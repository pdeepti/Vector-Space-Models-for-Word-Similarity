u.s. senator john kerry is on course to become george w. bush ’ s democratic challenger in the 2004 presidential election .
dw-world ’ s readers share their views on kerry ’ s chances to become the white house ’ s next occupant . i live in a particularly conservative city , but even here there is much disappointment with president bush .
ohio has lost many jobs to overseas locations , and mr bush is seen as a facilitator for allowing corporations to do this to american citizens in the pursuit of profits .
there is also a growing feeling that bush does n't know what he 's doing in iraq .
if kerry is selected as the democratic candidate , bush will have a very difficult time -lrb- especially if john edwards is kerry 's running mate -rrb- . - bob schindler , ohio . for germans who hate bush the thought that john kerry can win must be appealing but it is n't likely to happen .
contrary to you people , americans prefer low taxes and the economic prosperity that results from them .
also contrary to germans , most americans believe that the best defense is a good offense and favor current foreign policy .
we remember what happened in the late 30 's when chamberlain fooled around with hitler and the grave results that followed .
we may not be as educated , cultured and sophisticated as your people but we have far more common sense .
that 's why the united states is the greatest nation ever .
god bless america .
god help our enemies . - carl mahrenholz democrats lose elections because they wo n't compromise .
kerry already said he wo n't compromise on abortion , even revolting partial birth abortions done in the ninth month .
this will cost him many votes , especially in the southeast .
massachusetts became the first to legalize gay marriage .
this is a state matter .
the federal government has no jurisdiction .
consequently , kerry does n't need to say anything .
even so , he will most likely speak out in favor of it .
bush will coast to another 4 years .
i wish things were different . - peter laurence if senator kerry becomes the democrat ’ s presidential contender he will lose the election in november .
once his record is put under a microscope , people will see that this man is not what american want for our leader .
president bush has done well leading this country ’ s fight against terrorism .
our economy is one of the best in the world and getting stronger every day .
senator kerry is too liberal for most americans .
his anti-vietnam record will work against him in all the southern states .
burning the american flag in protest during the vietnam war will really hurt him . - marc johnson sr. it will be a very close race .
however , bush will probably win due to the fact that bush will carry most of the southern states and western states . - peter yoon yes , kerry can and will beat bush .
americans want to be told the truth and make up our own minds .

u.s. senator john kerry is on course to become george w. bush ’ s democratic challenger in the 2004 presidential election .
dw-world ’ s readers share their views on kerry ’ s chances to become the white house ’ s next occupant . i live in a particularly conservative city , but even here there is much disappointment with president bush .
ohio has lost many jobs to overseas locations , and mr bush is seen as a facilitator for allowing corporations to do this to american citizens in the pursuit of profits .
there is also a growing feeling that bush does n't know what he 's doing in iraq .
if kerry is selected as the democratic candidate , bush will have a very difficult time -lrb- especially if john edwards is kerry 's running mate -rrb- . - bob schindler , ohio . for germans who hate bush the thought that john kerry can win must be appealing but it is n't likely to happen .
contrary to you people , americans prefer low taxes and the economic prosperity that results from them .
also contrary to germans , most americans believe that the best defense is a good offense and favor current foreign policy .
we remember what happened in the late 30 's when chamberlain fooled around with hitler and the grave results that followed .
we may not be as educated , cultured and sophisticated as your people but we have far more common sense .
that 's why the united states is the greatest nation ever .
god bless america .
god help our enemies . - carl mahrenholz democrats lose elections because they wo n't compromise .
kerry already said he wo n't compromise on abortion , even revolting partial birth abortions done in the ninth month .
this will cost him many votes , especially in the southeast .
massachusetts became the first to legalize gay marriage .
this is a state matter .
the federal government has no jurisdiction .
consequently , kerry does n't need to say anything .
even so , he will most likely speak out in favor of it .
bush will coast to another 4 years .
i wish things were different . - peter laurence if senator kerry becomes the democrat ’ s presidential contender he will lose the election in november .
once his record is put under a microscope , people will see that this man is not what american want for our leader .
president bush has done well leading this country ’ s fight against terrorism .
our economy is one of the best in the world and getting stronger every day .
senator kerry is too liberal for most americans .
his anti-vietnam record will work against him in all the southern states .
burning the american flag in protest during the vietnam war will really hurt him . - marc johnson sr. it will be a very close race .
however , bush will probably win due to the fact that bush will carry most of the southern states and western states . - peter yoon yes , kerry can and will beat bush .
americans want to be told the truth and make up our own minds .
many feel we do n't get the truth from the present administration .
kerry can be a strong and protective leader and not bankrupt our country in doing so . - nick capece send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : can kerry beat bush ?
european papers on thursday focused on u.s. democratic presidential front-runner john kerry ’ s success on the campaign trail .
most warned kerry had his work cut out if he was to dislodge bush from the white house .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said he supported expanding peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , but remained cool to merging the nato deployment with the u.s. military campaign in the country . in consultations with new nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer in berlin , schröder said he backed letting the eurocorps – a joint military unit made up of soldiers from germany , france , belgium , luxembourg and spain – take over the transatlantic alliance ’ s isaf mission in afghanistan this summer . “ the defense ministers are currently examining whether , for example , the german-french brigade could play a role , and if so on what scale , ” schröder said at a joint press conference with de hoop scheffer in berlin on friday . isaf , which currently numbers around 6,000 of the predominately german and canadian soldiers , is limited to the afghan capital kabul and the northern city of kunduz .
it is nato ’ s first mission outside of the 19-member alliance ’ s traditional sphere of influence in europe and north america . after german troops last year expanded the peacekeeping operations to kunduz , other european nations are likely to commit military teams to five other provincial cities , hoping to help stabilize the country further ahead of afghan elections expected in june .
according to the associated press , italy and norway were considering deploying troops to run “ provincial reconstruction teams ” like the one in kunduz . “ we can not afford to lose in afghanistan because that would mean we lose the fight against terrorism and that we can not bring security and stability , ” de hoop scheffer said . eurocorps command in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps troops .
the eurocorps , founded in 1992 by germany and france to further military cooperation in the european union , would most likely take over isaf in august .
currently headquartered in strasbourg , it is unclear how many of its 50,000 troops would take part in an afghan mission . schröder appeared relieved that de hoop scheffer was opposed to merging isaf ’ s peacekeeping duties with the still substantial military mission led by u.s. forces in afghanistan .
he said , however , the nato allies needed to look for “ synergies ” and remain “ pragmatic ” on the matter . after meeting with schröder , de hoop scheffer continued to munich to an annual security conference .
besides discussing afghanistan , nato defense ministers are also expected to discuss what if any role the alliance may undertake in stabilizing iraq .
however , the nato chief cautioned it was too early for any decisions on a military role in the country . the united states would like nato to take more responsibility in a multinational sector now led by alliance member poland .
but for europeans countries opposed to the u.s.-led war in iraq – such as germany and france – washington will most likely first have to relinquish power in baghdad to an iraqi administration . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from america and europe on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld and german foreign minister joschka fischer famously clashed at the event , but relations between washington and berlin have since largely normalized . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato defense chiefs return to munich nato defense chiefs will meet in munich this weekend to discuss the alliance 's role in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said he supported expanding peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , but remained cool to merging the nato deployment with the u.s. military campaign in the country . in consultations with new nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer in berlin , schröder said he backed letting the eurocorps – a joint military unit made up of soldiers from germany , france , belgium , luxembourg and spain – take over the transatlantic alliance ’ s isaf mission in afghanistan this summer . “ the defense ministers are currently examining whether , for example , the german-french brigade could play a role , and if so on what scale , ” schröder said at a joint press conference with de hoop scheffer in berlin on friday . isaf , which currently numbers around 6,000 of the predominately german and canadian soldiers , is limited to the afghan capital kabul and the northern city of kunduz .
it is nato ’ s first mission outside of the 19-member alliance ’ s traditional sphere of influence in europe and north america . after german troops last year expanded the peacekeeping operations to kunduz , other european nations are likely to commit military teams to five other provincial cities , hoping to help stabilize the country further ahead of afghan elections expected in june .
according to the associated press , italy and norway were considering deploying troops to run “ provincial reconstruction teams ” like the one in kunduz . “ we can not afford to lose in afghanistan because that would mean we lose the fight against terrorism and that we can not bring security and stability , ” de hoop scheffer said . eurocorps command in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps troops .
the eurocorps , founded in 1992 by germany and france to further military cooperation in the european union , would most likely take over isaf in august .
currently headquartered in strasbourg , it is unclear how many of its 50,000 troops would take part in an afghan mission . schröder appeared relieved that de hoop scheffer was opposed to merging isaf ’ s peacekeeping duties with the still substantial military mission led by u.s. forces in afghanistan .
he said , however , the nato allies needed to look for “ synergies ” and remain “ pragmatic ” on the matter . after meeting with schröder , de hoop scheffer continued to munich to an annual security conference .
besides discussing afghanistan , nato defense ministers are also expected to discuss what if any role the alliance may undertake in stabilizing iraq .
however , the nato chief cautioned it was too early for any decisions on a military role in the country . the united states would like nato to take more responsibility in a multinational sector now led by alliance member poland .
but for europeans countries opposed to the u.s.-led war in iraq – such as germany and france – washington will most likely first have to relinquish power in baghdad to an iraqi administration . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from america and europe on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .

11 terror suspect acquitted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's a free man now .
a hamburg court on thursday acquitted a moroccan charged with helping to prepare the sept .
11 attacks .
german officials have already said they plan to deport abdelghani mzoudi to his home country . for now , mzoudi is a free man and will receive financial compensation for the time spent in jail .
“ this is the day of a justice system , which refuses to be used blindly to combat terrorism , ” mzoudi ’ s defense lawer , michael rosenthal , said after the verdict . but germany ’ s prosecutor-general said thursday that he planned to appeal the verdict to the federal court of justice . “ we ’ re hoping for a second round in the mzoudi case , ” kay nehm said , adding that he expected the verdict to serve as a wake-up call to u.s. authorities , who have so far been reluctant to release information and witness testimony the prosecution considered crucial to prove their case . in case of an appeal , mzoudi is likely to remain in germany for a while , but hamburg ’ s top security official said he wants him deported as soon as possible .
mzoudi has been trying to avoid deportation , fearing that moroccan officials might extradite him to the u.s. “ there is no case more pressing than mzoudi ’ s , ” dirk nockemann , the city state ’ s interior minister , told ap news service after the verdict .
“ the man is dangerous . ” nockemann said that officials will make a decision within a few days , adding that police would monitor the 31-year-old . defense lawyer gül pinar said she didn ’ t expect nockemann to succeed with the deportation plan .
“ mr. mzoudi will be here longer than mr. nockemann will stay in office , ” pinar said .
nockemann , a member of a populist right-wing party , is likely to lose his job after hamburg elects a new parliament on feb .
29 . acquittal for want of evidence mzoudi had been accused of abetting murder in more than 3,000 cases and belonging to terrorist organization al qaeda , but judges ruled that there was not enough evidence to confirm this . “ mr. mzoudi , you are acquitted , but this is no reason to celebrate , ” presiding judge klaus rühle said to mzoudi , who showed no emotions as the verdict was announced .
he added that the acquittal was not a sign that the court had been convinced of mzoudi ’ s innocence , but rather the prosecution ’ s failure to prove their case . in december , the court had already freed him from jail , however , after an anonymous witness had apparently exonerated him .
that witness is believed to be ramzi binalshibh , who allegedly organized the attacks and is now in u.s. custody . last-minute attempt to delay sentencing fails saying that not enough information about the witness ’ s testimony had been revealed , lawyers of relatives of sept .
11 victims had tried to delay sentencing on thursday , but the judges rejected this .
the relatives are allowed to appear as co-plaintiffs in andreas schulz , one of the lawyers , had asked the court to seek more information from the u.s. authorities , saying that they were now willing to share more information .
previous attempts to receive documents from washington had failed , however . ramifications for appeal in motassadeq trial ? thursday ’ s verdict could have ramifications for the appeal of the first ever verdict related to the sept .
11 attacks .
last february , the same hamburg court had sentenced mounir el motassadeq to 15 years in prison for his role in plotting the attacks . germany 's federal court of justice is currently considering the appeal and is expected to decide whether to let it proceed on march 4 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the only verdict possible the roller-coaster course of the five-month trial against abdelghani mzoudi left judges no choice but to acquit him , deutsche welle 's peter phillip writes in a commentary on thursday 's verdict .

11 terror suspect acquitted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's a free man now .
a hamburg court on thursday acquitted a moroccan charged with helping to prepare the sept .
11 attacks .
german officials have already said they plan to deport abdelghani mzoudi to his home country . for now , mzoudi is a free man and will receive financial compensation for the time spent in jail .
“ this is the day of a justice system , which refuses to be used blindly to combat terrorism , ” mzoudi ’ s defense lawer , michael rosenthal , said after the verdict . but germany ’ s prosecutor-general said thursday that he planned to appeal the verdict to the federal court of justice . “ we ’ re hoping for a second round in the mzoudi case , ” kay nehm said , adding that he expected the verdict to serve as a wake-up call to u.s. authorities , who have so far been reluctant to release information and witness testimony the prosecution considered crucial to prove their case . in case of an appeal , mzoudi is likely to remain in germany for a while , but hamburg ’ s top security official said he wants him deported as soon as possible .
mzoudi has been trying to avoid deportation , fearing that moroccan officials might extradite him to the u.s. “ there is no case more pressing than mzoudi ’ s , ” dirk nockemann , the city state ’ s interior minister , told ap news service after the verdict .
“ the man is dangerous . ” nockemann said that officials will make a decision within a few days , adding that police would monitor the 31-year-old . defense lawyer gül pinar said she didn ’ t expect nockemann to succeed with the deportation plan .
“ mr. mzoudi will be here longer than mr. nockemann will stay in office , ” pinar said .
nockemann , a member of a populist right-wing party , is likely to lose his job after hamburg elects a new parliament on feb .
29 . acquittal for want of evidence mzoudi had been accused of abetting murder in more than 3,000 cases and belonging to terrorist organization al qaeda , but judges ruled that there was not enough evidence to confirm this . “ mr. mzoudi , you are acquitted , but this is no reason to celebrate , ” presiding judge klaus rühle said to mzoudi , who showed no emotions as the verdict was announced .
he added that the acquittal was not a sign that the court had been convinced of mzoudi ’ s innocence , but rather the prosecution ’ s failure to prove their case . in december , the court had already freed him from jail , however , after an anonymous witness had apparently exonerated him .

besides , his likely successor could help build party support for schröder 's equally unloved reforms . franz müntefering is supposed to mend things : the leader of the social democrats ’ -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group will now likely be elected party chief of germany ’ s largest governing party after chancellor gerhard schröder threw in the towel friday .
the move comes barely five years after he took the party ’ s top job as an almost natural step after his predecessor , oscar lafontaine , resigned .
schröder didn ’ t want to do it , but who else , besides the chancellor , should have taken the position ?
today , the answer is franz müntefering .
and this time around , it ’ s perhaps less an inevitable decision than the logical consequence of a party that ’ s been plagued with diminishing membership and election losses .
there ’ s never been an emotional connection between schröder and the spd party base .
that ’ s underscored by the fact that the chancellor ’ s reform policies have come up against clear resentment among the party ’ s core .
criticism can often be heard that social equality has fallen to the wayside .
in that regard , müntefering as party chief won ’ t change anything either .
however , it could slightly change the mediation problems the chancellor has identified .
proverbially loyal parliamentary group leader müntefering has , without a doubt , greater chances of influencing the party .
the spd base doesn ’ t just listen to müntefering out of duty , but sympathy as well .
that could actually lead to the ideal type of division of labor the chancellor desires in his reform process .
müntefering would lobby for acceptance of change within the party while schröder devises plans for reforms .
at the same time , politics isn ’ t something easily drafted on the drawing board .
müntefering can be as loyal to the chancellor as he wants , as party leader he will have new and stronger authority – not least vis-à-vis the chancellor .
but there are also expectations tied to that , because for the party base , just having a new face at the top isn ’ t enough in the long term .
the grumblers in the party base , especially , will also expect him to influence government policy .
and that , one would expect , would be uncomfortable for schröder .
with müntefering as parliamentary group leader and national party chief , the party now has a second heavyweight next to the chancellor . it ’ s also still an open question how much the move will impact the public , who , if you believe the polls , are increasingly turning away from the spd .
that ’ s an effect of the reform policies – policies , which should not be stopped , according to gerhard schröder .
taking this under consideration , a new party chairman alone will have little ability to change anything .
nor will it lead to better results for the spd during upcoming elections for european parliament and in a number of german states .
but müntefering could have a motivating effect on the classic social democratic constituency – only that still won ’ t be enough to create an election success for the spd .
by resigning from his post as spd leader , schröder is taking leave of an unloved office .
it really should n't be difficult for him , but he ’ s nonetheless viewed the division of the chancellery and the party chairmanship as problematic in the past .
with schröder loyalist müntefering in the position , it could function , but gerhard schröder shouldn ’ t be too sure of it , either . heinz dylong -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder to step down as party leader giving in to calls from his party member to focus more on his duties as german chancellor , gerhard schröder on friday announced he will step down as leader of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .

the move comes barely five years after he took the party ’ s top job as an almost natural step after his predecessor , oscar lafontaine , resigned .
schröder didn ’ t want to do it , but who else , besides the chancellor , should have taken the position ?
today , the answer is franz müntefering .
and this time around , it ’ s perhaps less an inevitable decision than the logical consequence of a party that ’ s been plagued with diminishing membership and election losses .
there ’ s never been an emotional connection between schröder and the spd party base .
that ’ s underscored by the fact that the chancellor ’ s reform policies have come up against clear resentment among the party ’ s core .
criticism can often be heard that social equality has fallen to the wayside .
in that regard , müntefering as party chief won ’ t change anything either .
however , it could slightly change the mediation problems the chancellor has identified .
proverbially loyal parliamentary group leader müntefering has , without a doubt , greater chances of influencing the party .
the spd base doesn ’ t just listen to müntefering out of duty , but sympathy as well .
that could actually lead to the ideal type of division of labor the chancellor desires in his reform process .
müntefering would lobby for acceptance of change within the party while schröder devises plans for reforms .
at the same time , politics isn ’ t something easily drafted on the drawing board .
müntefering can be as loyal to the chancellor as he wants , as party leader he will have new and stronger authority – not least vis-à-vis the chancellor .
but there are also expectations tied to that , because for the party base , just having a new face at the top isn ’ t enough in the long term .
the grumblers in the party base , especially , will also expect him to influence government policy .
and that , one would expect , would be uncomfortable for schröder .
with müntefering as parliamentary group leader and national party chief , the party now has a second heavyweight next to the chancellor . it ’ s also still an open question how much the move will impact the public , who , if you believe the polls , are increasingly turning away from the spd .
that ’ s an effect of the reform policies – policies , which should not be stopped , according to gerhard schröder .
taking this under consideration , a new party chairman alone will have little ability to change anything .
nor will it lead to better results for the spd during upcoming elections for european parliament and in a number of german states .
but müntefering could have a motivating effect on the classic social democratic constituency – only that still won ’ t be enough to create an election success for the spd .
by resigning from his post as spd leader , schröder is taking leave of an unloved office .
it really should n't be difficult for him , but he ’ s nonetheless viewed the division of the chancellery and the party chairmanship as problematic in the past .

a hamburg court on thursday acquitted a moroccan charged with helping to prepare the sept .

german officials have already said they plan to deport abdelghani mzoudi to his home country . for now , mzoudi is a free man and will receive financial compensation for the time spent in jail .
“ this is the day of a justice system , which refuses to be used blindly to combat terrorism , ” mzoudi ’ s defense lawer , michael rosenthal , said after the verdict . but germany ’ s prosecutor-general said thursday that he planned to appeal the verdict to the federal court of justice . “ we ’ re hoping for a second round in the mzoudi case , ” kay nehm said , adding that he expected the verdict to serve as a wake-up call to u.s. authorities , who have so far been reluctant to release information and witness testimony the prosecution considered crucial to prove their case . in case of an appeal , mzoudi is likely to remain in germany for a while , but hamburg ’ s top security official said he wants him deported as soon as possible .
mzoudi has been trying to avoid deportation , fearing that moroccan officials might extradite him to the u.s. “ there is no case more pressing than mzoudi ’ s , ” dirk nockemann , the city state ’ s interior minister , told ap news service after the verdict .
“ the man is dangerous . ” nockemann said that officials will make a decision within a few days , adding that police would monitor the 31-year-old . defense lawyer gül pinar said she didn ’ t expect nockemann to succeed with the deportation plan .
“ mr. mzoudi will be here longer than mr. nockemann will stay in office , ” pinar said .
nockemann , a member of a populist right-wing party , is likely to lose his job after hamburg elects a new parliament on feb .
29 . acquittal for want of evidence mzoudi had been accused of abetting murder in more than 3,000 cases and belonging to terrorist organization al qaeda , but judges ruled that there was not enough evidence to confirm this . “ mr. mzoudi , you are acquitted , but this is no reason to celebrate , ” presiding judge klaus rühle said to mzoudi , who showed no emotions as the verdict was announced .
he added that the acquittal was not a sign that the court had been convinced of mzoudi ’ s innocence , but rather the prosecution ’ s failure to prove their case . in december , the court had already freed him from jail , however , after an anonymous witness had apparently exonerated him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.02.2004 eu to open trade talks with africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would like to see african trade benefit from economic partnerships within the continent .
the eu will launch trade talks with 16 eastern and southern african countries in mauritius this weekend .
the aim is to allow freer access to eu markets and to spur regional trade accords among african nations . the european union kicks off a second round of trade talks with 16 eastern and southern african countries on saturday .
the talks , which will gradually involve all members of the 79-nation africa , caribbean and pacific group -lrb- acp -rrb- , are intended to seal economic and partnership agreements -lrb- epa -rrb- with the african nations .
the negotiations follow a trade round already launched with nations in west and central africa in october .
epas are based on the cotonou agreement signed in benin in 2000 giving the 79 members of the acp group a special trade status within the eu .
while the eu says that under the agreement it will be prepared to further open its markets to acp products and loosen other trade barriers , acp states have indicated they will implement trade-friendly policies .
african development a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for trade pascal lamy gestures while answering reporters ' questions in the press conference at a hotel in tokyo , friday , feb .
16 , 2001 .
lamy arrived in tokyo thursday from seoul for a four-day visit to meet japanese leaders .
lamy met earlier today with japan 's economy , trade , and industry minister takeo hiranuma to reaffirm eu / japan globarization talks to be materialized .
-lrb- ap photo / junji kurokawa -rrb- " the epa negotiations with eastern and southern africa will follow a hands-on approach : development is the objective , trade one of the tools , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said on the eve of the trip .
eu development commissioner poul nielson also welcomed what he called the african nations ’ " important " decision to kickstart epa negotiations with the 15-nation eu bloc .
" deepening regional integration , breaking down barriers to neighbors and creating larger markets are crucial steps if these countries are to stimulate their necessary investments and productivity improvements that will drive their development , " he said .
the 16 countries slated to hold talks with the eu over the weekend are burundi , comores , djibouti , democratic republic of congo , eritrea , ethiopia , kenya , madagascar , malawi , mauritius , rwanda , seychelles , sudan , uganda , zambia and zimbabwe .
the countries , with a total population of 280 million , are all members of the acp , which includes some of the world 's poorest nations .
they form part of the common market for eastern and southern africa -lrb- comesa -rrb- .
the eu commission has underlined that the eu has already earmarked more than € 700 million -lrb- $ 880.6 million -rrb- for supporting trade-related activities and regional integration in the eastern and southern african countries .
helping africa help itself eu negotiators are emphasizing that in addition to allowing goods from developing countries almost free access to european markets , it is vital to strengthen regional integration among individual african countries .
in other words , the eu would like to help african nations help themselves .
martin dihm of the eu commission ’ s directorate-general for trade said in a press conference on thursday it was urgent that regional trade partnerships were formed before trade cooperations between africa and the eu could be hammered out .
" the most important topic is regional cooperation .
that ’ s our key phrase for further development perspectives , " he said .
" we believe that regional integration can reinforce the credibility of structures and good governance and thus become attractive for investors , " dihm added .
" and that ’ s what counts if you want to achieve development and economic growth . "
talks hoped to boost stalled wto debate the regional trade accords among the african nations are expected to be signed and sealed by 2008 .
negotiators are hoping that by then an african free trade zone between the regions will also have been established .

after general elections in 2002 , he took on the position of parliamentary group leader .
a supporter of schröder 's reforms , he said he will stay the course .
" i 'd like to do my part , " said müntefering on friday .
" we have to undertake certain measures now even if not everyone agrees with them . "
as a result of the leadership change , the spd 's current secretary-general , olaf scholz , announced he will step down as well .
müntefering said he already had chosen a replacement , but did n't want to reveal the name until a meeting of the party 's leadership on saturday .
no plans to replace ministers the chancellor did not reveal any plans to reshuffle his cabinet . several party leaders had asked him to do , saying that some ministers seemed to be worn out .

the doha round was meant to lower commercial barriers around the world from agriculture to the service industry .

besides , his likely successor could help build party support for schröder 's equally unloved reforms . franz müntefering is supposed to mend things : the leader of the social democrats ’ -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group will now likely be elected party chief of germany ’ s largest governing party after chancellor gerhard schröder threw in the towel friday .
the move comes barely five years after he took the party ’ s top job as an almost natural step after his predecessor , oscar lafontaine , resigned .
schröder didn ’ t want to do it , but who else , besides the chancellor , should have taken the position ?
today , the answer is franz müntefering .
and this time around , it ’ s perhaps less an inevitable decision than the logical consequence of a party that ’ s been plagued with diminishing membership and election losses .
there ’ s never been an emotional connection between schröder and the spd party base .
that ’ s underscored by the fact that the chancellor ’ s reform policies have come up against clear resentment among the party ’ s core .
criticism can often be heard that social equality has fallen to the wayside .
in that regard , müntefering as party chief won ’ t change anything either .
however , it could slightly change the mediation problems the chancellor has identified .
proverbially loyal parliamentary group leader müntefering has , without a doubt , greater chances of influencing the party .
the spd base doesn ’ t just listen to müntefering out of duty , but sympathy as well .
that could actually lead to the ideal type of division of labor the chancellor desires in his reform process .
müntefering would lobby for acceptance of change within the party while schröder devises plans for reforms .
at the same time , politics isn ’ t something easily drafted on the drawing board .
müntefering can be as loyal to the chancellor as he wants , as party leader he will have new and stronger authority – not least vis-à-vis the chancellor .
but there are also expectations tied to that , because for the party base , just having a new face at the top isn ’ t enough in the long term .
the grumblers in the party base , especially , will also expect him to influence government policy .
and that , one would expect , would be uncomfortable for schröder .
with müntefering as parliamentary group leader and national party chief , the party now has a second heavyweight next to the chancellor . it ’ s also still an open question how much the move will impact the public , who , if you believe the polls , are increasingly turning away from the spd .
that ’ s an effect of the reform policies – policies , which should not be stopped , according to gerhard schröder .
taking this under consideration , a new party chairman alone will have little ability to change anything .
nor will it lead to better results for the spd during upcoming elections for european parliament and in a number of german states .
but müntefering could have a motivating effect on the classic social democratic constituency – only that still won ’ t be enough to create an election success for the spd .
by resigning from his post as spd leader , schröder is taking leave of an unloved office .
it really should n't be difficult for him , but he ’ s nonetheless viewed the division of the chancellery and the party chairmanship as problematic in the past .
with schröder loyalist müntefering in the position , it could function , but gerhard schröder shouldn ’ t be too sure of it , either . heinz dylong -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder to step down as party leader giving in to calls from his party member to focus more on his duties as german chancellor , gerhard schröder on friday announced he will step down as leader of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .

" you can imagine that i 'm not happy to relinquish this office , but it 's in the interest of the reform process . " several leading spd politicians had called on schröder to do just this .
party members also had critized schröder for being out of touch with ordinary party members . opposition calls move " beginning of the end " opposition leaders described the decision as a " bad day for germany , " saying that schröder 's step down as party leader would soon be followed by his departure as chancellor . " this is the beginning of the end , " said angela merkel , leader of the christian democratic union .
" he 's now chancellor by grace of müntefering .
how can he expect to lead a country if he can not even lead the members of his own party ? " guido westerwelle , the leader of the neo-liberal free democrats , called on schröder to " end the government 's lingering illness " and hold new elections . schröder hopes move will silence critics the chancellor , however , hopes the move will silence his party critics who oppose his course of painful welfare and economic reforms .
after implementing parts of schröder 's so-called " agenda 2010 " package of reforms , the spd has suffered a string of election defeats .
the party continues to wallow near all-time lows in opinion polls . after his election as chancellor in oct .

lafontaine also stepped down as minister of finance at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering will now head the spd .

after general elections in 2002 , he took on the position of parliamentary group leader .
a supporter of schröder 's reforms , he said he will stay the course .
" i 'd like to do my part , " said müntefering on friday .
" we have to undertake certain measures now even if not everyone agrees with them . "
as a result of the leadership change , the spd 's current secretary-general , olaf scholz , announced he will step down as well .
müntefering said he already had chosen a replacement , but did n't want to reveal the name until a meeting of the party 's leadership on saturday .
no plans to replace ministers the chancellor did not reveal any plans to reshuffle his cabinet . several party leaders had asked him to do , saying that some ministers seemed to be worn out .

he added that the acquittal was not a sign that the court had been convinced of mzoudi ’ s innocence , but rather the prosecution ’ s failure to prove their case . in december , the court had already freed him from jail , however , after an anonymous witness had apparently exonerated him .

11 terror suspect acquitted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's a free man now .
a hamburg court on thursday acquitted a moroccan charged with helping to prepare the sept .
11 attacks .
german officials have already said they plan to deport abdelghani mzoudi to his home country . for now , mzoudi is a free man and will receive financial compensation for the time spent in jail .
“ this is the day of a justice system , which refuses to be used blindly to combat terrorism , ” mzoudi ’ s defense lawer , michael rosenthal , said after the verdict . but germany ’ s prosecutor-general said thursday that he planned to appeal the verdict to the federal court of justice . “ we ’ re hoping for a second round in the mzoudi case , ” kay nehm said , adding that he expected the verdict to serve as a wake-up call to u.s. authorities , who have so far been reluctant to release information and witness testimony the prosecution considered crucial to prove their case . in case of an appeal , mzoudi is likely to remain in germany for a while , but hamburg ’ s top security official said he wants him deported as soon as possible .
mzoudi has been trying to avoid deportation , fearing that moroccan officials might extradite him to the u.s. “ there is no case more pressing than mzoudi ’ s , ” dirk nockemann , the city state ’ s interior minister , told ap news service after the verdict .
“ the man is dangerous . ” nockemann said that officials will make a decision within a few days , adding that police would monitor the 31-year-old . defense lawyer gül pinar said she didn ’ t expect nockemann to succeed with the deportation plan .
“ mr. mzoudi will be here longer than mr. nockemann will stay in office , ” pinar said .
nockemann , a member of a populist right-wing party , is likely to lose his job after hamburg elects a new parliament on feb .
29 . acquittal for want of evidence mzoudi had been accused of abetting murder in more than 3,000 cases and belonging to terrorist organization al qaeda , but judges ruled that there was not enough evidence to confirm this . “ mr. mzoudi , you are acquitted , but this is no reason to celebrate , ” presiding judge klaus rühle said to mzoudi , who showed no emotions as the verdict was announced .
he added that the acquittal was not a sign that the court had been convinced of mzoudi ’ s innocence , but rather the prosecution ’ s failure to prove their case . in december , the court had already freed him from jail , however , after an anonymous witness had apparently exonerated him .
that witness is believed to be ramzi binalshibh , who allegedly organized the attacks and is now in u.s. custody . last-minute attempt to delay sentencing fails saying that not enough information about the witness ’ s testimony had been revealed , lawyers of relatives of sept .
11 victims had tried to delay sentencing on thursday , but the judges rejected this .
the relatives are allowed to appear as co-plaintiffs in andreas schulz , one of the lawyers , had asked the court to seek more information from the u.s. authorities , saying that they were now willing to share more information .
previous attempts to receive documents from washington had failed , however . ramifications for appeal in motassadeq trial ? thursday ’ s verdict could have ramifications for the appeal of the first ever verdict related to the sept .
11 attacks .
last february , the same hamburg court had sentenced mounir el motassadeq to 15 years in prison for his role in plotting the attacks . germany 's federal court of justice is currently considering the appeal and is expected to decide whether to let it proceed on march 4 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the only verdict possible the roller-coaster course of the five-month trial against abdelghani mzoudi left judges no choice but to acquit him , deutsche welle 's peter phillip writes in a commentary on thursday 's verdict .

the eu will launch trade talks with 16 eastern and southern african countries in mauritius this weekend .
the aim is to allow freer access to eu markets and to spur regional trade accords among african nations . the european union kicks off a second round of trade talks with 16 eastern and southern african countries on saturday .
the talks , which will gradually involve all members of the 79-nation africa , caribbean and pacific group -lrb- acp -rrb- , are intended to seal economic and partnership agreements -lrb- epa -rrb- with the african nations .
the negotiations follow a trade round already launched with nations in west and central africa in october .
epas are based on the cotonou agreement signed in benin in 2000 giving the 79 members of the acp group a special trade status within the eu .
while the eu says that under the agreement it will be prepared to further open its markets to acp products and loosen other trade barriers , acp states have indicated they will implement trade-friendly policies .

lamy arrived in tokyo thursday from seoul for a four-day visit to meet japanese leaders .
lamy met earlier today with japan 's economy , trade , and industry minister takeo hiranuma to reaffirm eu / japan globarization talks to be materialized .
-lrb- ap photo / junji kurokawa -rrb- " the epa negotiations with eastern and southern africa will follow a hands-on approach : development is the objective , trade one of the tools , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said on the eve of the trip .
eu development commissioner poul nielson also welcomed what he called the african nations ’ " important " decision to kickstart epa negotiations with the 15-nation eu bloc .
" deepening regional integration , breaking down barriers to neighbors and creating larger markets are crucial steps if these countries are to stimulate their necessary investments and productivity improvements that will drive their development , " he said .
the 16 countries slated to hold talks with the eu over the weekend are burundi , comores , djibouti , democratic republic of congo , eritrea , ethiopia , kenya , madagascar , malawi , mauritius , rwanda , seychelles , sudan , uganda , zambia and zimbabwe .
the countries , with a total population of 280 million , are all members of the acp , which includes some of the world 's poorest nations .
they form part of the common market for eastern and southern africa -lrb- comesa -rrb- .
the eu commission has underlined that the eu has already earmarked more than € 700 million -lrb- $ 880.6 million -rrb- for supporting trade-related activities and regional integration in the eastern and southern african countries .
helping africa help itself eu negotiators are emphasizing that in addition to allowing goods from developing countries almost free access to european markets , it is vital to strengthen regional integration among individual african countries .
in other words , the eu would like to help african nations help themselves .
martin dihm of the eu commission ’ s directorate-general for trade said in a press conference on thursday it was urgent that regional trade partnerships were formed before trade cooperations between africa and the eu could be hammered out .
" the most important topic is regional cooperation .
that ’ s our key phrase for further development perspectives , " he said .
" we believe that regional integration can reinforce the credibility of structures and good governance and thus become attractive for investors , " dihm added .
" and that ’ s what counts if you want to achieve development and economic growth . "
talks hoped to boost stalled wto debate the regional trade accords among the african nations are expected to be signed and sealed by 2008 .
negotiators are hoping that by then an african free trade zone between the regions will also have been established .
today trade between african states is burdened by heavy tariffs , which tend to be much higher than those involved in trade with the rest of the world .
the eu also hopes that the epas will get the doha development round -lrb- launched in 2001 in doha , qatar -rrb- back on track .
the doha round was meant to lower commercial barriers around the world from agriculture to the service industry .
talks in cancun , mexico , broke down last september mainly over farm subsidies in rich countries and on new issues such as trade and competition policy and transparency in government procurement that the eu wanted to include in the negotiations .
" epas are highly complimentary and supportive of the doha development round as they involve the same issues for the same countries , " dihm said .
" by strengthening their capacity within the epas , developing countries can also strengthen their capacity in geneva and the world trade organization , " he added .
" the first step of getting trade back on track is the development between the north-north relationships and south-south .
the second step is integration between them and us . "
eu trade commissioner pascal lamy stressed that the success of the negotiations would benefit both sides .
" if at the end of these negotiations eastern and southern africa stands as a stronger region , able to define its common interest and improve jointly the environment for business and investors , we will all have won , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder encourages more self-help for africa wrapping up his six-day tour of africa on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder inaugurated a peacekeeping training center in ghana , saying it will serve as a model for other countries .

german officials have already said they plan to deport abdelghani mzoudi to his home country . for now , mzoudi is a free man and will receive financial compensation for the time spent in jail .
“ this is the day of a justice system , which refuses to be used blindly to combat terrorism , ” mzoudi ’ s defense lawer , michael rosenthal , said after the verdict . but germany ’ s prosecutor-general said thursday that he planned to appeal the verdict to the federal court of justice . “ we ’ re hoping for a second round in the mzoudi case , ” kay nehm said , adding that he expected the verdict to serve as a wake-up call to u.s. authorities , who have so far been reluctant to release information and witness testimony the prosecution considered crucial to prove their case . in case of an appeal , mzoudi is likely to remain in germany for a while , but hamburg ’ s top security official said he wants him deported as soon as possible .
mzoudi has been trying to avoid deportation , fearing that moroccan officials might extradite him to the u.s. “ there is no case more pressing than mzoudi ’ s , ” dirk nockemann , the city state ’ s interior minister , told ap news service after the verdict .
“ the man is dangerous . ” nockemann said that officials will make a decision within a few days , adding that police would monitor the 31-year-old . defense lawyer gül pinar said she didn ’ t expect nockemann to succeed with the deportation plan .
“ mr. mzoudi will be here longer than mr. nockemann will stay in office , ” pinar said .
nockemann , a member of a populist right-wing party , is likely to lose his job after hamburg elects a new parliament on feb .

he added that the acquittal was not a sign that the court had been convinced of mzoudi ’ s innocence , but rather the prosecution ’ s failure to prove their case . in december , the court had already freed him from jail , however , after an anonymous witness had apparently exonerated him .

" he 's now chancellor by grace of müntefering .

" guido westerwelle , the leader of the neo-liberal free democrats , called on schröder to " end the government 's lingering illness " and hold new elections . schröder hopes move will silence critics the chancellor , however , hopes the move will silence his party critics who oppose his course of painful welfare and economic reforms .

a supporter of schröder 's reforms , he said he will stay the course .
" i 'd like to do my part , " said müntefering on friday .
" we have to undertake certain measures now even if not everyone agrees with them . "
as a result of the leadership change , the spd 's current secretary-general , olaf scholz , announced he will step down as well .
müntefering said he already had chosen a replacement , but did n't want to reveal the name until a meeting of the party 's leadership on saturday .
no plans to replace ministers the chancellor did not reveal any plans to reshuffle his cabinet . several party leaders had asked him to do , saying that some ministers seemed to be worn out .

the doha round was meant to lower commercial barriers around the world from agriculture to the service industry .

" epas are highly complimentary and supportive of the doha development round as they involve the same issues for the same countries , " dihm said .
" by strengthening their capacity within the epas , developing countries can also strengthen their capacity in geneva and the world trade organization , " he added .
" the first step of getting trade back on track is the development between the north-north relationships and south-south .
the second step is integration between them and us . "
eu trade commissioner pascal lamy stressed that the success of the negotiations would benefit both sides .
" if at the end of these negotiations eastern and southern africa stands as a stronger region , able to define its common interest and improve jointly the environment for business and investors , we will all have won , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder encourages more self-help for africa wrapping up his six-day tour of africa on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder inaugurated a peacekeeping training center in ghana , saying it will serve as a model for other countries .

besides , his likely successor could help build party support for schröder 's equally unloved reforms . franz müntefering is supposed to mend things : the leader of the social democrats ’ -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group will now likely be elected party chief of germany ’ s largest governing party after chancellor gerhard schröder threw in the towel friday .
the move comes barely five years after he took the party ’ s top job as an almost natural step after his predecessor , oscar lafontaine , resigned .
schröder didn ’ t want to do it , but who else , besides the chancellor , should have taken the position ?
today , the answer is franz müntefering .
and this time around , it ’ s perhaps less an inevitable decision than the logical consequence of a party that ’ s been plagued with diminishing membership and election losses .
there ’ s never been an emotional connection between schröder and the spd party base .
that ’ s underscored by the fact that the chancellor ’ s reform policies have come up against clear resentment among the party ’ s core .
criticism can often be heard that social equality has fallen to the wayside .
in that regard , müntefering as party chief won ’ t change anything either .
however , it could slightly change the mediation problems the chancellor has identified .
proverbially loyal parliamentary group leader müntefering has , without a doubt , greater chances of influencing the party .
the spd base doesn ’ t just listen to müntefering out of duty , but sympathy as well .
that could actually lead to the ideal type of division of labor the chancellor desires in his reform process .
müntefering would lobby for acceptance of change within the party while schröder devises plans for reforms .
at the same time , politics isn ’ t something easily drafted on the drawing board .
müntefering can be as loyal to the chancellor as he wants , as party leader he will have new and stronger authority – not least vis-à-vis the chancellor .
but there are also expectations tied to that , because for the party base , just having a new face at the top isn ’ t enough in the long term .
the grumblers in the party base , especially , will also expect him to influence government policy .
and that , one would expect , would be uncomfortable for schröder .
with müntefering as parliamentary group leader and national party chief , the party now has a second heavyweight next to the chancellor . it ’ s also still an open question how much the move will impact the public , who , if you believe the polls , are increasingly turning away from the spd .
that ’ s an effect of the reform policies – policies , which should not be stopped , according to gerhard schröder .
taking this under consideration , a new party chairman alone will have little ability to change anything .
nor will it lead to better results for the spd during upcoming elections for european parliament and in a number of german states .
but müntefering could have a motivating effect on the classic social democratic constituency – only that still won ’ t be enough to create an election success for the spd .
by resigning from his post as spd leader , schröder is taking leave of an unloved office .
it really should n't be difficult for him , but he ’ s nonetheless viewed the division of the chancellery and the party chairmanship as problematic in the past .
with schröder loyalist müntefering in the position , it could function , but gerhard schröder shouldn ’ t be too sure of it , either . heinz dylong -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder to step down as party leader giving in to calls from his party member to focus more on his duties as german chancellor , gerhard schröder on friday announced he will step down as leader of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said he supported expanding peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , but remained cool to merging the nato deployment with the u.s. military campaign in the country . in consultations with new nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer in berlin , schröder said he backed letting the eurocorps – a joint military unit made up of soldiers from germany , france , belgium , luxembourg and spain – take over the transatlantic alliance ’ s isaf mission in afghanistan this summer . “ the defense ministers are currently examining whether , for example , the german-french brigade could play a role , and if so on what scale , ” schröder said at a joint press conference with de hoop scheffer in berlin on friday . isaf , which currently numbers around 6,000 of the predominately german and canadian soldiers , is limited to the afghan capital kabul and the northern city of kunduz .
it is nato ’ s first mission outside of the 19-member alliance ’ s traditional sphere of influence in europe and north america . after german troops last year expanded the peacekeeping operations to kunduz , other european nations are likely to commit military teams to five other provincial cities , hoping to help stabilize the country further ahead of afghan elections expected in june .
according to the associated press , italy and norway were considering deploying troops to run “ provincial reconstruction teams ” like the one in kunduz . “ we can not afford to lose in afghanistan because that would mean we lose the fight against terrorism and that we can not bring security and stability , ” de hoop scheffer said . eurocorps command in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps troops .
the eurocorps , founded in 1992 by germany and france to further military cooperation in the european union , would most likely take over isaf in august .
currently headquartered in strasbourg , it is unclear how many of its 50,000 troops would take part in an afghan mission . schröder appeared relieved that de hoop scheffer was opposed to merging isaf ’ s peacekeeping duties with the still substantial military mission led by u.s. forces in afghanistan .
he said , however , the nato allies needed to look for “ synergies ” and remain “ pragmatic ” on the matter . after meeting with schröder , de hoop scheffer continued to munich to an annual security conference .
besides discussing afghanistan , nato defense ministers are also expected to discuss what if any role the alliance may undertake in stabilizing iraq .
however , the nato chief cautioned it was too early for any decisions on a military role in the country . the united states would like nato to take more responsibility in a multinational sector now led by alliance member poland .
but for europeans countries opposed to the u.s.-led war in iraq – such as germany and france – washington will most likely first have to relinquish power in baghdad to an iraqi administration . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from america and europe on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .

u.s. senator john kerry is on course to become george w. bush ’ s democratic challenger in the 2004 presidential election .
dw-world ’ s readers share their views on kerry ’ s chances to become the white house ’ s next occupant . i live in a particularly conservative city , but even here there is much disappointment with president bush .
ohio has lost many jobs to overseas locations , and mr bush is seen as a facilitator for allowing corporations to do this to american citizens in the pursuit of profits .
there is also a growing feeling that bush does n't know what he 's doing in iraq .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said he supported expanding peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , but remained cool to merging the nato deployment with the u.s. military campaign in the country . in consultations with new nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer in berlin , schröder said he backed letting the eurocorps – a joint military unit made up of soldiers from germany , france , belgium , luxembourg and spain – take over the transatlantic alliance ’ s isaf mission in afghanistan this summer . “ the defense ministers are currently examining whether , for example , the german-french brigade could play a role , and if so on what scale , ” schröder said at a joint press conference with de hoop scheffer in berlin on friday . isaf , which currently numbers around 6,000 of the predominately german and canadian soldiers , is limited to the afghan capital kabul and the northern city of kunduz .
it is nato ’ s first mission outside of the 19-member alliance ’ s traditional sphere of influence in europe and north america . after german troops last year expanded the peacekeeping operations to kunduz , other european nations are likely to commit military teams to five other provincial cities , hoping to help stabilize the country further ahead of afghan elections expected in june .
according to the associated press , italy and norway were considering deploying troops to run “ provincial reconstruction teams ” like the one in kunduz . “ we can not afford to lose in afghanistan because that would mean we lose the fight against terrorism and that we can not bring security and stability , ” de hoop scheffer said . eurocorps command in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps troops .
the eurocorps , founded in 1992 by germany and france to further military cooperation in the european union , would most likely take over isaf in august .
currently headquartered in strasbourg , it is unclear how many of its 50,000 troops would take part in an afghan mission . schröder appeared relieved that de hoop scheffer was opposed to merging isaf ’ s peacekeeping duties with the still substantial military mission led by u.s. forces in afghanistan .
he said , however , the nato allies needed to look for “ synergies ” and remain “ pragmatic ” on the matter . after meeting with schröder , de hoop scheffer continued to munich to an annual security conference .
besides discussing afghanistan , nato defense ministers are also expected to discuss what if any role the alliance may undertake in stabilizing iraq .
however , the nato chief cautioned it was too early for any decisions on a military role in the country . the united states would like nato to take more responsibility in a multinational sector now led by alliance member poland .
but for europeans countries opposed to the u.s.-led war in iraq – such as germany and france – washington will most likely first have to relinquish power in baghdad to an iraqi administration . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from america and europe on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .

u.s. senator john kerry is on course to become george w. bush ’ s democratic challenger in the 2004 presidential election .
dw-world ’ s readers share their views on kerry ’ s chances to become the white house ’ s next occupant . i live in a particularly conservative city , but even here there is much disappointment with president bush .
ohio has lost many jobs to overseas locations , and mr bush is seen as a facilitator for allowing corporations to do this to american citizens in the pursuit of profits .
there is also a growing feeling that bush does n't know what he 's doing in iraq .
if kerry is selected as the democratic candidate , bush will have a very difficult time -lrb- especially if john edwards is kerry 's running mate -rrb- . - bob schindler , ohio . for germans who hate bush the thought that john kerry can win must be appealing but it is n't likely to happen .
contrary to you people , americans prefer low taxes and the economic prosperity that results from them .
also contrary to germans , most americans believe that the best defense is a good offense and favor current foreign policy .
we remember what happened in the late 30 's when chamberlain fooled around with hitler and the grave results that followed .
we may not be as educated , cultured and sophisticated as your people but we have far more common sense .
that 's why the united states is the greatest nation ever .
god bless america .
god help our enemies . - carl mahrenholz democrats lose elections because they wo n't compromise .
kerry already said he wo n't compromise on abortion , even revolting partial birth abortions done in the ninth month .
this will cost him many votes , especially in the southeast .
massachusetts became the first to legalize gay marriage .
this is a state matter .
the federal government has no jurisdiction .
consequently , kerry does n't need to say anything .
even so , he will most likely speak out in favor of it .
bush will coast to another 4 years .
i wish things were different . - peter laurence if senator kerry becomes the democrat ’ s presidential contender he will lose the election in november .
once his record is put under a microscope , people will see that this man is not what american want for our leader .
president bush has done well leading this country ’ s fight against terrorism .
our economy is one of the best in the world and getting stronger every day .
senator kerry is too liberal for most americans .
his anti-vietnam record will work against him in all the southern states .
burning the american flag in protest during the vietnam war will really hurt him . - marc johnson sr. it will be a very close race .
however , bush will probably win due to the fact that bush will carry most of the southern states and western states . - peter yoon yes , kerry can and will beat bush .
americans want to be told the truth and make up our own minds .
many feel we do n't get the truth from the present administration .
kerry can be a strong and protective leader and not bankrupt our country in doing so . - nick capece send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : can kerry beat bush ?
european papers on thursday focused on u.s. democratic presidential front-runner john kerry ’ s success on the campaign trail .
most warned kerry had his work cut out if he was to dislodge bush from the white house .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said he supported expanding peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , but remained cool to merging the nato deployment with the u.s. military campaign in the country . in consultations with new nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer in berlin , schröder said he backed letting the eurocorps – a joint military unit made up of soldiers from germany , france , belgium , luxembourg and spain – take over the transatlantic alliance ’ s isaf mission in afghanistan this summer . “ the defense ministers are currently examining whether , for example , the german-french brigade could play a role , and if so on what scale , ” schröder said at a joint press conference with de hoop scheffer in berlin on friday . isaf , which currently numbers around 6,000 of the predominately german and canadian soldiers , is limited to the afghan capital kabul and the northern city of kunduz .
it is nato ’ s first mission outside of the 19-member alliance ’ s traditional sphere of influence in europe and north america . after german troops last year expanded the peacekeeping operations to kunduz , other european nations are likely to commit military teams to five other provincial cities , hoping to help stabilize the country further ahead of afghan elections expected in june .
according to the associated press , italy and norway were considering deploying troops to run “ provincial reconstruction teams ” like the one in kunduz . “ we can not afford to lose in afghanistan because that would mean we lose the fight against terrorism and that we can not bring security and stability , ” de hoop scheffer said . eurocorps command in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps troops .
the eurocorps , founded in 1992 by germany and france to further military cooperation in the european union , would most likely take over isaf in august .
currently headquartered in strasbourg , it is unclear how many of its 50,000 troops would take part in an afghan mission . schröder appeared relieved that de hoop scheffer was opposed to merging isaf ’ s peacekeeping duties with the still substantial military mission led by u.s. forces in afghanistan .
he said , however , the nato allies needed to look for “ synergies ” and remain “ pragmatic ” on the matter . after meeting with schröder , de hoop scheffer continued to munich to an annual security conference .
besides discussing afghanistan , nato defense ministers are also expected to discuss what if any role the alliance may undertake in stabilizing iraq .
however , the nato chief cautioned it was too early for any decisions on a military role in the country . the united states would like nato to take more responsibility in a multinational sector now led by alliance member poland .
but for europeans countries opposed to the u.s.-led war in iraq – such as germany and france – washington will most likely first have to relinquish power in baghdad to an iraqi administration . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from america and europe on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .

11 terror suspect acquitted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's a free man now .
a hamburg court on thursday acquitted a moroccan charged with helping to prepare the sept .
11 attacks .
german officials have already said they plan to deport abdelghani mzoudi to his home country . for now , mzoudi is a free man and will receive financial compensation for the time spent in jail .
“ this is the day of a justice system , which refuses to be used blindly to combat terrorism , ” mzoudi ’ s defense lawer , michael rosenthal , said after the verdict . but germany ’ s prosecutor-general said thursday that he planned to appeal the verdict to the federal court of justice . “ we ’ re hoping for a second round in the mzoudi case , ” kay nehm said , adding that he expected the verdict to serve as a wake-up call to u.s. authorities , who have so far been reluctant to release information and witness testimony the prosecution considered crucial to prove their case . in case of an appeal , mzoudi is likely to remain in germany for a while , but hamburg ’ s top security official said he wants him deported as soon as possible .
mzoudi has been trying to avoid deportation , fearing that moroccan officials might extradite him to the u.s. “ there is no case more pressing than mzoudi ’ s , ” dirk nockemann , the city state ’ s interior minister , told ap news service after the verdict .
“ the man is dangerous . ” nockemann said that officials will make a decision within a few days , adding that police would monitor the 31-year-old . defense lawyer gül pinar said she didn ’ t expect nockemann to succeed with the deportation plan .
“ mr. mzoudi will be here longer than mr. nockemann will stay in office , ” pinar said .
nockemann , a member of a populist right-wing party , is likely to lose his job after hamburg elects a new parliament on feb .
29 . acquittal for want of evidence mzoudi had been accused of abetting murder in more than 3,000 cases and belonging to terrorist organization al qaeda , but judges ruled that there was not enough evidence to confirm this . “ mr. mzoudi , you are acquitted , but this is no reason to celebrate , ” presiding judge klaus rühle said to mzoudi , who showed no emotions as the verdict was announced .
he added that the acquittal was not a sign that the court had been convinced of mzoudi ’ s innocence , but rather the prosecution ’ s failure to prove their case . in december , the court had already freed him from jail , however , after an anonymous witness had apparently exonerated him .

11 terror suspect acquitted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's a free man now .
a hamburg court on thursday acquitted a moroccan charged with helping to prepare the sept .
11 attacks .
german officials have already said they plan to deport abdelghani mzoudi to his home country . for now , mzoudi is a free man and will receive financial compensation for the time spent in jail .
“ this is the day of a justice system , which refuses to be used blindly to combat terrorism , ” mzoudi ’ s defense lawer , michael rosenthal , said after the verdict . but germany ’ s prosecutor-general said thursday that he planned to appeal the verdict to the federal court of justice . “ we ’ re hoping for a second round in the mzoudi case , ” kay nehm said , adding that he expected the verdict to serve as a wake-up call to u.s. authorities , who have so far been reluctant to release information and witness testimony the prosecution considered crucial to prove their case . in case of an appeal , mzoudi is likely to remain in germany for a while , but hamburg ’ s top security official said he wants him deported as soon as possible .
mzoudi has been trying to avoid deportation , fearing that moroccan officials might extradite him to the u.s. “ there is no case more pressing than mzoudi ’ s , ” dirk nockemann , the city state ’ s interior minister , told ap news service after the verdict .
“ the man is dangerous . ” nockemann said that officials will make a decision within a few days , adding that police would monitor the 31-year-old . defense lawyer gül pinar said she didn ’ t expect nockemann to succeed with the deportation plan .
“ mr. mzoudi will be here longer than mr. nockemann will stay in office , ” pinar said .
nockemann , a member of a populist right-wing party , is likely to lose his job after hamburg elects a new parliament on feb .
29 . acquittal for want of evidence mzoudi had been accused of abetting murder in more than 3,000 cases and belonging to terrorist organization al qaeda , but judges ruled that there was not enough evidence to confirm this . “ mr. mzoudi , you are acquitted , but this is no reason to celebrate , ” presiding judge klaus rühle said to mzoudi , who showed no emotions as the verdict was announced .
he added that the acquittal was not a sign that the court had been convinced of mzoudi ’ s innocence , but rather the prosecution ’ s failure to prove their case . in december , the court had already freed him from jail , however , after an anonymous witness had apparently exonerated him .

schily said in a television interview he was " disappointed that a ruling had gone in this direction " and that he was hopeful mzoudi would be sentenced after federal prosecutors said they planned to file a fresh appeal .
schily added that mzoudi , a former student at a hamburg university , would remain under observation by security officials .

besides , his likely successor could help build party support for schröder 's equally unloved reforms . franz müntefering is supposed to mend things : the leader of the social democrats ’ -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group will now likely be elected party chief of germany ’ s largest governing party after chancellor gerhard schröder threw in the towel friday .
the move comes barely five years after he took the party ’ s top job as an almost natural step after his predecessor , oscar lafontaine , resigned .
schröder didn ’ t want to do it , but who else , besides the chancellor , should have taken the position ?
today , the answer is franz müntefering .
and this time around , it ’ s perhaps less an inevitable decision than the logical consequence of a party that ’ s been plagued with diminishing membership and election losses .
there ’ s never been an emotional connection between schröder and the spd party base .
that ’ s underscored by the fact that the chancellor ’ s reform policies have come up against clear resentment among the party ’ s core .
criticism can often be heard that social equality has fallen to the wayside .
in that regard , müntefering as party chief won ’ t change anything either .
however , it could slightly change the mediation problems the chancellor has identified .
proverbially loyal parliamentary group leader müntefering has , without a doubt , greater chances of influencing the party .
the spd base doesn ’ t just listen to müntefering out of duty , but sympathy as well .
that could actually lead to the ideal type of division of labor the chancellor desires in his reform process .
müntefering would lobby for acceptance of change within the party while schröder devises plans for reforms .
at the same time , politics isn ’ t something easily drafted on the drawing board .
müntefering can be as loyal to the chancellor as he wants , as party leader he will have new and stronger authority – not least vis-à-vis the chancellor .
but there are also expectations tied to that , because for the party base , just having a new face at the top isn ’ t enough in the long term .
the grumblers in the party base , especially , will also expect him to influence government policy .
and that , one would expect , would be uncomfortable for schröder .
with müntefering as parliamentary group leader and national party chief , the party now has a second heavyweight next to the chancellor . it ’ s also still an open question how much the move will impact the public , who , if you believe the polls , are increasingly turning away from the spd .
that ’ s an effect of the reform policies – policies , which should not be stopped , according to gerhard schröder .
taking this under consideration , a new party chairman alone will have little ability to change anything .
nor will it lead to better results for the spd during upcoming elections for european parliament and in a number of german states .
but müntefering could have a motivating effect on the classic social democratic constituency – only that still won ’ t be enough to create an election success for the spd .
by resigning from his post as spd leader , schröder is taking leave of an unloved office .
it really should n't be difficult for him , but he ’ s nonetheless viewed the division of the chancellery and the party chairmanship as problematic in the past .
with schröder loyalist müntefering in the position , it could function , but gerhard schröder shouldn ’ t be too sure of it , either . heinz dylong -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder to step down as party leader giving in to calls from his party member to focus more on his duties as german chancellor , gerhard schröder on friday announced he will step down as leader of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .

production at factories , construction sites , utilities and mines gained 0.6 percent from november , when it increased a revised 0.8 percent , the economy and labor ministry said in berlin .
economists had expected a drop of 0.3 percent , the median of 34 forecasts in a bloomberg news survey showed .
the increase in production and orders suggests that the recovery in germany , which relies on exports for one third of gross domestic product , has n't yet been harmed by the euro 's 16 percent increase against the dollar in the past year . more briefs 06.02.2004 -pipe- siemens moves jobs to china 06.02.2004 -pipe- imf says the german economy will improve 05.02.2004 -pipe- deutsche bank posts q4 profit , raises dividend 05.02.2004 -pipe- germany seals estonian arms deal 05.02.2004 -pipe- berlin newspaper takeover blocked 05.02.2004 -pipe- shanghai airlines gets permission to fly to germany 04.02.2004 -pipe- record number of german insolvencies in 2003 04.02.2004 -pipe- bmw reorganizes brand focus radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

besides , his likely successor could help build party support for schröder 's equally unloved reforms . franz müntefering is supposed to mend things : the leader of the social democrats ’ -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group will now likely be elected party chief of germany ’ s largest governing party after chancellor gerhard schröder threw in the towel friday .
the move comes barely five years after he took the party ’ s top job as an almost natural step after his predecessor , oscar lafontaine , resigned .
schröder didn ’ t want to do it , but who else , besides the chancellor , should have taken the position ?
today , the answer is franz müntefering .
and this time around , it ’ s perhaps less an inevitable decision than the logical consequence of a party that ’ s been plagued with diminishing membership and election losses .
there ’ s never been an emotional connection between schröder and the spd party base .
that ’ s underscored by the fact that the chancellor ’ s reform policies have come up against clear resentment among the party ’ s core .
criticism can often be heard that social equality has fallen to the wayside .
in that regard , müntefering as party chief won ’ t change anything either .
however , it could slightly change the mediation problems the chancellor has identified .
proverbially loyal parliamentary group leader müntefering has , without a doubt , greater chances of influencing the party .
the spd base doesn ’ t just listen to müntefering out of duty , but sympathy as well .
that could actually lead to the ideal type of division of labor the chancellor desires in his reform process .
müntefering would lobby for acceptance of change within the party while schröder devises plans for reforms .
at the same time , politics isn ’ t something easily drafted on the drawing board .
müntefering can be as loyal to the chancellor as he wants , as party leader he will have new and stronger authority – not least vis-à-vis the chancellor .
but there are also expectations tied to that , because for the party base , just having a new face at the top isn ’ t enough in the long term .
the grumblers in the party base , especially , will also expect him to influence government policy .
and that , one would expect , would be uncomfortable for schröder .
with müntefering as parliamentary group leader and national party chief , the party now has a second heavyweight next to the chancellor . it ’ s also still an open question how much the move will impact the public , who , if you believe the polls , are increasingly turning away from the spd .
that ’ s an effect of the reform policies – policies , which should not be stopped , according to gerhard schröder .
taking this under consideration , a new party chairman alone will have little ability to change anything .
nor will it lead to better results for the spd during upcoming elections for european parliament and in a number of german states .
but müntefering could have a motivating effect on the classic social democratic constituency – only that still won ’ t be enough to create an election success for the spd .
by resigning from his post as spd leader , schröder is taking leave of an unloved office .
it really should n't be difficult for him , but he ’ s nonetheless viewed the division of the chancellery and the party chairmanship as problematic in the past .

the move comes barely five years after he took the party ’ s top job as an almost natural step after his predecessor , oscar lafontaine , resigned .
schröder didn ’ t want to do it , but who else , besides the chancellor , should have taken the position ?
today , the answer is franz müntefering .
and this time around , it ’ s perhaps less an inevitable decision than the logical consequence of a party that ’ s been plagued with diminishing membership and election losses .
there ’ s never been an emotional connection between schröder and the spd party base .
that ’ s underscored by the fact that the chancellor ’ s reform policies have come up against clear resentment among the party ’ s core .
criticism can often be heard that social equality has fallen to the wayside .
in that regard , müntefering as party chief won ’ t change anything either .
however , it could slightly change the mediation problems the chancellor has identified .
proverbially loyal parliamentary group leader müntefering has , without a doubt , greater chances of influencing the party .
the spd base doesn ’ t just listen to müntefering out of duty , but sympathy as well .
that could actually lead to the ideal type of division of labor the chancellor desires in his reform process .
müntefering would lobby for acceptance of change within the party while schröder devises plans for reforms .
at the same time , politics isn ’ t something easily drafted on the drawing board .
müntefering can be as loyal to the chancellor as he wants , as party leader he will have new and stronger authority – not least vis-à-vis the chancellor .
but there are also expectations tied to that , because for the party base , just having a new face at the top isn ’ t enough in the long term .
the grumblers in the party base , especially , will also expect him to influence government policy .
and that , one would expect , would be uncomfortable for schröder .
with müntefering as parliamentary group leader and national party chief , the party now has a second heavyweight next to the chancellor . it ’ s also still an open question how much the move will impact the public , who , if you believe the polls , are increasingly turning away from the spd .
that ’ s an effect of the reform policies – policies , which should not be stopped , according to gerhard schröder .
taking this under consideration , a new party chairman alone will have little ability to change anything .
nor will it lead to better results for the spd during upcoming elections for european parliament and in a number of german states .
but müntefering could have a motivating effect on the classic social democratic constituency – only that still won ’ t be enough to create an election success for the spd .
by resigning from his post as spd leader , schröder is taking leave of an unloved office .
it really should n't be difficult for him , but he ’ s nonetheless viewed the division of the chancellery and the party chairmanship as problematic in the past .
with schröder loyalist müntefering in the position , it could function , but gerhard schröder shouldn ’ t be too sure of it , either . heinz dylong -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder to step down as party leader giving in to calls from his party member to focus more on his duties as german chancellor , gerhard schröder on friday announced he will step down as leader of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .

a supporter of schröder 's reforms , he said he will stay the course .
" i 'd like to do my part , " said müntefering on friday .
" we have to undertake certain measures now even if not everyone agrees with them . "
as a result of the leadership change , the spd 's current secretary-general , olaf scholz , announced he will step down as well .
müntefering said he already had chosen a replacement , but did n't want to reveal the name until a meeting of the party 's leadership on saturday .
no plans to replace ministers the chancellor did not reveal any plans to reshuffle his cabinet . several party leaders had asked him to do , saying that some ministers seemed to be worn out .

lamy arrived in tokyo thursday from seoul for a four-day visit to meet japanese leaders .
lamy met earlier today with japan 's economy , trade , and industry minister takeo hiranuma to reaffirm eu / japan globarization talks to be materialized .
-lrb- ap photo / junji kurokawa -rrb- " the epa negotiations with eastern and southern africa will follow a hands-on approach : development is the objective , trade one of the tools , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said on the eve of the trip .
eu development commissioner poul nielson also welcomed what he called the african nations ’ " important " decision to kickstart epa negotiations with the 15-nation eu bloc .
" deepening regional integration , breaking down barriers to neighbors and creating larger markets are crucial steps if these countries are to stimulate their necessary investments and productivity improvements that will drive their development , " he said .
the 16 countries slated to hold talks with the eu over the weekend are burundi , comores , djibouti , democratic republic of congo , eritrea , ethiopia , kenya , madagascar , malawi , mauritius , rwanda , seychelles , sudan , uganda , zambia and zimbabwe .
the countries , with a total population of 280 million , are all members of the acp , which includes some of the world 's poorest nations .

the eu commission has underlined that the eu has already earmarked more than € 700 million -lrb- $ 880.6 million -rrb- for supporting trade-related activities and regional integration in the eastern and southern african countries .
helping africa help itself eu negotiators are emphasizing that in addition to allowing goods from developing countries almost free access to european markets , it is vital to strengthen regional integration among individual african countries .
in other words , the eu would like to help african nations help themselves .
martin dihm of the eu commission ’ s directorate-general for trade said in a press conference on thursday it was urgent that regional trade partnerships were formed before trade cooperations between africa and the eu could be hammered out .
" the most important topic is regional cooperation .
that ’ s our key phrase for further development perspectives , " he said .
" we believe that regional integration can reinforce the credibility of structures and good governance and thus become attractive for investors , " dihm added .
" and that ’ s what counts if you want to achieve development and economic growth . "
talks hoped to boost stalled wto debate the regional trade accords among the african nations are expected to be signed and sealed by 2008 .
negotiators are hoping that by then an african free trade zone between the regions will also have been established .
today trade between african states is burdened by heavy tariffs , which tend to be much higher than those involved in trade with the rest of the world .
the eu also hopes that the epas will get the doha development round -lrb- launched in 2001 in doha , qatar -rrb- back on track .
the doha round was meant to lower commercial barriers around the world from agriculture to the service industry .
talks in cancun , mexico , broke down last september mainly over farm subsidies in rich countries and on new issues such as trade and competition policy and transparency in government procurement that the eu wanted to include in the negotiations .
" epas are highly complimentary and supportive of the doha development round as they involve the same issues for the same countries , " dihm said .
" by strengthening their capacity within the epas , developing countries can also strengthen their capacity in geneva and the world trade organization , " he added .
" the first step of getting trade back on track is the development between the north-north relationships and south-south .
the second step is integration between them and us . "
eu trade commissioner pascal lamy stressed that the success of the negotiations would benefit both sides .

eu development commissioner poul nielson also welcomed what he called the african nations ’ " important " decision to kickstart epa negotiations with the 15-nation eu bloc .
" deepening regional integration , breaking down barriers to neighbors and creating larger markets are crucial steps if these countries are to stimulate their necessary investments and productivity improvements that will drive their development , " he said .
the 16 countries slated to hold talks with the eu over the weekend are burundi , comores , djibouti , democratic republic of congo , eritrea , ethiopia , kenya , madagascar , malawi , mauritius , rwanda , seychelles , sudan , uganda , zambia and zimbabwe .

the eu commission has underlined that the eu has already earmarked more than € 700 million -lrb- $ 880.6 million -rrb- for supporting trade-related activities and regional integration in the eastern and southern african countries .

in other words , the eu would like to help african nations help themselves .
martin dihm of the eu commission ’ s directorate-general for trade said in a press conference on thursday it was urgent that regional trade partnerships were formed before trade cooperations between africa and the eu could be hammered out .
" the most important topic is regional cooperation .
that ’ s our key phrase for further development perspectives , " he said .
" we believe that regional integration can reinforce the credibility of structures and good governance and thus become attractive for investors , " dihm added .
" and that ’ s what counts if you want to achieve development and economic growth . "

negotiators are hoping that by then an african free trade zone between the regions will also have been established .
today trade between african states is burdened by heavy tariffs , which tend to be much higher than those involved in trade with the rest of the world .
the eu also hopes that the epas will get the doha development round -lrb- launched in 2001 in doha , qatar -rrb- back on track .
the doha round was meant to lower commercial barriers around the world from agriculture to the service industry .
talks in cancun , mexico , broke down last september mainly over farm subsidies in rich countries and on new issues such as trade and competition policy and transparency in government procurement that the eu wanted to include in the negotiations .
" epas are highly complimentary and supportive of the doha development round as they involve the same issues for the same countries , " dihm said .
" by strengthening their capacity within the epas , developing countries can also strengthen their capacity in geneva and the world trade organization , " he added .
" the first step of getting trade back on track is the development between the north-north relationships and south-south .
the second step is integration between them and us . "
eu trade commissioner pascal lamy stressed that the success of the negotiations would benefit both sides .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said he supported expanding peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , but remained cool to merging the nato deployment with the u.s. military campaign in the country . in consultations with new nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer in berlin , schröder said he backed letting the eurocorps – a joint military unit made up of soldiers from germany , france , belgium , luxembourg and spain – take over the transatlantic alliance ’ s isaf mission in afghanistan this summer . “ the defense ministers are currently examining whether , for example , the german-french brigade could play a role , and if so on what scale , ” schröder said at a joint press conference with de hoop scheffer in berlin on friday . isaf , which currently numbers around 6,000 of the predominately german and canadian soldiers , is limited to the afghan capital kabul and the northern city of kunduz .
it is nato ’ s first mission outside of the 19-member alliance ’ s traditional sphere of influence in europe and north america . after german troops last year expanded the peacekeeping operations to kunduz , other european nations are likely to commit military teams to five other provincial cities , hoping to help stabilize the country further ahead of afghan elections expected in june .
according to the associated press , italy and norway were considering deploying troops to run “ provincial reconstruction teams ” like the one in kunduz . “ we can not afford to lose in afghanistan because that would mean we lose the fight against terrorism and that we can not bring security and stability , ” de hoop scheffer said . eurocorps command in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps troops .
the eurocorps , founded in 1992 by germany and france to further military cooperation in the european union , would most likely take over isaf in august .
currently headquartered in strasbourg , it is unclear how many of its 50,000 troops would take part in an afghan mission . schröder appeared relieved that de hoop scheffer was opposed to merging isaf ’ s peacekeeping duties with the still substantial military mission led by u.s. forces in afghanistan .
he said , however , the nato allies needed to look for “ synergies ” and remain “ pragmatic ” on the matter . after meeting with schröder , de hoop scheffer continued to munich to an annual security conference .
besides discussing afghanistan , nato defense ministers are also expected to discuss what if any role the alliance may undertake in stabilizing iraq .
however , the nato chief cautioned it was too early for any decisions on a military role in the country . the united states would like nato to take more responsibility in a multinational sector now led by alliance member poland .
but for europeans countries opposed to the u.s.-led war in iraq – such as germany and france – washington will most likely first have to relinquish power in baghdad to an iraqi administration . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from america and europe on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said he supported expanding peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , but remained cool to merging the nato deployment with the u.s. military campaign in the country . in consultations with new nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer in berlin , schröder said he backed letting the eurocorps – a joint military unit made up of soldiers from germany , france , belgium , luxembourg and spain – take over the transatlantic alliance ’ s isaf mission in afghanistan this summer . “ the defense ministers are currently examining whether , for example , the german-french brigade could play a role , and if so on what scale , ” schröder said at a joint press conference with de hoop scheffer in berlin on friday . isaf , which currently numbers around 6,000 of the predominately german and canadian soldiers , is limited to the afghan capital kabul and the northern city of kunduz .
it is nato ’ s first mission outside of the 19-member alliance ’ s traditional sphere of influence in europe and north america . after german troops last year expanded the peacekeeping operations to kunduz , other european nations are likely to commit military teams to five other provincial cities , hoping to help stabilize the country further ahead of afghan elections expected in june .
according to the associated press , italy and norway were considering deploying troops to run “ provincial reconstruction teams ” like the one in kunduz . “ we can not afford to lose in afghanistan because that would mean we lose the fight against terrorism and that we can not bring security and stability , ” de hoop scheffer said . eurocorps command in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps troops .
the eurocorps , founded in 1992 by germany and france to further military cooperation in the european union , would most likely take over isaf in august .
currently headquartered in strasbourg , it is unclear how many of its 50,000 troops would take part in an afghan mission . schröder appeared relieved that de hoop scheffer was opposed to merging isaf ’ s peacekeeping duties with the still substantial military mission led by u.s. forces in afghanistan .
he said , however , the nato allies needed to look for “ synergies ” and remain “ pragmatic ” on the matter . after meeting with schröder , de hoop scheffer continued to munich to an annual security conference .
besides discussing afghanistan , nato defense ministers are also expected to discuss what if any role the alliance may undertake in stabilizing iraq .
however , the nato chief cautioned it was too early for any decisions on a military role in the country . the united states would like nato to take more responsibility in a multinational sector now led by alliance member poland .
but for europeans countries opposed to the u.s.-led war in iraq – such as germany and france – washington will most likely first have to relinquish power in baghdad to an iraqi administration . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from america and europe on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld and german foreign minister joschka fischer famously clashed at the event , but relations between washington and berlin have since largely normalized . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato defense chiefs return to munich nato defense chiefs will meet in munich this weekend to discuss the alliance 's role in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.02.2004 schröder leaves an unloved post großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by quitting as the head of the social democratic party on friday , gerhard schröder left an office he hardly loved .
besides , his likely successor could help build party support for schröder 's equally unloved reforms . franz müntefering is supposed to mend things : the leader of the social democrats ’ -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group will now likely be elected party chief of germany ’ s largest governing party after chancellor gerhard schröder threw in the towel friday .
the move comes barely five years after he took the party ’ s top job as an almost natural step after his predecessor , oscar lafontaine , resigned .
schröder didn ’ t want to do it , but who else , besides the chancellor , should have taken the position ?
today , the answer is franz müntefering .
and this time around , it ’ s perhaps less an inevitable decision than the logical consequence of a party that ’ s been plagued with diminishing membership and election losses .
there ’ s never been an emotional connection between schröder and the spd party base .
that ’ s underscored by the fact that the chancellor ’ s reform policies have come up against clear resentment among the party ’ s core .
criticism can often be heard that social equality has fallen to the wayside .
in that regard , müntefering as party chief won ’ t change anything either .
however , it could slightly change the mediation problems the chancellor has identified .
proverbially loyal parliamentary group leader müntefering has , without a doubt , greater chances of influencing the party .
the spd base doesn ’ t just listen to müntefering out of duty , but sympathy as well .
that could actually lead to the ideal type of division of labor the chancellor desires in his reform process .
müntefering would lobby for acceptance of change within the party while schröder devises plans for reforms .
at the same time , politics isn ’ t something easily drafted on the drawing board .
müntefering can be as loyal to the chancellor as he wants , as party leader he will have new and stronger authority – not least vis-à-vis the chancellor .
but there are also expectations tied to that , because for the party base , just having a new face at the top isn ’ t enough in the long term .
the grumblers in the party base , especially , will also expect him to influence government policy .
and that , one would expect , would be uncomfortable for schröder .
with müntefering as parliamentary group leader and national party chief , the party now has a second heavyweight next to the chancellor . it ’ s also still an open question how much the move will impact the public , who , if you believe the polls , are increasingly turning away from the spd .
that ’ s an effect of the reform policies – policies , which should not be stopped , according to gerhard schröder .
taking this under consideration , a new party chairman alone will have little ability to change anything .
nor will it lead to better results for the spd during upcoming elections for european parliament and in a number of german states .
but müntefering could have a motivating effect on the classic social democratic constituency – only that still won ’ t be enough to create an election success for the spd .
by resigning from his post as spd leader , schröder is taking leave of an unloved office .
it really should n't be difficult for him , but he ’ s nonetheless viewed the division of the chancellery and the party chairmanship as problematic in the past .
with schröder loyalist müntefering in the position , it could function , but gerhard schröder shouldn ’ t be too sure of it , either . heinz dylong -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder to step down as party leader giving in to calls from his party member to focus more on his duties as german chancellor , gerhard schröder on friday announced he will step down as leader of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .

u.s. senator john kerry is on course to become george w. bush ’ s democratic challenger in the 2004 presidential election .
dw-world ’ s readers share their views on kerry ’ s chances to become the white house ’ s next occupant . i live in a particularly conservative city , but even here there is much disappointment with president bush .
ohio has lost many jobs to overseas locations , and mr bush is seen as a facilitator for allowing corporations to do this to american citizens in the pursuit of profits .
there is also a growing feeling that bush does n't know what he 's doing in iraq .
if kerry is selected as the democratic candidate , bush will have a very difficult time -lrb- especially if john edwards is kerry 's running mate -rrb- . - bob schindler , ohio . for germans who hate bush the thought that john kerry can win must be appealing but it is n't likely to happen .
contrary to you people , americans prefer low taxes and the economic prosperity that results from them .
also contrary to germans , most americans believe that the best defense is a good offense and favor current foreign policy .
we remember what happened in the late 30 's when chamberlain fooled around with hitler and the grave results that followed .
we may not be as educated , cultured and sophisticated as your people but we have far more common sense .
that 's why the united states is the greatest nation ever .
god bless america .
god help our enemies . - carl mahrenholz democrats lose elections because they wo n't compromise .
kerry already said he wo n't compromise on abortion , even revolting partial birth abortions done in the ninth month .
this will cost him many votes , especially in the southeast .
massachusetts became the first to legalize gay marriage .
this is a state matter .
the federal government has no jurisdiction .
consequently , kerry does n't need to say anything .
even so , he will most likely speak out in favor of it .
bush will coast to another 4 years .
i wish things were different . - peter laurence if senator kerry becomes the democrat ’ s presidential contender he will lose the election in november .
once his record is put under a microscope , people will see that this man is not what american want for our leader .
president bush has done well leading this country ’ s fight against terrorism .
our economy is one of the best in the world and getting stronger every day .
senator kerry is too liberal for most americans .
his anti-vietnam record will work against him in all the southern states .
burning the american flag in protest during the vietnam war will really hurt him . - marc johnson sr. it will be a very close race .
however , bush will probably win due to the fact that bush will carry most of the southern states and western states . - peter yoon yes , kerry can and will beat bush .
americans want to be told the truth and make up our own minds .
many feel we do n't get the truth from the present administration .
kerry can be a strong and protective leader and not bankrupt our country in doing so . - nick capece send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : can kerry beat bush ?
european papers on thursday focused on u.s. democratic presidential front-runner john kerry ’ s success on the campaign trail .
most warned kerry had his work cut out if he was to dislodge bush from the white house .

the move comes barely five years after he took the party ’ s top job as an almost natural step after his predecessor , oscar lafontaine , resigned .
schröder didn ’ t want to do it , but who else , besides the chancellor , should have taken the position ?
today , the answer is franz müntefering .
and this time around , it ’ s perhaps less an inevitable decision than the logical consequence of a party that ’ s been plagued with diminishing membership and election losses .
there ’ s never been an emotional connection between schröder and the spd party base .
that ’ s underscored by the fact that the chancellor ’ s reform policies have come up against clear resentment among the party ’ s core .
criticism can often be heard that social equality has fallen to the wayside .
in that regard , müntefering as party chief won ’ t change anything either .
however , it could slightly change the mediation problems the chancellor has identified .
proverbially loyal parliamentary group leader müntefering has , without a doubt , greater chances of influencing the party .
the spd base doesn ’ t just listen to müntefering out of duty , but sympathy as well .
that could actually lead to the ideal type of division of labor the chancellor desires in his reform process .
müntefering would lobby for acceptance of change within the party while schröder devises plans for reforms .
at the same time , politics isn ’ t something easily drafted on the drawing board .
müntefering can be as loyal to the chancellor as he wants , as party leader he will have new and stronger authority – not least vis-à-vis the chancellor .
but there are also expectations tied to that , because for the party base , just having a new face at the top isn ’ t enough in the long term .
the grumblers in the party base , especially , will also expect him to influence government policy .
and that , one would expect , would be uncomfortable for schröder .
with müntefering as parliamentary group leader and national party chief , the party now has a second heavyweight next to the chancellor . it ’ s also still an open question how much the move will impact the public , who , if you believe the polls , are increasingly turning away from the spd .
that ’ s an effect of the reform policies – policies , which should not be stopped , according to gerhard schröder .
taking this under consideration , a new party chairman alone will have little ability to change anything .
nor will it lead to better results for the spd during upcoming elections for european parliament and in a number of german states .
but müntefering could have a motivating effect on the classic social democratic constituency – only that still won ’ t be enough to create an election success for the spd .
by resigning from his post as spd leader , schröder is taking leave of an unloved office .
it really should n't be difficult for him , but he ’ s nonetheless viewed the division of the chancellery and the party chairmanship as problematic in the past .

besides , his likely successor could help build party support for schröder 's equally unloved reforms . franz müntefering is supposed to mend things : the leader of the social democrats ’ -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group will now likely be elected party chief of germany ’ s largest governing party after chancellor gerhard schröder threw in the towel friday .
the move comes barely five years after he took the party ’ s top job as an almost natural step after his predecessor , oscar lafontaine , resigned .
schröder didn ’ t want to do it , but who else , besides the chancellor , should have taken the position ?
today , the answer is franz müntefering .
and this time around , it ’ s perhaps less an inevitable decision than the logical consequence of a party that ’ s been plagued with diminishing membership and election losses .
there ’ s never been an emotional connection between schröder and the spd party base .
that ’ s underscored by the fact that the chancellor ’ s reform policies have come up against clear resentment among the party ’ s core .
criticism can often be heard that social equality has fallen to the wayside .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said he supported expanding peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , but remained cool to merging the nato deployment with the u.s. military campaign in the country . in consultations with new nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer in berlin , schröder said he backed letting the eurocorps – a joint military unit made up of soldiers from germany , france , belgium , luxembourg and spain – take over the transatlantic alliance ’ s isaf mission in afghanistan this summer . “ the defense ministers are currently examining whether , for example , the german-french brigade could play a role , and if so on what scale , ” schröder said at a joint press conference with de hoop scheffer in berlin on friday . isaf , which currently numbers around 6,000 of the predominately german and canadian soldiers , is limited to the afghan capital kabul and the northern city of kunduz .
it is nato ’ s first mission outside of the 19-member alliance ’ s traditional sphere of influence in europe and north america . after german troops last year expanded the peacekeeping operations to kunduz , other european nations are likely to commit military teams to five other provincial cities , hoping to help stabilize the country further ahead of afghan elections expected in june .
according to the associated press , italy and norway were considering deploying troops to run “ provincial reconstruction teams ” like the one in kunduz . “ we can not afford to lose in afghanistan because that would mean we lose the fight against terrorism and that we can not bring security and stability , ” de hoop scheffer said . eurocorps command in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps troops .
the eurocorps , founded in 1992 by germany and france to further military cooperation in the european union , would most likely take over isaf in august .
currently headquartered in strasbourg , it is unclear how many of its 50,000 troops would take part in an afghan mission . schröder appeared relieved that de hoop scheffer was opposed to merging isaf ’ s peacekeeping duties with the still substantial military mission led by u.s. forces in afghanistan .
he said , however , the nato allies needed to look for “ synergies ” and remain “ pragmatic ” on the matter . after meeting with schröder , de hoop scheffer continued to munich to an annual security conference .
besides discussing afghanistan , nato defense ministers are also expected to discuss what if any role the alliance may undertake in stabilizing iraq .
however , the nato chief cautioned it was too early for any decisions on a military role in the country . the united states would like nato to take more responsibility in a multinational sector now led by alliance member poland .
but for europeans countries opposed to the u.s.-led war in iraq – such as germany and france – washington will most likely first have to relinquish power in baghdad to an iraqi administration . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from america and europe on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said he supported expanding peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , but remained cool to merging the nato deployment with the u.s. military campaign in the country . in consultations with new nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer in berlin , schröder said he backed letting the eurocorps – a joint military unit made up of soldiers from germany , france , belgium , luxembourg and spain – take over the transatlantic alliance ’ s isaf mission in afghanistan this summer . “ the defense ministers are currently examining whether , for example , the german-french brigade could play a role , and if so on what scale , ” schröder said at a joint press conference with de hoop scheffer in berlin on friday . isaf , which currently numbers around 6,000 of the predominately german and canadian soldiers , is limited to the afghan capital kabul and the northern city of kunduz .
it is nato ’ s first mission outside of the 19-member alliance ’ s traditional sphere of influence in europe and north america . after german troops last year expanded the peacekeeping operations to kunduz , other european nations are likely to commit military teams to five other provincial cities , hoping to help stabilize the country further ahead of afghan elections expected in june .
according to the associated press , italy and norway were considering deploying troops to run “ provincial reconstruction teams ” like the one in kunduz . “ we can not afford to lose in afghanistan because that would mean we lose the fight against terrorism and that we can not bring security and stability , ” de hoop scheffer said . eurocorps command in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps troops .
the eurocorps , founded in 1992 by germany and france to further military cooperation in the european union , would most likely take over isaf in august .
currently headquartered in strasbourg , it is unclear how many of its 50,000 troops would take part in an afghan mission . schröder appeared relieved that de hoop scheffer was opposed to merging isaf ’ s peacekeeping duties with the still substantial military mission led by u.s. forces in afghanistan .
he said , however , the nato allies needed to look for “ synergies ” and remain “ pragmatic ” on the matter . after meeting with schröder , de hoop scheffer continued to munich to an annual security conference .
besides discussing afghanistan , nato defense ministers are also expected to discuss what if any role the alliance may undertake in stabilizing iraq .
however , the nato chief cautioned it was too early for any decisions on a military role in the country . the united states would like nato to take more responsibility in a multinational sector now led by alliance member poland .
but for europeans countries opposed to the u.s.-led war in iraq – such as germany and france – washington will most likely first have to relinquish power in baghdad to an iraqi administration . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from america and europe on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .

german officials have already said they plan to deport abdelghani mzoudi to his home country . for now , mzoudi is a free man and will receive financial compensation for the time spent in jail .
“ this is the day of a justice system , which refuses to be used blindly to combat terrorism , ” mzoudi ’ s defense lawer , michael rosenthal , said after the verdict . but germany ’ s prosecutor-general said thursday that he planned to appeal the verdict to the federal court of justice . “ we ’ re hoping for a second round in the mzoudi case , ” kay nehm said , adding that he expected the verdict to serve as a wake-up call to u.s. authorities , who have so far been reluctant to release information and witness testimony the prosecution considered crucial to prove their case . in case of an appeal , mzoudi is likely to remain in germany for a while , but hamburg ’ s top security official said he wants him deported as soon as possible .
mzoudi has been trying to avoid deportation , fearing that moroccan officials might extradite him to the u.s. “ there is no case more pressing than mzoudi ’ s , ” dirk nockemann , the city state ’ s interior minister , told ap news service after the verdict .
“ the man is dangerous . ” nockemann said that officials will make a decision within a few days , adding that police would monitor the 31-year-old . defense lawyer gül pinar said she didn ’ t expect nockemann to succeed with the deportation plan .

he added that the acquittal was not a sign that the court had been convinced of mzoudi ’ s innocence , but rather the prosecution ’ s failure to prove their case . in december , the court had already freed him from jail , however , after an anonymous witness had apparently exonerated him .

11 terror suspect acquitted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's a free man now .
a hamburg court on thursday acquitted a moroccan charged with helping to prepare the sept .
11 attacks .
german officials have already said they plan to deport abdelghani mzoudi to his home country . for now , mzoudi is a free man and will receive financial compensation for the time spent in jail .
“ this is the day of a justice system , which refuses to be used blindly to combat terrorism , ” mzoudi ’ s defense lawer , michael rosenthal , said after the verdict . but germany ’ s prosecutor-general said thursday that he planned to appeal the verdict to the federal court of justice . “ we ’ re hoping for a second round in the mzoudi case , ” kay nehm said , adding that he expected the verdict to serve as a wake-up call to u.s. authorities , who have so far been reluctant to release information and witness testimony the prosecution considered crucial to prove their case . in case of an appeal , mzoudi is likely to remain in germany for a while , but hamburg ’ s top security official said he wants him deported as soon as possible .
mzoudi has been trying to avoid deportation , fearing that moroccan officials might extradite him to the u.s. “ there is no case more pressing than mzoudi ’ s , ” dirk nockemann , the city state ’ s interior minister , told ap news service after the verdict .
“ the man is dangerous . ” nockemann said that officials will make a decision within a few days , adding that police would monitor the 31-year-old . defense lawyer gül pinar said she didn ’ t expect nockemann to succeed with the deportation plan .
“ mr. mzoudi will be here longer than mr. nockemann will stay in office , ” pinar said .
nockemann , a member of a populist right-wing party , is likely to lose his job after hamburg elects a new parliament on feb .
29 . acquittal for want of evidence mzoudi had been accused of abetting murder in more than 3,000 cases and belonging to terrorist organization al qaeda , but judges ruled that there was not enough evidence to confirm this . “ mr. mzoudi , you are acquitted , but this is no reason to celebrate , ” presiding judge klaus rühle said to mzoudi , who showed no emotions as the verdict was announced .
he added that the acquittal was not a sign that the court had been convinced of mzoudi ’ s innocence , but rather the prosecution ’ s failure to prove their case . in december , the court had already freed him from jail , however , after an anonymous witness had apparently exonerated him .
that witness is believed to be ramzi binalshibh , who allegedly organized the attacks and is now in u.s. custody . last-minute attempt to delay sentencing fails saying that not enough information about the witness ’ s testimony had been revealed , lawyers of relatives of sept .
11 victims had tried to delay sentencing on thursday , but the judges rejected this .
the relatives are allowed to appear as co-plaintiffs in andreas schulz , one of the lawyers , had asked the court to seek more information from the u.s. authorities , saying that they were now willing to share more information .
previous attempts to receive documents from washington had failed , however . ramifications for appeal in motassadeq trial ? thursday ’ s verdict could have ramifications for the appeal of the first ever verdict related to the sept .
11 attacks .
last february , the same hamburg court had sentenced mounir el motassadeq to 15 years in prison for his role in plotting the attacks . germany 's federal court of justice is currently considering the appeal and is expected to decide whether to let it proceed on march 4 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the only verdict possible the roller-coaster course of the five-month trial against abdelghani mzoudi left judges no choice but to acquit him , deutsche welle 's peter phillip writes in a commentary on thursday 's verdict .

the eu will launch trade talks with 16 eastern and southern african countries in mauritius this weekend .
the aim is to allow freer access to eu markets and to spur regional trade accords among african nations . the european union kicks off a second round of trade talks with 16 eastern and southern african countries on saturday .
the talks , which will gradually involve all members of the 79-nation africa , caribbean and pacific group -lrb- acp -rrb- , are intended to seal economic and partnership agreements -lrb- epa -rrb- with the african nations .
the negotiations follow a trade round already launched with nations in west and central africa in october .
epas are based on the cotonou agreement signed in benin in 2000 giving the 79 members of the acp group a special trade status within the eu .
while the eu says that under the agreement it will be prepared to further open its markets to acp products and loosen other trade barriers , acp states have indicated they will implement trade-friendly policies .
african development a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for trade pascal lamy gestures while answering reporters ' questions in the press conference at a hotel in tokyo , friday , feb .
16 , 2001 .
lamy arrived in tokyo thursday from seoul for a four-day visit to meet japanese leaders .
lamy met earlier today with japan 's economy , trade , and industry minister takeo hiranuma to reaffirm eu / japan globarization talks to be materialized .
-lrb- ap photo / junji kurokawa -rrb- " the epa negotiations with eastern and southern africa will follow a hands-on approach : development is the objective , trade one of the tools , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said on the eve of the trip .
eu development commissioner poul nielson also welcomed what he called the african nations ’ " important " decision to kickstart epa negotiations with the 15-nation eu bloc .
" deepening regional integration , breaking down barriers to neighbors and creating larger markets are crucial steps if these countries are to stimulate their necessary investments and productivity improvements that will drive their development , " he said .
the 16 countries slated to hold talks with the eu over the weekend are burundi , comores , djibouti , democratic republic of congo , eritrea , ethiopia , kenya , madagascar , malawi , mauritius , rwanda , seychelles , sudan , uganda , zambia and zimbabwe .
the countries , with a total population of 280 million , are all members of the acp , which includes some of the world 's poorest nations .
they form part of the common market for eastern and southern africa -lrb- comesa -rrb- .
the eu commission has underlined that the eu has already earmarked more than € 700 million -lrb- $ 880.6 million -rrb- for supporting trade-related activities and regional integration in the eastern and southern african countries .
helping africa help itself eu negotiators are emphasizing that in addition to allowing goods from developing countries almost free access to european markets , it is vital to strengthen regional integration among individual african countries .
in other words , the eu would like to help african nations help themselves .
martin dihm of the eu commission ’ s directorate-general for trade said in a press conference on thursday it was urgent that regional trade partnerships were formed before trade cooperations between africa and the eu could be hammered out .
" the most important topic is regional cooperation .
that ’ s our key phrase for further development perspectives , " he said .
" we believe that regional integration can reinforce the credibility of structures and good governance and thus become attractive for investors , " dihm added .
" and that ’ s what counts if you want to achieve development and economic growth . "
talks hoped to boost stalled wto debate the regional trade accords among the african nations are expected to be signed and sealed by 2008 .
negotiators are hoping that by then an african free trade zone between the regions will also have been established .
today trade between african states is burdened by heavy tariffs , which tend to be much higher than those involved in trade with the rest of the world .
the eu also hopes that the epas will get the doha development round -lrb- launched in 2001 in doha , qatar -rrb- back on track .
the doha round was meant to lower commercial barriers around the world from agriculture to the service industry .
talks in cancun , mexico , broke down last september mainly over farm subsidies in rich countries and on new issues such as trade and competition policy and transparency in government procurement that the eu wanted to include in the negotiations .
" epas are highly complimentary and supportive of the doha development round as they involve the same issues for the same countries , " dihm said .
" by strengthening their capacity within the epas , developing countries can also strengthen their capacity in geneva and the world trade organization , " he added .
" the first step of getting trade back on track is the development between the north-north relationships and south-south .
the second step is integration between them and us . "
eu trade commissioner pascal lamy stressed that the success of the negotiations would benefit both sides .
" if at the end of these negotiations eastern and southern africa stands as a stronger region , able to define its common interest and improve jointly the environment for business and investors , we will all have won , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder encourages more self-help for africa wrapping up his six-day tour of africa on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder inaugurated a peacekeeping training center in ghana , saying it will serve as a model for other countries .

the eu will launch trade talks with 16 eastern and southern african countries in mauritius this weekend .
the aim is to allow freer access to eu markets and to spur regional trade accords among african nations . the european union kicks off a second round of trade talks with 16 eastern and southern african countries on saturday .
the talks , which will gradually involve all members of the 79-nation africa , caribbean and pacific group -lrb- acp -rrb- , are intended to seal economic and partnership agreements -lrb- epa -rrb- with the african nations .
the negotiations follow a trade round already launched with nations in west and central africa in october .
epas are based on the cotonou agreement signed in benin in 2000 giving the 79 members of the acp group a special trade status within the eu .
while the eu says that under the agreement it will be prepared to further open its markets to acp products and loosen other trade barriers , acp states have indicated they will implement trade-friendly policies .
african development a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for trade pascal lamy gestures while answering reporters ' questions in the press conference at a hotel in tokyo , friday , feb .
16 , 2001 .
lamy arrived in tokyo thursday from seoul for a four-day visit to meet japanese leaders .
lamy met earlier today with japan 's economy , trade , and industry minister takeo hiranuma to reaffirm eu / japan globarization talks to be materialized .
-lrb- ap photo / junji kurokawa -rrb- " the epa negotiations with eastern and southern africa will follow a hands-on approach : development is the objective , trade one of the tools , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said on the eve of the trip .
eu development commissioner poul nielson also welcomed what he called the african nations ’ " important " decision to kickstart epa negotiations with the 15-nation eu bloc .
" deepening regional integration , breaking down barriers to neighbors and creating larger markets are crucial steps if these countries are to stimulate their necessary investments and productivity improvements that will drive their development , " he said .
the 16 countries slated to hold talks with the eu over the weekend are burundi , comores , djibouti , democratic republic of congo , eritrea , ethiopia , kenya , madagascar , malawi , mauritius , rwanda , seychelles , sudan , uganda , zambia and zimbabwe .
the countries , with a total population of 280 million , are all members of the acp , which includes some of the world 's poorest nations .
they form part of the common market for eastern and southern africa -lrb- comesa -rrb- .
the eu commission has underlined that the eu has already earmarked more than € 700 million -lrb- $ 880.6 million -rrb- for supporting trade-related activities and regional integration in the eastern and southern african countries .
helping africa help itself eu negotiators are emphasizing that in addition to allowing goods from developing countries almost free access to european markets , it is vital to strengthen regional integration among individual african countries .
in other words , the eu would like to help african nations help themselves .
martin dihm of the eu commission ’ s directorate-general for trade said in a press conference on thursday it was urgent that regional trade partnerships were formed before trade cooperations between africa and the eu could be hammered out .
" the most important topic is regional cooperation .
that ’ s our key phrase for further development perspectives , " he said .
" we believe that regional integration can reinforce the credibility of structures and good governance and thus become attractive for investors , " dihm added .
" and that ’ s what counts if you want to achieve development and economic growth . "
talks hoped to boost stalled wto debate the regional trade accords among the african nations are expected to be signed and sealed by 2008 .
negotiators are hoping that by then an african free trade zone between the regions will also have been established .
today trade between african states is burdened by heavy tariffs , which tend to be much higher than those involved in trade with the rest of the world .
the eu also hopes that the epas will get the doha development round -lrb- launched in 2001 in doha , qatar -rrb- back on track .
the doha round was meant to lower commercial barriers around the world from agriculture to the service industry .
talks in cancun , mexico , broke down last september mainly over farm subsidies in rich countries and on new issues such as trade and competition policy and transparency in government procurement that the eu wanted to include in the negotiations .
" epas are highly complimentary and supportive of the doha development round as they involve the same issues for the same countries , " dihm said .
" by strengthening their capacity within the epas , developing countries can also strengthen their capacity in geneva and the world trade organization , " he added .
" the first step of getting trade back on track is the development between the north-north relationships and south-south .
the second step is integration between them and us . "
eu trade commissioner pascal lamy stressed that the success of the negotiations would benefit both sides .
" if at the end of these negotiations eastern and southern africa stands as a stronger region , able to define its common interest and improve jointly the environment for business and investors , we will all have won , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder encourages more self-help for africa wrapping up his six-day tour of africa on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder inaugurated a peacekeeping training center in ghana , saying it will serve as a model for other countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.02.2004 eu to open trade talks with africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu would like to see african trade benefit from economic partnerships within the continent .
the eu will launch trade talks with 16 eastern and southern african countries in mauritius this weekend .
the aim is to allow freer access to eu markets and to spur regional trade accords among african nations . the european union kicks off a second round of trade talks with 16 eastern and southern african countries on saturday .
the talks , which will gradually involve all members of the 79-nation africa , caribbean and pacific group -lrb- acp -rrb- , are intended to seal economic and partnership agreements -lrb- epa -rrb- with the african nations .
the negotiations follow a trade round already launched with nations in west and central africa in october .
epas are based on the cotonou agreement signed in benin in 2000 giving the 79 members of the acp group a special trade status within the eu .
while the eu says that under the agreement it will be prepared to further open its markets to acp products and loosen other trade barriers , acp states have indicated they will implement trade-friendly policies .
african development a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for trade pascal lamy gestures while answering reporters ' questions in the press conference at a hotel in tokyo , friday , feb .
16 , 2001 .
lamy arrived in tokyo thursday from seoul for a four-day visit to meet japanese leaders .
lamy met earlier today with japan 's economy , trade , and industry minister takeo hiranuma to reaffirm eu / japan globarization talks to be materialized .
-lrb- ap photo / junji kurokawa -rrb- " the epa negotiations with eastern and southern africa will follow a hands-on approach : development is the objective , trade one of the tools , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said on the eve of the trip .
eu development commissioner poul nielson also welcomed what he called the african nations ’ " important " decision to kickstart epa negotiations with the 15-nation eu bloc .
" deepening regional integration , breaking down barriers to neighbors and creating larger markets are crucial steps if these countries are to stimulate their necessary investments and productivity improvements that will drive their development , " he said .
the 16 countries slated to hold talks with the eu over the weekend are burundi , comores , djibouti , democratic republic of congo , eritrea , ethiopia , kenya , madagascar , malawi , mauritius , rwanda , seychelles , sudan , uganda , zambia and zimbabwe .
the countries , with a total population of 280 million , are all members of the acp , which includes some of the world 's poorest nations .
they form part of the common market for eastern and southern africa -lrb- comesa -rrb- .
the eu commission has underlined that the eu has already earmarked more than € 700 million -lrb- $ 880.6 million -rrb- for supporting trade-related activities and regional integration in the eastern and southern african countries .
helping africa help itself eu negotiators are emphasizing that in addition to allowing goods from developing countries almost free access to european markets , it is vital to strengthen regional integration among individual african countries .
in other words , the eu would like to help african nations help themselves .
martin dihm of the eu commission ’ s directorate-general for trade said in a press conference on thursday it was urgent that regional trade partnerships were formed before trade cooperations between africa and the eu could be hammered out .
" the most important topic is regional cooperation .
that ’ s our key phrase for further development perspectives , " he said .
" we believe that regional integration can reinforce the credibility of structures and good governance and thus become attractive for investors , " dihm added .
" and that ’ s what counts if you want to achieve development and economic growth . "
talks hoped to boost stalled wto debate the regional trade accords among the african nations are expected to be signed and sealed by 2008 .
negotiators are hoping that by then an african free trade zone between the regions will also have been established .
today trade between african states is burdened by heavy tariffs , which tend to be much higher than those involved in trade with the rest of the world .
the eu also hopes that the epas will get the doha development round -lrb- launched in 2001 in doha , qatar -rrb- back on track .
the doha round was meant to lower commercial barriers around the world from agriculture to the service industry .
talks in cancun , mexico , broke down last september mainly over farm subsidies in rich countries and on new issues such as trade and competition policy and transparency in government procurement that the eu wanted to include in the negotiations .
" epas are highly complimentary and supportive of the doha development round as they involve the same issues for the same countries , " dihm said .
" by strengthening their capacity within the epas , developing countries can also strengthen their capacity in geneva and the world trade organization , " he added .
" the first step of getting trade back on track is the development between the north-north relationships and south-south .
the second step is integration between them and us . "
eu trade commissioner pascal lamy stressed that the success of the negotiations would benefit both sides .
" if at the end of these negotiations eastern and southern africa stands as a stronger region , able to define its common interest and improve jointly the environment for business and investors , we will all have won , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder encourages more self-help for africa wrapping up his six-day tour of africa on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder inaugurated a peacekeeping training center in ghana , saying it will serve as a model for other countries .

german officials have already said they plan to deport abdelghani mzoudi to his home country . for now , mzoudi is a free man and will receive financial compensation for the time spent in jail .
“ this is the day of a justice system , which refuses to be used blindly to combat terrorism , ” mzoudi ’ s defense lawer , michael rosenthal , said after the verdict . but germany ’ s prosecutor-general said thursday that he planned to appeal the verdict to the federal court of justice . “ we ’ re hoping for a second round in the mzoudi case , ” kay nehm said , adding that he expected the verdict to serve as a wake-up call to u.s. authorities , who have so far been reluctant to release information and witness testimony the prosecution considered crucial to prove their case . in case of an appeal , mzoudi is likely to remain in germany for a while , but hamburg ’ s top security official said he wants him deported as soon as possible .
mzoudi has been trying to avoid deportation , fearing that moroccan officials might extradite him to the u.s. “ there is no case more pressing than mzoudi ’ s , ” dirk nockemann , the city state ’ s interior minister , told ap news service after the verdict .
“ the man is dangerous . ” nockemann said that officials will make a decision within a few days , adding that police would monitor the 31-year-old . defense lawyer gül pinar said she didn ’ t expect nockemann to succeed with the deportation plan .
“ mr. mzoudi will be here longer than mr. nockemann will stay in office , ” pinar said .
nockemann , a member of a populist right-wing party , is likely to lose his job after hamburg elects a new parliament on feb .
29 . acquittal for want of evidence mzoudi had been accused of abetting murder in more than 3,000 cases and belonging to terrorist organization al qaeda , but judges ruled that there was not enough evidence to confirm this . “ mr. mzoudi , you are acquitted , but this is no reason to celebrate , ” presiding judge klaus rühle said to mzoudi , who showed no emotions as the verdict was announced .
he added that the acquittal was not a sign that the court had been convinced of mzoudi ’ s innocence , but rather the prosecution ’ s failure to prove their case . in december , the court had already freed him from jail , however , after an anonymous witness had apparently exonerated him .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said he supported expanding peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , but remained cool to merging the nato deployment with the u.s. military campaign in the country . in consultations with new nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer in berlin , schröder said he backed letting the eurocorps – a joint military unit made up of soldiers from germany , france , belgium , luxembourg and spain – take over the transatlantic alliance ’ s isaf mission in afghanistan this summer . “ the defense ministers are currently examining whether , for example , the german-french brigade could play a role , and if so on what scale , ” schröder said at a joint press conference with de hoop scheffer in berlin on friday . isaf , which currently numbers around 6,000 of the predominately german and canadian soldiers , is limited to the afghan capital kabul and the northern city of kunduz .
it is nato ’ s first mission outside of the 19-member alliance ’ s traditional sphere of influence in europe and north america . after german troops last year expanded the peacekeeping operations to kunduz , other european nations are likely to commit military teams to five other provincial cities , hoping to help stabilize the country further ahead of afghan elections expected in june .
according to the associated press , italy and norway were considering deploying troops to run “ provincial reconstruction teams ” like the one in kunduz . “ we can not afford to lose in afghanistan because that would mean we lose the fight against terrorism and that we can not bring security and stability , ” de hoop scheffer said . eurocorps command in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps troops .
the eurocorps , founded in 1992 by germany and france to further military cooperation in the european union , would most likely take over isaf in august .
currently headquartered in strasbourg , it is unclear how many of its 50,000 troops would take part in an afghan mission . schröder appeared relieved that de hoop scheffer was opposed to merging isaf ’ s peacekeeping duties with the still substantial military mission led by u.s. forces in afghanistan .
he said , however , the nato allies needed to look for “ synergies ” and remain “ pragmatic ” on the matter . after meeting with schröder , de hoop scheffer continued to munich to an annual security conference .
besides discussing afghanistan , nato defense ministers are also expected to discuss what if any role the alliance may undertake in stabilizing iraq .
however , the nato chief cautioned it was too early for any decisions on a military role in the country . the united states would like nato to take more responsibility in a multinational sector now led by alliance member poland .
but for europeans countries opposed to the u.s.-led war in iraq – such as germany and france – washington will most likely first have to relinquish power in baghdad to an iraqi administration . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from america and europe on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld and german foreign minister joschka fischer famously clashed at the event , but relations between washington and berlin have since largely normalized . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato defense chiefs return to munich nato defense chiefs will meet in munich this weekend to discuss the alliance 's role in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .

the eu will launch trade talks with 16 eastern and southern african countries in mauritius this weekend .
the aim is to allow freer access to eu markets and to spur regional trade accords among african nations . the european union kicks off a second round of trade talks with 16 eastern and southern african countries on saturday .
the talks , which will gradually involve all members of the 79-nation africa , caribbean and pacific group -lrb- acp -rrb- , are intended to seal economic and partnership agreements -lrb- epa -rrb- with the african nations .
the negotiations follow a trade round already launched with nations in west and central africa in october .
epas are based on the cotonou agreement signed in benin in 2000 giving the 79 members of the acp group a special trade status within the eu .
while the eu says that under the agreement it will be prepared to further open its markets to acp products and loosen other trade barriers , acp states have indicated they will implement trade-friendly policies .

lamy arrived in tokyo thursday from seoul for a four-day visit to meet japanese leaders .
lamy met earlier today with japan 's economy , trade , and industry minister takeo hiranuma to reaffirm eu / japan globarization talks to be materialized .
-lrb- ap photo / junji kurokawa -rrb- " the epa negotiations with eastern and southern africa will follow a hands-on approach : development is the objective , trade one of the tools , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said on the eve of the trip .
eu development commissioner poul nielson also welcomed what he called the african nations ’ " important " decision to kickstart epa negotiations with the 15-nation eu bloc .
" deepening regional integration , breaking down barriers to neighbors and creating larger markets are crucial steps if these countries are to stimulate their necessary investments and productivity improvements that will drive their development , " he said .
the 16 countries slated to hold talks with the eu over the weekend are burundi , comores , djibouti , democratic republic of congo , eritrea , ethiopia , kenya , madagascar , malawi , mauritius , rwanda , seychelles , sudan , uganda , zambia and zimbabwe .
the countries , with a total population of 280 million , are all members of the acp , which includes some of the world 's poorest nations .
they form part of the common market for eastern and southern africa -lrb- comesa -rrb- .
the eu commission has underlined that the eu has already earmarked more than € 700 million -lrb- $ 880.6 million -rrb- for supporting trade-related activities and regional integration in the eastern and southern african countries .
helping africa help itself eu negotiators are emphasizing that in addition to allowing goods from developing countries almost free access to european markets , it is vital to strengthen regional integration among individual african countries .
in other words , the eu would like to help african nations help themselves .
martin dihm of the eu commission ’ s directorate-general for trade said in a press conference on thursday it was urgent that regional trade partnerships were formed before trade cooperations between africa and the eu could be hammered out .
" the most important topic is regional cooperation .
that ’ s our key phrase for further development perspectives , " he said .
" we believe that regional integration can reinforce the credibility of structures and good governance and thus become attractive for investors , " dihm added .
" and that ’ s what counts if you want to achieve development and economic growth . "
talks hoped to boost stalled wto debate the regional trade accords among the african nations are expected to be signed and sealed by 2008 .
negotiators are hoping that by then an african free trade zone between the regions will also have been established .
today trade between african states is burdened by heavy tariffs , which tend to be much higher than those involved in trade with the rest of the world .
the eu also hopes that the epas will get the doha development round -lrb- launched in 2001 in doha , qatar -rrb- back on track .
the doha round was meant to lower commercial barriers around the world from agriculture to the service industry .
talks in cancun , mexico , broke down last september mainly over farm subsidies in rich countries and on new issues such as trade and competition policy and transparency in government procurement that the eu wanted to include in the negotiations .
" epas are highly complimentary and supportive of the doha development round as they involve the same issues for the same countries , " dihm said .
" by strengthening their capacity within the epas , developing countries can also strengthen their capacity in geneva and the world trade organization , " he added .
" the first step of getting trade back on track is the development between the north-north relationships and south-south .
the second step is integration between them and us . "
eu trade commissioner pascal lamy stressed that the success of the negotiations would benefit both sides .
" if at the end of these negotiations eastern and southern africa stands as a stronger region , able to define its common interest and improve jointly the environment for business and investors , we will all have won , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder encourages more self-help for africa wrapping up his six-day tour of africa on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder inaugurated a peacekeeping training center in ghana , saying it will serve as a model for other countries .

giving in to calls from his party member to focus more on his duties as german chancellor , gerhard schröder on friday announced he will step down as leader of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . franz müntefering , who serves as the leader of the spd ’ s parliamentary group , will now also take on leadership of the party .
" leading the spd is the best job next to being pope , " müntefering said .
a special party conference is expected to confirm him as leader in late march . sitting next to müntefering , schröder announced his decision at a press conference .
he said he did n't have enough time as head of government to explain crucial reform plans to party members . " we 've decided to split the work load , " the chancellor said , adding that he will concentrate on the business of leading the country .
" you can imagine that i 'm not happy to relinquish this office , but it 's in the interest of the reform process . " several leading spd politicians had called on schröder to do just this .
party members also had critized schröder for being out of touch with ordinary party members . opposition calls move " beginning of the end " opposition leaders described the decision as a " bad day for germany , " saying that schröder 's step down as party leader would soon be followed by his departure as chancellor . " this is the beginning of the end , " said angela merkel , leader of the christian democratic union .
" he 's now chancellor by grace of müntefering .
how can he expect to lead a country if he can not even lead the members of his own party ? " guido westerwelle , the leader of the neo-liberal free democrats , called on schröder to " end the government 's lingering illness " and hold new elections . schröder hopes move will silence critics the chancellor , however , hopes the move will silence his party critics who oppose his course of painful welfare and economic reforms .
after implementing parts of schröder 's so-called " agenda 2010 " package of reforms , the spd has suffered a string of election defeats .
the party continues to wallow near all-time lows in opinion polls . after his election as chancellor in oct .
1998 , schröder became party leader on april 12 , 1999 , replacing his rival oskar lafontaine , who was closer to the party 's left wing .
lafontaine also stepped down as minister of finance at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering will now head the spd .
müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- , 64 , served as labor , health and social issues minister in germany ’ s most populous state of north-rhine-westphalia before coming to berlin , where he was federal transport minister before becoming the spd ’ s secretary-general in 1999 .
after general elections in 2002 , he took on the position of parliamentary group leader .
a supporter of schröder 's reforms , he said he will stay the course .
" i 'd like to do my part , " said müntefering on friday .
" we have to undertake certain measures now even if not everyone agrees with them . "
as a result of the leadership change , the spd 's current secretary-general , olaf scholz , announced he will step down as well .
müntefering said he already had chosen a replacement , but did n't want to reveal the name until a meeting of the party 's leadership on saturday .
no plans to replace ministers the chancellor did not reveal any plans to reshuffle his cabinet . several party leaders had asked him to do , saying that some ministers seemed to be worn out .

besides , his likely successor could help build party support for schröder 's equally unloved reforms . franz müntefering is supposed to mend things : the leader of the social democrats ’ -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group will now likely be elected party chief of germany ’ s largest governing party after chancellor gerhard schröder threw in the towel friday .
the move comes barely five years after he took the party ’ s top job as an almost natural step after his predecessor , oscar lafontaine , resigned .
schröder didn ’ t want to do it , but who else , besides the chancellor , should have taken the position ?
today , the answer is franz müntefering .
and this time around , it ’ s perhaps less an inevitable decision than the logical consequence of a party that ’ s been plagued with diminishing membership and election losses .
there ’ s never been an emotional connection between schröder and the spd party base .
that ’ s underscored by the fact that the chancellor ’ s reform policies have come up against clear resentment among the party ’ s core .
criticism can often be heard that social equality has fallen to the wayside .
in that regard , müntefering as party chief won ’ t change anything either .
however , it could slightly change the mediation problems the chancellor has identified .
proverbially loyal parliamentary group leader müntefering has , without a doubt , greater chances of influencing the party .
the spd base doesn ’ t just listen to müntefering out of duty , but sympathy as well .
that could actually lead to the ideal type of division of labor the chancellor desires in his reform process .
müntefering would lobby for acceptance of change within the party while schröder devises plans for reforms .
at the same time , politics isn ’ t something easily drafted on the drawing board .
müntefering can be as loyal to the chancellor as he wants , as party leader he will have new and stronger authority – not least vis-à-vis the chancellor .
but there are also expectations tied to that , because for the party base , just having a new face at the top isn ’ t enough in the long term .
the grumblers in the party base , especially , will also expect him to influence government policy .
and that , one would expect , would be uncomfortable for schröder .
with müntefering as parliamentary group leader and national party chief , the party now has a second heavyweight next to the chancellor . it ’ s also still an open question how much the move will impact the public , who , if you believe the polls , are increasingly turning away from the spd .
that ’ s an effect of the reform policies – policies , which should not be stopped , according to gerhard schröder .
taking this under consideration , a new party chairman alone will have little ability to change anything .
nor will it lead to better results for the spd during upcoming elections for european parliament and in a number of german states .
but müntefering could have a motivating effect on the classic social democratic constituency – only that still won ’ t be enough to create an election success for the spd .
by resigning from his post as spd leader , schröder is taking leave of an unloved office .
it really should n't be difficult for him , but he ’ s nonetheless viewed the division of the chancellery and the party chairmanship as problematic in the past .
with schröder loyalist müntefering in the position , it could function , but gerhard schröder shouldn ’ t be too sure of it , either . heinz dylong -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder to step down as party leader giving in to calls from his party member to focus more on his duties as german chancellor , gerhard schröder on friday announced he will step down as leader of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .

besides , his likely successor could help build party support for schröder 's equally unloved reforms . franz müntefering is supposed to mend things : the leader of the social democrats ’ -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group will now likely be elected party chief of germany ’ s largest governing party after chancellor gerhard schröder threw in the towel friday .
the move comes barely five years after he took the party ’ s top job as an almost natural step after his predecessor , oscar lafontaine , resigned .
schröder didn ’ t want to do it , but who else , besides the chancellor , should have taken the position ?
today , the answer is franz müntefering .
and this time around , it ’ s perhaps less an inevitable decision than the logical consequence of a party that ’ s been plagued with diminishing membership and election losses .
there ’ s never been an emotional connection between schröder and the spd party base .
that ’ s underscored by the fact that the chancellor ’ s reform policies have come up against clear resentment among the party ’ s core .
criticism can often be heard that social equality has fallen to the wayside .
in that regard , müntefering as party chief won ’ t change anything either .
however , it could slightly change the mediation problems the chancellor has identified .
proverbially loyal parliamentary group leader müntefering has , without a doubt , greater chances of influencing the party .
the spd base doesn ’ t just listen to müntefering out of duty , but sympathy as well .
that could actually lead to the ideal type of division of labor the chancellor desires in his reform process .
müntefering would lobby for acceptance of change within the party while schröder devises plans for reforms .
at the same time , politics isn ’ t something easily drafted on the drawing board .
müntefering can be as loyal to the chancellor as he wants , as party leader he will have new and stronger authority – not least vis-à-vis the chancellor .
but there are also expectations tied to that , because for the party base , just having a new face at the top isn ’ t enough in the long term .
the grumblers in the party base , especially , will also expect him to influence government policy .
and that , one would expect , would be uncomfortable for schröder .
with müntefering as parliamentary group leader and national party chief , the party now has a second heavyweight next to the chancellor . it ’ s also still an open question how much the move will impact the public , who , if you believe the polls , are increasingly turning away from the spd .
that ’ s an effect of the reform policies – policies , which should not be stopped , according to gerhard schröder .
taking this under consideration , a new party chairman alone will have little ability to change anything .
nor will it lead to better results for the spd during upcoming elections for european parliament and in a number of german states .
but müntefering could have a motivating effect on the classic social democratic constituency – only that still won ’ t be enough to create an election success for the spd .
by resigning from his post as spd leader , schröder is taking leave of an unloved office .
it really should n't be difficult for him , but he ’ s nonetheless viewed the division of the chancellery and the party chairmanship as problematic in the past .

11 terror suspect acquitted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's a free man now .
a hamburg court on thursday acquitted a moroccan charged with helping to prepare the sept .
11 attacks .
german officials have already said they plan to deport abdelghani mzoudi to his home country . for now , mzoudi is a free man and will receive financial compensation for the time spent in jail .
“ this is the day of a justice system , which refuses to be used blindly to combat terrorism , ” mzoudi ’ s defense lawer , michael rosenthal , said after the verdict . but germany ’ s prosecutor-general said thursday that he planned to appeal the verdict to the federal court of justice . “ we ’ re hoping for a second round in the mzoudi case , ” kay nehm said , adding that he expected the verdict to serve as a wake-up call to u.s. authorities , who have so far been reluctant to release information and witness testimony the prosecution considered crucial to prove their case . in case of an appeal , mzoudi is likely to remain in germany for a while , but hamburg ’ s top security official said he wants him deported as soon as possible .
mzoudi has been trying to avoid deportation , fearing that moroccan officials might extradite him to the u.s. “ there is no case more pressing than mzoudi ’ s , ” dirk nockemann , the city state ’ s interior minister , told ap news service after the verdict .
“ the man is dangerous . ” nockemann said that officials will make a decision within a few days , adding that police would monitor the 31-year-old . defense lawyer gül pinar said she didn ’ t expect nockemann to succeed with the deportation plan .
“ mr. mzoudi will be here longer than mr. nockemann will stay in office , ” pinar said .
nockemann , a member of a populist right-wing party , is likely to lose his job after hamburg elects a new parliament on feb .

he added that the acquittal was not a sign that the court had been convinced of mzoudi ’ s innocence , but rather the prosecution ’ s failure to prove their case . in december , the court had already freed him from jail , however , after an anonymous witness had apparently exonerated him .

german officials have already said they plan to deport abdelghani mzoudi to his home country . for now , mzoudi is a free man and will receive financial compensation for the time spent in jail .
“ this is the day of a justice system , which refuses to be used blindly to combat terrorism , ” mzoudi ’ s defense lawer , michael rosenthal , said after the verdict . but germany ’ s prosecutor-general said thursday that he planned to appeal the verdict to the federal court of justice . “ we ’ re hoping for a second round in the mzoudi case , ” kay nehm said , adding that he expected the verdict to serve as a wake-up call to u.s. authorities , who have so far been reluctant to release information and witness testimony the prosecution considered crucial to prove their case . in case of an appeal , mzoudi is likely to remain in germany for a while , but hamburg ’ s top security official said he wants him deported as soon as possible .
mzoudi has been trying to avoid deportation , fearing that moroccan officials might extradite him to the u.s. “ there is no case more pressing than mzoudi ’ s , ” dirk nockemann , the city state ’ s interior minister , told ap news service after the verdict .
“ the man is dangerous . ” nockemann said that officials will make a decision within a few days , adding that police would monitor the 31-year-old . defense lawyer gül pinar said she didn ’ t expect nockemann to succeed with the deportation plan .
“ mr. mzoudi will be here longer than mr. nockemann will stay in office , ” pinar said .
nockemann , a member of a populist right-wing party , is likely to lose his job after hamburg elects a new parliament on feb .

he added that the acquittal was not a sign that the court had been convinced of mzoudi ’ s innocence , but rather the prosecution ’ s failure to prove their case . in december , the court had already freed him from jail , however , after an anonymous witness had apparently exonerated him .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said he supported expanding peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , but remained cool to merging the nato deployment with the u.s. military campaign in the country . in consultations with new nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer in berlin , schröder said he backed letting the eurocorps – a joint military unit made up of soldiers from germany , france , belgium , luxembourg and spain – take over the transatlantic alliance ’ s isaf mission in afghanistan this summer . “ the defense ministers are currently examining whether , for example , the german-french brigade could play a role , and if so on what scale , ” schröder said at a joint press conference with de hoop scheffer in berlin on friday . isaf , which currently numbers around 6,000 of the predominately german and canadian soldiers , is limited to the afghan capital kabul and the northern city of kunduz .
it is nato ’ s first mission outside of the 19-member alliance ’ s traditional sphere of influence in europe and north america . after german troops last year expanded the peacekeeping operations to kunduz , other european nations are likely to commit military teams to five other provincial cities , hoping to help stabilize the country further ahead of afghan elections expected in june .
according to the associated press , italy and norway were considering deploying troops to run “ provincial reconstruction teams ” like the one in kunduz . “ we can not afford to lose in afghanistan because that would mean we lose the fight against terrorism and that we can not bring security and stability , ” de hoop scheffer said . eurocorps command in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps troops .
the eurocorps , founded in 1992 by germany and france to further military cooperation in the european union , would most likely take over isaf in august .
currently headquartered in strasbourg , it is unclear how many of its 50,000 troops would take part in an afghan mission . schröder appeared relieved that de hoop scheffer was opposed to merging isaf ’ s peacekeeping duties with the still substantial military mission led by u.s. forces in afghanistan .
he said , however , the nato allies needed to look for “ synergies ” and remain “ pragmatic ” on the matter . after meeting with schröder , de hoop scheffer continued to munich to an annual security conference .
besides discussing afghanistan , nato defense ministers are also expected to discuss what if any role the alliance may undertake in stabilizing iraq .
however , the nato chief cautioned it was too early for any decisions on a military role in the country . the united states would like nato to take more responsibility in a multinational sector now led by alliance member poland .
but for europeans countries opposed to the u.s.-led war in iraq – such as germany and france – washington will most likely first have to relinquish power in baghdad to an iraqi administration . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from america and europe on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld and german foreign minister joschka fischer famously clashed at the event , but relations between washington and berlin have since largely normalized . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato defense chiefs return to munich nato defense chiefs will meet in munich this weekend to discuss the alliance 's role in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .

u.s. senator john kerry is on course to become george w. bush ’ s democratic challenger in the 2004 presidential election .
dw-world ’ s readers share their views on kerry ’ s chances to become the white house ’ s next occupant . i live in a particularly conservative city , but even here there is much disappointment with president bush .
ohio has lost many jobs to overseas locations , and mr bush is seen as a facilitator for allowing corporations to do this to american citizens in the pursuit of profits .
there is also a growing feeling that bush does n't know what he 's doing in iraq .
if kerry is selected as the democratic candidate , bush will have a very difficult time -lrb- especially if john edwards is kerry 's running mate -rrb- . - bob schindler , ohio . for germans who hate bush the thought that john kerry can win must be appealing but it is n't likely to happen .
contrary to you people , americans prefer low taxes and the economic prosperity that results from them .
also contrary to germans , most americans believe that the best defense is a good offense and favor current foreign policy .
we remember what happened in the late 30 's when chamberlain fooled around with hitler and the grave results that followed .
we may not be as educated , cultured and sophisticated as your people but we have far more common sense .
that 's why the united states is the greatest nation ever .
god bless america .
god help our enemies . - carl mahrenholz democrats lose elections because they wo n't compromise .
kerry already said he wo n't compromise on abortion , even revolting partial birth abortions done in the ninth month .
this will cost him many votes , especially in the southeast .
massachusetts became the first to legalize gay marriage .
this is a state matter .
the federal government has no jurisdiction .
consequently , kerry does n't need to say anything .
even so , he will most likely speak out in favor of it .
bush will coast to another 4 years .
i wish things were different . - peter laurence if senator kerry becomes the democrat ’ s presidential contender he will lose the election in november .
once his record is put under a microscope , people will see that this man is not what american want for our leader .
president bush has done well leading this country ’ s fight against terrorism .
our economy is one of the best in the world and getting stronger every day .
senator kerry is too liberal for most americans .
his anti-vietnam record will work against him in all the southern states .
burning the american flag in protest during the vietnam war will really hurt him . - marc johnson sr. it will be a very close race .
however , bush will probably win due to the fact that bush will carry most of the southern states and western states . - peter yoon yes , kerry can and will beat bush .
americans want to be told the truth and make up our own minds .
many feel we do n't get the truth from the present administration .
kerry can be a strong and protective leader and not bankrupt our country in doing so . - nick capece send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : can kerry beat bush ?
european papers on thursday focused on u.s. democratic presidential front-runner john kerry ’ s success on the campaign trail .
most warned kerry had his work cut out if he was to dislodge bush from the white house .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said he supported expanding peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , but remained cool to merging the nato deployment with the u.s. military campaign in the country . in consultations with new nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer in berlin , schröder said he backed letting the eurocorps – a joint military unit made up of soldiers from germany , france , belgium , luxembourg and spain – take over the transatlantic alliance ’ s isaf mission in afghanistan this summer . “ the defense ministers are currently examining whether , for example , the german-french brigade could play a role , and if so on what scale , ” schröder said at a joint press conference with de hoop scheffer in berlin on friday . isaf , which currently numbers around 6,000 of the predominately german and canadian soldiers , is limited to the afghan capital kabul and the northern city of kunduz .
it is nato ’ s first mission outside of the 19-member alliance ’ s traditional sphere of influence in europe and north america . after german troops last year expanded the peacekeeping operations to kunduz , other european nations are likely to commit military teams to five other provincial cities , hoping to help stabilize the country further ahead of afghan elections expected in june .
according to the associated press , italy and norway were considering deploying troops to run “ provincial reconstruction teams ” like the one in kunduz . “ we can not afford to lose in afghanistan because that would mean we lose the fight against terrorism and that we can not bring security and stability , ” de hoop scheffer said . eurocorps command in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps troops .
the eurocorps , founded in 1992 by germany and france to further military cooperation in the european union , would most likely take over isaf in august .
currently headquartered in strasbourg , it is unclear how many of its 50,000 troops would take part in an afghan mission . schröder appeared relieved that de hoop scheffer was opposed to merging isaf ’ s peacekeeping duties with the still substantial military mission led by u.s. forces in afghanistan .
he said , however , the nato allies needed to look for “ synergies ” and remain “ pragmatic ” on the matter . after meeting with schröder , de hoop scheffer continued to munich to an annual security conference .
besides discussing afghanistan , nato defense ministers are also expected to discuss what if any role the alliance may undertake in stabilizing iraq .
however , the nato chief cautioned it was too early for any decisions on a military role in the country . the united states would like nato to take more responsibility in a multinational sector now led by alliance member poland .
but for europeans countries opposed to the u.s.-led war in iraq – such as germany and france – washington will most likely first have to relinquish power in baghdad to an iraqi administration . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from america and europe on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld and german foreign minister joschka fischer famously clashed at the event , but relations between washington and berlin have since largely normalized . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato defense chiefs return to munich nato defense chiefs will meet in munich this weekend to discuss the alliance 's role in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said he supported expanding peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , but remained cool to merging the nato deployment with the u.s. military campaign in the country . in consultations with new nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer in berlin , schröder said he backed letting the eurocorps – a joint military unit made up of soldiers from germany , france , belgium , luxembourg and spain – take over the transatlantic alliance ’ s isaf mission in afghanistan this summer . “ the defense ministers are currently examining whether , for example , the german-french brigade could play a role , and if so on what scale , ” schröder said at a joint press conference with de hoop scheffer in berlin on friday . isaf , which currently numbers around 6,000 of the predominately german and canadian soldiers , is limited to the afghan capital kabul and the northern city of kunduz .
it is nato ’ s first mission outside of the 19-member alliance ’ s traditional sphere of influence in europe and north america . after german troops last year expanded the peacekeeping operations to kunduz , other european nations are likely to commit military teams to five other provincial cities , hoping to help stabilize the country further ahead of afghan elections expected in june .
according to the associated press , italy and norway were considering deploying troops to run “ provincial reconstruction teams ” like the one in kunduz . “ we can not afford to lose in afghanistan because that would mean we lose the fight against terrorism and that we can not bring security and stability , ” de hoop scheffer said . eurocorps command in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps troops .
the eurocorps , founded in 1992 by germany and france to further military cooperation in the european union , would most likely take over isaf in august .
currently headquartered in strasbourg , it is unclear how many of its 50,000 troops would take part in an afghan mission . schröder appeared relieved that de hoop scheffer was opposed to merging isaf ’ s peacekeeping duties with the still substantial military mission led by u.s. forces in afghanistan .
he said , however , the nato allies needed to look for “ synergies ” and remain “ pragmatic ” on the matter . after meeting with schröder , de hoop scheffer continued to munich to an annual security conference .
besides discussing afghanistan , nato defense ministers are also expected to discuss what if any role the alliance may undertake in stabilizing iraq .
however , the nato chief cautioned it was too early for any decisions on a military role in the country . the united states would like nato to take more responsibility in a multinational sector now led by alliance member poland .
but for europeans countries opposed to the u.s.-led war in iraq – such as germany and france – washington will most likely first have to relinquish power in baghdad to an iraqi administration . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from america and europe on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.02.2004 schröder leaves an unloved post großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by quitting as the head of the social democratic party on friday , gerhard schröder left an office he hardly loved .
besides , his likely successor could help build party support for schröder 's equally unloved reforms . franz müntefering is supposed to mend things : the leader of the social democrats ’ -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary group will now likely be elected party chief of germany ’ s largest governing party after chancellor gerhard schröder threw in the towel friday .
the move comes barely five years after he took the party ’ s top job as an almost natural step after his predecessor , oscar lafontaine , resigned .
schröder didn ’ t want to do it , but who else , besides the chancellor , should have taken the position ?
today , the answer is franz müntefering .
and this time around , it ’ s perhaps less an inevitable decision than the logical consequence of a party that ’ s been plagued with diminishing membership and election losses .
there ’ s never been an emotional connection between schröder and the spd party base .
that ’ s underscored by the fact that the chancellor ’ s reform policies have come up against clear resentment among the party ’ s core .
criticism can often be heard that social equality has fallen to the wayside .
in that regard , müntefering as party chief won ’ t change anything either .
however , it could slightly change the mediation problems the chancellor has identified .
proverbially loyal parliamentary group leader müntefering has , without a doubt , greater chances of influencing the party .
the spd base doesn ’ t just listen to müntefering out of duty , but sympathy as well .
that could actually lead to the ideal type of division of labor the chancellor desires in his reform process .
müntefering would lobby for acceptance of change within the party while schröder devises plans for reforms .
at the same time , politics isn ’ t something easily drafted on the drawing board .
müntefering can be as loyal to the chancellor as he wants , as party leader he will have new and stronger authority – not least vis-à-vis the chancellor .
but there are also expectations tied to that , because for the party base , just having a new face at the top isn ’ t enough in the long term .
the grumblers in the party base , especially , will also expect him to influence government policy .
and that , one would expect , would be uncomfortable for schröder .
with müntefering as parliamentary group leader and national party chief , the party now has a second heavyweight next to the chancellor . it ’ s also still an open question how much the move will impact the public , who , if you believe the polls , are increasingly turning away from the spd .
that ’ s an effect of the reform policies – policies , which should not be stopped , according to gerhard schröder .
taking this under consideration , a new party chairman alone will have little ability to change anything .
nor will it lead to better results for the spd during upcoming elections for european parliament and in a number of german states .
but müntefering could have a motivating effect on the classic social democratic constituency – only that still won ’ t be enough to create an election success for the spd .
by resigning from his post as spd leader , schröder is taking leave of an unloved office .
it really should n't be difficult for him , but he ’ s nonetheless viewed the division of the chancellery and the party chairmanship as problematic in the past .
with schröder loyalist müntefering in the position , it could function , but gerhard schröder shouldn ’ t be too sure of it , either . heinz dylong -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder to step down as party leader giving in to calls from his party member to focus more on his duties as german chancellor , gerhard schröder on friday announced he will step down as leader of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said he supported expanding peacekeeping operations in afghanistan , but remained cool to merging the nato deployment with the u.s. military campaign in the country . in consultations with new nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer in berlin , schröder said he backed letting the eurocorps – a joint military unit made up of soldiers from germany , france , belgium , luxembourg and spain – take over the transatlantic alliance ’ s isaf mission in afghanistan this summer . “ the defense ministers are currently examining whether , for example , the german-french brigade could play a role , and if so on what scale , ” schröder said at a joint press conference with de hoop scheffer in berlin on friday . isaf , which currently numbers around 6,000 of the predominately german and canadian soldiers , is limited to the afghan capital kabul and the northern city of kunduz .
it is nato ’ s first mission outside of the 19-member alliance ’ s traditional sphere of influence in europe and north america . after german troops last year expanded the peacekeeping operations to kunduz , other european nations are likely to commit military teams to five other provincial cities , hoping to help stabilize the country further ahead of afghan elections expected in june .
according to the associated press , italy and norway were considering deploying troops to run “ provincial reconstruction teams ” like the one in kunduz . “ we can not afford to lose in afghanistan because that would mean we lose the fight against terrorism and that we can not bring security and stability , ” de hoop scheffer said . eurocorps command in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps troops .
the eurocorps , founded in 1992 by germany and france to further military cooperation in the european union , would most likely take over isaf in august .
currently headquartered in strasbourg , it is unclear how many of its 50,000 troops would take part in an afghan mission . schröder appeared relieved that de hoop scheffer was opposed to merging isaf ’ s peacekeeping duties with the still substantial military mission led by u.s. forces in afghanistan .
he said , however , the nato allies needed to look for “ synergies ” and remain “ pragmatic ” on the matter . after meeting with schröder , de hoop scheffer continued to munich to an annual security conference .
besides discussing afghanistan , nato defense ministers are also expected to discuss what if any role the alliance may undertake in stabilizing iraq .
however , the nato chief cautioned it was too early for any decisions on a military role in the country . the united states would like nato to take more responsibility in a multinational sector now led by alliance member poland .
but for europeans countries opposed to the u.s.-led war in iraq – such as germany and france – washington will most likely first have to relinquish power in baghdad to an iraqi administration . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from america and europe on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld and german foreign minister joschka fischer famously clashed at the event , but relations between washington and berlin have since largely normalized . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato defense chiefs return to munich nato defense chiefs will meet in munich this weekend to discuss the alliance 's role in iraq , afghanistan and elsewhere .

according to the associated press , italy and norway were considering deploying troops to run “ provincial reconstruction teams ” like the one in kunduz . “ we can not afford to lose in afghanistan because that would mean we lose the fight against terrorism and that we can not bring security and stability , ” de hoop scheffer said . eurocorps command in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurocorps troops .
the eurocorps , founded in 1992 by germany and france to further military cooperation in the european union , would most likely take over isaf in august .
currently headquartered in strasbourg , it is unclear how many of its 50,000 troops would take part in an afghan mission . schröder appeared relieved that de hoop scheffer was opposed to merging isaf ’ s peacekeeping duties with the still substantial military mission led by u.s. forces in afghanistan .
he said , however , the nato allies needed to look for “ synergies ” and remain “ pragmatic ” on the matter . after meeting with schröder , de hoop scheffer continued to munich to an annual security conference .
besides discussing afghanistan , nato defense ministers are also expected to discuss what if any role the alliance may undertake in stabilizing iraq .
however , the nato chief cautioned it was too early for any decisions on a military role in the country . the united states would like nato to take more responsibility in a multinational sector now led by alliance member poland .
but for europeans countries opposed to the u.s.-led war in iraq – such as germany and france – washington will most likely first have to relinquish power in baghdad to an iraqi administration . last year 's munich conference was a highly tense affair with officials from america and europe on edge as a un security council vote on a new iraq resolution loomed ominously near .

the negotiations follow a trade round already launched with nations in west and central africa in october .
epas are based on the cotonou agreement signed in benin in 2000 giving the 79 members of the acp group a special trade status within the eu .
while the eu says that under the agreement it will be prepared to further open its markets to acp products and loosen other trade barriers , acp states have indicated they will implement trade-friendly policies .

eu development commissioner poul nielson also welcomed what he called the african nations ’ " important " decision to kickstart epa negotiations with the 15-nation eu bloc .
" deepening regional integration , breaking down barriers to neighbors and creating larger markets are crucial steps if these countries are to stimulate their necessary investments and productivity improvements that will drive their development , " he said .
the 16 countries slated to hold talks with the eu over the weekend are burundi , comores , djibouti , democratic republic of congo , eritrea , ethiopia , kenya , madagascar , malawi , mauritius , rwanda , seychelles , sudan , uganda , zambia and zimbabwe .
the countries , with a total population of 280 million , are all members of the acp , which includes some of the world 's poorest nations .
they form part of the common market for eastern and southern africa -lrb- comesa -rrb- .
the eu commission has underlined that the eu has already earmarked more than € 700 million -lrb- $ 880.6 million -rrb- for supporting trade-related activities and regional integration in the eastern and southern african countries .

martin dihm of the eu commission ’ s directorate-general for trade said in a press conference on thursday it was urgent that regional trade partnerships were formed before trade cooperations between africa and the eu could be hammered out .
" the most important topic is regional cooperation .
that ’ s our key phrase for further development perspectives , " he said .
" we believe that regional integration can reinforce the credibility of structures and good governance and thus become attractive for investors , " dihm added .

the eu also hopes that the epas will get the doha development round -lrb- launched in 2001 in doha , qatar -rrb- back on track .
the doha round was meant to lower commercial barriers around the world from agriculture to the service industry .
talks in cancun , mexico , broke down last september mainly over farm subsidies in rich countries and on new issues such as trade and competition policy and transparency in government procurement that the eu wanted to include in the negotiations .
" epas are highly complimentary and supportive of the doha development round as they involve the same issues for the same countries , " dihm said .
" by strengthening their capacity within the epas , developing countries can also strengthen their capacity in geneva and the world trade organization , " he added .
" the first step of getting trade back on track is the development between the north-north relationships and south-south .
the second step is integration between them and us . "
eu trade commissioner pascal lamy stressed that the success of the negotiations would benefit both sides .

" deepening regional integration , breaking down barriers to neighbors and creating larger markets are crucial steps if these countries are to stimulate their necessary investments and productivity improvements that will drive their development , " he said .
the 16 countries slated to hold talks with the eu over the weekend are burundi , comores , djibouti , democratic republic of congo , eritrea , ethiopia , kenya , madagascar , malawi , mauritius , rwanda , seychelles , sudan , uganda , zambia and zimbabwe .
the countries , with a total population of 280 million , are all members of the acp , which includes some of the world 's poorest nations .
they form part of the common market for eastern and southern africa -lrb- comesa -rrb- .
the eu commission has underlined that the eu has already earmarked more than € 700 million -lrb- $ 880.6 million -rrb- for supporting trade-related activities and regional integration in the eastern and southern african countries .
helping africa help itself eu negotiators are emphasizing that in addition to allowing goods from developing countries almost free access to european markets , it is vital to strengthen regional integration among individual african countries .
in other words , the eu would like to help african nations help themselves .
martin dihm of the eu commission ’ s directorate-general for trade said in a press conference on thursday it was urgent that regional trade partnerships were formed before trade cooperations between africa and the eu could be hammered out .
" the most important topic is regional cooperation .
that ’ s our key phrase for further development perspectives , " he said .
" we believe that regional integration can reinforce the credibility of structures and good governance and thus become attractive for investors , " dihm added .
" and that ’ s what counts if you want to achieve development and economic growth . "
talks hoped to boost stalled wto debate the regional trade accords among the african nations are expected to be signed and sealed by 2008 .
negotiators are hoping that by then an african free trade zone between the regions will also have been established .
today trade between african states is burdened by heavy tariffs , which tend to be much higher than those involved in trade with the rest of the world .
the eu also hopes that the epas will get the doha development round -lrb- launched in 2001 in doha , qatar -rrb- back on track .
the doha round was meant to lower commercial barriers around the world from agriculture to the service industry .
talks in cancun , mexico , broke down last september mainly over farm subsidies in rich countries and on new issues such as trade and competition policy and transparency in government procurement that the eu wanted to include in the negotiations .
" epas are highly complimentary and supportive of the doha development round as they involve the same issues for the same countries , " dihm said .
" by strengthening their capacity within the epas , developing countries can also strengthen their capacity in geneva and the world trade organization , " he added .
" the first step of getting trade back on track is the development between the north-north relationships and south-south .

eu development commissioner poul nielson also welcomed what he called the african nations ’ " important " decision to kickstart epa negotiations with the 15-nation eu bloc .
" deepening regional integration , breaking down barriers to neighbors and creating larger markets are crucial steps if these countries are to stimulate their necessary investments and productivity improvements that will drive their development , " he said .
the 16 countries slated to hold talks with the eu over the weekend are burundi , comores , djibouti , democratic republic of congo , eritrea , ethiopia , kenya , madagascar , malawi , mauritius , rwanda , seychelles , sudan , uganda , zambia and zimbabwe .
the countries , with a total population of 280 million , are all members of the acp , which includes some of the world 's poorest nations .

the eu commission has underlined that the eu has already earmarked more than € 700 million -lrb- $ 880.6 million -rrb- for supporting trade-related activities and regional integration in the eastern and southern african countries .
helping africa help itself eu negotiators are emphasizing that in addition to allowing goods from developing countries almost free access to european markets , it is vital to strengthen regional integration among individual african countries .
in other words , the eu would like to help african nations help themselves .
martin dihm of the eu commission ’ s directorate-general for trade said in a press conference on thursday it was urgent that regional trade partnerships were formed before trade cooperations between africa and the eu could be hammered out .
" the most important topic is regional cooperation .
that ’ s our key phrase for further development perspectives , " he said .
" we believe that regional integration can reinforce the credibility of structures and good governance and thus become attractive for investors , " dihm added .
" and that ’ s what counts if you want to achieve development and economic growth . "
talks hoped to boost stalled wto debate the regional trade accords among the african nations are expected to be signed and sealed by 2008 .
negotiators are hoping that by then an african free trade zone between the regions will also have been established .
today trade between african states is burdened by heavy tariffs , which tend to be much higher than those involved in trade with the rest of the world .
the eu also hopes that the epas will get the doha development round -lrb- launched in 2001 in doha , qatar -rrb- back on track .
the doha round was meant to lower commercial barriers around the world from agriculture to the service industry .
talks in cancun , mexico , broke down last september mainly over farm subsidies in rich countries and on new issues such as trade and competition policy and transparency in government procurement that the eu wanted to include in the negotiations .
" epas are highly complimentary and supportive of the doha development round as they involve the same issues for the same countries , " dihm said .
" by strengthening their capacity within the epas , developing countries can also strengthen their capacity in geneva and the world trade organization , " he added .
" the first step of getting trade back on track is the development between the north-north relationships and south-south .
the second step is integration between them and us . "

a hamburg court on thursday acquitted a moroccan charged with helping to prepare the sept .

german officials have already said they plan to deport abdelghani mzoudi to his home country . for now , mzoudi is a free man and will receive financial compensation for the time spent in jail .
“ this is the day of a justice system , which refuses to be used blindly to combat terrorism , ” mzoudi ’ s defense lawer , michael rosenthal , said after the verdict . but germany ’ s prosecutor-general said thursday that he planned to appeal the verdict to the federal court of justice . “ we ’ re hoping for a second round in the mzoudi case , ” kay nehm said , adding that he expected the verdict to serve as a wake-up call to u.s. authorities , who have so far been reluctant to release information and witness testimony the prosecution considered crucial to prove their case . in case of an appeal , mzoudi is likely to remain in germany for a while , but hamburg ’ s top security official said he wants him deported as soon as possible .
mzoudi has been trying to avoid deportation , fearing that moroccan officials might extradite him to the u.s. “ there is no case more pressing than mzoudi ’ s , ” dirk nockemann , the city state ’ s interior minister , told ap news service after the verdict .
“ the man is dangerous . ” nockemann said that officials will make a decision within a few days , adding that police would monitor the 31-year-old . defense lawyer gül pinar said she didn ’ t expect nockemann to succeed with the deportation plan .
“ mr. mzoudi will be here longer than mr. nockemann will stay in office , ” pinar said .
nockemann , a member of a populist right-wing party , is likely to lose his job after hamburg elects a new parliament on feb .
29 . acquittal for want of evidence mzoudi had been accused of abetting murder in more than 3,000 cases and belonging to terrorist organization al qaeda , but judges ruled that there was not enough evidence to confirm this . “ mr. mzoudi , you are acquitted , but this is no reason to celebrate , ” presiding judge klaus rühle said to mzoudi , who showed no emotions as the verdict was announced .
he added that the acquittal was not a sign that the court had been convinced of mzoudi ’ s innocence , but rather the prosecution ’ s failure to prove their case . in december , the court had already freed him from jail , however , after an anonymous witness had apparently exonerated him .

the move comes barely five years after he took the party ’ s top job as an almost natural step after his predecessor , oscar lafontaine , resigned .
schröder didn ’ t want to do it , but who else , besides the chancellor , should have taken the position ?

the grumblers in the party base , especially , will also expect him to influence government policy .

the move comes barely five years after he took the party ’ s top job as an almost natural step after his predecessor , oscar lafontaine , resigned .
schröder didn ’ t want to do it , but who else , besides the chancellor , should have taken the position ?
today , the answer is franz müntefering .
and this time around , it ’ s perhaps less an inevitable decision than the logical consequence of a party that ’ s been plagued with diminishing membership and election losses .
there ’ s never been an emotional connection between schröder and the spd party base .
that ’ s underscored by the fact that the chancellor ’ s reform policies have come up against clear resentment among the party ’ s core .
criticism can often be heard that social equality has fallen to the wayside .
in that regard , müntefering as party chief won ’ t change anything either .
however , it could slightly change the mediation problems the chancellor has identified .
proverbially loyal parliamentary group leader müntefering has , without a doubt , greater chances of influencing the party .
the spd base doesn ’ t just listen to müntefering out of duty , but sympathy as well .
that could actually lead to the ideal type of division of labor the chancellor desires in his reform process .
müntefering would lobby for acceptance of change within the party while schröder devises plans for reforms .
at the same time , politics isn ’ t something easily drafted on the drawing board .
müntefering can be as loyal to the chancellor as he wants , as party leader he will have new and stronger authority – not least vis-à-vis the chancellor .
but there are also expectations tied to that , because for the party base , just having a new face at the top isn ’ t enough in the long term .
the grumblers in the party base , especially , will also expect him to influence government policy .
and that , one would expect , would be uncomfortable for schröder .
with müntefering as parliamentary group leader and national party chief , the party now has a second heavyweight next to the chancellor . it ’ s also still an open question how much the move will impact the public , who , if you believe the polls , are increasingly turning away from the spd .
that ’ s an effect of the reform policies – policies , which should not be stopped , according to gerhard schröder .
taking this under consideration , a new party chairman alone will have little ability to change anything .

there 'll be a set price list for a range of procedures , instead of hospitals charging what they want .
ministers say this will expand patient choice , but some critics are worried that hospitals will be forced to make cuts .
what will it all mean for patients - and why are some hospitals paying over the odds ?
we tried to find out how the new system will work .
we spoke to sally gorham , chief executive of the waltham forest primary care trust and paul roberts , chief executive of plymouth hospitals nhs trust .
we talked to dr edwin borman , of the british medical association .
further details from bbc news online the aim is to ensure the nhs gets better value for money by stamping out variations in the cost of operations .
ministers say the " fundamental reform " will make the nhs more efficient but critics say it could cause some trusts to cut services .
it comes as the government confirms that treating nhs patients in private hospitals is proving expensive .
the nhs paid private hospitals £ 100m last year to treat 60,000 patients as part of efforts to cut waiting times .
what hospitals will be paid ?
heart bypass £ 8,080 hip replacement £ 5,568 cataract operation £ 786 varicose vein procedure £ 1,063 major breast surgery £ 2,386 figures are for planned operations source : dept. of health however , the operations cost 43 % more than if they had been done on the nhs .
the new nhs tariff sets a fixed price for 48 different procedures , ranging from cataract surgery to a heart bypass operation .
the tariffs will be phased in over the next four years .
however , foundation trusts will be able to adopt them from april .
there are currently huge variations in the amount of money hospitals are paid for carrying out certain operations .
the price of a heart bypass operation ranges from £ 2,540 to £ 6,911 .
the cost of cataract surgery varies between £ 763 and £ 1,164 .
more efficient ministers say a fixed fee will force many hospitals to become more efficient .
hospitals that fail to reduce their costs will face losing millions of pounds a year .
those that succeed in providing the operations below the tariff price will be able to keep the profit .
that money could be spent on new equipment .
ministers hope the system will also drive up quality and improve choice for patients . "
given that the nhs can not afford to lose staff , how will these savings be made ? "
british medical association health minister john hutton said : " by fixing a national tariff , we can minimise bureaucracy and unnecessary transaction costs associated with local price negotiation , allowing trusts and pcts to focus on quality and speed of access .
" and secondly , it will allow patients to exercise greater choice over when and where they are treated . "
however , the british medical association expressed concerns .
" the tariff system could cause the nhs problems , " said its chairman james johnson .
" some tariffs will be far lower than the real costs of providing care , putting undue pressure on hospitals to make cuts .
" given that the nhs can not afford to lose staff , how will these savings be made ? "
mr hutton defended the government 's use of private hospitals to cut nhs waiting lists despite the relatively high cost .
" our use of the private sector allowed nearly 60,000 nhs patients to have their operation more quickly than would otherwise have been possible .
that was absolutely the right thing to do . "
however , trade union unison condemned the policy .
karen jennings , its head of health , said the private sector was " ripping off the nhs ... at the expense of patient care " .

mr hutton defended the government 's use of private hospitals to cut nhs waiting lists despite the relatively high cost .

that was absolutely the right thing to do . "
however , trade union unison condemned the policy .
karen jennings , its head of health , said the private sector was " ripping off the nhs ... at the expense of patient care " .

no-one told security officials what to say or how to say it , he said , adding : " we always call it as we see it . "
he said the intelligence services had never said saddam hussein was an " imminent threat " but stood by warnings about the future danger he could pose .
the search had to go on in iraq for the weapons of mass destruction that us intelligence believed existed , he said .
mr tenet said he supported the establishment of the president 's commission into intelligence-gathering , which is being touted as a broad review but is seen in many quarters as an inquiry into the apparent failures to identify saddam hussein 's arsenal accurately .
the review comes after former us chief weapons inspector , david kay , told congress they were unlikely to find chemical and biological weapons stockpiles in iraq and backed an inquiry into alleged failures of the intelligence agencies .
mr kay has called for an independent commission to examine whether politicians misused intelligence data in making the case for war .
the bbc 's adam brookes in washington said mr tenet 's address amounted to him drawing the battle lines ahead of the investigation .
but us defence secretary donald rumsfeld said he did not believe there was a discrepancy between the views of mr tenet and mr kay .
playing down any differences that might exist , he said : " the question is : is the glass half full or half empty ? " , a reference to the fact that both men agree the weapons hunt is not over , although mr kay believes it is 85 % complete .
the bbc 's nick childs said mr rumsfeld 's apparent defiance contrasts to some of his colleagues who seem to have modified their views recently .
unanswerable questions mr tenet told an audience at georgetown university that he recognised that the key question was had the central intelligence agency and others got it right or wrong when they said saddam hussein had or was seeking weapons of mass destruction in the key national intelligence estimate of october 2002 .
but he said that question could not be answered .
" in the intelligence business , you are almost never completely right or completely wrong , " he said .

mr tenet said it was important that analysts be allowed to offer their judgements without fear of political retribution .
he rejected any suggestion that the iraq intelligence had been packaged or presented in any way to push any particular policy , though he said officials were examining whether policymakers were made sufficiently aware of gaps in knowledge .
mr tenet said president bush never asked for anything but honest opinions in their daily meetings .
" he has told me firmly and directly that he 's wanted -lsb- the intelligence -rsb- straight and he 's wanted it honest , and he 's never wanted the facts shaded . "
provisional judgements he urged people and politicians to allow more time for the search for evidence of banned weapons in iraq and challenged the verdict of mr kay that most of the work had been done .
but mr tenet said he was able to offer some " provisional bottom lines " on key areas : missiles : " we were generally on target . "
unmanned aerial vehicles : " we detected development of prohibited and undeclared unmanned aerial vehicles , but the jury is still out on whether iraq intended to use its newer , smaller unmanned aerial vehicle to deliver biological weapons . "
nuclear weapons : " saddam did not have a nuclear weapon ; he still wanted one ; and iraq intended to reconstitute a nuclear programme at some point .

biological weapons : " iraq intended to develop biological weapons . "
chemical weapons : " saddam had the intent and capability to quickly convert civilian industry to chemical weapons production .

mr tenet also used his speech to mention cia successes elsewhere in the world where he said us spies had been heavily involved in the capture of alleged terrorist masterminds connected to the 11 september 2001 and bali attacks .

the jury 's recommendations were not made public at the hearing into the death of stuart cunningham-jones , 12 , last month .
he was killed and more than 30 others were injured in december 2002 after their double-decker bus careered off the road and hit a tree near the village of ystradowen in the vale of glamorgan .
a verdict of accidental death was recorded at an inquest in cardiff after the jury heard a boy had grabbed the steering wheel .
the jury 's comments have since been sent to the vale of glamorgan council by the coroner .
stuart 's parents , joanna and david , said they were " elated " when they heard what the jury had said .
" this is common sense and the fact that the jury could see that gives you a lot more determination to carry on , " said mrs cunningham-jones . "
we 've lost our son yet no one 's being held responsible and that 's very difficult " joanna cunningham-jones mr cunningham-jones described it as a vote of confidence .
" the 10 people that made up that jury were parents themselves and they understand the risks the children are going through being on those buses .
" now we 'll be calling on the government to change the legislation , " he added .
a consultation group has now been set up by the vale of glamorgan council to look at the issue of school transport .
it will be chaired by rob quick , the council 's director of environmental and economic regeneration .
he said the supervision of children needed to be looked at .
" at the moment the use of supervisors is actually quite rare throughout wales and if this was to be implemented it would have major implications for all councils , " he said .
" the group has not been set up to have a further police investigation or a further inquest into this particular tragedy . "
in a week long hearing , it was said that , during the journey from cowbridge comprehensive school to talbot green , a group of boys had continually tried to distract the driver .
seconds before the bus left the road near the village of ystradowen , one of the four grabbed the steering wheel .
the jury was told that rowdy behaviour had been a serious problem on the bus in the weeks leading up to the crash .
in a letter to the vale of glamorgan council , coroner dr lawrence addicott said the jury had made seven recommendations .
they included that all school buses should have trained and qualified escorts , and that a liaison officer should be appointed by the local authority to monitor behaviour on buses carrying schoolchildren .
the jury also said the use of a controversial rule allowing three children under fourteen to sit on a seat designed for two adults should be reviewed .
mrs cunningham-jones said there was " a lot of anger there " because of what had happened to stuart . "
it 's difficult to put into words .
we 've lost our son yet no one 's being held responsible and that 's very difficult .
" i 'm bitter and angry but you have to keep that under control really . "
mr cunningham-jones said there was a " sense of a lack of justice . "

the jury 's recommendations were not made public at the hearing into the death of stuart cunningham-jones , 12 , last month .
he was killed and more than 30 others were injured in december 2002 after their double-decker bus careered off the road and hit a tree near the village of ystradowen in the vale of glamorgan .
a verdict of accidental death was recorded at an inquest in cardiff after the jury heard a boy had grabbed the steering wheel .
the jury 's comments have since been sent to the vale of glamorgan council by the coroner .
stuart 's parents , joanna and david , said they were " elated " when they heard what the jury had said .
" this is common sense and the fact that the jury could see that gives you a lot more determination to carry on , " said mrs cunningham-jones .
we 've lost our son yet no one 's being held responsible and that 's very difficult joanna cunningham-jones mr cunningham-jones described it as a vote of confidence .
" the 10 people that made up that jury were parents themselves and they understand the risks the children are going through being on those buses .

a consultation group has now been set up by the vale of glamorgan council to look at the issue of school transport .
it will be chaired by rob quick , the council 's director of environmental and economic regeneration .
he said the supervision of children needed to be looked at .
" at the moment the use of supervisors is actually quite rare throughout wales and if this was to be implemented it would have major implications for all councils , " he said .
" the group has not been set up to have a further police investigation or a further inquest into this particular tragedy . "
in a week long hearing , it was said that , during the journey from cowbridge comprehensive school to talbot green , a group of boys had continually tried to distract the driver .
stuart 's parents have welcomed the recommendations seconds before the bus left the road near the village of ystradowen , one of the four grabbed the steering wheel .
the jury was told that rowdy behaviour had been a serious problem on the bus in the weeks leading up to the crash .
in a letter to the vale of glamorgan council , coroner dr lawrence addicott said the jury had made seven recommendations .
they included that all school buses should have trained and qualified escorts , and that a liaison officer should be appointed by the local authority to monitor behaviour on buses carrying schoolchildren .
the jury also said the use of a controversial rule allowing three children under fourteen to sit on a seat designed for two adults should be reviewed .
mrs cunningham-jones said there was " a lot of anger there " because of what had happened to stuart . "

hundreds of drivers refused to work in the town on saturday - one of the busiest nights of the week - leaving thousands of revellers stranded without transport home .
the private cab drivers launched their protest after the local council ordered them to display stickers on their cars showing they were driving registered taxis .
but the drivers complained that the signs would damage the paintwork on their cars .
they also claimed their privacy would be affected because they also used the cars outside working hours .
there are more than 460 private hire drivers in wrexham .
solidarity taxi offices in the town centre closed from 2230 gmt last saturday in a show of solidarity against the council rulings .
the council has argued that the public had to be protected against unlicensed drivers - and against potentially dangerous men who might pose as cabbies .
magnetic or adhesive signs were previously used , but they could be dislodged and lost .
the stickers would be phased in over six months , but anyone without them afterwards could be fined .
andy lewis , chief public protection officer for wrexham council , said taxi drivers had a job to do , but the public had to be protected .

seven aircrew from culdrose in cornwall were killed last march when two sea king surveillance helicopters collided over the sea in the gulf just before the gulf war began .
north cornwall mps paul tyler and andrew george say that in a commons answer last week , the government implied that pilot error was to blame for the collision .
but mr caplin , who has been visiting armed forces bases in the west country , denied pre-empting an inquiry into the crash .
he said : " that is not the suggestion and no final answer has been reached .
" it will be right and proper that when there is a conclusion , the first people to know about it should be the families . "
mr tyler and mr george have raised questions about the lack of night goggles available to the crew of the sea kings .
mr george , who will be meeting mr caplin on friday , said : " i am seeking clear answers on equipment deficiency or whether it was human error .

the victims were packed onto a canal bridge in a park 65 km -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- from beijing to watch a lantern and firework display to end the new year .
hundreds of people were reportedly involved in the accident .
witnesses described harrowing scenes of parents searching for their children in sub-zero temperatures .

" i had this feeling that it was dangerous on the bridge so i chose to walk over the ice .

he said it was important for people in st sampson to realise the scale of the building .
drilling boreholes he has now called for a meeting to be held by developers to show exactly what they intend .
while he accepted the need for a plant to replace the landfill site at mont cuet , deputy rihoy said there were better ways of doing it other than simply providing what he described as a " rectangular box " .
the firm developing the plant , lurgi uk limited , has already started drilling boreholes into the ground that will support the facility at longue hougue .
the holes have been commissioned to test the firmness of the ground and to determine the way in which the foundations should be designed and positioned .
the land on which the plant is being built has been reclaimed from the sea relatively recently and sea water enters it at high tide .
however , lurgi uk does not see this as a serious problem .
it is hoped to get the plant finished by late 2006 .

the holes have been commissioned to test the firmness of the ground and to determine the way in which the foundations should be designed and positioned .
the land on which the plant is being built has been reclaimed from the sea relatively recently and sea water enters it at high tide .
however , lurgi uk does not see this as a serious problem .
it is hoped to get the plant finished by late 2006 .

can i move these to other providers without losing their tax- free status , the interest they have earned , and can i still invest in another ?
jessie murray colin jackson , managing director of independent financial advisers baronworth : subject to any restrictions imposed by your existing product providers , you should be able to transfer your mini-cash isas to other providers with the minimum of fuss .
generally speaking , all you need to do is approach the new provider , complete the documentation and let them get on with dealing with the transfer .

do you have a question ?
send your questions to our experts if you go for a variable rate mini-cash isa you should bear in mind that some product providers have been know to offer a very attractive rate to tempt new customers but then reduce the return at a later date .
one way to get round this possible problem is to go for a fixed rate mini-cash isa .
each person is allowed to invest into one mini-cash isa in each tax year .
if you have not taken one out for this tax year and wish to do so you should act quickly as you will have to do so before the end of the tax year -lrb- 5 april 2004 -rrb- .
bear in mind the provider will need some time to process the paperwork .
also , take into account the possibility of human error .
you could make a mistake when filling in the application form which means that it could be returned to you for amendment .
always give enough time before the end of the tax year to cover these contingencies .
if you leave it to the last minute you may be too late .
whilst i would encourage anybody to take advantage of any tax concessions , in reality , the amount of tax that you will save is small .
this is due to the relatively small amount that you can invest into a mini-cash isa coupled with , currently , low rates of interest .
unless you need the cash , on no account should you cash in your isas as you will lose the tax break forever .
if you make a transfer , the tax-free status will continue .

rascal , whose real name is dylan mills , saw his career take off in the uk last year when his debut album , boy in da corner , won him the mercury music award .
he told bbc world service 's the music biz programme that he felt the us would embrace his music because , unlike many other artists who try to crack america , his work was not going to be " watered down . "
" that gap is definitely open , " he said .
" i think it 'll work over there .
this is a worldwide thing .
i 'm in it for the long run .
i 'm not playing . "
experimental follow-up rascal , who is currently working on his follow-up album to boy in da corner , said that he had been strongly influenced by us rap music .
" the beauty of american stuff is because it was real , and it was reflective of what they are , because they were talking how they talk , and were n't changing anything - they were being themselves , " he said .
i 'm writing about whatever comes to mind dizzee rascal " i 've done that to the max on my album ...
it 's going to go over in its purest form . "
rascal said that he had been very happy with the " achievement " of the mercury award , but that he was now " moving on . "
he also revealed that he was feeling pressure after notching up such a successful debut album .
" there 's definitely pressure there , because there 's this big hype around , " he said .
" but i 'm really focused on what i 've got to do next ...
it 's all about moving on .
i 'm saying , ' take every day as it comes ' .
it 's a hustle , but i like this hustle dizzee rascal " i 'm really focused on what i 'm going to do next musically , definitely , because it 's about experimenting with the music , playing with it . "
he said that he felt the reason boy in da corner had achieved mass appeal was because many people felt they could relate to it .
he hinted also that the follow-up album would be highly experimental .
" -lsb- boy in da corner -rsb- sees things from a different perspective , from an angle - but i do n't necessarily pass a judgement , " he said .
" people that are listening to it can get into it for their own reasons .
it 's obviously very reflective of my life , but also london street life as a whole .
" but it 's got mass appeal .
so what i 'm writing now - i 'm writing whatever , to experiment with music .
" the whole thing is not always necessarily about me as a person , this music is fun , creativity , adding to the world of music .
" all music revolves around other music - it 's a cycle at the end of the day .
it 's just going on , and so i 'm writing about whatever comes to mind , innovative stuff . "
' bigger picture ' rascal also stated that , as he was experimenting with music , he was keen to avoid being categorised this early into his career .
" it 's something that 's still being worked on , " he said .
" to generalise it now , pigeon-hole it , there would be no point , because it 's growing .
" it 's in its early stages - i do n't know where it 's going next .
all i know is when me and my sound are elevating .
" anyone can get anything out of it - people into punk could get something out of it , that 's what it is , it does n't pass judgement . "
and he added he felt his horizons were limitless , having achieved what he had so far " from scratch . "
" it 's a hustle , but i like this hustle , " he said .
" i 've come from the bottom , having to do it myself , so i 've seen the bottom end of it all .
that 's how i think of things , from that angle , that corner .
" i see the bigger picture . "

rascal , whose real name is dylan mills , saw his career take off in the uk last year when his debut album , boy in da corner , won him the mercury music award .
he told bbc world service 's the music biz programme that he felt the us would embrace his music because , unlike many other artists who try to crack america , his work was not going to be " watered down . "
" that gap is definitely open , " he said .
" i think it 'll work over there .
this is a worldwide thing .
i 'm in it for the long run .
i 'm not playing . "
experimental follow-up rascal , who is currently working on his follow-up album to boy in da corner , said that he had been strongly influenced by us rap music .
" the beauty of american stuff is because it was real , and it was reflective of what they are , because they were talking how they talk , and were n't changing anything - they were being themselves , " he said .
i 'm writing about whatever comes to mind dizzee rascal " i 've done that to the max on my album ...
it 's going to go over in its purest form . "
rascal said that he had been very happy with the " achievement " of the mercury award , but that he was now " moving on . "
he also revealed that he was feeling pressure after notching up such a successful debut album .
" there 's definitely pressure there , because there 's this big hype around , " he said .
" but i 'm really focused on what i 've got to do next ...
it 's all about moving on .
i 'm saying , ' take every day as it comes ' .
it 's a hustle , but i like this hustle dizzee rascal " i 'm really focused on what i 'm going to do next musically , definitely , because it 's about experimenting with the music , playing with it . "
he said that he felt the reason boy in da corner had achieved mass appeal was because many people felt they could relate to it .
he hinted also that the follow-up album would be highly experimental .
" -lsb- boy in da corner -rsb- sees things from a different perspective , from an angle - but i do n't necessarily pass a judgement , " he said .
" people that are listening to it can get into it for their own reasons .
it 's obviously very reflective of my life , but also london street life as a whole .
" but it 's got mass appeal .
so what i 'm writing now - i 'm writing whatever , to experiment with music .
" the whole thing is not always necessarily about me as a person , this music is fun , creativity , adding to the world of music .
" all music revolves around other music - it 's a cycle at the end of the day .
it 's just going on , and so i 'm writing about whatever comes to mind , innovative stuff . "
' bigger picture ' rascal also stated that , as he was experimenting with music , he was keen to avoid being categorised this early into his career .
" it 's something that 's still being worked on , " he said .
" to generalise it now , pigeon-hole it , there would be no point , because it 's growing .
" it 's in its early stages - i do n't know where it 's going next .
all i know is when me and my sound are elevating .
" anyone can get anything out of it - people into punk could get something out of it , that 's what it is , it does n't pass judgement . "
and he added he felt his horizons were limitless , having achieved what he had so far " from scratch . "
" it 's a hustle , but i like this hustle , " he said .
" i 've come from the bottom , having to do it myself , so i 've seen the bottom end of it all .
that 's how i think of things , from that angle , that corner .
" i see the bigger picture . "

rascal , whose real name is dylan mills , saw his career take off in the uk last year when his debut album , boy in da corner , won him the mercury music award .
he told bbc world service 's the music biz programme that he felt the us would embrace his music because , unlike many other artists who try to crack america , his work was not going to be " watered down . "
" that gap is definitely open , " he said .
" i think it 'll work over there .
this is a worldwide thing .
i 'm in it for the long run .
i 'm not playing . "
experimental follow-up rascal , who is currently working on his follow-up album to boy in da corner , said that he had been strongly influenced by us rap music .
" the beauty of american stuff is because it was real , and it was reflective of what they are , because they were talking how they talk , and were n't changing anything - they were being themselves , " he said .
i 'm writing about whatever comes to mind dizzee rascal " i 've done that to the max on my album ...
it 's going to go over in its purest form . "
rascal said that he had been very happy with the " achievement " of the mercury award , but that he was now " moving on . "
he also revealed that he was feeling pressure after notching up such a successful debut album .
" there 's definitely pressure there , because there 's this big hype around , " he said .
" but i 'm really focused on what i 've got to do next ...
it 's all about moving on .
i 'm saying , ' take every day as it comes ' .
it 's a hustle , but i like this hustle dizzee rascal " i 'm really focused on what i 'm going to do next musically , definitely , because it 's about experimenting with the music , playing with it . "
he said that he felt the reason boy in da corner had achieved mass appeal was because many people felt they could relate to it .
he hinted also that the follow-up album would be highly experimental .
" -lsb- boy in da corner -rsb- sees things from a different perspective , from an angle - but i do n't necessarily pass a judgement , " he said .
" people that are listening to it can get into it for their own reasons .
it 's obviously very reflective of my life , but also london street life as a whole .
" but it 's got mass appeal .
so what i 'm writing now - i 'm writing whatever , to experiment with music .
" the whole thing is not always necessarily about me as a person , this music is fun , creativity , adding to the world of music .
" all music revolves around other music - it 's a cycle at the end of the day .
it 's just going on , and so i 'm writing about whatever comes to mind , innovative stuff . "
' bigger picture ' rascal also stated that , as he was experimenting with music , he was keen to avoid being categorised this early into his career .
" it 's something that 's still being worked on , " he said .
" to generalise it now , pigeon-hole it , there would be no point , because it 's growing .
" it 's in its early stages - i do n't know where it 's going next .
all i know is when me and my sound are elevating .
" anyone can get anything out of it - people into punk could get something out of it , that 's what it is , it does n't pass judgement . "
and he added he felt his horizons were limitless , having achieved what he had so far " from scratch . "
" it 's a hustle , but i like this hustle , " he said .
" i 've come from the bottom , having to do it myself , so i 've seen the bottom end of it all .
that 's how i think of things , from that angle , that corner .
" i see the bigger picture . "

if confirmed , it will be the latest in a long line of suicide bomb attacks in russia - most of them blamed on chechen rebels .
it is more than 18 months since president vladimir putin said the war in chechnya was over - but russia is increasingly coming to realise that a new kind of war may be under way .
thousands of russian forces remain in chechnya experts are talking about the " palestinisation " of the conflict - and pointing out that israel has been powerless to halt suicide bombers .
the first suicide bombings took place in chechnya in june and july of 2000 , but in the last year they have become regular occurrences .
the list includes : a lorry-bomb attack on the grozny administration at the end of december 2002 , which left 80 people dead .
a carbon copy of that attack in znamenskoye , in the north of chechnya in may , which left more than 50 dead .
an attack at a religious ceremony in chechnya later that month , in which two female suicide bombers apparently tried to assassinate chechnya 's pro-moscow leader -lrb- now chechen president -rrb- akhmad kadyrov .
another lorry bomb in june , which destroyed a branch of the federal security service in grozny and a local government building .
a suicide bomb attack on a bus carrying air force personnel near mozdok in north ossetia , the same month .
an attack by two female suicide bombers at a rock concert in moscow in july , which killed 15 people .
another lorry bomb at a military hospital in mozdok on 1 august , which killed at least 50 people .
a bomb attack on a train in the stavropol region of southern russia , in december , which killed at least 44 people .
some 300 people died in these attacks , many thought to have been carried out by chechen women - the wives , mothers and sisters of chechen men killed by russian security forces .
statistics the radical chechen warlord shamil basayev , who apparently masterminded the mass hostage-taking at a moscow theatre in october 2002 , has boasted of having a whole unit of female suicide fighters .
the earth will burn under their feet .
these animals will never feel safe anywhere boris gryzlov , interior minister it is little consolation to ordinary russians that the chechen rebel government repeated after the stavropol rail attack that it respected " international humanitarian law " and condemned acts of violence against civilians .
nor that interior minister boris gryzlov issued a blood-curdling threat to the rebels : " the earth will burn under their feet .
these animals will never feel safe anywhere . "
statistics show how badly the war has affected both the lives of both chechens and russians : thousands of russian troops remain in chechnya - some 38,000 were entitled to vote in a march referendum on a constitution for the republic - only a tiny fraction have been withdrawn .
there are few places where they can feel totally safe .
a missile attack on a helicopter in august 2002 killed 116 - the heaviest russian casualty toll in a single incident since the start of the second chechen war in 1999 .
the official figure for the number of russian soldiers who died in chechnya between 1999 and mid-2003 is 4,705 - though the soldiers ' mothers of russia organisation put the figure at 11,000 .
their estimate for the first chechen war , which lasted from 1994 -1996 is 14,000 dead , compared with the official 5,500 .
civilian deaths in this war are numbered in the tens of thousands .
more than 250 people went missing in chechnya in the first half of 2003 , according to a member of the pro-moscow government another government official was quoted as saying that 1,178 people had been killed in the first nine months of 2002 , and that 654 people had disappeared .
the disappearances are in some cases linked to a disturbing new trend . : in pictures images of life amid chechnya 's war whereas in the past , russian units would cordon off a village during daylight and " cleanse " it - taking in young men for violent interrogations - this practice appears to have been replaced by targeted night-time raids on particular houses .
the men taken away allegedly have a tendency to " disappear " .
according to award-winning russian journalist anna politkovskaya , these raids are sometimes carried out not by russian federal forces , but by a powerful force of bodyguards assembled by chechen president akhmad kadyrov .
the best way for a former rebel to avoid such a fate , she reports , is for him to join mr kadyrov 's squad .

if confirmed , it will be the latest in a long line of suicide bomb attacks in russia - most of them blamed on chechen rebels .
it is more than 18 months since president vladimir putin said the war in chechnya was over - but russia is increasingly coming to realise that a new kind of war may be under way .
thousands of russian forces remain in chechnya experts are talking about the " palestinisation " of the conflict - and pointing out that israel has been powerless to halt suicide bombers .
the first suicide bombings took place in chechnya in june and july of 2000 , but in the last year they have become regular occurrences .
the list includes : a lorry-bomb attack on the grozny administration at the end of december 2002 , which left 80 people dead .
a carbon copy of that attack in znamenskoye , in the north of chechnya in may , which left more than 50 dead .
an attack at a religious ceremony in chechnya later that month , in which two female suicide bombers apparently tried to assassinate chechnya 's pro-moscow leader -lrb- now chechen president -rrb- akhmad kadyrov .
another lorry bomb in june , which destroyed a branch of the federal security service in grozny and a local government building .
a suicide bomb attack on a bus carrying air force personnel near mozdok in north ossetia , the same month .
an attack by two female suicide bombers at a rock concert in moscow in july , which killed 15 people .
another lorry bomb at a military hospital in mozdok on 1 august , which killed at least 50 people .
a bomb attack on a train in the stavropol region of southern russia , in december , which killed at least 44 people .
some 300 people died in these attacks , many thought to have been carried out by chechen women - the wives , mothers and sisters of chechen men killed by russian security forces .
statistics the radical chechen warlord shamil basayev , who apparently masterminded the mass hostage-taking at a moscow theatre in october 2002 , has boasted of having a whole unit of female suicide fighters .
the earth will burn under their feet .
these animals will never feel safe anywhere boris gryzlov , interior minister it is little consolation to ordinary russians that the chechen rebel government repeated after the stavropol rail attack that it respected " international humanitarian law " and condemned acts of violence against civilians .
nor that interior minister boris gryzlov issued a blood-curdling threat to the rebels : " the earth will burn under their feet .
these animals will never feel safe anywhere . "
statistics show how badly the war has affected both the lives of both chechens and russians : thousands of russian troops remain in chechnya - some 38,000 were entitled to vote in a march referendum on a constitution for the republic - only a tiny fraction have been withdrawn .
there are few places where they can feel totally safe .
a missile attack on a helicopter in august 2002 killed 116 - the heaviest russian casualty toll in a single incident since the start of the second chechen war in 1999 .
the official figure for the number of russian soldiers who died in chechnya between 1999 and mid-2003 is 4,705 - though the soldiers ' mothers of russia organisation put the figure at 11,000 .
their estimate for the first chechen war , which lasted from 1994 -1996 is 14,000 dead , compared with the official 5,500 .
civilian deaths in this war are numbered in the tens of thousands .
more than 250 people went missing in chechnya in the first half of 2003 , according to a member of the pro-moscow government another government official was quoted as saying that 1,178 people had been killed in the first nine months of 2002 , and that 654 people had disappeared .
the disappearances are in some cases linked to a disturbing new trend . : in pictures images of life amid chechnya 's war whereas in the past , russian units would cordon off a village during daylight and " cleanse " it - taking in young men for violent interrogations - this practice appears to have been replaced by targeted night-time raids on particular houses .
the men taken away allegedly have a tendency to " disappear " .

children are abducted and forced to fight for the lra rebels the ugandan refugee law project has just interviewed 900 people from northern uganda to try to discover just what it and its mysterious leader , joseph kony , stand for .
the report says the seeds of this terrible conflict were sown in the defeat in 1986 of presidents milton obote and tito okello by forces loyal to uganda 's current leader , yoweri museveni .
the remnants of the defeated forces fled north , to their home areas - fearful that the new government would carry out attacks in retribution for government massacres in the luwero triangle under the previous regimes .
the defeated fighters reformed and eventually rallied to a spiritualist - alice lakewenya , in the hour of their despair .
she was in turn defeated in 1987 - and other rebels threw in the towel - leaving a power vacuum in northern uganda .
it was this that joseph kony filled with the lord 's resistance army .
children while he initially targeted government troops , he turned on civilians when the government sent civil defence militia against him .
profile : joseph kony eyewitness : massacre in lira in nearly 18 years of fighting joseph kony has remained undefeated .
so what is his secret ?
the refugee law project report says his recruitment is as simple as it is bloody .
twenty-thousand children have been abducted - often forced to kill their own parents so they have no way back .
they are used as expendable troops - frequently not even given guns to fight with .
only 200 core combatants are fully armed with weapons supplied by the sudanese government and other sources .
cleansing the report interviewed former lra fighters who tried to explain kony 's philosophy .
in essence he appears to believe that his role is to cleanse the acholi people .
joseph kony -lrb- r -rrb- believes he must ' cleanse ' the acholi people he uses biblical references to explain why it is necessary to kill his own people , since they have - in his view - failed to support his cause .
" if the acholi do n't support us , they must be finished , " he told one abductee .
but there are practical reasons for the war to continue .
kony and his senior commanders live well , taking the pick of the girls they capture as wives .
they also believe that if they surrendered they would be killed by the government .
president museveni wishes to use military means to finish him off .

children are abducted and forced to fight for the lra rebels the ugandan refugee law project has just interviewed 900 people from northern uganda to try to discover just what it and its mysterious leader , joseph kony , stand for .
the report says the seeds of this terrible conflict were sown in the defeat in 1986 of presidents milton obote and tito okello by forces loyal to uganda 's current leader , yoweri museveni .
the remnants of the defeated forces fled north , to their home areas - fearful that the new government would carry out attacks in retribution for government massacres in the luwero triangle under the previous regimes .
the defeated fighters reformed and eventually rallied to a spiritualist - alice lakewenya , in the hour of their despair .
she was in turn defeated in 1987 - and other rebels threw in the towel - leaving a power vacuum in northern uganda .
it was this that joseph kony filled with the lord 's resistance army .
children while he initially targeted government troops , he turned on civilians when the government sent civil defence militia against him .
profile : joseph kony eyewitness : massacre in lira in nearly 18 years of fighting joseph kony has remained undefeated .
so what is his secret ?
the refugee law project report says his recruitment is as simple as it is bloody .
twenty-thousand children have been abducted - often forced to kill their own parents so they have no way back .
they are used as expendable troops - frequently not even given guns to fight with .
only 200 core combatants are fully armed with weapons supplied by the sudanese government and other sources .
cleansing the report interviewed former lra fighters who tried to explain kony 's philosophy .
in essence he appears to believe that his role is to cleanse the acholi people .
joseph kony -lrb- r -rrb- believes he must ' cleanse ' the acholi people he uses biblical references to explain why it is necessary to kill his own people , since they have - in his view - failed to support his cause .
" if the acholi do n't support us , they must be finished , " he told one abductee .
but there are practical reasons for the war to continue .
kony and his senior commanders live well , taking the pick of the girls they capture as wives .
they also believe that if they surrendered they would be killed by the government .
president museveni wishes to use military means to finish him off .
but many church and traditional leaders believe that only talking can halt the lra 's murderous campaign .
