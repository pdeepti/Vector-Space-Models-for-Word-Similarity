when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close . coming weeks after president horst köhler 's controversial comment that the former east would never have the same living and employment standards as the rest of the country , few would have expected the positive results laid out in the report . catching up contrary to perception , " with the exception of the building sector , slowly but surely eastern germany is managing to catch up economically , " the report stated . it therefore looks as though the government is indeed reaching its goal of equalizing living standards across germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the report , presented by manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- , minister of transport , building and housing and the government 's special representative for the eastern states , showed that despite the broader trend of economic downturn , production in eastern german industry grew an average 5.5 percent per year over the last decade and reached 74.6 percent of the western german standard . engineering , the food , car and electrical industries are enjoying a particular upswing , proving that the process of successful reindustrialization is well underway . were it not for the slump in the building sector , the report pointed out that the rate of growth in the former east between 1992 and 2003 could have reached 3.7 percent , considerably higher than in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is one of the few cities in the east , where construction is an active industry as it is , however , the construction industry crisis is one of the main reasons for the ongoing rise in the region 's joblessness .
in 2003 , unemployment hovered around 18.6 percent , almost twice as high as in the rest of the country .
consequently , the region also suffers from a young people drain . restructuring reconstruction aid shaken by the results of the recent state elections in brandenburg and saxony , which saw considerable gains for far right parties , the government has decided to restructure its reconstruction aid for eastern germany in order to develop what it calls ' growth clusters ' and prompt improved competitiveness , reported the daily süddeutsche zeitung from munich . this would involve closer ties between investment and research , for example , and subsidize programs better focused on existing regional strengths . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dilapidated factory buildings are still easier to find than new plants in many regions of eastern germany the report stressed that one of eastern germany 's most pressing problems is its lack of big business , and that states should use funds from the solidarity pact for eastern reconstruction , consisting of € 156 billion -lrb- $ 191 billion -rrb- until 2019 , " with as broad an intensity possible " .
the state governments were also criticized for investing too little in infrastructure . questioning label of failure the report paints a different picture of eastern germany 's economy to the one the country is used to . " without ignoring the specific problems of the eastern german states , such as high unemployment and overall economic weaknesses , it 's time to question the label of ' failure ' , " wrote the daily berliner zeitung . " the brutal reality is that the general mood is considerably worse than the reality , " argued manfred stolpe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " upswing east , " reads the graffiti , but many eastern germans do n't feel that 's happened in the past 15 years .

the declaration stated that germany , brazil , india and japan , known as the g4 nations , " based on the firmly shared recognition that they are legitimate candidates for permanent membership in an expanded security council , support each other 's candidature . "
" the security council must reflect the realities of the international community in the 21st century , " the statement continued , echoing many voices within the united nations including that of un secretary general kofi annan , saying that the broadening of representation on the 15-nation council would strengthen the moral authority of decisions taken by the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in order for the international community to effectively address the various threats and challenges that it presently faces , it is important to reform the united nations as a whole , " a further passage read .
such a reform of the council , which passes resolutions that are binding for the un 's 191 member states , is long overdue , both supporters and critics of the institution say .
the council has had the same five permanent members with veto power - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - since the united nations was established in the wake of world war ii .
ten other nations are elected as non-permanent members for two-year rotation terms .
proposed reforms biggest in 60-year history the proposal put forward by the four nations , which also envisages a permanent seat for africa and an expansion of the non-permanent council membership , would represent the largest shake-up at the top decision-making body of the united nations in its nearly 60-year history . a high-level panel set up by kofi annan to research the possibilities of reform is scheduled to offer concrete proposals for change in december .
annan was recently quoted as saying the question of reform took on added urgency after last year 's crisis over iraq , when the united states went to war without the backing of the council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer .
germany , who is the third highest contributor to un coffers behind the united states and japan , has lobbied strongly for a permanent seat on the council as its two year term as a non-permanent member comes to an end this december .
foreign minister fischer has recently completed an exhaustive tour of countries in a bid to drum up support for germany 's campaign for permanent status .
his work seemed to have paid off on tuesday night . fischer sees g4 as natural candidates " all four states regard themselves as natural candidates , " fischer said after the meeting , " based on what they are doing for the un , what they are capable of doing and also because of their regional roles . "
at least one of the five current permanent members , britain , has already voiced its support for all four bids .
old regional animosities , however , are likely to ensure that none of the candidates enjoys an easy ride .
germany is likely to face opposition from italy , a solid ally of the united states in iraq , for its stance against the 2003 invasion . opposition may bar the way pakistan could find it hard to accept india , their nuclear-armed neighbor , while brazil 's bid might get a lukewarm reception in mexico and argentina , and china on tuesday indicated reservations over japan 's candidacy , saying the un was " not a board of directors " whose composition could be decided by " the financial contribution of its members . "

" countries with the will and resources to play a major role in international peace and security must always take part in the council 's decision-making process , " he said .
koizumi also claimed a unique voice for japan as the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack . the four countries also said that africa , the poorest continent in the united nations , " must also be represented in the permanent membership of the security council . "

the declaration stated that germany , brazil , india and japan , known as the g4 nations , " based on the firmly shared recognition that they are legitimate candidates for permanent membership in an expanded security council , support each other 's candidature . "
" the security council must reflect the realities of the international community in the 21st century , " the statement continued , echoing many voices within the united nations including that of un secretary general kofi annan , saying that the broadening of representation on the 15-nation council would strengthen the moral authority of decisions taken by the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in order for the international community to effectively address the various threats and challenges that it presently faces , it is important to reform the united nations as a whole , " a further passage read .
such a reform of the council , which passes resolutions that are binding for the un 's 191 member states , is long overdue , both supporters and critics of the institution say .
the council has had the same five permanent members with veto power - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - since the united nations was established in the wake of world war ii .
ten other nations are elected as non-permanent members for two-year rotation terms .
proposed reforms biggest in 60-year history the proposal put forward by the four nations , which also envisages a permanent seat for africa and an expansion of the non-permanent council membership , would represent the largest shake-up at the top decision-making body of the united nations in its nearly 60-year history . a high-level panel set up by kofi annan to research the possibilities of reform is scheduled to offer concrete proposals for change in december .
annan was recently quoted as saying the question of reform took on added urgency after last year 's crisis over iraq , when the united states went to war without the backing of the council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer .
germany , who is the third highest contributor to un coffers behind the united states and japan , has lobbied strongly for a permanent seat on the council as its two year term as a non-permanent member comes to an end this december .
foreign minister fischer has recently completed an exhaustive tour of countries in a bid to drum up support for germany 's campaign for permanent status .
his work seemed to have paid off on tuesday night . fischer sees g4 as natural candidates " all four states regard themselves as natural candidates , " fischer said after the meeting , " based on what they are doing for the un , what they are capable of doing and also because of their regional roles . "
at least one of the five current permanent members , britain , has already voiced its support for all four bids .
old regional animosities , however , are likely to ensure that none of the candidates enjoys an easy ride .
germany is likely to face opposition from italy , a solid ally of the united states in iraq , for its stance against the 2003 invasion . opposition may bar the way pakistan could find it hard to accept india , their nuclear-armed neighbor , while brazil 's bid might get a lukewarm reception in mexico and argentina , and china on tuesday indicated reservations over japan 's candidacy , saying the un was " not a board of directors " whose composition could be decided by " the financial contribution of its members . "

addressing the general assembly later in the day , japanese prime minister koizumi fleshed out his country 's credentials , pointing to its reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan , as well as its leading role in talks to resolve the north korean nuclear issue . " countries with the will and resources to play a major role in international peace and security must always take part in the council 's decision-making process , " he said .
koizumi also claimed a unique voice for japan as the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack . the four countries also said that africa , the poorest continent in the united nations , " must also be represented in the permanent membership of the security council . "
african leaders are debating which country from the vast continent might get a permanent security council seat if one is made available .

the declaration stated that germany , brazil , india and japan , known as the g4 nations , " based on the firmly shared recognition that they are legitimate candidates for permanent membership in an expanded security council , support each other 's candidature . "
" the security council must reflect the realities of the international community in the 21st century , " the statement continued , echoing many voices within the united nations including that of un secretary general kofi annan , saying that the broadening of representation on the 15-nation council would strengthen the moral authority of decisions taken by the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in order for the international community to effectively address the various threats and challenges that it presently faces , it is important to reform the united nations as a whole , " a further passage read .
such a reform of the council , which passes resolutions that are binding for the un 's 191 member states , is long overdue , both supporters and critics of the institution say .
the council has had the same five permanent members with veto power - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - since the united nations was established in the wake of world war ii .
ten other nations are elected as non-permanent members for two-year rotation terms .
proposed reforms biggest in 60-year history the proposal put forward by the four nations , which also envisages a permanent seat for africa and an expansion of the non-permanent council membership , would represent the largest shake-up at the top decision-making body of the united nations in its nearly 60-year history . a high-level panel set up by kofi annan to research the possibilities of reform is scheduled to offer concrete proposals for change in december .
annan was recently quoted as saying the question of reform took on added urgency after last year 's crisis over iraq , when the united states went to war without the backing of the council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer .
germany , who is the third highest contributor to un coffers behind the united states and japan , has lobbied strongly for a permanent seat on the council as its two year term as a non-permanent member comes to an end this december .
foreign minister fischer has recently completed an exhaustive tour of countries in a bid to drum up support for germany 's campaign for permanent status .
his work seemed to have paid off on tuesday night . fischer sees g4 as natural candidates " all four states regard themselves as natural candidates , " fischer said after the meeting , " based on what they are doing for the un , what they are capable of doing and also because of their regional roles . "
at least one of the five current permanent members , britain , has already voiced its support for all four bids .
old regional animosities , however , are likely to ensure that none of the candidates enjoys an easy ride .
germany is likely to face opposition from italy , a solid ally of the united states in iraq , for its stance against the 2003 invasion . opposition may bar the way pakistan could find it hard to accept india , their nuclear-armed neighbor , while brazil 's bid might get a lukewarm reception in mexico and argentina , and china on tuesday indicated reservations over japan 's candidacy , saying the un was " not a board of directors " whose composition could be decided by " the financial contribution of its members . "

" countries with the will and resources to play a major role in international peace and security must always take part in the council 's decision-making process , " he said .
koizumi also claimed a unique voice for japan as the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack . the four countries also said that africa , the poorest continent in the united nations , " must also be represented in the permanent membership of the security council . "
african leaders are debating which country from the vast continent might get a permanent security council seat if one is made available .

his work seemed to have paid off on tuesday night . fischer sees g4 as natural candidates " all four states regard themselves as natural candidates , " fischer said after the meeting , " based on what they are doing for the un , what they are capable of doing and also because of their regional roles . "
at least one of the five current permanent members , britain , has already voiced its support for all four bids .
old regional animosities , however , are likely to ensure that none of the candidates enjoys an easy ride .
germany is likely to face opposition from italy , a solid ally of the united states in iraq , for its stance against the 2003 invasion . opposition may bar the way pakistan could find it hard to accept india , their nuclear-armed neighbor , while brazil 's bid might get a lukewarm reception in mexico and argentina , and china on tuesday indicated reservations over japan 's candidacy , saying the un was " not a board of directors " whose composition could be decided by " the financial contribution of its members .

the declaration stated that germany , brazil , india and japan , known as the g4 nations , " based on the firmly shared recognition that they are legitimate candidates for permanent membership in an expanded security council , support each other 's candidature . "
" the security council must reflect the realities of the international community in the 21st century , " the statement continued , echoing many voices within the united nations including that of un secretary general kofi annan , saying that the broadening of representation on the 15-nation council would strengthen the moral authority of decisions taken by the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in order for the international community to effectively address the various threats and challenges that it presently faces , it is important to reform the united nations as a whole , " a further passage read .
such a reform of the council , which passes resolutions that are binding for the un 's 191 member states , is long overdue , both supporters and critics of the institution say .
the council has had the same five permanent members with veto power - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - since the united nations was established in the wake of world war ii .
ten other nations are elected as non-permanent members for two-year rotation terms .
proposed reforms biggest in 60-year history the proposal put forward by the four nations , which also envisages a permanent seat for africa and an expansion of the non-permanent council membership , would represent the largest shake-up at the top decision-making body of the united nations in its nearly 60-year history . a high-level panel set up by kofi annan to research the possibilities of reform is scheduled to offer concrete proposals for change in december .
annan was recently quoted as saying the question of reform took on added urgency after last year 's crisis over iraq , when the united states went to war without the backing of the council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.09.2004 -pipe- 12:00 utc germany mulls extending afghan mission the german cabinet agreed on wednesday to ask parliament to extend the german army 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan by a further 12 months despite criticism that it is ineffective .
the recently established german provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- , operating in faizabad in northern afghanistan , has attracted controversy over its failure to rescue foreign aid workers who came under attack from an angry mob earlier this month .
the mainly swiss aid workers eventually had to be rescued by unarmed staff from the united nations and a private security firm .
the main german opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is calling for the 110-soldier force in faizabad to be reinforced .
germany also runs a prt in nearby kunduz staffed by 270 peacekeeping troops from the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul and some 30 civilians .
germany has 2,000 soldiers in isaf , its largest military force abroad .
the un security council voted unanimously friday to renew the mandate of the multinational security force in afghanistan for another year until october 2005 .

the recently established german provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- , operating in faizabad in northern afghanistan , has attracted controversy over its failure to rescue foreign aid workers who came under attack from an angry mob earlier this month .
the mainly swiss aid workers eventually had to be rescued by unarmed staff from the united nations and a private security firm .
the main german opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is calling for the 110-soldier force in faizabad to be reinforced .
germany also runs a prt in nearby kunduz staffed by 270 peacekeeping troops from the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul and some 30 civilians .
germany has 2,000 soldiers in isaf , its largest military force abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2004 the dangerous quest for news großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more journalists are becoming victims while working in war zones more journalists are being targeted or caught in the crossfire of war zones and need greater protection , a group of experts said .
some are pushing for an international emblem to distinguish the media . at least 1,200 reporters have been killed worldwide over the past 12 years and no one has been brought to justice in about 95 percent of the cases , said aidan white , secretary general of the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- . in iraq alone , more than 50 reporters and media staff have been killed since the us-led invasion in march 2003 , according to figures from the ifj , which represents half a million correspondents globally . desperate to combat the problem , 14 media associations signed a declaration after a two-day meeting in geneva to make journalism safer , primarily by pressing governments to comply with international laws that safeguard reporters , namely the geneva conventions on the rules of war . " if governments today honored the obligations they already have under international law we would not be facing the crisis we have , " white told a news conference at the end of the meeting , which was also attended by non-governmental organizations and human rights groups . at present , he said , countries failed to investigate media deaths or provide journalists with adequate protection and at times were even responsible for the murders .
" this declaration is a good step forward .
we have started a process , which we now know we will continue , " said white . proposed symbol would act as a bulls-eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporters georges malbrunot and christian chesnot were held captive in iraq .
but the accord fell short of some participants ' desire to establish a press emblem that would alert people to the media in a similar way as the red cross symbol and un flag are used to identify aid workers . instead , the ifj merely promised to study the idea after fears were expressed that such an emblem - the word " press " written in black letters on an orange-colored disk - would make many reporters in hot spots such as iraq or colombia an even easier target for those who oppose their work .
" a visible identification mark for journalists would be calculated suicide , " henrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists federation , told dw-world .
in some conflict areas it might make sense to identify the press with a universal emblem , he said , but in others , such as iraq or the former yugoslavia , where journalists are often singled out , such a marking would have the reverse effect of protection .
the german organization is not alone in being torn between wanting to protect its members and worrying that an emblem might backfire .
" there were diverging opinions on the emblem so we decided to look deeper into the practical and legal issues involved , " said blaise lempen , a founding member of the press emblem campaign , a group of largely geneva-based correspondents that organized the meeting , and a strong advocate of the idea .
a convention was needed to create a universally-recognized press logo , backed by the full support of governments and international law , that would arm anyone who is harmed wearing it with strong legal redress , lempen , a reporter for the swiss news agency ats , said during the talks . the real issue of increasing deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist were wounded when a us tank fired at their hotel in baghdad in april , 2003 .
in contrast , rodney pinder , director of the international news safety institute , a recently-established body that groups about 60 news organizations , argued that debate on an emblem was a dangerous distraction to the real issue - the fact that more and more journalists are dying . " there is already a well recognized emblem - the ' press ' and ' tv ' signs that are often displayed - yet journalists are being killed now in greater numbers than ever before , " pinder told afp on the sidelines of the meeting . a perception that people can target journalists with impunity coupled with the perceived loss of the media 's neutrality in conflict zones were far more pressing matters , he said . white agreed that it would be difficult to generate support from major news organizations for a new emblem when already established mechanisms to protect journalists are ignored . signatories to the document - which also promises to create a group of experts who will draw up a list of practical measures that can be taken to boost the protection of journalists - included the ifj , the european broadcasting union , the syndicate of iraqi journalists and media rights watchdog reporters without borders . they are due to meet again in the united arab emirates early next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2004 the dangerous quest for news großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more journalists are becoming victims while working in war zones more journalists are being targeted or caught in the crossfire of war zones and need greater protection , a group of experts said .
some are pushing for an international emblem to distinguish the media . at least 1,200 reporters have been killed worldwide over the past 12 years and no one has been brought to justice in about 95 percent of the cases , said aidan white , secretary general of the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- . in iraq alone , more than 50 reporters and media staff have been killed since the us-led invasion in march 2003 , according to figures from the ifj , which represents half a million correspondents globally . desperate to combat the problem , 14 media associations signed a declaration after a two-day meeting in geneva to make journalism safer , primarily by pressing governments to comply with international laws that safeguard reporters , namely the geneva conventions on the rules of war . " if governments today honored the obligations they already have under international law we would not be facing the crisis we have , " white told a news conference at the end of the meeting , which was also attended by non-governmental organizations and human rights groups . at present , he said , countries failed to investigate media deaths or provide journalists with adequate protection and at times were even responsible for the murders .
" this declaration is a good step forward .
we have started a process , which we now know we will continue , " said white . proposed symbol would act as a bulls-eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporters georges malbrunot and christian chesnot were held captive in iraq .
but the accord fell short of some participants ' desire to establish a press emblem that would alert people to the media in a similar way as the red cross symbol and un flag are used to identify aid workers . instead , the ifj merely promised to study the idea after fears were expressed that such an emblem - the word " press " written in black letters on an orange-colored disk - would make many reporters in hot spots such as iraq or colombia an even easier target for those who oppose their work .
" a visible identification mark for journalists would be calculated suicide , " henrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists federation , told dw-world .
in some conflict areas it might make sense to identify the press with a universal emblem , he said , but in others , such as iraq or the former yugoslavia , where journalists are often singled out , such a marking would have the reverse effect of protection .
the german organization is not alone in being torn between wanting to protect its members and worrying that an emblem might backfire .
" there were diverging opinions on the emblem so we decided to look deeper into the practical and legal issues involved , " said blaise lempen , a founding member of the press emblem campaign , a group of largely geneva-based correspondents that organized the meeting , and a strong advocate of the idea .
a convention was needed to create a universally-recognized press logo , backed by the full support of governments and international law , that would arm anyone who is harmed wearing it with strong legal redress , lempen , a reporter for the swiss news agency ats , said during the talks . the real issue of increasing deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist were wounded when a us tank fired at their hotel in baghdad in april , 2003 .
in contrast , rodney pinder , director of the international news safety institute , a recently-established body that groups about 60 news organizations , argued that debate on an emblem was a dangerous distraction to the real issue - the fact that more and more journalists are dying . " there is already a well recognized emblem - the ' press ' and ' tv ' signs that are often displayed - yet journalists are being killed now in greater numbers than ever before , " pinder told afp on the sidelines of the meeting . a perception that people can target journalists with impunity coupled with the perceived loss of the media 's neutrality in conflict zones were far more pressing matters , he said . white agreed that it would be difficult to generate support from major news organizations for a new emblem when already established mechanisms to protect journalists are ignored . signatories to the document - which also promises to create a group of experts who will draw up a list of practical measures that can be taken to boost the protection of journalists - included the ifj , the european broadcasting union , the syndicate of iraqi journalists and media rights watchdog reporters without borders . they are due to meet again in the united arab emirates early next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

some are pushing for an international emblem to distinguish the media . at least 1,200 reporters have been killed worldwide over the past 12 years and no one has been brought to justice in about 95 percent of the cases , said aidan white , secretary general of the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- . in iraq alone , more than 50 reporters and media staff have been killed since the us-led invasion in march 2003 , according to figures from the ifj , which represents half a million correspondents globally . desperate to combat the problem , 14 media associations signed a declaration after a two-day meeting in geneva to make journalism safer , primarily by pressing governments to comply with international laws that safeguard reporters , namely the geneva conventions on the rules of war . " if governments today honored the obligations they already have under international law we would not be facing the crisis we have , " white told a news conference at the end of the meeting , which was also attended by non-governmental organizations and human rights groups . at present , he said , countries failed to investigate media deaths or provide journalists with adequate protection and at times were even responsible for the murders .
" this declaration is a good step forward .
we have started a process , which we now know we will continue , " said white . proposed symbol would act as a bulls-eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporters georges malbrunot and christian chesnot were held captive in iraq .
but the accord fell short of some participants ' desire to establish a press emblem that would alert people to the media in a similar way as the red cross symbol and un flag are used to identify aid workers . instead , the ifj merely promised to study the idea after fears were expressed that such an emblem - the word " press " written in black letters on an orange-colored disk - would make many reporters in hot spots such as iraq or colombia an even easier target for those who oppose their work .
" a visible identification mark for journalists would be calculated suicide , " henrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists federation , told dw-world .
in some conflict areas it might make sense to identify the press with a universal emblem , he said , but in others , such as iraq or the former yugoslavia , where journalists are often singled out , such a marking would have the reverse effect of protection .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2004 g4 nations bid for permanent security council seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the representatives of the g4 nations mark their joint bid germany , japan , brazil and india - the so-called g4 group - launched a joint effort for permament seats on the united nations security council after meeting on the fringes of the un general assembly in new york . after meeting on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer , brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva and the indian and japanese prime ministers , manmohan singh and junichiro koizumi delivered a joint statement launching a united bid for permanent un security council seats , arguing that expanded membership was crucial to addressing new global threats .
the declaration stated that germany , brazil , india and japan , known as the g4 nations , " based on the firmly shared recognition that they are legitimate candidates for permanent membership in an expanded security council , support each other 's candidature . "
" the security council must reflect the realities of the international community in the 21st century , " the statement continued , echoing many voices within the united nations including that of un secretary general kofi annan , saying that the broadening of representation on the 15-nation council would strengthen the moral authority of decisions taken by the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in order for the international community to effectively address the various threats and challenges that it presently faces , it is important to reform the united nations as a whole , " a further passage read .
such a reform of the council , which passes resolutions that are binding for the un 's 191 member states , is long overdue , both supporters and critics of the institution say .
the council has had the same five permanent members with veto power - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - since the united nations was established in the wake of world war ii .
ten other nations are elected as non-permanent members for two-year rotation terms .
proposed reforms biggest in 60-year history the proposal put forward by the four nations , which also envisages a permanent seat for africa and an expansion of the non-permanent council membership , would represent the largest shake-up at the top decision-making body of the united nations in its nearly 60-year history . a high-level panel set up by kofi annan to research the possibilities of reform is scheduled to offer concrete proposals for change in december .
annan was recently quoted as saying the question of reform took on added urgency after last year 's crisis over iraq , when the united states went to war without the backing of the council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer .
germany , who is the third highest contributor to un coffers behind the united states and japan , has lobbied strongly for a permanent seat on the council as its two year term as a non-permanent member comes to an end this december .
foreign minister fischer has recently completed an exhaustive tour of countries in a bid to drum up support for germany 's campaign for permanent status .
his work seemed to have paid off on tuesday night . fischer sees g4 as natural candidates " all four states regard themselves as natural candidates , " fischer said after the meeting , " based on what they are doing for the un , what they are capable of doing and also because of their regional roles . "
at least one of the five current permanent members , britain , has already voiced its support for all four bids .
old regional animosities , however , are likely to ensure that none of the candidates enjoys an easy ride .
germany is likely to face opposition from italy , a solid ally of the united states in iraq , for its stance against the 2003 invasion . opposition may bar the way pakistan could find it hard to accept india , their nuclear-armed neighbor , while brazil 's bid might get a lukewarm reception in mexico and argentina , and china on tuesday indicated reservations over japan 's candidacy , saying the un was " not a board of directors " whose composition could be decided by " the financial contribution of its members . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi .
addressing the general assembly later in the day , japanese prime minister koizumi fleshed out his country 's credentials , pointing to its reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan , as well as its leading role in talks to resolve the north korean nuclear issue . " countries with the will and resources to play a major role in international peace and security must always take part in the council 's decision-making process , " he said .
koizumi also claimed a unique voice for japan as the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack . the four countries also said that africa , the poorest continent in the united nations , " must also be represented in the permanent membership of the security council . "
african leaders are debating which country from the vast continent might get a permanent security council seat if one is made available .
tanzania put itself forward as a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the council , saying it would seek election before august . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to push for un security council seat german foreign minster joschka fischer headed to new york on monday to attend this week 's meeting of the un general assembly .

when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close . coming weeks after president horst köhler 's controversial comment that the former east would never have the same living and employment standards as the rest of the country , few would have expected the positive results laid out in the report . catching up contrary to perception , " with the exception of the building sector , slowly but surely eastern germany is managing to catch up economically , " the report stated . it therefore looks as though the government is indeed reaching its goal of equalizing living standards across germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the report , presented by manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- , minister of transport , building and housing and the government 's special representative for the eastern states , showed that despite the broader trend of economic downturn , production in eastern german industry grew an average 5.5 percent per year over the last decade and reached 74.6 percent of the western german standard . engineering , the food , car and electrical industries are enjoying a particular upswing , proving that the process of successful reindustrialization is well underway . were it not for the slump in the building sector , the report pointed out that the rate of growth in the former east between 1992 and 2003 could have reached 3.7 percent , considerably higher than in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is one of the few cities in the east , where construction is an active industry as it is , however , the construction industry crisis is one of the main reasons for the ongoing rise in the region 's joblessness .
in 2003 , unemployment hovered around 18.6 percent , almost twice as high as in the rest of the country .
consequently , the region also suffers from a young people drain . restructuring reconstruction aid shaken by the results of the recent state elections in brandenburg and saxony , which saw considerable gains for far right parties , the government has decided to restructure its reconstruction aid for eastern germany in order to develop what it calls ' growth clusters ' and prompt improved competitiveness , reported the daily süddeutsche zeitung from munich . this would involve closer ties between investment and research , for example , and subsidize programs better focused on existing regional strengths . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dilapidated factory buildings are still easier to find than new plants in many regions of eastern germany the report stressed that one of eastern germany 's most pressing problems is its lack of big business , and that states should use funds from the solidarity pact for eastern reconstruction , consisting of € 156 billion -lrb- $ 191 billion -rrb- until 2019 , " with as broad an intensity possible " .
the state governments were also criticized for investing too little in infrastructure . questioning label of failure the report paints a different picture of eastern germany 's economy to the one the country is used to . " without ignoring the specific problems of the eastern german states , such as high unemployment and overall economic weaknesses , it 's time to question the label of ' failure ' , " wrote the daily berliner zeitung . " the brutal reality is that the general mood is considerably worse than the reality , " argued manfred stolpe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " upswing east , " reads the graffiti , but many eastern germans do n't feel that 's happened in the past 15 years .
he also referred to the increasingly strained relationship between eastern and western germany , stressing the need to avoid mutual resentment . " we have to protect ourselves from prejudice , " he said .
" there are signs of increasing bitterness on both sides . " while the government report admitted that unemployment rose rise in 2003 , it emphasized that the region has also seen " remarkable progress . "
" all in all , the eastern german economy is on track to achieving an internationally competitive and sustainable structure , " concluded the report .
stolpe also took the opportunity to defend the controversial hartz iv welfare reforms , insisting that they would make germany more competitive and help create jobs . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gains by extremist parties trouble germany germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors . -lrb- september 20 , 2004 -rrb- silicon saxony : chip factory brings high-tech to dresden u.s. chipmaker amd has broken ground on a $ 2.4 billion factory in dresden that will manufacture silicon wafers .
it 's another coup for the eastern german city that has become one of the region 's few economic bright spots . -lrb- may 18 , 2004 -rrb- köhler stokes fires of east-west discontent german president horst köhler has caused tension between the eastern and western regions by saying that it is unlikely the former east will ever have the same living and employment standards as the rest of the country .

chewbacca then took to a velo taxi , a mode of transport unlikely to carry him into hyperspace , for a tour of the park on ebertstrasse .
even the awesomely-built wookie 's legs could n't power the peddle car fast enough for the jump to light speed so he gave up with a roar and headed to one of berlin 's most famous relics from the recent past , the remains of the wall . chewie sightings flood berlin media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way to tatooine ?
as a freedom fighter used to struggling against oppressive political regimes , chewie appreciated the wall and its downfall before heading to potsdamer platz on his way to berlin zoo .

privacy becomes a problem when you 're two meters tall and covered in hair , so after devouring an ice-cream at the zoo , chewie hid in the bushes for a while before making a quick stop off at germany 's seat of power , the bundestag . satisfied that it was n't as corrupt as the galactic senate , chewie saw no need to unleash his crossbow lazer and headed back to his hotel suite to prepare for his next mission , his visit to london . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the very best of and finally ...

the declaration stated that germany , brazil , india and japan , known as the g4 nations , " based on the firmly shared recognition that they are legitimate candidates for permanent membership in an expanded security council , support each other 's candidature . "
" the security council must reflect the realities of the international community in the 21st century , " the statement continued , echoing many voices within the united nations including that of un secretary general kofi annan , saying that the broadening of representation on the 15-nation council would strengthen the moral authority of decisions taken by the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in order for the international community to effectively address the various threats and challenges that it presently faces , it is important to reform the united nations as a whole , " a further passage read .
such a reform of the council , which passes resolutions that are binding for the un 's 191 member states , is long overdue , both supporters and critics of the institution say .
the council has had the same five permanent members with veto power - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - since the united nations was established in the wake of world war ii .
ten other nations are elected as non-permanent members for two-year rotation terms .
proposed reforms biggest in 60-year history the proposal put forward by the four nations , which also envisages a permanent seat for africa and an expansion of the non-permanent council membership , would represent the largest shake-up at the top decision-making body of the united nations in its nearly 60-year history . a high-level panel set up by kofi annan to research the possibilities of reform is scheduled to offer concrete proposals for change in december .
annan was recently quoted as saying the question of reform took on added urgency after last year 's crisis over iraq , when the united states went to war without the backing of the council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer .
germany , who is the third highest contributor to un coffers behind the united states and japan , has lobbied strongly for a permanent seat on the council as its two year term as a non-permanent member comes to an end this december .
foreign minister fischer has recently completed an exhaustive tour of countries in a bid to drum up support for germany 's campaign for permanent status .
his work seemed to have paid off on tuesday night . fischer sees g4 as natural candidates " all four states regard themselves as natural candidates , " fischer said after the meeting , " based on what they are doing for the un , what they are capable of doing and also because of their regional roles . "
at least one of the five current permanent members , britain , has already voiced its support for all four bids .
old regional animosities , however , are likely to ensure that none of the candidates enjoys an easy ride .
germany is likely to face opposition from italy , a solid ally of the united states in iraq , for its stance against the 2003 invasion . opposition may bar the way pakistan could find it hard to accept india , their nuclear-armed neighbor , while brazil 's bid might get a lukewarm reception in mexico and argentina , and china on tuesday indicated reservations over japan 's candidacy , saying the un was " not a board of directors " whose composition could be decided by " the financial contribution of its members . "

addressing the general assembly later in the day , japanese prime minister koizumi fleshed out his country 's credentials , pointing to its reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan , as well as its leading role in talks to resolve the north korean nuclear issue . " countries with the will and resources to play a major role in international peace and security must always take part in the council 's decision-making process , " he said .
koizumi also claimed a unique voice for japan as the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack . the four countries also said that africa , the poorest continent in the united nations , " must also be represented in the permanent membership of the security council . "
african leaders are debating which country from the vast continent might get a permanent security council seat if one is made available .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2004 the dangerous quest for news großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more journalists are becoming victims while working in war zones more journalists are being targeted or caught in the crossfire of war zones and need greater protection , a group of experts said .
some are pushing for an international emblem to distinguish the media . at least 1,200 reporters have been killed worldwide over the past 12 years and no one has been brought to justice in about 95 percent of the cases , said aidan white , secretary general of the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- . in iraq alone , more than 50 reporters and media staff have been killed since the us-led invasion in march 2003 , according to figures from the ifj , which represents half a million correspondents globally . desperate to combat the problem , 14 media associations signed a declaration after a two-day meeting in geneva to make journalism safer , primarily by pressing governments to comply with international laws that safeguard reporters , namely the geneva conventions on the rules of war . " if governments today honored the obligations they already have under international law we would not be facing the crisis we have , " white told a news conference at the end of the meeting , which was also attended by non-governmental organizations and human rights groups . at present , he said , countries failed to investigate media deaths or provide journalists with adequate protection and at times were even responsible for the murders .
" this declaration is a good step forward .
we have started a process , which we now know we will continue , " said white . proposed symbol would act as a bulls-eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporters georges malbrunot and christian chesnot were held captive in iraq .
but the accord fell short of some participants ' desire to establish a press emblem that would alert people to the media in a similar way as the red cross symbol and un flag are used to identify aid workers . instead , the ifj merely promised to study the idea after fears were expressed that such an emblem - the word " press " written in black letters on an orange-colored disk - would make many reporters in hot spots such as iraq or colombia an even easier target for those who oppose their work .
" a visible identification mark for journalists would be calculated suicide , " henrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists federation , told dw-world .
in some conflict areas it might make sense to identify the press with a universal emblem , he said , but in others , such as iraq or the former yugoslavia , where journalists are often singled out , such a marking would have the reverse effect of protection .
the german organization is not alone in being torn between wanting to protect its members and worrying that an emblem might backfire .
" there were diverging opinions on the emblem so we decided to look deeper into the practical and legal issues involved , " said blaise lempen , a founding member of the press emblem campaign , a group of largely geneva-based correspondents that organized the meeting , and a strong advocate of the idea .
a convention was needed to create a universally-recognized press logo , backed by the full support of governments and international law , that would arm anyone who is harmed wearing it with strong legal redress , lempen , a reporter for the swiss news agency ats , said during the talks . the real issue of increasing deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist were wounded when a us tank fired at their hotel in baghdad in april , 2003 .
in contrast , rodney pinder , director of the international news safety institute , a recently-established body that groups about 60 news organizations , argued that debate on an emblem was a dangerous distraction to the real issue - the fact that more and more journalists are dying . " there is already a well recognized emblem - the ' press ' and ' tv ' signs that are often displayed - yet journalists are being killed now in greater numbers than ever before , " pinder told afp on the sidelines of the meeting . a perception that people can target journalists with impunity coupled with the perceived loss of the media 's neutrality in conflict zones were far more pressing matters , he said . white agreed that it would be difficult to generate support from major news organizations for a new emblem when already established mechanisms to protect journalists are ignored . signatories to the document - which also promises to create a group of experts who will draw up a list of practical measures that can be taken to boost the protection of journalists - included the ifj , the european broadcasting union , the syndicate of iraqi journalists and media rights watchdog reporters without borders . they are due to meet again in the united arab emirates early next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

his forecast reflected a wider optimistic trend based on the recent upswing in advertising spending . online ads outstrip other media " according to estimates by us company jupiter research , turnover from online advertising will have overtaken turnover from print media by 2008 , " wrote german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung recently . pressetext.austria noted a similar development .
" in the first half of 2004 , online advertising spending was twice as high as it was in cinema theaters , " it wrote , while the interactive advertising bureau in new york , the industry 's leading association , pointed out that internet advertising would be outstripping radio advertising by 2007 . in the us , the world 's largest advertising market , web sites provided turnover of almost € 7.3 billion , thereby matching the amount spent in 2000 , the most lucrative year ever .
advertising also increased by 6.5 percent in germany in the first half of 2004 , with a turnover of € 8.8 billion for all media . the internet , meanwhile , registered a drop of 2.6 percent .
nonetheless , bernd henning from dmv market research told dw-world that other studies showed the market was improving .
after years of ad price dumping , prices are once again rising , he said .
that 's because cost-per-thousand - the average cost for achieving a thousand exposures for a commercial against a target audience - rises in accordance with the number of users a site attracts , and the cost of advertising rises with it . the new face of online advertising like cinema advertising , experts agree that internet advertising has a slow-burn effect on the consumer . current online advertising is now far more complex and less click-oriented than it was ten years ago .
' sticky ads ' and ' interstitials ' , for example - ads that display between two pages of a website - are interruptive , like television advertising , rather than passive , like web banner advertising . another trend is keyword marketing .
search engines like google and yahoo auction off prime positions on their pages , primarily to internet traders with a vested interest in appearing at the top of the list in response to a query for , for example , ' digital camera ' . these hits are known as " sponsored listings " . even though the growth in the online advertising market is considerable , its budgets are still far smaller than in other media .
according to the 2003 focus mediaguide , the online share of the total us advertising budget was just three percent . even in norway , denmark and estonia , the european countries spending most on online advertising , the budget is negligible . mediterranean countries spend even less .
" the north-south divide correlates with national statistics on internet use , " says bernd henning .
" the worse the weather , the more time people spend on the internet .

some are pushing for an international emblem to distinguish the media . at least 1,200 reporters have been killed worldwide over the past 12 years and no one has been brought to justice in about 95 percent of the cases , said aidan white , secretary general of the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- . in iraq alone , more than 50 reporters and media staff have been killed since the us-led invasion in march 2003 , according to figures from the ifj , which represents half a million correspondents globally . desperate to combat the problem , 14 media associations signed a declaration after a two-day meeting in geneva to make journalism safer , primarily by pressing governments to comply with international laws that safeguard reporters , namely the geneva conventions on the rules of war . " if governments today honored the obligations they already have under international law we would not be facing the crisis we have , " white told a news conference at the end of the meeting , which was also attended by non-governmental organizations and human rights groups . at present , he said , countries failed to investigate media deaths or provide journalists with adequate protection and at times were even responsible for the murders .
" this declaration is a good step forward .
we have started a process , which we now know we will continue , " said white . proposed symbol would act as a bulls-eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporters georges malbrunot and christian chesnot were held captive in iraq .
but the accord fell short of some participants ' desire to establish a press emblem that would alert people to the media in a similar way as the red cross symbol and un flag are used to identify aid workers . instead , the ifj merely promised to study the idea after fears were expressed that such an emblem - the word " press " written in black letters on an orange-colored disk - would make many reporters in hot spots such as iraq or colombia an even easier target for those who oppose their work .
" a visible identification mark for journalists would be calculated suicide , " henrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists federation , told dw-world .
in some conflict areas it might make sense to identify the press with a universal emblem , he said , but in others , such as iraq or the former yugoslavia , where journalists are often singled out , such a marking would have the reverse effect of protection .
the german organization is not alone in being torn between wanting to protect its members and worrying that an emblem might backfire .
" there were diverging opinions on the emblem so we decided to look deeper into the practical and legal issues involved , " said blaise lempen , a founding member of the press emblem campaign , a group of largely geneva-based correspondents that organized the meeting , and a strong advocate of the idea .
a convention was needed to create a universally-recognized press logo , backed by the full support of governments and international law , that would arm anyone who is harmed wearing it with strong legal redress , lempen , a reporter for the swiss news agency ats , said during the talks . the real issue of increasing deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist were wounded when a us tank fired at their hotel in baghdad in april , 2003 .
in contrast , rodney pinder , director of the international news safety institute , a recently-established body that groups about 60 news organizations , argued that debate on an emblem was a dangerous distraction to the real issue - the fact that more and more journalists are dying . " there is already a well recognized emblem - the ' press ' and ' tv ' signs that are often displayed - yet journalists are being killed now in greater numbers than ever before , " pinder told afp on the sidelines of the meeting . a perception that people can target journalists with impunity coupled with the perceived loss of the media 's neutrality in conflict zones were far more pressing matters , he said . white agreed that it would be difficult to generate support from major news organizations for a new emblem when already established mechanisms to protect journalists are ignored . signatories to the document - which also promises to create a group of experts who will draw up a list of practical measures that can be taken to boost the protection of journalists - included the ifj , the european broadcasting union , the syndicate of iraqi journalists and media rights watchdog reporters without borders . they are due to meet again in the united arab emirates early next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2004 the dangerous quest for news großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more journalists are becoming victims while working in war zones more journalists are being targeted or caught in the crossfire of war zones and need greater protection , a group of experts said .
some are pushing for an international emblem to distinguish the media . at least 1,200 reporters have been killed worldwide over the past 12 years and no one has been brought to justice in about 95 percent of the cases , said aidan white , secretary general of the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- . in iraq alone , more than 50 reporters and media staff have been killed since the us-led invasion in march 2003 , according to figures from the ifj , which represents half a million correspondents globally . desperate to combat the problem , 14 media associations signed a declaration after a two-day meeting in geneva to make journalism safer , primarily by pressing governments to comply with international laws that safeguard reporters , namely the geneva conventions on the rules of war . " if governments today honored the obligations they already have under international law we would not be facing the crisis we have , " white told a news conference at the end of the meeting , which was also attended by non-governmental organizations and human rights groups . at present , he said , countries failed to investigate media deaths or provide journalists with adequate protection and at times were even responsible for the murders .
" this declaration is a good step forward .
we have started a process , which we now know we will continue , " said white . proposed symbol would act as a bulls-eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporters georges malbrunot and christian chesnot were held captive in iraq .
but the accord fell short of some participants ' desire to establish a press emblem that would alert people to the media in a similar way as the red cross symbol and un flag are used to identify aid workers . instead , the ifj merely promised to study the idea after fears were expressed that such an emblem - the word " press " written in black letters on an orange-colored disk - would make many reporters in hot spots such as iraq or colombia an even easier target for those who oppose their work .
" a visible identification mark for journalists would be calculated suicide , " henrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists federation , told dw-world .
in some conflict areas it might make sense to identify the press with a universal emblem , he said , but in others , such as iraq or the former yugoslavia , where journalists are often singled out , such a marking would have the reverse effect of protection .
the german organization is not alone in being torn between wanting to protect its members and worrying that an emblem might backfire .
" there were diverging opinions on the emblem so we decided to look deeper into the practical and legal issues involved , " said blaise lempen , a founding member of the press emblem campaign , a group of largely geneva-based correspondents that organized the meeting , and a strong advocate of the idea .
a convention was needed to create a universally-recognized press logo , backed by the full support of governments and international law , that would arm anyone who is harmed wearing it with strong legal redress , lempen , a reporter for the swiss news agency ats , said during the talks . the real issue of increasing deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist were wounded when a us tank fired at their hotel in baghdad in april , 2003 .
in contrast , rodney pinder , director of the international news safety institute , a recently-established body that groups about 60 news organizations , argued that debate on an emblem was a dangerous distraction to the real issue - the fact that more and more journalists are dying . " there is already a well recognized emblem - the ' press ' and ' tv ' signs that are often displayed - yet journalists are being killed now in greater numbers than ever before , " pinder told afp on the sidelines of the meeting . a perception that people can target journalists with impunity coupled with the perceived loss of the media 's neutrality in conflict zones were far more pressing matters , he said . white agreed that it would be difficult to generate support from major news organizations for a new emblem when already established mechanisms to protect journalists are ignored . signatories to the document - which also promises to create a group of experts who will draw up a list of practical measures that can be taken to boost the protection of journalists - included the ifj , the european broadcasting union , the syndicate of iraqi journalists and media rights watchdog reporters without borders . they are due to meet again in the united arab emirates early next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

" we are heading in the direction of lifting -lrb- the embargo -rrb- .
it still has to be confirmed by ministers , " one eu diplomat told the afp news agency , expressing caution since two or three national delegations were still consulting with their capitals .
" but in principle there should n't be any surprises . " sanctions were imposed on libya because of its role in state-sponsored terrorism , including the 1986 airliner bombing over lockerbie , scotland .
they were partially eased last year , paving the way for tripoli to compensate victims ' families .
in theory the ban should be lifted at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers , scheduled for october 11-12 in luxembourg , officials said . italian pressure the italian government said last week it was determined to press the matter forward , even if the eu struggled to agree unanimously on the issue .
italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu said rome was ready to take exceptional measures , including ignoring eu sanctions , to force the move through at eu level . he said that if italy 's eu neighbors were not unanimous in wanting to lift the sanctions , italy would do so unilaterally under a rule which allows such actions when a country is confronted by an exceptional problem .
italy considers libya a major hub for clandestine migrants from african countries and has already signed cooperation agreements to help the libyan authorities combat the problem . pisanu plans to travel to libya on september 26 .
tripoli has warned that it would be unable to stem the flow of illegal immigrants into europe from its territory unless the eu lifted the sanctions . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels meeting with eu leaders tuesday , moammar gadhafi makes his first visit to europe in 15 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2004 g4 nations bid for permanent security council seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the representatives of the g4 nations mark their joint bid germany , japan , brazil and india - the so-called g4 group - launched a joint effort for permament seats on the united nations security council after meeting on the fringes of the un general assembly in new york . after meeting on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer , brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva and the indian and japanese prime ministers , manmohan singh and junichiro koizumi delivered a joint statement launching a united bid for permanent un security council seats , arguing that expanded membership was crucial to addressing new global threats .
the declaration stated that germany , brazil , india and japan , known as the g4 nations , " based on the firmly shared recognition that they are legitimate candidates for permanent membership in an expanded security council , support each other 's candidature . "
" the security council must reflect the realities of the international community in the 21st century , " the statement continued , echoing many voices within the united nations including that of un secretary general kofi annan , saying that the broadening of representation on the 15-nation council would strengthen the moral authority of decisions taken by the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in order for the international community to effectively address the various threats and challenges that it presently faces , it is important to reform the united nations as a whole , " a further passage read .
such a reform of the council , which passes resolutions that are binding for the un 's 191 member states , is long overdue , both supporters and critics of the institution say .
the council has had the same five permanent members with veto power - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - since the united nations was established in the wake of world war ii .
ten other nations are elected as non-permanent members for two-year rotation terms .
proposed reforms biggest in 60-year history the proposal put forward by the four nations , which also envisages a permanent seat for africa and an expansion of the non-permanent council membership , would represent the largest shake-up at the top decision-making body of the united nations in its nearly 60-year history . a high-level panel set up by kofi annan to research the possibilities of reform is scheduled to offer concrete proposals for change in december .
annan was recently quoted as saying the question of reform took on added urgency after last year 's crisis over iraq , when the united states went to war without the backing of the council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer .
germany , who is the third highest contributor to un coffers behind the united states and japan , has lobbied strongly for a permanent seat on the council as its two year term as a non-permanent member comes to an end this december .
foreign minister fischer has recently completed an exhaustive tour of countries in a bid to drum up support for germany 's campaign for permanent status .
his work seemed to have paid off on tuesday night . fischer sees g4 as natural candidates " all four states regard themselves as natural candidates , " fischer said after the meeting , " based on what they are doing for the un , what they are capable of doing and also because of their regional roles . "
at least one of the five current permanent members , britain , has already voiced its support for all four bids .
old regional animosities , however , are likely to ensure that none of the candidates enjoys an easy ride .
germany is likely to face opposition from italy , a solid ally of the united states in iraq , for its stance against the 2003 invasion . opposition may bar the way pakistan could find it hard to accept india , their nuclear-armed neighbor , while brazil 's bid might get a lukewarm reception in mexico and argentina , and china on tuesday indicated reservations over japan 's candidacy , saying the un was " not a board of directors " whose composition could be decided by " the financial contribution of its members . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi .
addressing the general assembly later in the day , japanese prime minister koizumi fleshed out his country 's credentials , pointing to its reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan , as well as its leading role in talks to resolve the north korean nuclear issue . " countries with the will and resources to play a major role in international peace and security must always take part in the council 's decision-making process , " he said .
koizumi also claimed a unique voice for japan as the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack . the four countries also said that africa , the poorest continent in the united nations , " must also be represented in the permanent membership of the security council . "
african leaders are debating which country from the vast continent might get a permanent security council seat if one is made available .

some are pushing for an international emblem to distinguish the media . at least 1,200 reporters have been killed worldwide over the past 12 years and no one has been brought to justice in about 95 percent of the cases , said aidan white , secretary general of the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- . in iraq alone , more than 50 reporters and media staff have been killed since the us-led invasion in march 2003 , according to figures from the ifj , which represents half a million correspondents globally . desperate to combat the problem , 14 media associations signed a declaration after a two-day meeting in geneva to make journalism safer , primarily by pressing governments to comply with international laws that safeguard reporters , namely the geneva conventions on the rules of war . " if governments today honored the obligations they already have under international law we would not be facing the crisis we have , " white told a news conference at the end of the meeting , which was also attended by non-governmental organizations and human rights groups . at present , he said , countries failed to investigate media deaths or provide journalists with adequate protection and at times were even responsible for the murders .
" this declaration is a good step forward .
we have started a process , which we now know we will continue , " said white . proposed symbol would act as a bulls-eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporters georges malbrunot and christian chesnot were held captive in iraq .

the declaration stated that germany , brazil , india and japan , known as the g4 nations , " based on the firmly shared recognition that they are legitimate candidates for permanent membership in an expanded security council , support each other 's candidature . "
" the security council must reflect the realities of the international community in the 21st century , " the statement continued , echoing many voices within the united nations including that of un secretary general kofi annan , saying that the broadening of representation on the 15-nation council would strengthen the moral authority of decisions taken by the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in order for the international community to effectively address the various threats and challenges that it presently faces , it is important to reform the united nations as a whole , " a further passage read .
such a reform of the council , which passes resolutions that are binding for the un 's 191 member states , is long overdue , both supporters and critics of the institution say .
the council has had the same five permanent members with veto power - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - since the united nations was established in the wake of world war ii .
ten other nations are elected as non-permanent members for two-year rotation terms .
proposed reforms biggest in 60-year history the proposal put forward by the four nations , which also envisages a permanent seat for africa and an expansion of the non-permanent council membership , would represent the largest shake-up at the top decision-making body of the united nations in its nearly 60-year history . a high-level panel set up by kofi annan to research the possibilities of reform is scheduled to offer concrete proposals for change in december .
annan was recently quoted as saying the question of reform took on added urgency after last year 's crisis over iraq , when the united states went to war without the backing of the council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer .
germany , who is the third highest contributor to un coffers behind the united states and japan , has lobbied strongly for a permanent seat on the council as its two year term as a non-permanent member comes to an end this december .
foreign minister fischer has recently completed an exhaustive tour of countries in a bid to drum up support for germany 's campaign for permanent status .
his work seemed to have paid off on tuesday night . fischer sees g4 as natural candidates " all four states regard themselves as natural candidates , " fischer said after the meeting , " based on what they are doing for the un , what they are capable of doing and also because of their regional roles . "
at least one of the five current permanent members , britain , has already voiced its support for all four bids .
old regional animosities , however , are likely to ensure that none of the candidates enjoys an easy ride .
germany is likely to face opposition from italy , a solid ally of the united states in iraq , for its stance against the 2003 invasion . opposition may bar the way pakistan could find it hard to accept india , their nuclear-armed neighbor , while brazil 's bid might get a lukewarm reception in mexico and argentina , and china on tuesday indicated reservations over japan 's candidacy , saying the un was " not a board of directors " whose composition could be decided by " the financial contribution of its members . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi .
addressing the general assembly later in the day , japanese prime minister koizumi fleshed out his country 's credentials , pointing to its reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan , as well as its leading role in talks to resolve the north korean nuclear issue . " countries with the will and resources to play a major role in international peace and security must always take part in the council 's decision-making process , " he said .
koizumi also claimed a unique voice for japan as the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack . the four countries also said that africa , the poorest continent in the united nations , " must also be represented in the permanent membership of the security council . "
african leaders are debating which country from the vast continent might get a permanent security council seat if one is made available .

the declaration stated that germany , brazil , india and japan , known as the g4 nations , " based on the firmly shared recognition that they are legitimate candidates for permanent membership in an expanded security council , support each other 's candidature . "
" the security council must reflect the realities of the international community in the 21st century , " the statement continued , echoing many voices within the united nations including that of un secretary general kofi annan , saying that the broadening of representation on the 15-nation council would strengthen the moral authority of decisions taken by the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in order for the international community to effectively address the various threats and challenges that it presently faces , it is important to reform the united nations as a whole , " a further passage read .
such a reform of the council , which passes resolutions that are binding for the un 's 191 member states , is long overdue , both supporters and critics of the institution say .
the council has had the same five permanent members with veto power - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - since the united nations was established in the wake of world war ii .
ten other nations are elected as non-permanent members for two-year rotation terms .
proposed reforms biggest in 60-year history the proposal put forward by the four nations , which also envisages a permanent seat for africa and an expansion of the non-permanent council membership , would represent the largest shake-up at the top decision-making body of the united nations in its nearly 60-year history . a high-level panel set up by kofi annan to research the possibilities of reform is scheduled to offer concrete proposals for change in december .
annan was recently quoted as saying the question of reform took on added urgency after last year 's crisis over iraq , when the united states went to war without the backing of the council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer .
germany , who is the third highest contributor to un coffers behind the united states and japan , has lobbied strongly for a permanent seat on the council as its two year term as a non-permanent member comes to an end this december .
foreign minister fischer has recently completed an exhaustive tour of countries in a bid to drum up support for germany 's campaign for permanent status .
his work seemed to have paid off on tuesday night . fischer sees g4 as natural candidates " all four states regard themselves as natural candidates , " fischer said after the meeting , " based on what they are doing for the un , what they are capable of doing and also because of their regional roles . "
at least one of the five current permanent members , britain , has already voiced its support for all four bids .
old regional animosities , however , are likely to ensure that none of the candidates enjoys an easy ride .
germany is likely to face opposition from italy , a solid ally of the united states in iraq , for its stance against the 2003 invasion . opposition may bar the way pakistan could find it hard to accept india , their nuclear-armed neighbor , while brazil 's bid might get a lukewarm reception in mexico and argentina , and china on tuesday indicated reservations over japan 's candidacy , saying the un was " not a board of directors " whose composition could be decided by " the financial contribution of its members . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi .
addressing the general assembly later in the day , japanese prime minister koizumi fleshed out his country 's credentials , pointing to its reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan , as well as its leading role in talks to resolve the north korean nuclear issue . " countries with the will and resources to play a major role in international peace and security must always take part in the council 's decision-making process , " he said .
koizumi also claimed a unique voice for japan as the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack . the four countries also said that africa , the poorest continent in the united nations , " must also be represented in the permanent membership of the security council . "
african leaders are debating which country from the vast continent might get a permanent security council seat if one is made available .
tanzania put itself forward as a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the council , saying it would seek election before august . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to push for un security council seat german foreign minster joschka fischer headed to new york on monday to attend this week 's meeting of the un general assembly .

the giant wookie gave up his seat as co-pilot on the millennium falcon to fly club class from australia to germany as part of his duties in promoting the imminent release of the original star wars trilogy on dvd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chewbacca goes sight-seeing .
surprised onlookers stood open mouthed as chewie emerged from his suite at the kempinski bristol hotel to join in with a street band playing a set on the breitscheid platz .
obviously missing the delights of his local cantina , chewbacca added some vocals and smooth dance moves to the show before heading to the famous brandenburg gate for a photo opportunity beneath the symbol of german unity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does this thing reach light speed ?
chewbacca then took to a velo taxi , a mode of transport unlikely to carry him into hyperspace , for a tour of the park on ebertstrasse .
even the awesomely-built wookie 's legs could n't power the peddle car fast enough for the jump to light speed so he gave up with a roar and headed to one of berlin 's most famous relics from the recent past , the remains of the wall . chewie sightings flood berlin media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way to tatooine ?
as a freedom fighter used to struggling against oppressive political regimes , chewie appreciated the wall and its downfall before heading to potsdamer platz on his way to berlin zoo .
by now , news was out all over the capital and local broadcaster radio rtl 104.6 even began broadcasting a series of " chewbacca sighting " alerts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully , herr schröder looked nothing like the evil emperor .
privacy becomes a problem when you 're two meters tall and covered in hair , so after devouring an ice-cream at the zoo , chewie hid in the bushes for a while before making a quick stop off at germany 's seat of power , the bundestag . satisfied that it was n't as corrupt as the galactic senate , chewie saw no need to unleash his crossbow lazer and headed back to his hotel suite to prepare for his next mission , his visit to london . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the very best of and finally ...

' sticky ads ' and ' interstitials ' , for example - ads that display between two pages of a website - are interruptive , like television advertising , rather than passive , like web banner advertising . another trend is keyword marketing .
search engines like google and yahoo auction off prime positions on their pages , primarily to internet traders with a vested interest in appearing at the top of the list in response to a query for , for example , ' digital camera ' . these hits are known as " sponsored listings " . even though the growth in the online advertising market is considerable , its budgets are still far smaller than in other media .
according to the 2003 focus mediaguide , the online share of the total us advertising budget was just three percent . even in norway , denmark and estonia , the european countries spending most on online advertising , the budget is negligible . mediterranean countries spend even less .
" the north-south divide correlates with national statistics on internet use , " says bernd henning .

the declaration stated that germany , brazil , india and japan , known as the g4 nations , " based on the firmly shared recognition that they are legitimate candidates for permanent membership in an expanded security council , support each other 's candidature . "
" the security council must reflect the realities of the international community in the 21st century , " the statement continued , echoing many voices within the united nations including that of un secretary general kofi annan , saying that the broadening of representation on the 15-nation council would strengthen the moral authority of decisions taken by the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in order for the international community to effectively address the various threats and challenges that it presently faces , it is important to reform the united nations as a whole , " a further passage read .
such a reform of the council , which passes resolutions that are binding for the un 's 191 member states , is long overdue , both supporters and critics of the institution say .
the council has had the same five permanent members with veto power - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - since the united nations was established in the wake of world war ii .
ten other nations are elected as non-permanent members for two-year rotation terms .
proposed reforms biggest in 60-year history the proposal put forward by the four nations , which also envisages a permanent seat for africa and an expansion of the non-permanent council membership , would represent the largest shake-up at the top decision-making body of the united nations in its nearly 60-year history . a high-level panel set up by kofi annan to research the possibilities of reform is scheduled to offer concrete proposals for change in december .
annan was recently quoted as saying the question of reform took on added urgency after last year 's crisis over iraq , when the united states went to war without the backing of the council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer .
germany , who is the third highest contributor to un coffers behind the united states and japan , has lobbied strongly for a permanent seat on the council as its two year term as a non-permanent member comes to an end this december .
foreign minister fischer has recently completed an exhaustive tour of countries in a bid to drum up support for germany 's campaign for permanent status .
his work seemed to have paid off on tuesday night . fischer sees g4 as natural candidates " all four states regard themselves as natural candidates , " fischer said after the meeting , " based on what they are doing for the un , what they are capable of doing and also because of their regional roles . "
at least one of the five current permanent members , britain , has already voiced its support for all four bids .
old regional animosities , however , are likely to ensure that none of the candidates enjoys an easy ride .
germany is likely to face opposition from italy , a solid ally of the united states in iraq , for its stance against the 2003 invasion . opposition may bar the way pakistan could find it hard to accept india , their nuclear-armed neighbor , while brazil 's bid might get a lukewarm reception in mexico and argentina , and china on tuesday indicated reservations over japan 's candidacy , saying the un was " not a board of directors " whose composition could be decided by " the financial contribution of its members . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi .
addressing the general assembly later in the day , japanese prime minister koizumi fleshed out his country 's credentials , pointing to its reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan , as well as its leading role in talks to resolve the north korean nuclear issue . " countries with the will and resources to play a major role in international peace and security must always take part in the council 's decision-making process , " he said .
koizumi also claimed a unique voice for japan as the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack . the four countries also said that africa , the poorest continent in the united nations , " must also be represented in the permanent membership of the security council . "
african leaders are debating which country from the vast continent might get a permanent security council seat if one is made available .
tanzania put itself forward as a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the council , saying it would seek election before august . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to push for un security council seat german foreign minster joschka fischer headed to new york on monday to attend this week 's meeting of the un general assembly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2004 the dangerous quest for news großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more journalists are becoming victims while working in war zones more journalists are being targeted or caught in the crossfire of war zones and need greater protection , a group of experts said .
some are pushing for an international emblem to distinguish the media . at least 1,200 reporters have been killed worldwide over the past 12 years and no one has been brought to justice in about 95 percent of the cases , said aidan white , secretary general of the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- . in iraq alone , more than 50 reporters and media staff have been killed since the us-led invasion in march 2003 , according to figures from the ifj , which represents half a million correspondents globally . desperate to combat the problem , 14 media associations signed a declaration after a two-day meeting in geneva to make journalism safer , primarily by pressing governments to comply with international laws that safeguard reporters , namely the geneva conventions on the rules of war . " if governments today honored the obligations they already have under international law we would not be facing the crisis we have , " white told a news conference at the end of the meeting , which was also attended by non-governmental organizations and human rights groups . at present , he said , countries failed to investigate media deaths or provide journalists with adequate protection and at times were even responsible for the murders .
" this declaration is a good step forward .
we have started a process , which we now know we will continue , " said white . proposed symbol would act as a bulls-eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporters georges malbrunot and christian chesnot were held captive in iraq .
but the accord fell short of some participants ' desire to establish a press emblem that would alert people to the media in a similar way as the red cross symbol and un flag are used to identify aid workers . instead , the ifj merely promised to study the idea after fears were expressed that such an emblem - the word " press " written in black letters on an orange-colored disk - would make many reporters in hot spots such as iraq or colombia an even easier target for those who oppose their work .
" a visible identification mark for journalists would be calculated suicide , " henrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists federation , told dw-world .
in some conflict areas it might make sense to identify the press with a universal emblem , he said , but in others , such as iraq or the former yugoslavia , where journalists are often singled out , such a marking would have the reverse effect of protection .
the german organization is not alone in being torn between wanting to protect its members and worrying that an emblem might backfire .
" there were diverging opinions on the emblem so we decided to look deeper into the practical and legal issues involved , " said blaise lempen , a founding member of the press emblem campaign , a group of largely geneva-based correspondents that organized the meeting , and a strong advocate of the idea .
a convention was needed to create a universally-recognized press logo , backed by the full support of governments and international law , that would arm anyone who is harmed wearing it with strong legal redress , lempen , a reporter for the swiss news agency ats , said during the talks . the real issue of increasing deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist were wounded when a us tank fired at their hotel in baghdad in april , 2003 .
in contrast , rodney pinder , director of the international news safety institute , a recently-established body that groups about 60 news organizations , argued that debate on an emblem was a dangerous distraction to the real issue - the fact that more and more journalists are dying . " there is already a well recognized emblem - the ' press ' and ' tv ' signs that are often displayed - yet journalists are being killed now in greater numbers than ever before , " pinder told afp on the sidelines of the meeting . a perception that people can target journalists with impunity coupled with the perceived loss of the media 's neutrality in conflict zones were far more pressing matters , he said . white agreed that it would be difficult to generate support from major news organizations for a new emblem when already established mechanisms to protect journalists are ignored . signatories to the document - which also promises to create a group of experts who will draw up a list of practical measures that can be taken to boost the protection of journalists - included the ifj , the european broadcasting union , the syndicate of iraqi journalists and media rights watchdog reporters without borders . they are due to meet again in the united arab emirates early next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

some are pushing for an international emblem to distinguish the media . at least 1,200 reporters have been killed worldwide over the past 12 years and no one has been brought to justice in about 95 percent of the cases , said aidan white , secretary general of the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- . in iraq alone , more than 50 reporters and media staff have been killed since the us-led invasion in march 2003 , according to figures from the ifj , which represents half a million correspondents globally . desperate to combat the problem , 14 media associations signed a declaration after a two-day meeting in geneva to make journalism safer , primarily by pressing governments to comply with international laws that safeguard reporters , namely the geneva conventions on the rules of war . " if governments today honored the obligations they already have under international law we would not be facing the crisis we have , " white told a news conference at the end of the meeting , which was also attended by non-governmental organizations and human rights groups . at present , he said , countries failed to investigate media deaths or provide journalists with adequate protection and at times were even responsible for the murders .
" this declaration is a good step forward .
we have started a process , which we now know we will continue , " said white . proposed symbol would act as a bulls-eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporters georges malbrunot and christian chesnot were held captive in iraq .
but the accord fell short of some participants ' desire to establish a press emblem that would alert people to the media in a similar way as the red cross symbol and un flag are used to identify aid workers . instead , the ifj merely promised to study the idea after fears were expressed that such an emblem - the word " press " written in black letters on an orange-colored disk - would make many reporters in hot spots such as iraq or colombia an even easier target for those who oppose their work .
" a visible identification mark for journalists would be calculated suicide , " henrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists federation , told dw-world .
in some conflict areas it might make sense to identify the press with a universal emblem , he said , but in others , such as iraq or the former yugoslavia , where journalists are often singled out , such a marking would have the reverse effect of protection .
the german organization is not alone in being torn between wanting to protect its members and worrying that an emblem might backfire .
" there were diverging opinions on the emblem so we decided to look deeper into the practical and legal issues involved , " said blaise lempen , a founding member of the press emblem campaign , a group of largely geneva-based correspondents that organized the meeting , and a strong advocate of the idea .
a convention was needed to create a universally-recognized press logo , backed by the full support of governments and international law , that would arm anyone who is harmed wearing it with strong legal redress , lempen , a reporter for the swiss news agency ats , said during the talks . the real issue of increasing deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist were wounded when a us tank fired at their hotel in baghdad in april , 2003 .
in contrast , rodney pinder , director of the international news safety institute , a recently-established body that groups about 60 news organizations , argued that debate on an emblem was a dangerous distraction to the real issue - the fact that more and more journalists are dying . " there is already a well recognized emblem - the ' press ' and ' tv ' signs that are often displayed - yet journalists are being killed now in greater numbers than ever before , " pinder told afp on the sidelines of the meeting . a perception that people can target journalists with impunity coupled with the perceived loss of the media 's neutrality in conflict zones were far more pressing matters , he said . white agreed that it would be difficult to generate support from major news organizations for a new emblem when already established mechanisms to protect journalists are ignored . signatories to the document - which also promises to create a group of experts who will draw up a list of practical measures that can be taken to boost the protection of journalists - included the ifj , the european broadcasting union , the syndicate of iraqi journalists and media rights watchdog reporters without borders . they are due to meet again in the united arab emirates early next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

" we are heading in the direction of lifting -lrb- the embargo -rrb- .
it still has to be confirmed by ministers , " one eu diplomat told the afp news agency , expressing caution since two or three national delegations were still consulting with their capitals .
" but in principle there should n't be any surprises . " sanctions were imposed on libya because of its role in state-sponsored terrorism , including the 1986 airliner bombing over lockerbie , scotland .
they were partially eased last year , paving the way for tripoli to compensate victims ' families .
in theory the ban should be lifted at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers , scheduled for october 11-12 in luxembourg , officials said . italian pressure the italian government said last week it was determined to press the matter forward , even if the eu struggled to agree unanimously on the issue .
italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu said rome was ready to take exceptional measures , including ignoring eu sanctions , to force the move through at eu level . he said that if italy 's eu neighbors were not unanimous in wanting to lift the sanctions , italy would do so unilaterally under a rule which allows such actions when a country is confronted by an exceptional problem .
italy considers libya a major hub for clandestine migrants from african countries and has already signed cooperation agreements to help the libyan authorities combat the problem . pisanu plans to travel to libya on september 26 .
tripoli has warned that it would be unable to stem the flow of illegal immigrants into europe from its territory unless the eu lifted the sanctions . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels meeting with eu leaders tuesday , moammar gadhafi makes his first visit to europe in 15 years .
the trip is a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2004 g4 nations bid for permanent security council seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the representatives of the g4 nations mark their joint bid germany , japan , brazil and india - the so-called g4 group - launched a joint effort for permament seats on the united nations security council after meeting on the fringes of the un general assembly in new york . after meeting on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer , brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva and the indian and japanese prime ministers , manmohan singh and junichiro koizumi delivered a joint statement launching a united bid for permanent un security council seats , arguing that expanded membership was crucial to addressing new global threats .
the declaration stated that germany , brazil , india and japan , known as the g4 nations , " based on the firmly shared recognition that they are legitimate candidates for permanent membership in an expanded security council , support each other 's candidature . "
" the security council must reflect the realities of the international community in the 21st century , " the statement continued , echoing many voices within the united nations including that of un secretary general kofi annan , saying that the broadening of representation on the 15-nation council would strengthen the moral authority of decisions taken by the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in order for the international community to effectively address the various threats and challenges that it presently faces , it is important to reform the united nations as a whole , " a further passage read .
such a reform of the council , which passes resolutions that are binding for the un 's 191 member states , is long overdue , both supporters and critics of the institution say .
the council has had the same five permanent members with veto power - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - since the united nations was established in the wake of world war ii .
ten other nations are elected as non-permanent members for two-year rotation terms .
proposed reforms biggest in 60-year history the proposal put forward by the four nations , which also envisages a permanent seat for africa and an expansion of the non-permanent council membership , would represent the largest shake-up at the top decision-making body of the united nations in its nearly 60-year history . a high-level panel set up by kofi annan to research the possibilities of reform is scheduled to offer concrete proposals for change in december .
annan was recently quoted as saying the question of reform took on added urgency after last year 's crisis over iraq , when the united states went to war without the backing of the council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer .
germany , who is the third highest contributor to un coffers behind the united states and japan , has lobbied strongly for a permanent seat on the council as its two year term as a non-permanent member comes to an end this december .
foreign minister fischer has recently completed an exhaustive tour of countries in a bid to drum up support for germany 's campaign for permanent status .
his work seemed to have paid off on tuesday night . fischer sees g4 as natural candidates " all four states regard themselves as natural candidates , " fischer said after the meeting , " based on what they are doing for the un , what they are capable of doing and also because of their regional roles . "
at least one of the five current permanent members , britain , has already voiced its support for all four bids .
old regional animosities , however , are likely to ensure that none of the candidates enjoys an easy ride .
germany is likely to face opposition from italy , a solid ally of the united states in iraq , for its stance against the 2003 invasion . opposition may bar the way pakistan could find it hard to accept india , their nuclear-armed neighbor , while brazil 's bid might get a lukewarm reception in mexico and argentina , and china on tuesday indicated reservations over japan 's candidacy , saying the un was " not a board of directors " whose composition could be decided by " the financial contribution of its members . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi .
addressing the general assembly later in the day , japanese prime minister koizumi fleshed out his country 's credentials , pointing to its reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan , as well as its leading role in talks to resolve the north korean nuclear issue . " countries with the will and resources to play a major role in international peace and security must always take part in the council 's decision-making process , " he said .
koizumi also claimed a unique voice for japan as the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack . the four countries also said that africa , the poorest continent in the united nations , " must also be represented in the permanent membership of the security council . "
african leaders are debating which country from the vast continent might get a permanent security council seat if one is made available .
tanzania put itself forward as a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the council , saying it would seek election before august . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to push for un security council seat german foreign minster joschka fischer headed to new york on monday to attend this week 's meeting of the un general assembly .

the declaration stated that germany , brazil , india and japan , known as the g4 nations , " based on the firmly shared recognition that they are legitimate candidates for permanent membership in an expanded security council , support each other 's candidature . "
" the security council must reflect the realities of the international community in the 21st century , " the statement continued , echoing many voices within the united nations including that of un secretary general kofi annan , saying that the broadening of representation on the 15-nation council would strengthen the moral authority of decisions taken by the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in order for the international community to effectively address the various threats and challenges that it presently faces , it is important to reform the united nations as a whole , " a further passage read .
such a reform of the council , which passes resolutions that are binding for the un 's 191 member states , is long overdue , both supporters and critics of the institution say .
the council has had the same five permanent members with veto power - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - since the united nations was established in the wake of world war ii .
ten other nations are elected as non-permanent members for two-year rotation terms .
proposed reforms biggest in 60-year history the proposal put forward by the four nations , which also envisages a permanent seat for africa and an expansion of the non-permanent council membership , would represent the largest shake-up at the top decision-making body of the united nations in its nearly 60-year history . a high-level panel set up by kofi annan to research the possibilities of reform is scheduled to offer concrete proposals for change in december .
annan was recently quoted as saying the question of reform took on added urgency after last year 's crisis over iraq , when the united states went to war without the backing of the council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer .
germany , who is the third highest contributor to un coffers behind the united states and japan , has lobbied strongly for a permanent seat on the council as its two year term as a non-permanent member comes to an end this december .
foreign minister fischer has recently completed an exhaustive tour of countries in a bid to drum up support for germany 's campaign for permanent status .
his work seemed to have paid off on tuesday night . fischer sees g4 as natural candidates " all four states regard themselves as natural candidates , " fischer said after the meeting , " based on what they are doing for the un , what they are capable of doing and also because of their regional roles . "
at least one of the five current permanent members , britain , has already voiced its support for all four bids .
old regional animosities , however , are likely to ensure that none of the candidates enjoys an easy ride .
germany is likely to face opposition from italy , a solid ally of the united states in iraq , for its stance against the 2003 invasion . opposition may bar the way pakistan could find it hard to accept india , their nuclear-armed neighbor , while brazil 's bid might get a lukewarm reception in mexico and argentina , and china on tuesday indicated reservations over japan 's candidacy , saying the un was " not a board of directors " whose composition could be decided by " the financial contribution of its members . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi .
addressing the general assembly later in the day , japanese prime minister koizumi fleshed out his country 's credentials , pointing to its reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan , as well as its leading role in talks to resolve the north korean nuclear issue . " countries with the will and resources to play a major role in international peace and security must always take part in the council 's decision-making process , " he said .
koizumi also claimed a unique voice for japan as the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack . the four countries also said that africa , the poorest continent in the united nations , " must also be represented in the permanent membership of the security council . "
african leaders are debating which country from the vast continent might get a permanent security council seat if one is made available .

the declaration stated that germany , brazil , india and japan , known as the g4 nations , " based on the firmly shared recognition that they are legitimate candidates for permanent membership in an expanded security council , support each other 's candidature . "
" the security council must reflect the realities of the international community in the 21st century , " the statement continued , echoing many voices within the united nations including that of un secretary general kofi annan , saying that the broadening of representation on the 15-nation council would strengthen the moral authority of decisions taken by the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in order for the international community to effectively address the various threats and challenges that it presently faces , it is important to reform the united nations as a whole , " a further passage read .
such a reform of the council , which passes resolutions that are binding for the un 's 191 member states , is long overdue , both supporters and critics of the institution say .
the council has had the same five permanent members with veto power - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - since the united nations was established in the wake of world war ii .
ten other nations are elected as non-permanent members for two-year rotation terms .

some are pushing for an international emblem to distinguish the media . at least 1,200 reporters have been killed worldwide over the past 12 years and no one has been brought to justice in about 95 percent of the cases , said aidan white , secretary general of the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- . in iraq alone , more than 50 reporters and media staff have been killed since the us-led invasion in march 2003 , according to figures from the ifj , which represents half a million correspondents globally . desperate to combat the problem , 14 media associations signed a declaration after a two-day meeting in geneva to make journalism safer , primarily by pressing governments to comply with international laws that safeguard reporters , namely the geneva conventions on the rules of war . " if governments today honored the obligations they already have under international law we would not be facing the crisis we have , " white told a news conference at the end of the meeting , which was also attended by non-governmental organizations and human rights groups . at present , he said , countries failed to investigate media deaths or provide journalists with adequate protection and at times were even responsible for the murders .
" this declaration is a good step forward .
we have started a process , which we now know we will continue , " said white . proposed symbol would act as a bulls-eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporters georges malbrunot and christian chesnot were held captive in iraq .
but the accord fell short of some participants ' desire to establish a press emblem that would alert people to the media in a similar way as the red cross symbol and un flag are used to identify aid workers . instead , the ifj merely promised to study the idea after fears were expressed that such an emblem - the word " press " written in black letters on an orange-colored disk - would make many reporters in hot spots such as iraq or colombia an even easier target for those who oppose their work .
" a visible identification mark for journalists would be calculated suicide , " henrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists federation , told dw-world .
in some conflict areas it might make sense to identify the press with a universal emblem , he said , but in others , such as iraq or the former yugoslavia , where journalists are often singled out , such a marking would have the reverse effect of protection .
the german organization is not alone in being torn between wanting to protect its members and worrying that an emblem might backfire .
" there were diverging opinions on the emblem so we decided to look deeper into the practical and legal issues involved , " said blaise lempen , a founding member of the press emblem campaign , a group of largely geneva-based correspondents that organized the meeting , and a strong advocate of the idea .
a convention was needed to create a universally-recognized press logo , backed by the full support of governments and international law , that would arm anyone who is harmed wearing it with strong legal redress , lempen , a reporter for the swiss news agency ats , said during the talks . the real issue of increasing deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist were wounded when a us tank fired at their hotel in baghdad in april , 2003 .
in contrast , rodney pinder , director of the international news safety institute , a recently-established body that groups about 60 news organizations , argued that debate on an emblem was a dangerous distraction to the real issue - the fact that more and more journalists are dying . " there is already a well recognized emblem - the ' press ' and ' tv ' signs that are often displayed - yet journalists are being killed now in greater numbers than ever before , " pinder told afp on the sidelines of the meeting . a perception that people can target journalists with impunity coupled with the perceived loss of the media 's neutrality in conflict zones were far more pressing matters , he said . white agreed that it would be difficult to generate support from major news organizations for a new emblem when already established mechanisms to protect journalists are ignored . signatories to the document - which also promises to create a group of experts who will draw up a list of practical measures that can be taken to boost the protection of journalists - included the ifj , the european broadcasting union , the syndicate of iraqi journalists and media rights watchdog reporters without borders . they are due to meet again in the united arab emirates early next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2004 the dangerous quest for news großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more journalists are becoming victims while working in war zones more journalists are being targeted or caught in the crossfire of war zones and need greater protection , a group of experts said .
some are pushing for an international emblem to distinguish the media . at least 1,200 reporters have been killed worldwide over the past 12 years and no one has been brought to justice in about 95 percent of the cases , said aidan white , secretary general of the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- . in iraq alone , more than 50 reporters and media staff have been killed since the us-led invasion in march 2003 , according to figures from the ifj , which represents half a million correspondents globally . desperate to combat the problem , 14 media associations signed a declaration after a two-day meeting in geneva to make journalism safer , primarily by pressing governments to comply with international laws that safeguard reporters , namely the geneva conventions on the rules of war . " if governments today honored the obligations they already have under international law we would not be facing the crisis we have , " white told a news conference at the end of the meeting , which was also attended by non-governmental organizations and human rights groups . at present , he said , countries failed to investigate media deaths or provide journalists with adequate protection and at times were even responsible for the murders .
" this declaration is a good step forward .
we have started a process , which we now know we will continue , " said white . proposed symbol would act as a bulls-eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporters georges malbrunot and christian chesnot were held captive in iraq .
but the accord fell short of some participants ' desire to establish a press emblem that would alert people to the media in a similar way as the red cross symbol and un flag are used to identify aid workers . instead , the ifj merely promised to study the idea after fears were expressed that such an emblem - the word " press " written in black letters on an orange-colored disk - would make many reporters in hot spots such as iraq or colombia an even easier target for those who oppose their work .
" a visible identification mark for journalists would be calculated suicide , " henrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists federation , told dw-world .
in some conflict areas it might make sense to identify the press with a universal emblem , he said , but in others , such as iraq or the former yugoslavia , where journalists are often singled out , such a marking would have the reverse effect of protection .
the german organization is not alone in being torn between wanting to protect its members and worrying that an emblem might backfire .
" there were diverging opinions on the emblem so we decided to look deeper into the practical and legal issues involved , " said blaise lempen , a founding member of the press emblem campaign , a group of largely geneva-based correspondents that organized the meeting , and a strong advocate of the idea .
a convention was needed to create a universally-recognized press logo , backed by the full support of governments and international law , that would arm anyone who is harmed wearing it with strong legal redress , lempen , a reporter for the swiss news agency ats , said during the talks . the real issue of increasing deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist were wounded when a us tank fired at their hotel in baghdad in april , 2003 .
in contrast , rodney pinder , director of the international news safety institute , a recently-established body that groups about 60 news organizations , argued that debate on an emblem was a dangerous distraction to the real issue - the fact that more and more journalists are dying . " there is already a well recognized emblem - the ' press ' and ' tv ' signs that are often displayed - yet journalists are being killed now in greater numbers than ever before , " pinder told afp on the sidelines of the meeting . a perception that people can target journalists with impunity coupled with the perceived loss of the media 's neutrality in conflict zones were far more pressing matters , he said . white agreed that it would be difficult to generate support from major news organizations for a new emblem when already established mechanisms to protect journalists are ignored . signatories to the document - which also promises to create a group of experts who will draw up a list of practical measures that can be taken to boost the protection of journalists - included the ifj , the european broadcasting union , the syndicate of iraqi journalists and media rights watchdog reporters without borders . they are due to meet again in the united arab emirates early next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close . coming weeks after president horst köhler 's controversial comment that the former east would never have the same living and employment standards as the rest of the country , few would have expected the positive results laid out in the report . catching up contrary to perception , " with the exception of the building sector , slowly but surely eastern germany is managing to catch up economically , " the report stated . it therefore looks as though the government is indeed reaching its goal of equalizing living standards across germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the report , presented by manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- , minister of transport , building and housing and the government 's special representative for the eastern states , showed that despite the broader trend of economic downturn , production in eastern german industry grew an average 5.5 percent per year over the last decade and reached 74.6 percent of the western german standard . engineering , the food , car and electrical industries are enjoying a particular upswing , proving that the process of successful reindustrialization is well underway . were it not for the slump in the building sector , the report pointed out that the rate of growth in the former east between 1992 and 2003 could have reached 3.7 percent , considerably higher than in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is one of the few cities in the east , where construction is an active industry as it is , however , the construction industry crisis is one of the main reasons for the ongoing rise in the region 's joblessness .
in 2003 , unemployment hovered around 18.6 percent , almost twice as high as in the rest of the country .
consequently , the region also suffers from a young people drain . restructuring reconstruction aid shaken by the results of the recent state elections in brandenburg and saxony , which saw considerable gains for far right parties , the government has decided to restructure its reconstruction aid for eastern germany in order to develop what it calls ' growth clusters ' and prompt improved competitiveness , reported the daily süddeutsche zeitung from munich . this would involve closer ties between investment and research , for example , and subsidize programs better focused on existing regional strengths . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dilapidated factory buildings are still easier to find than new plants in many regions of eastern germany the report stressed that one of eastern germany 's most pressing problems is its lack of big business , and that states should use funds from the solidarity pact for eastern reconstruction , consisting of € 156 billion -lrb- $ 191 billion -rrb- until 2019 , " with as broad an intensity possible " .
the state governments were also criticized for investing too little in infrastructure . questioning label of failure the report paints a different picture of eastern germany 's economy to the one the country is used to . " without ignoring the specific problems of the eastern german states , such as high unemployment and overall economic weaknesses , it 's time to question the label of ' failure ' , " wrote the daily berliner zeitung . " the brutal reality is that the general mood is considerably worse than the reality , " argued manfred stolpe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " upswing east , " reads the graffiti , but many eastern germans do n't feel that 's happened in the past 15 years .
he also referred to the increasingly strained relationship between eastern and western germany , stressing the need to avoid mutual resentment . " we have to protect ourselves from prejudice , " he said .
" there are signs of increasing bitterness on both sides . " while the government report admitted that unemployment rose rise in 2003 , it emphasized that the region has also seen " remarkable progress . "
" all in all , the eastern german economy is on track to achieving an internationally competitive and sustainable structure , " concluded the report .
stolpe also took the opportunity to defend the controversial hartz iv welfare reforms , insisting that they would make germany more competitive and help create jobs . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gains by extremist parties trouble germany germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors . -lrb- september 20 , 2004 -rrb- silicon saxony : chip factory brings high-tech to dresden u.s. chipmaker amd has broken ground on a $ 2.4 billion factory in dresden that will manufacture silicon wafers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2004 g4 nations bid for permanent security council seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the representatives of the g4 nations mark their joint bid germany , japan , brazil and india - the so-called g4 group - launched a joint effort for permament seats on the united nations security council after meeting on the fringes of the un general assembly in new york . after meeting on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly in new york on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer , brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva and the indian and japanese prime ministers , manmohan singh and junichiro koizumi delivered a joint statement launching a united bid for permanent un security council seats , arguing that expanded membership was crucial to addressing new global threats .
the declaration stated that germany , brazil , india and japan , known as the g4 nations , " based on the firmly shared recognition that they are legitimate candidates for permanent membership in an expanded security council , support each other 's candidature . "
" the security council must reflect the realities of the international community in the 21st century , " the statement continued , echoing many voices within the united nations including that of un secretary general kofi annan , saying that the broadening of representation on the 15-nation council would strengthen the moral authority of decisions taken by the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in order for the international community to effectively address the various threats and challenges that it presently faces , it is important to reform the united nations as a whole , " a further passage read .
such a reform of the council , which passes resolutions that are binding for the un 's 191 member states , is long overdue , both supporters and critics of the institution say .
the council has had the same five permanent members with veto power - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - since the united nations was established in the wake of world war ii .
ten other nations are elected as non-permanent members for two-year rotation terms .
proposed reforms biggest in 60-year history the proposal put forward by the four nations , which also envisages a permanent seat for africa and an expansion of the non-permanent council membership , would represent the largest shake-up at the top decision-making body of the united nations in its nearly 60-year history . a high-level panel set up by kofi annan to research the possibilities of reform is scheduled to offer concrete proposals for change in december .
annan was recently quoted as saying the question of reform took on added urgency after last year 's crisis over iraq , when the united states went to war without the backing of the council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer .
germany , who is the third highest contributor to un coffers behind the united states and japan , has lobbied strongly for a permanent seat on the council as its two year term as a non-permanent member comes to an end this december .
foreign minister fischer has recently completed an exhaustive tour of countries in a bid to drum up support for germany 's campaign for permanent status .
his work seemed to have paid off on tuesday night . fischer sees g4 as natural candidates " all four states regard themselves as natural candidates , " fischer said after the meeting , " based on what they are doing for the un , what they are capable of doing and also because of their regional roles . "
at least one of the five current permanent members , britain , has already voiced its support for all four bids .
old regional animosities , however , are likely to ensure that none of the candidates enjoys an easy ride .
germany is likely to face opposition from italy , a solid ally of the united states in iraq , for its stance against the 2003 invasion . opposition may bar the way pakistan could find it hard to accept india , their nuclear-armed neighbor , while brazil 's bid might get a lukewarm reception in mexico and argentina , and china on tuesday indicated reservations over japan 's candidacy , saying the un was " not a board of directors " whose composition could be decided by " the financial contribution of its members . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi .

the declaration stated that germany , brazil , india and japan , known as the g4 nations , " based on the firmly shared recognition that they are legitimate candidates for permanent membership in an expanded security council , support each other 's candidature . "
" the security council must reflect the realities of the international community in the 21st century , " the statement continued , echoing many voices within the united nations including that of un secretary general kofi annan , saying that the broadening of representation on the 15-nation council would strengthen the moral authority of decisions taken by the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in order for the international community to effectively address the various threats and challenges that it presently faces , it is important to reform the united nations as a whole , " a further passage read .
such a reform of the council , which passes resolutions that are binding for the un 's 191 member states , is long overdue , both supporters and critics of the institution say .
the council has had the same five permanent members with veto power - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - since the united nations was established in the wake of world war ii .
ten other nations are elected as non-permanent members for two-year rotation terms .
proposed reforms biggest in 60-year history the proposal put forward by the four nations , which also envisages a permanent seat for africa and an expansion of the non-permanent council membership , would represent the largest shake-up at the top decision-making body of the united nations in its nearly 60-year history . a high-level panel set up by kofi annan to research the possibilities of reform is scheduled to offer concrete proposals for change in december .
annan was recently quoted as saying the question of reform took on added urgency after last year 's crisis over iraq , when the united states went to war without the backing of the council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer .
germany , who is the third highest contributor to un coffers behind the united states and japan , has lobbied strongly for a permanent seat on the council as its two year term as a non-permanent member comes to an end this december .
foreign minister fischer has recently completed an exhaustive tour of countries in a bid to drum up support for germany 's campaign for permanent status .
his work seemed to have paid off on tuesday night . fischer sees g4 as natural candidates " all four states regard themselves as natural candidates , " fischer said after the meeting , " based on what they are doing for the un , what they are capable of doing and also because of their regional roles . "
at least one of the five current permanent members , britain , has already voiced its support for all four bids .
old regional animosities , however , are likely to ensure that none of the candidates enjoys an easy ride .
germany is likely to face opposition from italy , a solid ally of the united states in iraq , for its stance against the 2003 invasion . opposition may bar the way pakistan could find it hard to accept india , their nuclear-armed neighbor , while brazil 's bid might get a lukewarm reception in mexico and argentina , and china on tuesday indicated reservations over japan 's candidacy , saying the un was " not a board of directors " whose composition could be decided by " the financial contribution of its members .

the declaration stated that germany , brazil , india and japan , known as the g4 nations , " based on the firmly shared recognition that they are legitimate candidates for permanent membership in an expanded security council , support each other 's candidature . "
" the security council must reflect the realities of the international community in the 21st century , " the statement continued , echoing many voices within the united nations including that of un secretary general kofi annan , saying that the broadening of representation on the 15-nation council would strengthen the moral authority of decisions taken by the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in order for the international community to effectively address the various threats and challenges that it presently faces , it is important to reform the united nations as a whole , " a further passage read .
such a reform of the council , which passes resolutions that are binding for the un 's 191 member states , is long overdue , both supporters and critics of the institution say .
the council has had the same five permanent members with veto power - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - since the united nations was established in the wake of world war ii .
ten other nations are elected as non-permanent members for two-year rotation terms .
proposed reforms biggest in 60-year history the proposal put forward by the four nations , which also envisages a permanent seat for africa and an expansion of the non-permanent council membership , would represent the largest shake-up at the top decision-making body of the united nations in its nearly 60-year history . a high-level panel set up by kofi annan to research the possibilities of reform is scheduled to offer concrete proposals for change in december .
annan was recently quoted as saying the question of reform took on added urgency after last year 's crisis over iraq , when the united states went to war without the backing of the council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer .
germany , who is the third highest contributor to un coffers behind the united states and japan , has lobbied strongly for a permanent seat on the council as its two year term as a non-permanent member comes to an end this december .
foreign minister fischer has recently completed an exhaustive tour of countries in a bid to drum up support for germany 's campaign for permanent status .
his work seemed to have paid off on tuesday night . fischer sees g4 as natural candidates " all four states regard themselves as natural candidates , " fischer said after the meeting , " based on what they are doing for the un , what they are capable of doing and also because of their regional roles . "
at least one of the five current permanent members , britain , has already voiced its support for all four bids .
old regional animosities , however , are likely to ensure that none of the candidates enjoys an easy ride .
germany is likely to face opposition from italy , a solid ally of the united states in iraq , for its stance against the 2003 invasion . opposition may bar the way pakistan could find it hard to accept india , their nuclear-armed neighbor , while brazil 's bid might get a lukewarm reception in mexico and argentina , and china on tuesday indicated reservations over japan 's candidacy , saying the un was " not a board of directors " whose composition could be decided by " the financial contribution of its members . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi .
addressing the general assembly later in the day , japanese prime minister koizumi fleshed out his country 's credentials , pointing to its reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan , as well as its leading role in talks to resolve the north korean nuclear issue . " countries with the will and resources to play a major role in international peace and security must always take part in the council 's decision-making process , " he said .
koizumi also claimed a unique voice for japan as the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack . the four countries also said that africa , the poorest continent in the united nations , " must also be represented in the permanent membership of the security council . "
african leaders are debating which country from the vast continent might get a permanent security council seat if one is made available .
tanzania put itself forward as a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the council , saying it would seek election before august . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to push for un security council seat german foreign minster joschka fischer headed to new york on monday to attend this week 's meeting of the un general assembly .

some are pushing for an international emblem to distinguish the media . at least 1,200 reporters have been killed worldwide over the past 12 years and no one has been brought to justice in about 95 percent of the cases , said aidan white , secretary general of the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- . in iraq alone , more than 50 reporters and media staff have been killed since the us-led invasion in march 2003 , according to figures from the ifj , which represents half a million correspondents globally . desperate to combat the problem , 14 media associations signed a declaration after a two-day meeting in geneva to make journalism safer , primarily by pressing governments to comply with international laws that safeguard reporters , namely the geneva conventions on the rules of war . " if governments today honored the obligations they already have under international law we would not be facing the crisis we have , " white told a news conference at the end of the meeting , which was also attended by non-governmental organizations and human rights groups . at present , he said , countries failed to investigate media deaths or provide journalists with adequate protection and at times were even responsible for the murders .
" this declaration is a good step forward .
we have started a process , which we now know we will continue , " said white . proposed symbol would act as a bulls-eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporters georges malbrunot and christian chesnot were held captive in iraq .
but the accord fell short of some participants ' desire to establish a press emblem that would alert people to the media in a similar way as the red cross symbol and un flag are used to identify aid workers . instead , the ifj merely promised to study the idea after fears were expressed that such an emblem - the word " press " written in black letters on an orange-colored disk - would make many reporters in hot spots such as iraq or colombia an even easier target for those who oppose their work .
" a visible identification mark for journalists would be calculated suicide , " henrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists federation , told dw-world .
in some conflict areas it might make sense to identify the press with a universal emblem , he said , but in others , such as iraq or the former yugoslavia , where journalists are often singled out , such a marking would have the reverse effect of protection .
the german organization is not alone in being torn between wanting to protect its members and worrying that an emblem might backfire .
" there were diverging opinions on the emblem so we decided to look deeper into the practical and legal issues involved , " said blaise lempen , a founding member of the press emblem campaign , a group of largely geneva-based correspondents that organized the meeting , and a strong advocate of the idea .
a convention was needed to create a universally-recognized press logo , backed by the full support of governments and international law , that would arm anyone who is harmed wearing it with strong legal redress , lempen , a reporter for the swiss news agency ats , said during the talks . the real issue of increasing deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist were wounded when a us tank fired at their hotel in baghdad in april , 2003 .
in contrast , rodney pinder , director of the international news safety institute , a recently-established body that groups about 60 news organizations , argued that debate on an emblem was a dangerous distraction to the real issue - the fact that more and more journalists are dying . " there is already a well recognized emblem - the ' press ' and ' tv ' signs that are often displayed - yet journalists are being killed now in greater numbers than ever before , " pinder told afp on the sidelines of the meeting . a perception that people can target journalists with impunity coupled with the perceived loss of the media 's neutrality in conflict zones were far more pressing matters , he said . white agreed that it would be difficult to generate support from major news organizations for a new emblem when already established mechanisms to protect journalists are ignored . signatories to the document - which also promises to create a group of experts who will draw up a list of practical measures that can be taken to boost the protection of journalists - included the ifj , the european broadcasting union , the syndicate of iraqi journalists and media rights watchdog reporters without borders . they are due to meet again in the united arab emirates early next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2004 the dangerous quest for news großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more journalists are becoming victims while working in war zones more journalists are being targeted or caught in the crossfire of war zones and need greater protection , a group of experts said .
some are pushing for an international emblem to distinguish the media . at least 1,200 reporters have been killed worldwide over the past 12 years and no one has been brought to justice in about 95 percent of the cases , said aidan white , secretary general of the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- . in iraq alone , more than 50 reporters and media staff have been killed since the us-led invasion in march 2003 , according to figures from the ifj , which represents half a million correspondents globally . desperate to combat the problem , 14 media associations signed a declaration after a two-day meeting in geneva to make journalism safer , primarily by pressing governments to comply with international laws that safeguard reporters , namely the geneva conventions on the rules of war . " if governments today honored the obligations they already have under international law we would not be facing the crisis we have , " white told a news conference at the end of the meeting , which was also attended by non-governmental organizations and human rights groups . at present , he said , countries failed to investigate media deaths or provide journalists with adequate protection and at times were even responsible for the murders .
" this declaration is a good step forward .
we have started a process , which we now know we will continue , " said white . proposed symbol would act as a bulls-eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporters georges malbrunot and christian chesnot were held captive in iraq .
but the accord fell short of some participants ' desire to establish a press emblem that would alert people to the media in a similar way as the red cross symbol and un flag are used to identify aid workers . instead , the ifj merely promised to study the idea after fears were expressed that such an emblem - the word " press " written in black letters on an orange-colored disk - would make many reporters in hot spots such as iraq or colombia an even easier target for those who oppose their work .
" a visible identification mark for journalists would be calculated suicide , " henrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists federation , told dw-world .
in some conflict areas it might make sense to identify the press with a universal emblem , he said , but in others , such as iraq or the former yugoslavia , where journalists are often singled out , such a marking would have the reverse effect of protection .
the german organization is not alone in being torn between wanting to protect its members and worrying that an emblem might backfire .
" there were diverging opinions on the emblem so we decided to look deeper into the practical and legal issues involved , " said blaise lempen , a founding member of the press emblem campaign , a group of largely geneva-based correspondents that organized the meeting , and a strong advocate of the idea .

" we are heading in the direction of lifting -lrb- the embargo -rrb- .
it still has to be confirmed by ministers , " one eu diplomat told the afp news agency , expressing caution since two or three national delegations were still consulting with their capitals .
" but in principle there should n't be any surprises . " sanctions were imposed on libya because of its role in state-sponsored terrorism , including the 1986 airliner bombing over lockerbie , scotland .
they were partially eased last year , paving the way for tripoli to compensate victims ' families .
in theory the ban should be lifted at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers , scheduled for october 11-12 in luxembourg , officials said . italian pressure the italian government said last week it was determined to press the matter forward , even if the eu struggled to agree unanimously on the issue .
italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu said rome was ready to take exceptional measures , including ignoring eu sanctions , to force the move through at eu level . he said that if italy 's eu neighbors were not unanimous in wanting to lift the sanctions , italy would do so unilaterally under a rule which allows such actions when a country is confronted by an exceptional problem .
italy considers libya a major hub for clandestine migrants from african countries and has already signed cooperation agreements to help the libyan authorities combat the problem . pisanu plans to travel to libya on september 26 .
tripoli has warned that it would be unable to stem the flow of illegal immigrants into europe from its territory unless the eu lifted the sanctions . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels meeting with eu leaders tuesday , moammar gadhafi makes his first visit to europe in 15 years .
the trip is a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction .

" we are heading in the direction of lifting -lrb- the embargo -rrb- .
it still has to be confirmed by ministers , " one eu diplomat told the afp news agency , expressing caution since two or three national delegations were still consulting with their capitals .
" but in principle there should n't be any surprises . " sanctions were imposed on libya because of its role in state-sponsored terrorism , including the 1986 airliner bombing over lockerbie , scotland .
they were partially eased last year , paving the way for tripoli to compensate victims ' families .
in theory the ban should be lifted at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers , scheduled for october 11-12 in luxembourg , officials said . italian pressure the italian government said last week it was determined to press the matter forward , even if the eu struggled to agree unanimously on the issue .
italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu said rome was ready to take exceptional measures , including ignoring eu sanctions , to force the move through at eu level . he said that if italy 's eu neighbors were not unanimous in wanting to lift the sanctions , italy would do so unilaterally under a rule which allows such actions when a country is confronted by an exceptional problem .
italy considers libya a major hub for clandestine migrants from african countries and has already signed cooperation agreements to help the libyan authorities combat the problem . pisanu plans to travel to libya on september 26 .
tripoli has warned that it would be unable to stem the flow of illegal immigrants into europe from its territory unless the eu lifted the sanctions . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels meeting with eu leaders tuesday , moammar gadhafi makes his first visit to europe in 15 years .

his forecast reflected a wider optimistic trend based on the recent upswing in advertising spending . online ads outstrip other media " according to estimates by us company jupiter research , turnover from online advertising will have overtaken turnover from print media by 2008 , " wrote german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung recently . pressetext.austria noted a similar development .
" in the first half of 2004 , online advertising spending was twice as high as it was in cinema theaters , " it wrote , while the interactive advertising bureau in new york , the industry 's leading association , pointed out that internet advertising would be outstripping radio advertising by 2007 . in the us , the world 's largest advertising market , web sites provided turnover of almost € 7.3 billion , thereby matching the amount spent in 2000 , the most lucrative year ever .
advertising also increased by 6.5 percent in germany in the first half of 2004 , with a turnover of € 8.8 billion for all media . the internet , meanwhile , registered a drop of 2.6 percent .

his forecast reflected a wider optimistic trend based on the recent upswing in advertising spending . online ads outstrip other media " according to estimates by us company jupiter research , turnover from online advertising will have overtaken turnover from print media by 2008 , " wrote german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung recently . pressetext.austria noted a similar development .
" in the first half of 2004 , online advertising spending was twice as high as it was in cinema theaters , " it wrote , while the interactive advertising bureau in new york , the industry 's leading association , pointed out that internet advertising would be outstripping radio advertising by 2007 . in the us , the world 's largest advertising market , web sites provided turnover of almost € 7.3 billion , thereby matching the amount spent in 2000 , the most lucrative year ever .
advertising also increased by 6.5 percent in germany in the first half of 2004 , with a turnover of € 8.8 billion for all media . the internet , meanwhile , registered a drop of 2.6 percent .
nonetheless , bernd henning from dmv market research told dw-world that other studies showed the market was improving .
after years of ad price dumping , prices are once again rising , he said .

italy considers libya a major hub for clandestine migrants from african countries and has already signed cooperation agreements to help the libyan authorities combat the problem . pisanu plans to travel to libya on september 26 .
tripoli has warned that it would be unable to stem the flow of illegal immigrants into europe from its territory unless the eu lifted the sanctions . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels meeting with eu leaders tuesday , moammar gadhafi makes his first visit to europe in 15 years .

the giant wookie gave up his seat as co-pilot on the millennium falcon to fly club class from australia to germany as part of his duties in promoting the imminent release of the original star wars trilogy on dvd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chewbacca goes sight-seeing .
surprised onlookers stood open mouthed as chewie emerged from his suite at the kempinski bristol hotel to join in with a street band playing a set on the breitscheid platz .
obviously missing the delights of his local cantina , chewbacca added some vocals and smooth dance moves to the show before heading to the famous brandenburg gate for a photo opportunity beneath the symbol of german unity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does this thing reach light speed ?
chewbacca then took to a velo taxi , a mode of transport unlikely to carry him into hyperspace , for a tour of the park on ebertstrasse .
even the awesomely-built wookie 's legs could n't power the peddle car fast enough for the jump to light speed so he gave up with a roar and headed to one of berlin 's most famous relics from the recent past , the remains of the wall . chewie sightings flood berlin media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way to tatooine ?
as a freedom fighter used to struggling against oppressive political regimes , chewie appreciated the wall and its downfall before heading to potsdamer platz on his way to berlin zoo .
by now , news was out all over the capital and local broadcaster radio rtl 104.6 even began broadcasting a series of " chewbacca sighting " alerts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully , herr schröder looked nothing like the evil emperor .
privacy becomes a problem when you 're two meters tall and covered in hair , so after devouring an ice-cream at the zoo , chewie hid in the bushes for a while before making a quick stop off at germany 's seat of power , the bundestag . satisfied that it was n't as corrupt as the galactic senate , chewie saw no need to unleash his crossbow lazer and headed back to his hotel suite to prepare for his next mission , his visit to london . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the very best of and finally ...

the giant wookie gave up his seat as co-pilot on the millennium falcon to fly club class from australia to germany as part of his duties in promoting the imminent release of the original star wars trilogy on dvd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chewbacca goes sight-seeing .
surprised onlookers stood open mouthed as chewie emerged from his suite at the kempinski bristol hotel to join in with a street band playing a set on the breitscheid platz .
obviously missing the delights of his local cantina , chewbacca added some vocals and smooth dance moves to the show before heading to the famous brandenburg gate for a photo opportunity beneath the symbol of german unity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does this thing reach light speed ?
chewbacca then took to a velo taxi , a mode of transport unlikely to carry him into hyperspace , for a tour of the park on ebertstrasse .
even the awesomely-built wookie 's legs could n't power the peddle car fast enough for the jump to light speed so he gave up with a roar and headed to one of berlin 's most famous relics from the recent past , the remains of the wall . chewie sightings flood berlin media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way to tatooine ?
as a freedom fighter used to struggling against oppressive political regimes , chewie appreciated the wall and its downfall before heading to potsdamer platz on his way to berlin zoo .
by now , news was out all over the capital and local broadcaster radio rtl 104.6 even began broadcasting a series of " chewbacca sighting " alerts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully , herr schröder looked nothing like the evil emperor .
privacy becomes a problem when you 're two meters tall and covered in hair , so after devouring an ice-cream at the zoo , chewie hid in the bushes for a while before making a quick stop off at germany 's seat of power , the bundestag . satisfied that it was n't as corrupt as the galactic senate , chewie saw no need to unleash his crossbow lazer and headed back to his hotel suite to prepare for his next mission , his visit to london . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the very best of and finally ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2004 the dangerous quest for news großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more journalists are becoming victims while working in war zones more journalists are being targeted or caught in the crossfire of war zones and need greater protection , a group of experts said .
some are pushing for an international emblem to distinguish the media . at least 1,200 reporters have been killed worldwide over the past 12 years and no one has been brought to justice in about 95 percent of the cases , said aidan white , secretary general of the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- . in iraq alone , more than 50 reporters and media staff have been killed since the us-led invasion in march 2003 , according to figures from the ifj , which represents half a million correspondents globally . desperate to combat the problem , 14 media associations signed a declaration after a two-day meeting in geneva to make journalism safer , primarily by pressing governments to comply with international laws that safeguard reporters , namely the geneva conventions on the rules of war . " if governments today honored the obligations they already have under international law we would not be facing the crisis we have , " white told a news conference at the end of the meeting , which was also attended by non-governmental organizations and human rights groups . at present , he said , countries failed to investigate media deaths or provide journalists with adequate protection and at times were even responsible for the murders .
" this declaration is a good step forward .
we have started a process , which we now know we will continue , " said white . proposed symbol would act as a bulls-eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporters georges malbrunot and christian chesnot were held captive in iraq .
but the accord fell short of some participants ' desire to establish a press emblem that would alert people to the media in a similar way as the red cross symbol and un flag are used to identify aid workers . instead , the ifj merely promised to study the idea after fears were expressed that such an emblem - the word " press " written in black letters on an orange-colored disk - would make many reporters in hot spots such as iraq or colombia an even easier target for those who oppose their work .
" a visible identification mark for journalists would be calculated suicide , " henrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists federation , told dw-world .
in some conflict areas it might make sense to identify the press with a universal emblem , he said , but in others , such as iraq or the former yugoslavia , where journalists are often singled out , such a marking would have the reverse effect of protection .
the german organization is not alone in being torn between wanting to protect its members and worrying that an emblem might backfire .
" there were diverging opinions on the emblem so we decided to look deeper into the practical and legal issues involved , " said blaise lempen , a founding member of the press emblem campaign , a group of largely geneva-based correspondents that organized the meeting , and a strong advocate of the idea .
a convention was needed to create a universally-recognized press logo , backed by the full support of governments and international law , that would arm anyone who is harmed wearing it with strong legal redress , lempen , a reporter for the swiss news agency ats , said during the talks . the real issue of increasing deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist were wounded when a us tank fired at their hotel in baghdad in april , 2003 .
in contrast , rodney pinder , director of the international news safety institute , a recently-established body that groups about 60 news organizations , argued that debate on an emblem was a dangerous distraction to the real issue - the fact that more and more journalists are dying . " there is already a well recognized emblem - the ' press ' and ' tv ' signs that are often displayed - yet journalists are being killed now in greater numbers than ever before , " pinder told afp on the sidelines of the meeting . a perception that people can target journalists with impunity coupled with the perceived loss of the media 's neutrality in conflict zones were far more pressing matters , he said . white agreed that it would be difficult to generate support from major news organizations for a new emblem when already established mechanisms to protect journalists are ignored . signatories to the document - which also promises to create a group of experts who will draw up a list of practical measures that can be taken to boost the protection of journalists - included the ifj , the european broadcasting union , the syndicate of iraqi journalists and media rights watchdog reporters without borders . they are due to meet again in the united arab emirates early next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

some are pushing for an international emblem to distinguish the media . at least 1,200 reporters have been killed worldwide over the past 12 years and no one has been brought to justice in about 95 percent of the cases , said aidan white , secretary general of the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- . in iraq alone , more than 50 reporters and media staff have been killed since the us-led invasion in march 2003 , according to figures from the ifj , which represents half a million correspondents globally . desperate to combat the problem , 14 media associations signed a declaration after a two-day meeting in geneva to make journalism safer , primarily by pressing governments to comply with international laws that safeguard reporters , namely the geneva conventions on the rules of war . " if governments today honored the obligations they already have under international law we would not be facing the crisis we have , " white told a news conference at the end of the meeting , which was also attended by non-governmental organizations and human rights groups . at present , he said , countries failed to investigate media deaths or provide journalists with adequate protection and at times were even responsible for the murders .
" this declaration is a good step forward .
we have started a process , which we now know we will continue , " said white . proposed symbol would act as a bulls-eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporters georges malbrunot and christian chesnot were held captive in iraq .
but the accord fell short of some participants ' desire to establish a press emblem that would alert people to the media in a similar way as the red cross symbol and un flag are used to identify aid workers . instead , the ifj merely promised to study the idea after fears were expressed that such an emblem - the word " press " written in black letters on an orange-colored disk - would make many reporters in hot spots such as iraq or colombia an even easier target for those who oppose their work .
" a visible identification mark for journalists would be calculated suicide , " henrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists federation , told dw-world .
in some conflict areas it might make sense to identify the press with a universal emblem , he said , but in others , such as iraq or the former yugoslavia , where journalists are often singled out , such a marking would have the reverse effect of protection .
the german organization is not alone in being torn between wanting to protect its members and worrying that an emblem might backfire .
" there were diverging opinions on the emblem so we decided to look deeper into the practical and legal issues involved , " said blaise lempen , a founding member of the press emblem campaign , a group of largely geneva-based correspondents that organized the meeting , and a strong advocate of the idea .
a convention was needed to create a universally-recognized press logo , backed by the full support of governments and international law , that would arm anyone who is harmed wearing it with strong legal redress , lempen , a reporter for the swiss news agency ats , said during the talks . the real issue of increasing deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist were wounded when a us tank fired at their hotel in baghdad in april , 2003 .
in contrast , rodney pinder , director of the international news safety institute , a recently-established body that groups about 60 news organizations , argued that debate on an emblem was a dangerous distraction to the real issue - the fact that more and more journalists are dying . " there is already a well recognized emblem - the ' press ' and ' tv ' signs that are often displayed - yet journalists are being killed now in greater numbers than ever before , " pinder told afp on the sidelines of the meeting . a perception that people can target journalists with impunity coupled with the perceived loss of the media 's neutrality in conflict zones were far more pressing matters , he said . white agreed that it would be difficult to generate support from major news organizations for a new emblem when already established mechanisms to protect journalists are ignored . signatories to the document - which also promises to create a group of experts who will draw up a list of practical measures that can be taken to boost the protection of journalists - included the ifj , the european broadcasting union , the syndicate of iraqi journalists and media rights watchdog reporters without borders . they are due to meet again in the united arab emirates early next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

the giant wookie gave up his seat as co-pilot on the millennium falcon to fly club class from australia to germany as part of his duties in promoting the imminent release of the original star wars trilogy on dvd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chewbacca goes sight-seeing .
surprised onlookers stood open mouthed as chewie emerged from his suite at the kempinski bristol hotel to join in with a street band playing a set on the breitscheid platz .
obviously missing the delights of his local cantina , chewbacca added some vocals and smooth dance moves to the show before heading to the famous brandenburg gate for a photo opportunity beneath the symbol of german unity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does this thing reach light speed ?
chewbacca then took to a velo taxi , a mode of transport unlikely to carry him into hyperspace , for a tour of the park on ebertstrasse .
even the awesomely-built wookie 's legs could n't power the peddle car fast enough for the jump to light speed so he gave up with a roar and headed to one of berlin 's most famous relics from the recent past , the remains of the wall . chewie sightings flood berlin media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way to tatooine ?
as a freedom fighter used to struggling against oppressive political regimes , chewie appreciated the wall and its downfall before heading to potsdamer platz on his way to berlin zoo .
by now , news was out all over the capital and local broadcaster radio rtl 104.6 even began broadcasting a series of " chewbacca sighting " alerts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully , herr schröder looked nothing like the evil emperor .
privacy becomes a problem when you 're two meters tall and covered in hair , so after devouring an ice-cream at the zoo , chewie hid in the bushes for a while before making a quick stop off at germany 's seat of power , the bundestag . satisfied that it was n't as corrupt as the galactic senate , chewie saw no need to unleash his crossbow lazer and headed back to his hotel suite to prepare for his next mission , his visit to london . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the very best of and finally ...

his forecast reflected a wider optimistic trend based on the recent upswing in advertising spending . online ads outstrip other media " according to estimates by us company jupiter research , turnover from online advertising will have overtaken turnover from print media by 2008 , " wrote german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung recently . pressetext.austria noted a similar development .
" in the first half of 2004 , online advertising spending was twice as high as it was in cinema theaters , " it wrote , while the interactive advertising bureau in new york , the industry 's leading association , pointed out that internet advertising would be outstripping radio advertising by 2007 . in the us , the world 's largest advertising market , web sites provided turnover of almost € 7.3 billion , thereby matching the amount spent in 2000 , the most lucrative year ever .
advertising also increased by 6.5 percent in germany in the first half of 2004 , with a turnover of € 8.8 billion for all media . the internet , meanwhile , registered a drop of 2.6 percent .

' sticky ads ' and ' interstitials ' , for example - ads that display between two pages of a website - are interruptive , like television advertising , rather than passive , like web banner advertising . another trend is keyword marketing .
search engines like google and yahoo auction off prime positions on their pages , primarily to internet traders with a vested interest in appearing at the top of the list in response to a query for , for example , ' digital camera ' . these hits are known as " sponsored listings " . even though the growth in the online advertising market is considerable , its budgets are still far smaller than in other media .
according to the 2003 focus mediaguide , the online share of the total us advertising budget was just three percent . even in norway , denmark and estonia , the european countries spending most on online advertising , the budget is negligible . mediterranean countries spend even less .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2004 the dangerous quest for news großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more journalists are becoming victims while working in war zones more journalists are being targeted or caught in the crossfire of war zones and need greater protection , a group of experts said .
some are pushing for an international emblem to distinguish the media . at least 1,200 reporters have been killed worldwide over the past 12 years and no one has been brought to justice in about 95 percent of the cases , said aidan white , secretary general of the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- . in iraq alone , more than 50 reporters and media staff have been killed since the us-led invasion in march 2003 , according to figures from the ifj , which represents half a million correspondents globally . desperate to combat the problem , 14 media associations signed a declaration after a two-day meeting in geneva to make journalism safer , primarily by pressing governments to comply with international laws that safeguard reporters , namely the geneva conventions on the rules of war . " if governments today honored the obligations they already have under international law we would not be facing the crisis we have , " white told a news conference at the end of the meeting , which was also attended by non-governmental organizations and human rights groups . at present , he said , countries failed to investigate media deaths or provide journalists with adequate protection and at times were even responsible for the murders .
" this declaration is a good step forward .
we have started a process , which we now know we will continue , " said white . proposed symbol would act as a bulls-eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporters georges malbrunot and christian chesnot were held captive in iraq .
but the accord fell short of some participants ' desire to establish a press emblem that would alert people to the media in a similar way as the red cross symbol and un flag are used to identify aid workers . instead , the ifj merely promised to study the idea after fears were expressed that such an emblem - the word " press " written in black letters on an orange-colored disk - would make many reporters in hot spots such as iraq or colombia an even easier target for those who oppose their work .
" a visible identification mark for journalists would be calculated suicide , " henrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists federation , told dw-world .
in some conflict areas it might make sense to identify the press with a universal emblem , he said , but in others , such as iraq or the former yugoslavia , where journalists are often singled out , such a marking would have the reverse effect of protection .
the german organization is not alone in being torn between wanting to protect its members and worrying that an emblem might backfire .
" there were diverging opinions on the emblem so we decided to look deeper into the practical and legal issues involved , " said blaise lempen , a founding member of the press emblem campaign , a group of largely geneva-based correspondents that organized the meeting , and a strong advocate of the idea .
a convention was needed to create a universally-recognized press logo , backed by the full support of governments and international law , that would arm anyone who is harmed wearing it with strong legal redress , lempen , a reporter for the swiss news agency ats , said during the talks . the real issue of increasing deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist were wounded when a us tank fired at their hotel in baghdad in april , 2003 .
in contrast , rodney pinder , director of the international news safety institute , a recently-established body that groups about 60 news organizations , argued that debate on an emblem was a dangerous distraction to the real issue - the fact that more and more journalists are dying . " there is already a well recognized emblem - the ' press ' and ' tv ' signs that are often displayed - yet journalists are being killed now in greater numbers than ever before , " pinder told afp on the sidelines of the meeting . a perception that people can target journalists with impunity coupled with the perceived loss of the media 's neutrality in conflict zones were far more pressing matters , he said . white agreed that it would be difficult to generate support from major news organizations for a new emblem when already established mechanisms to protect journalists are ignored . signatories to the document - which also promises to create a group of experts who will draw up a list of practical measures that can be taken to boost the protection of journalists - included the ifj , the european broadcasting union , the syndicate of iraqi journalists and media rights watchdog reporters without borders . they are due to meet again in the united arab emirates early next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

the giant wookie gave up his seat as co-pilot on the millennium falcon to fly club class from australia to germany as part of his duties in promoting the imminent release of the original star wars trilogy on dvd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chewbacca goes sight-seeing .
surprised onlookers stood open mouthed as chewie emerged from his suite at the kempinski bristol hotel to join in with a street band playing a set on the breitscheid platz .
obviously missing the delights of his local cantina , chewbacca added some vocals and smooth dance moves to the show before heading to the famous brandenburg gate for a photo opportunity beneath the symbol of german unity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does this thing reach light speed ?
chewbacca then took to a velo taxi , a mode of transport unlikely to carry him into hyperspace , for a tour of the park on ebertstrasse .
even the awesomely-built wookie 's legs could n't power the peddle car fast enough for the jump to light speed so he gave up with a roar and headed to one of berlin 's most famous relics from the recent past , the remains of the wall . chewie sightings flood berlin media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which way to tatooine ?
as a freedom fighter used to struggling against oppressive political regimes , chewie appreciated the wall and its downfall before heading to potsdamer platz on his way to berlin zoo .
by now , news was out all over the capital and local broadcaster radio rtl 104.6 even began broadcasting a series of " chewbacca sighting " alerts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully , herr schröder looked nothing like the evil emperor .
privacy becomes a problem when you 're two meters tall and covered in hair , so after devouring an ice-cream at the zoo , chewie hid in the bushes for a while before making a quick stop off at germany 's seat of power , the bundestag . satisfied that it was n't as corrupt as the galactic senate , chewie saw no need to unleash his crossbow lazer and headed back to his hotel suite to prepare for his next mission , his visit to london . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the very best of and finally ...

when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close . coming weeks after president horst köhler 's controversial comment that the former east would never have the same living and employment standards as the rest of the country , few would have expected the positive results laid out in the report . catching up contrary to perception , " with the exception of the building sector , slowly but surely eastern germany is managing to catch up economically , " the report stated . it therefore looks as though the government is indeed reaching its goal of equalizing living standards across germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the report , presented by manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- , minister of transport , building and housing and the government 's special representative for the eastern states , showed that despite the broader trend of economic downturn , production in eastern german industry grew an average 5.5 percent per year over the last decade and reached 74.6 percent of the western german standard . engineering , the food , car and electrical industries are enjoying a particular upswing , proving that the process of successful reindustrialization is well underway . were it not for the slump in the building sector , the report pointed out that the rate of growth in the former east between 1992 and 2003 could have reached 3.7 percent , considerably higher than in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is one of the few cities in the east , where construction is an active industry as it is , however , the construction industry crisis is one of the main reasons for the ongoing rise in the region 's joblessness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.09.2004 online advertising gathers momentum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as people spend more time online , advertising spending is on the rise at the german multi-media congress , experts agreed that online advertising is finally witnessing an upswing after a long downturn . after experiencing a three-year slump in online advertising , the situation in today 's internet market is looking promising , according to a group of industry experts meeting in stuttgart this week . earlier this year , christian muche from online marketing at the german multi-media association -lrb- dmv -rrb- predicted that internet advertising could expect a growth rate of 20 percent in 2004 .
his forecast reflected a wider optimistic trend based on the recent upswing in advertising spending . online ads outstrip other media " according to estimates by us company jupiter research , turnover from online advertising will have overtaken turnover from print media by 2008 , " wrote german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung recently . pressetext.austria noted a similar development .
" in the first half of 2004 , online advertising spending was twice as high as it was in cinema theaters , " it wrote , while the interactive advertising bureau in new york , the industry 's leading association , pointed out that internet advertising would be outstripping radio advertising by 2007 . in the us , the world 's largest advertising market , web sites provided turnover of almost € 7.3 billion , thereby matching the amount spent in 2000 , the most lucrative year ever .
advertising also increased by 6.5 percent in germany in the first half of 2004 , with a turnover of € 8.8 billion for all media . the internet , meanwhile , registered a drop of 2.6 percent .
nonetheless , bernd henning from dmv market research told dw-world that other studies showed the market was improving .
after years of ad price dumping , prices are once again rising , he said .
that 's because cost-per-thousand - the average cost for achieving a thousand exposures for a commercial against a target audience - rises in accordance with the number of users a site attracts , and the cost of advertising rises with it . the new face of online advertising like cinema advertising , experts agree that internet advertising has a slow-burn effect on the consumer . current online advertising is now far more complex and less click-oriented than it was ten years ago .
' sticky ads ' and ' interstitials ' , for example - ads that display between two pages of a website - are interruptive , like television advertising , rather than passive , like web banner advertising . another trend is keyword marketing .
search engines like google and yahoo auction off prime positions on their pages , primarily to internet traders with a vested interest in appearing at the top of the list in response to a query for , for example , ' digital camera ' . these hits are known as " sponsored listings " . even though the growth in the online advertising market is considerable , its budgets are still far smaller than in other media .
according to the 2003 focus mediaguide , the online share of the total us advertising budget was just three percent . even in norway , denmark and estonia , the european countries spending most on online advertising , the budget is negligible . mediterranean countries spend even less .
" the north-south divide correlates with national statistics on internet use , " says bernd henning .
" the worse the weather , the more time people spend on the internet .

the declaration stated that germany , brazil , india and japan , known as the g4 nations , " based on the firmly shared recognition that they are legitimate candidates for permanent membership in an expanded security council , support each other 's candidature . "
" the security council must reflect the realities of the international community in the 21st century , " the statement continued , echoing many voices within the united nations including that of un secretary general kofi annan , saying that the broadening of representation on the 15-nation council would strengthen the moral authority of decisions taken by the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in order for the international community to effectively address the various threats and challenges that it presently faces , it is important to reform the united nations as a whole , " a further passage read .
such a reform of the council , which passes resolutions that are binding for the un 's 191 member states , is long overdue , both supporters and critics of the institution say .
the council has had the same five permanent members with veto power - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - since the united nations was established in the wake of world war ii .
ten other nations are elected as non-permanent members for two-year rotation terms .
proposed reforms biggest in 60-year history the proposal put forward by the four nations , which also envisages a permanent seat for africa and an expansion of the non-permanent council membership , would represent the largest shake-up at the top decision-making body of the united nations in its nearly 60-year history . a high-level panel set up by kofi annan to research the possibilities of reform is scheduled to offer concrete proposals for change in december .
annan was recently quoted as saying the question of reform took on added urgency after last year 's crisis over iraq , when the united states went to war without the backing of the council .

germany , who is the third highest contributor to un coffers behind the united states and japan , has lobbied strongly for a permanent seat on the council as its two year term as a non-permanent member comes to an end this december .
foreign minister fischer has recently completed an exhaustive tour of countries in a bid to drum up support for germany 's campaign for permanent status .
his work seemed to have paid off on tuesday night . fischer sees g4 as natural candidates " all four states regard themselves as natural candidates , " fischer said after the meeting , " based on what they are doing for the un , what they are capable of doing and also because of their regional roles . "
at least one of the five current permanent members , britain , has already voiced its support for all four bids .
old regional animosities , however , are likely to ensure that none of the candidates enjoys an easy ride .
germany is likely to face opposition from italy , a solid ally of the united states in iraq , for its stance against the 2003 invasion . opposition may bar the way pakistan could find it hard to accept india , their nuclear-armed neighbor , while brazil 's bid might get a lukewarm reception in mexico and argentina , and china on tuesday indicated reservations over japan 's candidacy , saying the un was " not a board of directors " whose composition could be decided by " the financial contribution of its members .

" countries with the will and resources to play a major role in international peace and security must always take part in the council 's decision-making process , " he said .
koizumi also claimed a unique voice for japan as the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack . the four countries also said that africa , the poorest continent in the united nations , " must also be represented in the permanent membership of the security council . "
african leaders are debating which country from the vast continent might get a permanent security council seat if one is made available .

when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close . coming weeks after president horst köhler 's controversial comment that the former east would never have the same living and employment standards as the rest of the country , few would have expected the positive results laid out in the report . catching up contrary to perception , " with the exception of the building sector , slowly but surely eastern germany is managing to catch up economically , " the report stated . it therefore looks as though the government is indeed reaching its goal of equalizing living standards across germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the report , presented by manfred stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- , minister of transport , building and housing and the government 's special representative for the eastern states , showed that despite the broader trend of economic downturn , production in eastern german industry grew an average 5.5 percent per year over the last decade and reached 74.6 percent of the western german standard . engineering , the food , car and electrical industries are enjoying a particular upswing , proving that the process of successful reindustrialization is well underway . were it not for the slump in the building sector , the report pointed out that the rate of growth in the former east between 1992 and 2003 could have reached 3.7 percent , considerably higher than in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is one of the few cities in the east , where construction is an active industry as it is , however , the construction industry crisis is one of the main reasons for the ongoing rise in the region 's joblessness .
in 2003 , unemployment hovered around 18.6 percent , almost twice as high as in the rest of the country .
consequently , the region also suffers from a young people drain . restructuring reconstruction aid shaken by the results of the recent state elections in brandenburg and saxony , which saw considerable gains for far right parties , the government has decided to restructure its reconstruction aid for eastern germany in order to develop what it calls ' growth clusters ' and prompt improved competitiveness , reported the daily süddeutsche zeitung from munich . this would involve closer ties between investment and research , for example , and subsidize programs better focused on existing regional strengths . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dilapidated factory buildings are still easier to find than new plants in many regions of eastern germany the report stressed that one of eastern germany 's most pressing problems is its lack of big business , and that states should use funds from the solidarity pact for eastern reconstruction , consisting of € 156 billion -lrb- $ 191 billion -rrb- until 2019 , " with as broad an intensity possible " .
the state governments were also criticized for investing too little in infrastructure . questioning label of failure the report paints a different picture of eastern germany 's economy to the one the country is used to . " without ignoring the specific problems of the eastern german states , such as high unemployment and overall economic weaknesses , it 's time to question the label of ' failure ' , " wrote the daily berliner zeitung . " the brutal reality is that the general mood is considerably worse than the reality , " argued manfred stolpe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " upswing east , " reads the graffiti , but many eastern germans do n't feel that 's happened in the past 15 years .
he also referred to the increasingly strained relationship between eastern and western germany , stressing the need to avoid mutual resentment . " we have to protect ourselves from prejudice , " he said .
" there are signs of increasing bitterness on both sides . " while the government report admitted that unemployment rose rise in 2003 , it emphasized that the region has also seen " remarkable progress . "
" all in all , the eastern german economy is on track to achieving an internationally competitive and sustainable structure , " concluded the report .
stolpe also took the opportunity to defend the controversial hartz iv welfare reforms , insisting that they would make germany more competitive and help create jobs . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gains by extremist parties trouble germany germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors . -lrb- september 20 , 2004 -rrb- silicon saxony : chip factory brings high-tech to dresden u.s. chipmaker amd has broken ground on a $ 2.4 billion factory in dresden that will manufacture silicon wafers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2004 the dangerous quest for news großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more journalists are becoming victims while working in war zones more journalists are being targeted or caught in the crossfire of war zones and need greater protection , a group of experts said .
some are pushing for an international emblem to distinguish the media . at least 1,200 reporters have been killed worldwide over the past 12 years and no one has been brought to justice in about 95 percent of the cases , said aidan white , secretary general of the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- . in iraq alone , more than 50 reporters and media staff have been killed since the us-led invasion in march 2003 , according to figures from the ifj , which represents half a million correspondents globally . desperate to combat the problem , 14 media associations signed a declaration after a two-day meeting in geneva to make journalism safer , primarily by pressing governments to comply with international laws that safeguard reporters , namely the geneva conventions on the rules of war . " if governments today honored the obligations they already have under international law we would not be facing the crisis we have , " white told a news conference at the end of the meeting , which was also attended by non-governmental organizations and human rights groups . at present , he said , countries failed to investigate media deaths or provide journalists with adequate protection and at times were even responsible for the murders .
" this declaration is a good step forward .
we have started a process , which we now know we will continue , " said white . proposed symbol would act as a bulls-eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporters georges malbrunot and christian chesnot were held captive in iraq .
but the accord fell short of some participants ' desire to establish a press emblem that would alert people to the media in a similar way as the red cross symbol and un flag are used to identify aid workers . instead , the ifj merely promised to study the idea after fears were expressed that such an emblem - the word " press " written in black letters on an orange-colored disk - would make many reporters in hot spots such as iraq or colombia an even easier target for those who oppose their work .
" a visible identification mark for journalists would be calculated suicide , " henrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists federation , told dw-world .
in some conflict areas it might make sense to identify the press with a universal emblem , he said , but in others , such as iraq or the former yugoslavia , where journalists are often singled out , such a marking would have the reverse effect of protection .
the german organization is not alone in being torn between wanting to protect its members and worrying that an emblem might backfire .
" there were diverging opinions on the emblem so we decided to look deeper into the practical and legal issues involved , " said blaise lempen , a founding member of the press emblem campaign , a group of largely geneva-based correspondents that organized the meeting , and a strong advocate of the idea .
a convention was needed to create a universally-recognized press logo , backed by the full support of governments and international law , that would arm anyone who is harmed wearing it with strong legal redress , lempen , a reporter for the swiss news agency ats , said during the talks . the real issue of increasing deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist were wounded when a us tank fired at their hotel in baghdad in april , 2003 .
in contrast , rodney pinder , director of the international news safety institute , a recently-established body that groups about 60 news organizations , argued that debate on an emblem was a dangerous distraction to the real issue - the fact that more and more journalists are dying . " there is already a well recognized emblem - the ' press ' and ' tv ' signs that are often displayed - yet journalists are being killed now in greater numbers than ever before , " pinder told afp on the sidelines of the meeting . a perception that people can target journalists with impunity coupled with the perceived loss of the media 's neutrality in conflict zones were far more pressing matters , he said . white agreed that it would be difficult to generate support from major news organizations for a new emblem when already established mechanisms to protect journalists are ignored . signatories to the document - which also promises to create a group of experts who will draw up a list of practical measures that can be taken to boost the protection of journalists - included the ifj , the european broadcasting union , the syndicate of iraqi journalists and media rights watchdog reporters without borders . they are due to meet again in the united arab emirates early next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

some are pushing for an international emblem to distinguish the media . at least 1,200 reporters have been killed worldwide over the past 12 years and no one has been brought to justice in about 95 percent of the cases , said aidan white , secretary general of the international federation of journalists -lrb- ifj -rrb- . in iraq alone , more than 50 reporters and media staff have been killed since the us-led invasion in march 2003 , according to figures from the ifj , which represents half a million correspondents globally . desperate to combat the problem , 14 media associations signed a declaration after a two-day meeting in geneva to make journalism safer , primarily by pressing governments to comply with international laws that safeguard reporters , namely the geneva conventions on the rules of war . " if governments today honored the obligations they already have under international law we would not be facing the crisis we have , " white told a news conference at the end of the meeting , which was also attended by non-governmental organizations and human rights groups . at present , he said , countries failed to investigate media deaths or provide journalists with adequate protection and at times were even responsible for the murders .
" this declaration is a good step forward .
we have started a process , which we now know we will continue , " said white . proposed symbol would act as a bulls-eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporters georges malbrunot and christian chesnot were held captive in iraq .
but the accord fell short of some participants ' desire to establish a press emblem that would alert people to the media in a similar way as the red cross symbol and un flag are used to identify aid workers . instead , the ifj merely promised to study the idea after fears were expressed that such an emblem - the word " press " written in black letters on an orange-colored disk - would make many reporters in hot spots such as iraq or colombia an even easier target for those who oppose their work .
" a visible identification mark for journalists would be calculated suicide , " henrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists federation , told dw-world .
in some conflict areas it might make sense to identify the press with a universal emblem , he said , but in others , such as iraq or the former yugoslavia , where journalists are often singled out , such a marking would have the reverse effect of protection .
the german organization is not alone in being torn between wanting to protect its members and worrying that an emblem might backfire .
" there were diverging opinions on the emblem so we decided to look deeper into the practical and legal issues involved , " said blaise lempen , a founding member of the press emblem campaign , a group of largely geneva-based correspondents that organized the meeting , and a strong advocate of the idea .
a convention was needed to create a universally-recognized press logo , backed by the full support of governments and international law , that would arm anyone who is harmed wearing it with strong legal redress , lempen , a reporter for the swiss news agency ats , said during the talks . the real issue of increasing deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist were wounded when a us tank fired at their hotel in baghdad in april , 2003 .
in contrast , rodney pinder , director of the international news safety institute , a recently-established body that groups about 60 news organizations , argued that debate on an emblem was a dangerous distraction to the real issue - the fact that more and more journalists are dying . " there is already a well recognized emblem - the ' press ' and ' tv ' signs that are often displayed - yet journalists are being killed now in greater numbers than ever before , " pinder told afp on the sidelines of the meeting . a perception that people can target journalists with impunity coupled with the perceived loss of the media 's neutrality in conflict zones were far more pressing matters , he said . white agreed that it would be difficult to generate support from major news organizations for a new emblem when already established mechanisms to protect journalists are ignored . signatories to the document - which also promises to create a group of experts who will draw up a list of practical measures that can be taken to boost the protection of journalists - included the ifj , the european broadcasting union , the syndicate of iraqi journalists and media rights watchdog reporters without borders . they are due to meet again in the united arab emirates early next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

at the moment the reservoirs are more than 75 % full , but at the end of august water levels were up to more than 80 % .
august 2003 was the third driest month on record since records first began but this summer the weather has been less predictable .
howard snowden , managing director of the waterworks company , said it meant the reservoirs were fuller than normal .
he said the levels were also higher because of a lower demand for water in gardens and the water level is now adequate for the rest of the year .

forest are playing their first match since their former manager died aged 69 from stomach cancer in hospital in derby on monday morning .
more than 20,000 fans are expected to watch forest 's coca cola cup match against rotherham .
derby county fans will have their opportunity to honour clough in their next game on saturday against wigan .
clough led unfashionable forest from the second division to two successive european cups .
he also led derby county to the domestic championship in 1972 and is widely regarded as one of the best english managers of all time .
books of condolence have been opened and fans have flocked to both grounds .
nottingham forest manager joe kinnear hailed the " unique " ability of brian clough and claimed he was arguably more famous than robin hood .
clough also took derby county to the semi-finals of the european cup in 1973 .
current rams manager george burley said : " brian was one of this country 's greatest ever managers with a style of his own . "
marcus alton runs a website dedicated to ' cloughie ' and had campaigned for him to be given a knighthood .
he said : " obviously forest fans from all over the world have held such great affection for him .

the mid and south wales camera safety partnership said motorists had heeded its warning before last week 's wales rally gb .
more than 2,000 fans and 17 competitors were caught breaking the limit two years ago during a crackdown .
the number fell substantially last year too .
offences numbered 525 at this year 's rally , which ran between 16 and 19 september , compared to 725 last year and 1,616 in 2002 .
john rowling , manager of the safety camera partnership , said : " we are extremely pleased that even fewer speeding offences were recorded this year and want to thank motorists for listening to our appeals to drive safely and at appropriate speeds .
we have worked hard with all parties to ensure all drivers , spectators and competitors alike were aware of speeding restrictions andrew coe , chief executive of rally gb " there were no major incidents during the practice or competition stages and we did n't see any of the excessive speeds we witnessed two years ago .
" we also want to thank wales rally gb for their continued support in helping to keep the roads safe between stages . "
andrew coe , chief executive of rally gb , added : " it 's fantastic to see the number of offences were down for 2004 .
" we have worked hard with all parties to ensure all drivers , spectators and competitors alike were aware of speeding restrictions and kept within the rules of the highway code .
" this year 's rally was a huge success and our thanks go to all those that helped contribute to it being a safe and enjoyable event . "
speed cameras on motorbikes targeted wales rally gb competitors and fans on public roads at this year 's event .
eighteen speed camera vans were in operation during the rally they were used along with 18 mobile vans in the annual clampdown by the authorities .
there were fears that the federation internationale de l 'automobile -lrb- fia -rrb- was going to pull the event out of wales after competitors were caught speeding between stages in 2002 .
the competition in wales , which was a round of the world rally championship , was won by petter solberg and his welsh co-driver phil mills , from newtown , powys , in a subaru .

the mid and south wales camera safety partnership said motorists had heeded its warning before last week 's wales rally gb .
more than 2,000 fans and 17 competitors were caught breaking the limit two years ago during a crackdown .
the number fell substantially last year too .
offences numbered 525 at this year 's rally , which ran between 16 and 19 september , compared to 725 last year and 1,616 in 2002 .
john rowling , manager of the safety camera partnership , said : " we are extremely pleased that even fewer speeding offences were recorded this year and want to thank motorists for listening to our appeals to drive safely and at appropriate speeds . "
we have worked hard with all parties to ensure all drivers , spectators and competitors alike were aware of speeding restrictions " andrew coe , chief executive of rally gb " there were no major incidents during the practice or competition stages and we did n't see any of the excessive speeds we witnessed two years ago .
" we also want to thank wales rally gb for their continued support in helping to keep the roads safe between stages . "
andrew coe , chief executive of rally gb , added : " it 's fantastic to see the number of offences were down for 2004 .
" we have worked hard with all parties to ensure all drivers , spectators and competitors alike were aware of speeding restrictions and kept within the rules of the highway code .
" this year 's rally was a huge success and our thanks go to all those that helped contribute to it being a safe and enjoyable event . "
speed cameras on motorbikes targeted wales rally gb competitors and fans on public roads at this year 's event .
they were used along with 18 mobile vans in the annual clampdown by the authorities .
there were fears that the federation internationale de l 'automobile -lrb- fia -rrb- was going to pull the event out of wales after competitors were caught speeding between stages in 2002 .
the competition in wales , which was a round of the world rally championship , was won by petter solberg and his welsh co-driver phil mills , from newtown , powys , in a subaru .

albert rowlands from wrexham was just 14 when his father was killed in the 1934 gresford colliery explosion .
for the past 70 years , the north wales village has been synonymous with the tragedy .
a church service at gresford parish church marks the anniversary of the disaster on wednesday .
in the early hours of saturday 22 september , an explosion rocked the dennis section of the mine and life was never quite the same again .
the disaster , which affected so many wrexham families , shocked the whole country .
mr rowlands was a 14-year-old lamp boy working at the gresford colliery at the time of the disaster .
still living in wrexham , the 84-year-old remembers the day he last saw his 35-year-old father john .
" we lived on holt road and i started off down the road with my dad on bikes - two more miners joined us and the four of us cycled together , " he said .
his father was worried that his son would be late for work so he told him to ride ahead alone and he would see him later .
he never did .
" i got into work and in the lamp room there were two windows where the miners could get their lamps from , my father was at the other window and not the one i served , " mr rowlands recalled .
" so when i left him on the bike , that was the last i saw of him . "
i remember them bringing up a few dead bodies on stretchers and there were some dead horses " albert rowlands " the telephone went and the foreman said to me ' go and get the ambulance man ' .
" i got to his house and knocked on the door and i told him he had to come back to the pit , but i did n't know what had happened . "
the teenage albert cycled back to gresford , still unaware of the tragedy unfolding .
" there was n't anything happening and they were coming out like mad from the martin section .
" i remember the llay main rescue team arriving and then some miners arrived who would 've normally gone to work .
" miners that went down and came up were just shaking their heads .
" i remember them bringing up a few dead bodies on stretchers and there were some dead horses .
mourning clothes " six escaped because they knew of an air vent and fortunately they found it .
" i just wandered around backwards and forwards and up to the pit - we were just living in hope all the time , " he added .
his father 's body was never recovered .
five hundred men were underground on the night shift when the incident happened .
historians say this was an unusually high number because some men had worked double shifts .
there is evidence that suggests about 70 men survived the explosion .
jonathan gammond from wrexham museum said people from across britain and overseas responded generously to the plight of the bereaved .
" donations poured in to the two big funds , one based in london and the other in wrexham , " he said .
" in all more than £ 566,500 was raised , a truly massive sum of money in those days .
" donations also came in kind , two lorry loads of apples from kent fruit growers , 200 boxes of kippers from an aberdeen fish merchant , 10 massive cases of campbell soup , girls ' frocks and boys ' shirts from english clothing companies .
" ordinary individuals sent clothes , especially children 's and mourning clothes , in abundance , " he added .
despite an inquiry in october 1934 into the disaster , it is still not known what really caused the explosion .
however , prior to the explosion , evidence of heat and gas was discovered in the colliery .
only 11 bodies were recovered from the colliery , the other 254 were sealed inside the mine .
gresford colliery reopened six months after the disaster but the dennis section was never used again .

officers in shropshire found that compared to raw pork , pork with added water has higher levels of salt .
it has sparked health concerns because high blood pressure can increase the risk of strokes and heart attacks .
officers said supermarkets should " put health before profits " .
the study by the trading standards institute -lrb- tsi -rrb- and the local authority earlier this year found that water was being added to some raw pork steaks , chops and joints . "
the industry should put the health of consumers before profits and stop the practice immediately " david walker shropshire county council some were marketed as premium " succulent " products and sold at premium price alongside genuine raw pork steaks .
david walker , chief trading standards officer for shropshire county council , said some pork products should come with a health warning as they could have serious long-term implications for the nation 's health .
" the food industry has always maintained that it acts responsibly towards its customers , " he said .
" on that basis the industry should put the health of consumers before profits and stop the practice immediately .
" if the industry fails to respond positively , we will be calling upon the food standards agency to formally intervene and prohibit this practice . "
' take action ' in the survey last month , a typical pork loin steak was found to contain sodium equivalent to 5 % of the recommended daily salt intake of 6g .
but the same sized pork steak with added water was found to contain up to six times more sodium - or 30.5 % of the recommended daily intake of salt .
ron gainsford , chief executive of tsi , said : " based on the worrying results of the shropshire survey and the government 's advice to reduce salt intake , we would urge supermarkets and manufacturers to heed our concerns and take action . "
a sainsbury 's spokeswoman said its pork chops did not contain added salt and water .
" none of our sainsbury 's own-label fresh pork contains added water or bran , " she said .
a spokesman for tesco said it used clear labelling to inform customers if pork products contained added water .
he said : " we give more information than anyone else , including the catering sector , so customers can make an informed choice on what they buy .
" but we are going to go even further by giving the salt levels on the packaging as well .
" adding this water keeps the meat succulent and tender and regular customer tastings tell us it provides a better quality product . "

what 's more , the challenger , susilo bambang yudhoyono , appears to have secured victory over the incumbent , megawati sukarnoputri , by a whopping margin .
mrs megawati , who came to power three years ago , seems to have been punished by voters for not delivering the reform agenda she promised .
mr yudhoyono 's charisma may have been key " indonesians are really disappointed with the government 's performance , " said daniel sparingga , a political scientist at the university of airlangga in surabaya .
" they -lsb- the government -rsb- had their chance but they never used it .
corruption is getting worse , law enforcement is weakening and unemployment is becoming a really big problem , " he said .
in fairness , mrs megawati did bring a period of relative stability after the turbulence of former president suharto 's downfall and the regional financial crisis which hit indonesia especially hard .
but stability - critics would call it inertia - is no longer enough .
by voting for a new president , indonesians are demanding better .
so is susilo bambang yudhoyono , or sby as he is popularly known , the man to lead this sprawling archipelago towards a brighter future ?
after all , both he and his vice-presidential running mate , jusuf kalla , were senior ministers in megawati sukarnoputri 's government .
we do n't know yet whether he can fulfil his promises or not .
but if his work is just the same as the megawati government , people will desert him fachri ali , a political observer the election campaign offered few clues as to the kind of changes a yudhoyono administration might represent .
he and mrs megawati both ran on secular , nationalist platforms .
both promised to boost indonesia 's underperforming economy , root out corruption and improve security .
neither gave much detail on how they would achieve all this .
fachri ali , a political observer , believes indonesians made their decision on the basis of personality as much as anything else .
" you see sby has charisma , sby can talk and sby knows how to express his opinions while megawati sometimes has problems answering questions , " he said .
but mr ali warned that the new president would now be under pressure to back up his words with action .
" we do n't know yet whether he can fulfil his promises or not .
but if his work is just the same as the megawati government , people will desert him . "
corruption mr yudhoyono has promised to spend the early part of his presidency focussing on corruption .
so it is possible that a few high-profile characters will be brought before the courts .
but probably not as high-profile as former president suharto , who has been indicted on charges of massive misappropriation of funds , but who is deemed too ill to stand trial .
indonesia 's historic poll mr yudhoyono won first round 150 million registered voters on 14,000 islands previous leaders chosen by the legislature winner must tackle regional conflicts and terrorist threat have your say on outcome latest results -lrb- official website -rrb- the more likely candidates are members of the financial community accused of embezzling money meant to bail out the banks in the wake of indonesia 's currency crisis .
a few big fish would go a long way to showing mr yudhoyono means business .
but the problem is that indonesia 's justice system is itself widely perceived to be corrupt .
at the very least , the courts have shown themselves to be inconsistent , bordering on incompetent .
reform is desperately needed .
according to political chatter , mr yudhoyono may introduce some changes at the top , with a new attorney general , perhaps even a new police chief , in the offing .
mr yudhoyono says the economy will be a priority for much of the presidential campaign , security did n't feature much as an issue .
but a bomb attack outside the australian embassy in jakarta on 9 september changed all that .
as chief security minister in mrs megawati 's government susilo bambang yudhoyono was the point man in indonesia 's war on terror .
he takes a tough line on militant violence , promising to hunt down those responsible .
but there has been no clear indication he will be more willing than his predecessor to tackle the roots of the problem .
anyone looking for his government to make banning the regional extremist network jemaah islamiah an early priority could be disappointed .
few indonesian leaders , political or religious , are willing even to use the name in public for fear of alienating a predominantly muslim population .
and what of the separatist violence which still flares at either end of indonesia , in papua and in aceh ?
mr yudhoyono is often credited with trying to keep the peace process in aceh going long after it had run into the ground .
on the other hand , he was also in the cabinet when the decision was taken to launch a massive military assault against the free aceh rebels in the hopes of using force to the end the long running conflict in the province .
what he has to do is create a new network , change people in the military and put in people he can trust and work with political scientist daniel sparingga sixteen months later , the fighting goes on with no end in sight .
interestingly , in the presidential contest , mr yudhoyono won in aceh by a considerable margin , so perhaps the acehnese are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt .
military past supporters say that as a former soldier himself , susilo bambang yudhoyono will be better placed than mrs megawati was to control the military , which remains a powerful force , despite having its formal political role removed .
but given the security forces ' appalling human rights record , there are also people who are distinctly nervous about a retired general coming to power in indonesia .
here mr yudhoyono has a tricky balancing act to perform .
he has to provide the strong leadership indonesians are looking for , without appearing to step over the line into the authoritarianism they have fought so hard to leave behind .
political scientist daniel sparingga thinks mr yudhoyono should impress himself on the military early on .
" what he has to do is create a new network , change people in the military and put in people he can trust and work with , " he said .
" that way it 'll be easier to control the military , but it 's not going to be easy . "
the next president will also have to work with parliament , and here mr yudhoyono could be frustrated .
his democratic party has only 8 % of the seats , in a parliament dominated by golkar , the party of former president suharto , and mrs megawati 's pdip party .
" an sby government could have a lot of problems if it does n't get enough support from parliament , " said fachri ali .
" there are many policies , like changing the chief of police for instance , that will need the backing of parliament , so sby is going to have to work on that . "
the challenges facing the next leader of indonesia are many and varied .
but at least mr yudhoyono knows that he was chosen by the people .
he has a huge mandate for change , and the people who voted for him expect him to honour that .

the bishop of liverpool , james jones , and akbar ali , liverpool mosque chairman , said the " terrorists " have no right to " use the name of god " .
they also said " taking hostages and murdering them is completely and utterly un-islamic " .
the faith leaders said they hope the crisis does not affect the relations between communities in liverpool .
mr bigley is being held by a group claiming to be from tawhid and jihad which is led by al-qaeda suspect abu musab al-zarqawi .
two americans taken hostage along with mr bigley have been beheaded , according an islamist website .
speaking on bbc radio 4 's today programme on wednesday mr ali - also chair of liverpool 's islamic institute - said the hostage-takers can only be described as " terrorists " .
the vast majority of muslims do want to live peacefully james jones , bishop of liverpool " these men have no right to use the name of islam or say ' we 're doing it in the name of god ' , " he said .
bishop jones said they are aiming to ensure people understand that the men are acting alone and do not represent the islamic faith .
" this is why it is so important for me and akbar to release this statement together , " he said .
" and for people to have heard categorically now from akbar , his condemnation of this sort of violence .
" what it shows is that the vast majority of muslims do want to live peacefully , and it shows that myself and akbar stand together in solidarity in our attitudes to the situation . "
' very sad ' he said it was also important for the two of them to stress how different religious faiths can work together .
" -lsb- this is vital -rsb- because the future stability of the world and the future stability in local communities depends on it , " added bishop jones .
mr ali said he hoped that the crisis does not have a negative impact on relations in liverpool .
" we have worked together for so long and built such a good relationship between the christians and muslims and of course others as well , that i feel very sad that these actions which are taking place thousands of miles away should really affect our relationship , " he said .
he added there have been " no visible signs " relations have so far been affected .

it is one of 30 units across the uk being considered for development into six specialist centres for treating the worst burns injuries .
one of the centres will cover wales and the south west of england .
if the morriston unit is chosen , it is thought extra investment and specialists would follow .
a review group of nhs commissioners and clinicians , as well as the department of health , will decide on the unit 's future in december .
morriston 's unit , which has recently celebrated its 10th birthday , currently treats around 300 adults and 150 children each year .
staff use the latest techiques in modern treatment , such as sophisticated procedures like repairing burns with substitute skin , as well as dealing with problems caused by skin cancers and birth deformities .
the hospital saved my life , and helped my family to cope as well peter clement , patient plastic surgery consultant hamish laing said that securing specialist status would be " a big boost " .
" it would be help us recruit staff and help morale and would be very good for nhs wales , " he said .
" it would be one of the first times the health service in england was buying health care for wales , recognising the value of the service we have here .
" this would mean we have a steady stream of investment that would allow us to expand and take on new staff and develop our service even more . "
bill dixon , the director of morriston burns unit and consultant , admitted that failing to get the status would be a serious problem .
" from our own point of view , we would continue to treat all the smaller burn injuries in south wales but we would lose that expertise in dealing with the most severely injured patients , " he said .
" secondly i think it would possibly lead to problems of retention and recruitment of staff , and thirdly for patients it would mean that they would have to travel to other centres . "
life-saver three years ago , the burns unit played a prominent role treating victims of the major explosion at the corus steelworks in which three people died and five people had terrible burns .
peter clement had been working as a mechanical technologist at the plant at the time .
it is a well-constructed , organised unit that is highly regarded dr jeffrey carroll , health commission wales " i suffered 43 % burns , broken shoulder , broken ribs and multiple organ failure , " he said .
" the hospital saved my life , and helped my family to cope with it as well .
" every day is a bonus and every day i am thankful . "
dr jeffrey carroll , from health commission wales , is part of the review group assessing units around the country .
he said he was " extremely optimistic " about the future of morriston 's unit , saying it stood " an excellent chance of achieving burns centre status " .
" it is a well-constructed , organised unit that is highly regarded , " he said .
but he said that failing to attain centre status would mean a loss of " expertise and quality of contact with severely burned patients " .
" it would have to export or , after initial treatment , turn away patients with the most severe burns , " he said .
a team of 10 surgeons , nine consultant anaesthetists , and 250 other staff - including nurses , physiotherapists and occupational therapists - are currently employed at the unit .
