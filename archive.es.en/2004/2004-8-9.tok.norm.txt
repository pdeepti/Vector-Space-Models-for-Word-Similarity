program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2004 east germans stage anti-reform protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans protest cuts in welfare benefits at a leipzig protest in the tradition of the monday demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the communist state 15 years ago , east germans are planning to hold weekly protests against chancellor schröder 's reform package . some 10,000 eastern germans are expected to take to the streets of magdeburg monday evening with a number of other eastern cities set to host smaller rallies .
but the demonstrations organized by german leftists and trade unions are highly controversial and have drawn strong reactions not only from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . organizers of the rallies in eastern german cities hope they can halt schröder ’ s sweeping cuts in benefits for the long-time jobless here , by drawing inspiration from the peaceful monday demonstrations that brought down communism in the region in 1989 . but leading social democrats , such as labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , have slammed the analogy as a shameless abuse of a shining moment in german history .
clement told a newspaper on monday that the comparison was a provocation and an insult to the civil courage that many east germans showed at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement , german minister for economy and labor vera lengsfeld , a former east german civil rights activists and a parliamentary deputy for the conservative christian democratic party , also said the comparison was untenable . " the demonstrations in 1989 were directed against a repressive regime that prevented freedom , " she said .
" but those taking to the streets today are protesting against necessary reforms that ultimately aim to maintain the welfare system in face of the current crisis .
with all due respect to those criticizing chancellor schröder , his government can not be compared with that of communist leader erich honecker . " the anti-communist monday demonstrations in autumn 1989 began with prayers for peace and candlelight marches in the city of leipzig , and towards the end drew more than 100,000 protesters .
last monday a few thousand people joined a rally in magdeburg against the reforms , but turnout is expected to rise this monday .
mouths shut ? the demonstrations ' organizers insist , however , that their actions are justified .
" i do n't understand all the excitement on the part of the political elites , " said christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig protests in 1989 .
it was unacceptable to suggest that " we accept that you took to the streets to oppose the communists , but now you should keep your mouths shut , " führer said .
but führer also criticized that some groups or parties were trying to use the demonstrations for their own purposes . saxon 's christian democratic premier , georg milbradt , said monday he would not rule out his party participating in the protests , " if we are invited . "
hard-hitting reforms the new reform law - set to take effect next year - will bring long-term unemployment benefits down to the amount of subsistence-level welfare payments .
eastern germans are hit hardest by the reforms because long-term joblessness is especially rife here . but the rallies in eastern germany are part of more widespread public outrage over schröder ‘ s agenda 2010 welfare reforms .
internal dissent within the spd over the chancellor ’ s course has also increased .
just last week an anonymous e-mail chain letter called for the chancellor to be toppled .
and on sunday , former spd finance minister oskar lafontaine threatened to help form a breakaway left-wing party if schröder persists with his reforms .
subsequently , social democratic party leader franz müntefering warned all spd rebels against playing with fire : " i accept that people are now taking to the streets , but i don ’ t think they are right , " he said .
" i think their fears are baseless because we actually want to preserve social welfare and not destroy it ...
and all those stoking public fears and resentment must know that they are going to be held responsible for their actions . " lafontaine ’ s comments mark a bid to establish himself as a champion of the spd 's disenchanted left wing , but they have drawn a withering response from spd leaders .
the threats of a breakaway party and the in-fighting about the reforms have already caused the social democrats ' popular support to plunge to a historic low .
sizable demonstrations on mondays are sure to dent the spd 's chances for comeback at the polls even further . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd angered by anti-schröder letter while it 's no secret that some social democrats disagree with chancellor gerhard schröder 's policies , a chain letter of insurgency that surfaced thursday hit too far below the belt for many from the spd .

but the demonstrations organized by german leftists and trade unions are highly controversial and have drawn strong reactions not only from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . organizers of the rallies in eastern german cities hope they can halt schröder ’ s sweeping cuts in benefits for the long-time jobless here , by drawing inspiration from the peaceful monday demonstrations that brought down communism in the region in 1989 . but leading social democrats , such as labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , have slammed the analogy as a shameless abuse of a shining moment in german history .
clement told a newspaper on monday that the comparison was a provocation and an insult to the civil courage that many east germans showed at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement , german minister for economy and labor vera lengsfeld , a former east german civil rights activists and a parliamentary deputy for the conservative christian democratic party , also said the comparison was untenable . " the demonstrations in 1989 were directed against a repressive regime that prevented freedom , " she said .
" but those taking to the streets today are protesting against necessary reforms that ultimately aim to maintain the welfare system in face of the current crisis .
with all due respect to those criticizing chancellor schröder , his government can not be compared with that of communist leader erich honecker . " the anti-communist monday demonstrations in autumn 1989 began with prayers for peace and candlelight marches in the city of leipzig , and towards the end drew more than 100,000 protesters .
last monday a few thousand people joined a rally in magdeburg against the reforms , but turnout is expected to rise this monday .
mouths shut ? the demonstrations ' organizers insist , however , that their actions are justified .
" i do n't understand all the excitement on the part of the political elites , " said christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig protests in 1989 .
it was unacceptable to suggest that " we accept that you took to the streets to oppose the communists , but now you should keep your mouths shut , " führer said .
but führer also criticized that some groups or parties were trying to use the demonstrations for their own purposes . saxon 's christian democratic premier , georg milbradt , said monday he would not rule out his party participating in the protests , " if we are invited . "
hard-hitting reforms the new reform law - set to take effect next year - will bring long-term unemployment benefits down to the amount of subsistence-level welfare payments .
eastern germans are hit hardest by the reforms because long-term joblessness is especially rife here . but the rallies in eastern germany are part of more widespread public outrage over schröder ‘ s agenda 2010 welfare reforms .
internal dissent within the spd over the chancellor ’ s course has also increased .
just last week an anonymous e-mail chain letter called for the chancellor to be toppled .
and on sunday , former spd finance minister oskar lafontaine threatened to help form a breakaway left-wing party if schröder persists with his reforms .
subsequently , social democratic party leader franz müntefering warned all spd rebels against playing with fire : " i accept that people are now taking to the streets , but i don ’ t think they are right , " he said .
" i think their fears are baseless because we actually want to preserve social welfare and not destroy it ...
and all those stoking public fears and resentment must know that they are going to be held responsible for their actions . " lafontaine ’ s comments mark a bid to establish himself as a champion of the spd 's disenchanted left wing , but they have drawn a withering response from spd leaders .
the threats of a breakaway party and the in-fighting about the reforms have already caused the social democrats ' popular support to plunge to a historic low .
sizable demonstrations on mondays are sure to dent the spd 's chances for comeback at the polls even further . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd angered by anti-schröder letter while it 's no secret that some social democrats disagree with chancellor gerhard schröder 's policies , a chain letter of insurgency that surfaced thursday hit too far below the belt for many from the spd .

" i do n't understand all the excitement on the part of the political elites , " said christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig protests in 1989 .
it was unacceptable to suggest that " we accept that you took to the streets to oppose the communists , but now you should keep your mouths shut , " führer said .
but führer also criticized that some groups or parties were trying to use the demonstrations for their own purposes . saxon 's christian democratic premier , georg milbradt , said monday he would not rule out his party participating in the protests , " if we are invited . "
hard-hitting reforms the new reform law - set to take effect next year - will bring long-term unemployment benefits down to the amount of subsistence-level welfare payments .
eastern germans are hit hardest by the reforms because long-term joblessness is especially rife here . but the rallies in eastern germany are part of more widespread public outrage over schröder ‘ s agenda 2010 welfare reforms .
internal dissent within the spd over the chancellor ’ s course has also increased .
just last week an anonymous e-mail chain letter called for the chancellor to be toppled .
and on sunday , former spd finance minister oskar lafontaine threatened to help form a breakaway left-wing party if schröder persists with his reforms .
subsequently , social democratic party leader franz müntefering warned all spd rebels against playing with fire : " i accept that people are now taking to the streets , but i don ’ t think they are right , " he said .
" i think their fears are baseless because we actually want to preserve social welfare and not destroy it ...
and all those stoking public fears and resentment must know that they are going to be held responsible for their actions . " lafontaine ’ s comments mark a bid to establish himself as a champion of the spd 's disenchanted left wing , but they have drawn a withering response from spd leaders .
the threats of a breakaway party and the in-fighting about the reforms have already caused the social democrats ' popular support to plunge to a historic low .
sizable demonstrations on mondays are sure to dent the spd 's chances for comeback at the polls even further . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd angered by anti-schröder letter while it 's no secret that some social democrats disagree with chancellor gerhard schröder 's policies , a chain letter of insurgency that surfaced thursday hit too far below the belt for many from the spd .

thirteen democratic members of the house of representatives requested un monitors for this year 's presidential elections in an effort to avoid possible voting irregularities that plagued the 2000 election .
in a letter to the 13 democrats , assistant secretary of state paul kelly did not mention the request for un observers , but said the united states had already invited the osce 's office for democratic institutions and human rights -lrb- odihr -rrb- to observe the 2004 presidential elections .
the observer team will go to the united states in september to plan how to monitor the election , including how many observers to send and where to deploy them .
the osce sent observers to the united states in november 2002 to monitor the us midterm elections as well as last year 's election in california .
osce members , including the united states , agreed in 1990 to allow fellow members to observe elections in one another 's countries .

it said that oskar lafontaine , the former german finance minister , was challenging chancellor gerhard schröder louder than ever before by threatening to form a breakaway left-wing party , if the government persisted with benefit cuts that were sparking protests around the country .
but the paper concluded that this saarland napoleon might find his idea put him on track to the same place as bonaparte - namely waterloo .
berlin 's tageszeitung took a more relaxed approach .
it said that lafontaine was ranting and raving again against the party which wasn ’ t anything new .
since lafontaine quit the social democrats as party leader and finance minister in 1999 , he did little else than to caution and abuse his comrades , according to the daily .
it concluded that what changed was that suddenly he might find himself with a support base , that could present a clear threat to the spd .
the frankfurter neue presse disagreed .
it said that the new left wing parties might delight in the support they were getting from lafontaine , but in reality they were just proving that their political ideas were stuck in the past .
the darmstädter echo said that lafontaine was merely making use of his democratic right but that ultimately the voters were going to tell him what they thought of his policies .
commenting on the new debate about germany 's spelling reform , tabloid bild said that politicians could be mislead .
noting that five years ago germany introduced a nonsensical language and spelling reform , with rules that lead to confusion on a babylonian scale .
now that major german newspapers , including bild and der spiegel news weekly announced they were abandoning the language reform and returning to the old way of writing , it was clear that the reforms failed , the editorial continued .
but instead of just admitting their mistakes , the paper wrote , politicians were frantically trying to save as much face as possible by attempting to reform the reforms .
it concluded that rather than create a nation of dyslexics they should just admit defeat and annul the reform .
die welt , which also announced it will abandon the new spelling , said that the changes should have coincided with a reform of society as a whole , but instead it lead to the greatest divide in german writing and grammar since the 19th century .
what was worrisome , the paper continued , was that children were used as guinea pigs in this experiment .

it said that oskar lafontaine , the former german finance minister , was challenging chancellor gerhard schröder louder than ever before by threatening to form a breakaway left-wing party , if the government persisted with benefit cuts that were sparking protests around the country .
but the paper concluded that this saarland napoleon might find his idea put him on track to the same place as bonaparte - namely waterloo .
berlin 's tageszeitung took a more relaxed approach .
it said that lafontaine was ranting and raving again against the party which wasn ’ t anything new .
since lafontaine quit the social democrats as party leader and finance minister in 1999 , he did little else than to caution and abuse his comrades , according to the daily .
it concluded that what changed was that suddenly he might find himself with a support base , that could present a clear threat to the spd .
the frankfurter neue presse disagreed .
it said that the new left wing parties might delight in the support they were getting from lafontaine , but in reality they were just proving that their political ideas were stuck in the past .
the darmstädter echo said that lafontaine was merely making use of his democratic right but that ultimately the voters were going to tell him what they thought of his policies .
commenting on the new debate about germany 's spelling reform , tabloid bild said that politicians could be mislead .
noting that five years ago germany introduced a nonsensical language and spelling reform , with rules that lead to confusion on a babylonian scale .
now that major german newspapers , including bild and der spiegel news weekly announced they were abandoning the language reform and returning to the old way of writing , it was clear that the reforms failed , the editorial continued .
but instead of just admitting their mistakes , the paper wrote , politicians were frantically trying to save as much face as possible by attempting to reform the reforms .
it concluded that rather than create a nation of dyslexics they should just admit defeat and annul the reform .

change is perceptible along the new eu borders . fireworks in malta , loud church bells in hungary , a sea of lights in lithuania and an elegant waltz at the brandenburg gate in berlin - that 's how the european union 's largest enlargement to date was ushered in on may 1 this year . but a 100 days later not much of the optimistic mood remains in zittau , an eastern german town located on the border triangle of poland , the czech republic and germany .
eu euphoria here seems as far away as brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , second right , poland 's then prime minister leszek miller , right , and eu commissioner guenter verheugen in zittau on may 1 " a mere blurb , a showy spectacle , " is how ralf richter , ceo of a company specializing in rust protection in zittau , described the enlargement celebrations , which saw german chancellor gerhard schröder flying in to shake hands with the leaders of poland and the czech republic and breaking ground for a new street in zittau . but now the chancellor and the media circus are gone and " we are n't any better off with the street , " richter said . for the past 10 years , richter has been struggling with his firm in the region which suffers from an acute lack of infrastructure .
now he wants to find quicker routes to new customers behind the border . " change only through hard work " but not everybody shares richter 's pessimism . just behind the border lies zittau 's partner city in the czech republic , hradek . hedvika zimmermanova , hradek 's deputy mayor , said she has no illusions about eu membership .
" we were n't so naive as to believe that the eu would immediately make everything better , " zimmermann said .
" that can only happen through hard work . " zimmermann remembers the hectic days following eu enlargement . " but ever since then - and we knew that before - everything 's the same , " she said . even the czechs are hoping that the new streets promised by their leaders as the country was accepted into the eu , will soon be built . zimmernova , who has to deal daily with authorities from all three countries in the border triangle , however is glad about one aspect . " i no longer need three-quarters of an hour over the border , rather just ten minutes , " she said . imperceptible maybe , but change nonetheless german and polish border guards work side by side in this region , silently but harmoniously checking the passports held out through the windows by car drivers .
a second check point tower is now no longer occupied . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau 's main square " the personal hand-checked controls are very successful , " said arnd voigt , the mayor of zittau .
he added that the opening up of the borders has brought several improvements , many of which are n't immediately evident to the people . a wait and watch attitude is clearly visible in the eastern german border towns since the eu 's eastern enlargement . but the horror images painted by some politicians and economic experts of eastern germany - sandwiched between the richer western germany and the new eu states - being overrun by cheap labor have n't translated into reality . " it 's there for all to see that the fears were slightly exaggerated in the run up to enlargement , " said barbara lippert from the institute for european politics in berlin .
she added that with limitations placed on eastern european workers and markets gaining access to germany , the country 's economy is picking up . cashing in on enlargement lippert also pointed out there 's a reason why the eu 's eastern expansion is n't much of an issue among the people . " the expansion has been the result of years of preparation .
much has already happened on the economic front .
may 1 was simply an act of political integration , " she said , adding that there is n't much interest in the new eu members among the older eu states either . " the people there have no real relation to eastern europe , " according to lippert .
" that , in addition to a rise in prices , is a real disadvantage for the new eu members . " but for some in " old europe " , eastern enlargement has presented unforeseen opportunities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau 's surroundings the german authorities in zittau are using the time to cash in on their new-found fame in the border triangle while the neighbors play catch-up .

change is perceptible along the new eu borders . fireworks in malta , loud church bells in hungary , a sea of lights in lithuania and an elegant waltz at the brandenburg gate in berlin - that 's how the european union 's largest enlargement to date was ushered in on may 1 this year . but a 100 days later not much of the optimistic mood remains in zittau , an eastern german town located on the border triangle of poland , the czech republic and germany .

rallies in leipzig , halle , magdeburg , rostock and suhl will add pressure on schröder to reverse his reforms in the face of record low opinion poll scores for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the reforms will particularly hurt regions of former east germany where unemployment is as high as 17 to 20 percent .
eastern germany has been plagued by high unemployment since national reunification in 1990 as unprofitable former state-run enterprises were closed down .
in july , the jobless rate was at 18.5 percent , more than double the figure in the wealthier western states .
the reforms , part of schröder 's controversial agenda 2010 package , would see benefits for the long-time unemployed slashed to the rate of subsistence-level welfare payments .
the two germanies reunited in 1990 after communism collapsed in east germany with the disintegration of the east bloc in the wake of reforms in the soviet union .
monday demos an east german tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germans in leipzig also held " monday demos " to express their dissent of the iraq war german protest organizers have called for regular " monday demonstrations , " recalling weekly demonstrations 15 years ago in east germany against the dying communist regime .
marches in autumn 1989 drew hundreds of thousands in leipzig , the epicenter of the pro-democracy movement under the communists , and helped set events in motion that led the berlin wall to fall that november .
christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig rallies , said he would join the new protests and dismissed claims that the demonstrators were putting schröder 's government on a par with the communists ' repressive regime .
" you ca n't say , ' we 're happy that you marched against the communists , but you should shut up now ' , " führer told the berlin radio station inforadio .
" that 's totally unacceptable . "
" the monday demonstrations is a brand name , " added winfried helbig from the leipzig social forum .
" the people also went out into the streets in 1989 because they could see no future for themselves . "
" we want to remember 1989 , when the people said : that 's enough , " said attac , an anti-globalization group .
germany 's federal labor agency said some one million people in the eastern states and 1.2 million in the more populous west would be affected by the reforms which also require those on the dole to dip deep into family savings and life insurance policies to support themselves .
schröder , faced with yawning public deficits and stagnant economic growth , has moved to cut government outlays for pensions , health care and other social welfare benefits .
but his plans have sparked waves of protest against the center-left government , with the spd currently trailing the conservative opposition christian union parties by more than 20 percentage points .
the government 's deputy spokesman , hans langguth , denounced monday 's demonstrations as " a higher level of hysteria . "
he accused the media of disinformation by emphasizing the sacrifices instead of the benefits of the reforms .
langguth called on demonstrators to make a clear difference in their minds between what was happening in east germany in 1989 and what was now in play .
economics minister wolfgang clement , the man behind the controversial reforms said the comparison with 1989 was " an insult to the civic courage shown by many east germans . "
the spd accuses former communists - currently enjoying a wave of new popularity , and the conservative opposition in germany of fanning the flames of discontent . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germans stage anti-reform protests in the tradition of the monday demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the communist state 15 years ago , east germans are planning to hold weekly protests against chancellor schröder 's reform package .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2004 east german marches pile pressure on schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands gather for " monday protests " in eastern germany tens of thousands demonstrated monday in 30 cities of former communist east germany against economic reforms by the government of chancellor gerhard schroeder that would cut back unemployment benefits . demonstrators carried banners reading : " schröder must go , " and demanding the creation of a new party of the left .
rallies in leipzig , halle , magdeburg , rostock and suhl will add pressure on schröder to reverse his reforms in the face of record low opinion poll scores for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the reforms will particularly hurt regions of former east germany where unemployment is as high as 17 to 20 percent .
eastern germany has been plagued by high unemployment since national reunification in 1990 as unprofitable former state-run enterprises were closed down .
in july , the jobless rate was at 18.5 percent , more than double the figure in the wealthier western states .
the reforms , part of schröder 's controversial agenda 2010 package , would see benefits for the long-time unemployed slashed to the rate of subsistence-level welfare payments .
the two germanies reunited in 1990 after communism collapsed in east germany with the disintegration of the east bloc in the wake of reforms in the soviet union .
monday demos an east german tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germans in leipzig also held " monday demos " to express their dissent of the iraq war german protest organizers have called for regular " monday demonstrations , " recalling weekly demonstrations 15 years ago in east germany against the dying communist regime .
marches in autumn 1989 drew hundreds of thousands in leipzig , the epicenter of the pro-democracy movement under the communists , and helped set events in motion that led the berlin wall to fall that november .
christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig rallies , said he would join the new protests and dismissed claims that the demonstrators were putting schröder 's government on a par with the communists ' repressive regime .
" you ca n't say , ' we 're happy that you marched against the communists , but you should shut up now ' , " führer told the berlin radio station inforadio .
" that 's totally unacceptable . "
" the monday demonstrations is a brand name , " added winfried helbig from the leipzig social forum .
" the people also went out into the streets in 1989 because they could see no future for themselves . "
" we want to remember 1989 , when the people said : that 's enough , " said attac , an anti-globalization group .
germany 's federal labor agency said some one million people in the eastern states and 1.2 million in the more populous west would be affected by the reforms which also require those on the dole to dip deep into family savings and life insurance policies to support themselves .
schröder , faced with yawning public deficits and stagnant economic growth , has moved to cut government outlays for pensions , health care and other social welfare benefits .
but his plans have sparked waves of protest against the center-left government , with the spd currently trailing the conservative opposition christian union parties by more than 20 percentage points .
the government 's deputy spokesman , hans langguth , denounced monday 's demonstrations as " a higher level of hysteria . "
he accused the media of disinformation by emphasizing the sacrifices instead of the benefits of the reforms .
langguth called on demonstrators to make a clear difference in their minds between what was happening in east germany in 1989 and what was now in play .
economics minister wolfgang clement , the man behind the controversial reforms said the comparison with 1989 was " an insult to the civic courage shown by many east germans . "
the spd accuses former communists - currently enjoying a wave of new popularity , and the conservative opposition in germany of fanning the flames of discontent . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germans stage anti-reform protests in the tradition of the monday demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the communist state 15 years ago , east germans are planning to hold weekly protests against chancellor schröder 's reform package .

last week , a handful of germany 's biggest publishers , including the influential newsweekly der spiegel and the axel springer publishing conglomerate , which includes the mass-circulation bild tabloid , said they would abandon the rules and return to old ones .
the decision has had a domino effect and many publishing houses and broadcasters say they are keen to join the news outlets in their boycott of the new rules .
however , educational policy authorities in austria and switzerland have said they want to uphold the new spelling and language guidelines .
" having several simultaneously valid orthography rules would be fatal , " said christian schmidt , a spokesman for switzerland 's education authority .
german supporters of the reform also criticized the publishers ' move , saying that it was the publishers who were causing uncertainty among germans .
in a written statement issued last week , officials for the conference of german culture ministers , the government body that initiated the reforms , said media companies had so far supported the change . dw-world.de major german media reject spelling reform rejecting a six-year-old spelling reform , several publishing companies have announced they would switch back to the old system .
the move comes shortly after leading conservative politicians had proposed a reversal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2004 east germans stage anti-reform protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans protest cuts in welfare benefits at a leipzig protest in the tradition of the monday demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the communist state 15 years ago , east germans are planning to hold weekly protests against chancellor schröder 's reform package . some 10,000 eastern germans are expected to take to the streets of magdeburg monday evening with a number of other eastern cities set to host smaller rallies .
but the demonstrations organized by german leftists and trade unions are highly controversial and have drawn strong reactions not only from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . organizers of the rallies in eastern german cities hope they can halt schröder ’ s sweeping cuts in benefits for the long-time jobless here , by drawing inspiration from the peaceful monday demonstrations that brought down communism in the region in 1989 . but leading social democrats , such as labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , have slammed the analogy as a shameless abuse of a shining moment in german history .
clement told a newspaper on monday that the comparison was a provocation and an insult to the civil courage that many east germans showed at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement , german minister for economy and labor vera lengsfeld , a former east german civil rights activists and a parliamentary deputy for the conservative christian democratic party , also said the comparison was untenable . " the demonstrations in 1989 were directed against a repressive regime that prevented freedom , " she said .
" but those taking to the streets today are protesting against necessary reforms that ultimately aim to maintain the welfare system in face of the current crisis .
with all due respect to those criticizing chancellor schröder , his government can not be compared with that of communist leader erich honecker . " the anti-communist monday demonstrations in autumn 1989 began with prayers for peace and candlelight marches in the city of leipzig , and towards the end drew more than 100,000 protesters .
last monday a few thousand people joined a rally in magdeburg against the reforms , but turnout is expected to rise this monday .
mouths shut ? the demonstrations ' organizers insist , however , that their actions are justified .
" i do n't understand all the excitement on the part of the political elites , " said christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig protests in 1989 .
it was unacceptable to suggest that " we accept that you took to the streets to oppose the communists , but now you should keep your mouths shut , " führer said .
but führer also criticized that some groups or parties were trying to use the demonstrations for their own purposes . saxon 's christian democratic premier , georg milbradt , said monday he would not rule out his party participating in the protests , " if we are invited . "
hard-hitting reforms the new reform law - set to take effect next year - will bring long-term unemployment benefits down to the amount of subsistence-level welfare payments .
eastern germans are hit hardest by the reforms because long-term joblessness is especially rife here . but the rallies in eastern germany are part of more widespread public outrage over schröder ‘ s agenda 2010 welfare reforms .
internal dissent within the spd over the chancellor ’ s course has also increased .
just last week an anonymous e-mail chain letter called for the chancellor to be toppled .
and on sunday , former spd finance minister oskar lafontaine threatened to help form a breakaway left-wing party if schröder persists with his reforms .
subsequently , social democratic party leader franz müntefering warned all spd rebels against playing with fire : " i accept that people are now taking to the streets , but i don ’ t think they are right , " he said .
" i think their fears are baseless because we actually want to preserve social welfare and not destroy it ...
and all those stoking public fears and resentment must know that they are going to be held responsible for their actions . " lafontaine ’ s comments mark a bid to establish himself as a champion of the spd 's disenchanted left wing , but they have drawn a withering response from spd leaders .
the threats of a breakaway party and the in-fighting about the reforms have already caused the social democrats ' popular support to plunge to a historic low .
sizable demonstrations on mondays are sure to dent the spd 's chances for comeback at the polls even further . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd angered by anti-schröder letter while it 's no secret that some social democrats disagree with chancellor gerhard schröder 's policies , a chain letter of insurgency that surfaced thursday hit too far below the belt for many from the spd .

but the demonstrations organized by german leftists and trade unions are highly controversial and have drawn strong reactions not only from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . organizers of the rallies in eastern german cities hope they can halt schröder ’ s sweeping cuts in benefits for the long-time jobless here , by drawing inspiration from the peaceful monday demonstrations that brought down communism in the region in 1989 . but leading social democrats , such as labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , have slammed the analogy as a shameless abuse of a shining moment in german history .
clement told a newspaper on monday that the comparison was a provocation and an insult to the civil courage that many east germans showed at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement , german minister for economy and labor vera lengsfeld , a former east german civil rights activists and a parliamentary deputy for the conservative christian democratic party , also said the comparison was untenable . " the demonstrations in 1989 were directed against a repressive regime that prevented freedom , " she said .
" but those taking to the streets today are protesting against necessary reforms that ultimately aim to maintain the welfare system in face of the current crisis .
with all due respect to those criticizing chancellor schröder , his government can not be compared with that of communist leader erich honecker . " the anti-communist monday demonstrations in autumn 1989 began with prayers for peace and candlelight marches in the city of leipzig , and towards the end drew more than 100,000 protesters .
last monday a few thousand people joined a rally in magdeburg against the reforms , but turnout is expected to rise this monday .
mouths shut ? the demonstrations ' organizers insist , however , that their actions are justified .
" i do n't understand all the excitement on the part of the political elites , " said christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig protests in 1989 .
it was unacceptable to suggest that " we accept that you took to the streets to oppose the communists , but now you should keep your mouths shut , " führer said .
but führer also criticized that some groups or parties were trying to use the demonstrations for their own purposes . saxon 's christian democratic premier , georg milbradt , said monday he would not rule out his party participating in the protests , " if we are invited . "
hard-hitting reforms the new reform law - set to take effect next year - will bring long-term unemployment benefits down to the amount of subsistence-level welfare payments .
eastern germans are hit hardest by the reforms because long-term joblessness is especially rife here . but the rallies in eastern germany are part of more widespread public outrage over schröder ‘ s agenda 2010 welfare reforms .
internal dissent within the spd over the chancellor ’ s course has also increased .
just last week an anonymous e-mail chain letter called for the chancellor to be toppled .
and on sunday , former spd finance minister oskar lafontaine threatened to help form a breakaway left-wing party if schröder persists with his reforms .
subsequently , social democratic party leader franz müntefering warned all spd rebels against playing with fire : " i accept that people are now taking to the streets , but i don ’ t think they are right , " he said .
" i think their fears are baseless because we actually want to preserve social welfare and not destroy it ...
and all those stoking public fears and resentment must know that they are going to be held responsible for their actions . " lafontaine ’ s comments mark a bid to establish himself as a champion of the spd 's disenchanted left wing , but they have drawn a withering response from spd leaders .
the threats of a breakaway party and the in-fighting about the reforms have already caused the social democrats ' popular support to plunge to a historic low .
sizable demonstrations on mondays are sure to dent the spd 's chances for comeback at the polls even further . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd angered by anti-schröder letter while it 's no secret that some social democrats disagree with chancellor gerhard schröder 's policies , a chain letter of insurgency that surfaced thursday hit too far below the belt for many from the spd .

it was unacceptable to suggest that " we accept that you took to the streets to oppose the communists , but now you should keep your mouths shut , " führer said .
but führer also criticized that some groups or parties were trying to use the demonstrations for their own purposes . saxon 's christian democratic premier , georg milbradt , said monday he would not rule out his party participating in the protests , " if we are invited . "
hard-hitting reforms the new reform law - set to take effect next year - will bring long-term unemployment benefits down to the amount of subsistence-level welfare payments .
eastern germans are hit hardest by the reforms because long-term joblessness is especially rife here . but the rallies in eastern germany are part of more widespread public outrage over schröder ‘ s agenda 2010 welfare reforms .
internal dissent within the spd over the chancellor ’ s course has also increased .
just last week an anonymous e-mail chain letter called for the chancellor to be toppled .
and on sunday , former spd finance minister oskar lafontaine threatened to help form a breakaway left-wing party if schröder persists with his reforms .
subsequently , social democratic party leader franz müntefering warned all spd rebels against playing with fire : " i accept that people are now taking to the streets , but i don ’ t think they are right , " he said .
" i think their fears are baseless because we actually want to preserve social welfare and not destroy it ...
and all those stoking public fears and resentment must know that they are going to be held responsible for their actions . " lafontaine ’ s comments mark a bid to establish himself as a champion of the spd 's disenchanted left wing , but they have drawn a withering response from spd leaders .
the threats of a breakaway party and the in-fighting about the reforms have already caused the social democrats ' popular support to plunge to a historic low .
sizable demonstrations on mondays are sure to dent the spd 's chances for comeback at the polls even further . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd angered by anti-schröder letter while it 's no secret that some social democrats disagree with chancellor gerhard schröder 's policies , a chain letter of insurgency that surfaced thursday hit too far below the belt for many from the spd .

change is perceptible along the new eu borders . fireworks in malta , loud church bells in hungary , a sea of lights in lithuania and an elegant waltz at the brandenburg gate in berlin - that 's how the european union 's largest enlargement to date was ushered in on may 1 this year . but a 100 days later not much of the optimistic mood remains in zittau , an eastern german town located on the border triangle of poland , the czech republic and germany .
eu euphoria here seems as far away as brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , second right , poland 's then prime minister leszek miller , right , and eu commissioner guenter verheugen in zittau on may 1 " a mere blurb , a showy spectacle , " is how ralf richter , ceo of a company specializing in rust protection in zittau , described the enlargement celebrations , which saw german chancellor gerhard schröder flying in to shake hands with the leaders of poland and the czech republic and breaking ground for a new street in zittau . but now the chancellor and the media circus are gone and " we are n't any better off with the street , " richter said . for the past 10 years , richter has been struggling with his firm in the region which suffers from an acute lack of infrastructure .
now he wants to find quicker routes to new customers behind the border . " change only through hard work " but not everybody shares richter 's pessimism . just behind the border lies zittau 's partner city in the czech republic , hradek . hedvika zimmermanova , hradek 's deputy mayor , said she has no illusions about eu membership .
" we were n't so naive as to believe that the eu would immediately make everything better , " zimmermann said .
" that can only happen through hard work . " zimmermann remembers the hectic days following eu enlargement . " but ever since then - and we knew that before - everything 's the same , " she said . even the czechs are hoping that the new streets promised by their leaders as the country was accepted into the eu , will soon be built . zimmernova , who has to deal daily with authorities from all three countries in the border triangle , however is glad about one aspect . " i no longer need three-quarters of an hour over the border , rather just ten minutes , " she said . imperceptible maybe , but change nonetheless german and polish border guards work side by side in this region , silently but harmoniously checking the passports held out through the windows by car drivers .
a second check point tower is now no longer occupied . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau 's main square " the personal hand-checked controls are very successful , " said arnd voigt , the mayor of zittau .
he added that the opening up of the borders has brought several improvements , many of which are n't immediately evident to the people . a wait and watch attitude is clearly visible in the eastern german border towns since the eu 's eastern enlargement . but the horror images painted by some politicians and economic experts of eastern germany - sandwiched between the richer western germany and the new eu states - being overrun by cheap labor have n't translated into reality . " it 's there for all to see that the fears were slightly exaggerated in the run up to enlargement , " said barbara lippert from the institute for european politics in berlin .
she added that with limitations placed on eastern european workers and markets gaining access to germany , the country 's economy is picking up . cashing in on enlargement lippert also pointed out there 's a reason why the eu 's eastern expansion is n't much of an issue among the people . " the expansion has been the result of years of preparation .
much has already happened on the economic front .
may 1 was simply an act of political integration , " she said , adding that there is n't much interest in the new eu members among the older eu states either . " the people there have no real relation to eastern europe , " according to lippert .
" that , in addition to a rise in prices , is a real disadvantage for the new eu members . " but for some in " old europe " , eastern enlargement has presented unforeseen opportunities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau 's surroundings the german authorities in zittau are using the time to cash in on their new-found fame in the border triangle while the neighbors play catch-up . " we 've never had so many tourists as at present , " said voigt , adding that former residents of zittau are coming from as far away as canada to visit . margret steffen -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what will change with eu expansion ?

last week , a handful of germany 's biggest publishers , including the influential newsweekly der spiegel and the axel springer publishing conglomerate , which includes the mass-circulation bild tabloid , said they would abandon the rules and return to old ones .
the decision has had a domino effect and many publishing houses and broadcasters say they are keen to join the news outlets in their boycott of the new rules .
however , educational policy authorities in austria and switzerland have said they want to uphold the new spelling and language guidelines .
" having several simultaneously valid orthography rules would be fatal , " said christian schmidt , a spokesman for switzerland 's education authority .
german supporters of the reform also criticized the publishers ' move , saying that it was the publishers who were causing uncertainty among germans .
in a written statement issued last week , officials for the conference of german culture ministers , the government body that initiated the reforms , said media companies had so far supported the change . dw-world.de major german media reject spelling reform rejecting a six-year-old spelling reform , several publishing companies have announced they would switch back to the old system .
the move comes shortly after leading conservative politicians had proposed a reversal .

last week , a handful of germany 's biggest publishers , including the influential newsweekly der spiegel and the axel springer publishing conglomerate , which includes the mass-circulation bild tabloid , said they would abandon the rules and return to old ones .
the decision has had a domino effect and many publishing houses and broadcasters say they are keen to join the news outlets in their boycott of the new rules .
however , educational policy authorities in austria and switzerland have said they want to uphold the new spelling and language guidelines .
" having several simultaneously valid orthography rules would be fatal , " said christian schmidt , a spokesman for switzerland 's education authority .
german supporters of the reform also criticized the publishers ' move , saying that it was the publishers who were causing uncertainty among germans .
in a written statement issued last week , officials for the conference of german culture ministers , the government body that initiated the reforms , said media companies had so far supported the change . dw-world.de major german media reject spelling reform rejecting a six-year-old spelling reform , several publishing companies have announced they would switch back to the old system .
the move comes shortly after leading conservative politicians had proposed a reversal .

but the demonstrations organized by german leftists and trade unions are highly controversial and have drawn strong reactions not only from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . organizers of the rallies in eastern german cities hope they can halt schröder ’ s sweeping cuts in benefits for the long-time jobless here , by drawing inspiration from the peaceful monday demonstrations that brought down communism in the region in 1989 . but leading social democrats , such as labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , have slammed the analogy as a shameless abuse of a shining moment in german history .
clement told a newspaper on monday that the comparison was a provocation and an insult to the civil courage that many east germans showed at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement , german minister for economy and labor vera lengsfeld , a former east german civil rights activists and a parliamentary deputy for the conservative christian democratic party , also said the comparison was untenable . " the demonstrations in 1989 were directed against a repressive regime that prevented freedom , " she said .
" but those taking to the streets today are protesting against necessary reforms that ultimately aim to maintain the welfare system in face of the current crisis .
with all due respect to those criticizing chancellor schröder , his government can not be compared with that of communist leader erich honecker . " the anti-communist monday demonstrations in autumn 1989 began with prayers for peace and candlelight marches in the city of leipzig , and towards the end drew more than 100,000 protesters .
last monday a few thousand people joined a rally in magdeburg against the reforms , but turnout is expected to rise this monday .
mouths shut ? the demonstrations ' organizers insist , however , that their actions are justified .
" i do n't understand all the excitement on the part of the political elites , " said christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig protests in 1989 .
it was unacceptable to suggest that " we accept that you took to the streets to oppose the communists , but now you should keep your mouths shut , " führer said .
but führer also criticized that some groups or parties were trying to use the demonstrations for their own purposes . saxon 's christian democratic premier , georg milbradt , said monday he would not rule out his party participating in the protests , " if we are invited . "
hard-hitting reforms the new reform law - set to take effect next year - will bring long-term unemployment benefits down to the amount of subsistence-level welfare payments .
eastern germans are hit hardest by the reforms because long-term joblessness is especially rife here . but the rallies in eastern germany are part of more widespread public outrage over schröder ‘ s agenda 2010 welfare reforms .
internal dissent within the spd over the chancellor ’ s course has also increased .
just last week an anonymous e-mail chain letter called for the chancellor to be toppled .
and on sunday , former spd finance minister oskar lafontaine threatened to help form a breakaway left-wing party if schröder persists with his reforms .
subsequently , social democratic party leader franz müntefering warned all spd rebels against playing with fire : " i accept that people are now taking to the streets , but i don ’ t think they are right , " he said .
" i think their fears are baseless because we actually want to preserve social welfare and not destroy it ...
and all those stoking public fears and resentment must know that they are going to be held responsible for their actions . " lafontaine ’ s comments mark a bid to establish himself as a champion of the spd 's disenchanted left wing , but they have drawn a withering response from spd leaders .
the threats of a breakaway party and the in-fighting about the reforms have already caused the social democrats ' popular support to plunge to a historic low .
sizable demonstrations on mondays are sure to dent the spd 's chances for comeback at the polls even further . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd angered by anti-schröder letter while it 's no secret that some social democrats disagree with chancellor gerhard schröder 's policies , a chain letter of insurgency that surfaced thursday hit too far below the belt for many from the spd .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2004 east germans stage anti-reform protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans protest cuts in welfare benefits at a leipzig protest in the tradition of the monday demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the communist state 15 years ago , east germans are planning to hold weekly protests against chancellor schröder 's reform package . some 10,000 eastern germans are expected to take to the streets of magdeburg monday evening with a number of other eastern cities set to host smaller rallies .
but the demonstrations organized by german leftists and trade unions are highly controversial and have drawn strong reactions not only from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . organizers of the rallies in eastern german cities hope they can halt schröder ’ s sweeping cuts in benefits for the long-time jobless here , by drawing inspiration from the peaceful monday demonstrations that brought down communism in the region in 1989 . but leading social democrats , such as labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , have slammed the analogy as a shameless abuse of a shining moment in german history .
clement told a newspaper on monday that the comparison was a provocation and an insult to the civil courage that many east germans showed at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement , german minister for economy and labor vera lengsfeld , a former east german civil rights activists and a parliamentary deputy for the conservative christian democratic party , also said the comparison was untenable . " the demonstrations in 1989 were directed against a repressive regime that prevented freedom , " she said .
" but those taking to the streets today are protesting against necessary reforms that ultimately aim to maintain the welfare system in face of the current crisis .
with all due respect to those criticizing chancellor schröder , his government can not be compared with that of communist leader erich honecker . " the anti-communist monday demonstrations in autumn 1989 began with prayers for peace and candlelight marches in the city of leipzig , and towards the end drew more than 100,000 protesters .
last monday a few thousand people joined a rally in magdeburg against the reforms , but turnout is expected to rise this monday .
mouths shut ? the demonstrations ' organizers insist , however , that their actions are justified .
" i do n't understand all the excitement on the part of the political elites , " said christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig protests in 1989 .
it was unacceptable to suggest that " we accept that you took to the streets to oppose the communists , but now you should keep your mouths shut , " führer said .
but führer also criticized that some groups or parties were trying to use the demonstrations for their own purposes . saxon 's christian democratic premier , georg milbradt , said monday he would not rule out his party participating in the protests , " if we are invited . "
hard-hitting reforms the new reform law - set to take effect next year - will bring long-term unemployment benefits down to the amount of subsistence-level welfare payments .
eastern germans are hit hardest by the reforms because long-term joblessness is especially rife here . but the rallies in eastern germany are part of more widespread public outrage over schröder ‘ s agenda 2010 welfare reforms .
internal dissent within the spd over the chancellor ’ s course has also increased .
just last week an anonymous e-mail chain letter called for the chancellor to be toppled .
and on sunday , former spd finance minister oskar lafontaine threatened to help form a breakaway left-wing party if schröder persists with his reforms .
subsequently , social democratic party leader franz müntefering warned all spd rebels against playing with fire : " i accept that people are now taking to the streets , but i don ’ t think they are right , " he said .
" i think their fears are baseless because we actually want to preserve social welfare and not destroy it ...

but the demonstrations organized by german leftists and trade unions are highly controversial and have drawn strong reactions not only from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . organizers of the rallies in eastern german cities hope they can halt schröder ’ s sweeping cuts in benefits for the long-time jobless here , by drawing inspiration from the peaceful monday demonstrations that brought down communism in the region in 1989 . but leading social democrats , such as labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , have slammed the analogy as a shameless abuse of a shining moment in german history .
clement told a newspaper on monday that the comparison was a provocation and an insult to the civil courage that many east germans showed at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement , german minister for economy and labor vera lengsfeld , a former east german civil rights activists and a parliamentary deputy for the conservative christian democratic party , also said the comparison was untenable . " the demonstrations in 1989 were directed against a repressive regime that prevented freedom , " she said .
" but those taking to the streets today are protesting against necessary reforms that ultimately aim to maintain the welfare system in face of the current crisis .
with all due respect to those criticizing chancellor schröder , his government can not be compared with that of communist leader erich honecker . " the anti-communist monday demonstrations in autumn 1989 began with prayers for peace and candlelight marches in the city of leipzig , and towards the end drew more than 100,000 protesters .
last monday a few thousand people joined a rally in magdeburg against the reforms , but turnout is expected to rise this monday .
mouths shut ? the demonstrations ' organizers insist , however , that their actions are justified .
" i do n't understand all the excitement on the part of the political elites , " said christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig protests in 1989 .
it was unacceptable to suggest that " we accept that you took to the streets to oppose the communists , but now you should keep your mouths shut , " führer said .
but führer also criticized that some groups or parties were trying to use the demonstrations for their own purposes . saxon 's christian democratic premier , georg milbradt , said monday he would not rule out his party participating in the protests , " if we are invited . "
hard-hitting reforms the new reform law - set to take effect next year - will bring long-term unemployment benefits down to the amount of subsistence-level welfare payments .
eastern germans are hit hardest by the reforms because long-term joblessness is especially rife here . but the rallies in eastern germany are part of more widespread public outrage over schröder ‘ s agenda 2010 welfare reforms .
internal dissent within the spd over the chancellor ’ s course has also increased .
just last week an anonymous e-mail chain letter called for the chancellor to be toppled .
and on sunday , former spd finance minister oskar lafontaine threatened to help form a breakaway left-wing party if schröder persists with his reforms .
subsequently , social democratic party leader franz müntefering warned all spd rebels against playing with fire : " i accept that people are now taking to the streets , but i don ’ t think they are right , " he said .
" i think their fears are baseless because we actually want to preserve social welfare and not destroy it ...
and all those stoking public fears and resentment must know that they are going to be held responsible for their actions . " lafontaine ’ s comments mark a bid to establish himself as a champion of the spd 's disenchanted left wing , but they have drawn a withering response from spd leaders .
the threats of a breakaway party and the in-fighting about the reforms have already caused the social democrats ' popular support to plunge to a historic low .

the reforms will particularly hurt regions of former east germany where unemployment is as high as 17 to 20 percent .
eastern germany has been plagued by high unemployment since national reunification in 1990 as unprofitable former state-run enterprises were closed down .
in july , the jobless rate was at 18.5 percent , more than double the figure in the wealthier western states .

germany 's federal labor agency said some one million people in the eastern states and 1.2 million in the more populous west would be affected by the reforms which also require those on the dole to dip deep into family savings and life insurance policies to support themselves .
schröder , faced with yawning public deficits and stagnant economic growth , has moved to cut government outlays for pensions , health care and other social welfare benefits .

change is perceptible along the new eu borders . fireworks in malta , loud church bells in hungary , a sea of lights in lithuania and an elegant waltz at the brandenburg gate in berlin - that 's how the european union 's largest enlargement to date was ushered in on may 1 this year . but a 100 days later not much of the optimistic mood remains in zittau , an eastern german town located on the border triangle of poland , the czech republic and germany .
eu euphoria here seems as far away as brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , second right , poland 's then prime minister leszek miller , right , and eu commissioner guenter verheugen in zittau on may 1 " a mere blurb , a showy spectacle , " is how ralf richter , ceo of a company specializing in rust protection in zittau , described the enlargement celebrations , which saw german chancellor gerhard schröder flying in to shake hands with the leaders of poland and the czech republic and breaking ground for a new street in zittau . but now the chancellor and the media circus are gone and " we are n't any better off with the street , " richter said . for the past 10 years , richter has been struggling with his firm in the region which suffers from an acute lack of infrastructure .
now he wants to find quicker routes to new customers behind the border . " change only through hard work " but not everybody shares richter 's pessimism . just behind the border lies zittau 's partner city in the czech republic , hradek . hedvika zimmermanova , hradek 's deputy mayor , said she has no illusions about eu membership .
" we were n't so naive as to believe that the eu would immediately make everything better , " zimmermann said .
" that can only happen through hard work . " zimmermann remembers the hectic days following eu enlargement . " but ever since then - and we knew that before - everything 's the same , " she said . even the czechs are hoping that the new streets promised by their leaders as the country was accepted into the eu , will soon be built . zimmernova , who has to deal daily with authorities from all three countries in the border triangle , however is glad about one aspect . " i no longer need three-quarters of an hour over the border , rather just ten minutes , " she said . imperceptible maybe , but change nonetheless german and polish border guards work side by side in this region , silently but harmoniously checking the passports held out through the windows by car drivers .
a second check point tower is now no longer occupied . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau 's main square " the personal hand-checked controls are very successful , " said arnd voigt , the mayor of zittau .
he added that the opening up of the borders has brought several improvements , many of which are n't immediately evident to the people . a wait and watch attitude is clearly visible in the eastern german border towns since the eu 's eastern enlargement . but the horror images painted by some politicians and economic experts of eastern germany - sandwiched between the richer western germany and the new eu states - being overrun by cheap labor have n't translated into reality . " it 's there for all to see that the fears were slightly exaggerated in the run up to enlargement , " said barbara lippert from the institute for european politics in berlin .
she added that with limitations placed on eastern european workers and markets gaining access to germany , the country 's economy is picking up . cashing in on enlargement lippert also pointed out there 's a reason why the eu 's eastern expansion is n't much of an issue among the people . " the expansion has been the result of years of preparation .
much has already happened on the economic front .
may 1 was simply an act of political integration , " she said , adding that there is n't much interest in the new eu members among the older eu states either . " the people there have no real relation to eastern europe , " according to lippert .
" that , in addition to a rise in prices , is a real disadvantage for the new eu members . " but for some in " old europe " , eastern enlargement has presented unforeseen opportunities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau 's surroundings the german authorities in zittau are using the time to cash in on their new-found fame in the border triangle while the neighbors play catch-up . " we 've never had so many tourists as at present , " said voigt , adding that former residents of zittau are coming from as far away as canada to visit . margret steffen -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what will change with eu expansion ?

rallies in leipzig , halle , magdeburg , rostock and suhl will add pressure on schröder to reverse his reforms in the face of record low opinion poll scores for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the reforms will particularly hurt regions of former east germany where unemployment is as high as 17 to 20 percent .
eastern germany has been plagued by high unemployment since national reunification in 1990 as unprofitable former state-run enterprises were closed down .
in july , the jobless rate was at 18.5 percent , more than double the figure in the wealthier western states .
the reforms , part of schröder 's controversial agenda 2010 package , would see benefits for the long-time unemployed slashed to the rate of subsistence-level welfare payments .

marches in autumn 1989 drew hundreds of thousands in leipzig , the epicenter of the pro-democracy movement under the communists , and helped set events in motion that led the berlin wall to fall that november .
christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig rallies , said he would join the new protests and dismissed claims that the demonstrators were putting schröder 's government on a par with the communists ' repressive regime .

germany 's federal labor agency said some one million people in the eastern states and 1.2 million in the more populous west would be affected by the reforms which also require those on the dole to dip deep into family savings and life insurance policies to support themselves .
schröder , faced with yawning public deficits and stagnant economic growth , has moved to cut government outlays for pensions , health care and other social welfare benefits .

the government 's deputy spokesman , hans langguth , denounced monday 's demonstrations as " a higher level of hysteria . "

marches in autumn 1989 drew hundreds of thousands in leipzig , the epicenter of the pro-democracy movement under the communists , and helped set events in motion that led the berlin wall to fall that november .
christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig rallies , said he would join the new protests and dismissed claims that the demonstrators were putting schröder 's government on a par with the communists ' repressive regime .
" you ca n't say , ' we 're happy that you marched against the communists , but you should shut up now ' , " führer told the berlin radio station inforadio .
" that 's totally unacceptable . "
" the monday demonstrations is a brand name , " added winfried helbig from the leipzig social forum .
" the people also went out into the streets in 1989 because they could see no future for themselves . "
" we want to remember 1989 , when the people said : that 's enough , " said attac , an anti-globalization group .
germany 's federal labor agency said some one million people in the eastern states and 1.2 million in the more populous west would be affected by the reforms which also require those on the dole to dip deep into family savings and life insurance policies to support themselves .
schröder , faced with yawning public deficits and stagnant economic growth , has moved to cut government outlays for pensions , health care and other social welfare benefits .
but his plans have sparked waves of protest against the center-left government , with the spd currently trailing the conservative opposition christian union parties by more than 20 percentage points .
the government 's deputy spokesman , hans langguth , denounced monday 's demonstrations as " a higher level of hysteria . "
he accused the media of disinformation by emphasizing the sacrifices instead of the benefits of the reforms .
langguth called on demonstrators to make a clear difference in their minds between what was happening in east germany in 1989 and what was now in play .
economics minister wolfgang clement , the man behind the controversial reforms said the comparison with 1989 was " an insult to the civic courage shown by many east germans . "
the spd accuses former communists - currently enjoying a wave of new popularity , and the conservative opposition in germany of fanning the flames of discontent . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germans stage anti-reform protests in the tradition of the monday demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the communist state 15 years ago , east germans are planning to hold weekly protests against chancellor schröder 's reform package .

last week , a handful of germany 's biggest publishers , including the influential newsweekly der spiegel and the axel springer publishing conglomerate , which includes the mass-circulation bild tabloid , said they would abandon the rules and return to old ones .
the decision has had a domino effect and many publishing houses and broadcasters say they are keen to join the news outlets in their boycott of the new rules .
however , educational policy authorities in austria and switzerland have said they want to uphold the new spelling and language guidelines .
" having several simultaneously valid orthography rules would be fatal , " said christian schmidt , a spokesman for switzerland 's education authority .
german supporters of the reform also criticized the publishers ' move , saying that it was the publishers who were causing uncertainty among germans .
in a written statement issued last week , officials for the conference of german culture ministers , the government body that initiated the reforms , said media companies had so far supported the change . dw-world.de major german media reject spelling reform rejecting a six-year-old spelling reform , several publishing companies have announced they would switch back to the old system .
the move comes shortly after leading conservative politicians had proposed a reversal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.08.2004 enlarged eu sparks change along borders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euphoria that marked eu enlargement has n't all evaporated over 100 days have passed since the eu expanded to take in ten new members , who entered the bloc with a mixture of hope and euphoria on may 1 .
change is perceptible along the new eu borders . fireworks in malta , loud church bells in hungary , a sea of lights in lithuania and an elegant waltz at the brandenburg gate in berlin - that 's how the european union 's largest enlargement to date was ushered in on may 1 this year . but a 100 days later not much of the optimistic mood remains in zittau , an eastern german town located on the border triangle of poland , the czech republic and germany .
eu euphoria here seems as far away as brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , second right , poland 's then prime minister leszek miller , right , and eu commissioner guenter verheugen in zittau on may 1 " a mere blurb , a showy spectacle , " is how ralf richter , ceo of a company specializing in rust protection in zittau , described the enlargement celebrations , which saw german chancellor gerhard schröder flying in to shake hands with the leaders of poland and the czech republic and breaking ground for a new street in zittau . but now the chancellor and the media circus are gone and " we are n't any better off with the street , " richter said . for the past 10 years , richter has been struggling with his firm in the region which suffers from an acute lack of infrastructure .
now he wants to find quicker routes to new customers behind the border . " change only through hard work " but not everybody shares richter 's pessimism . just behind the border lies zittau 's partner city in the czech republic , hradek . hedvika zimmermanova , hradek 's deputy mayor , said she has no illusions about eu membership .
" we were n't so naive as to believe that the eu would immediately make everything better , " zimmermann said .
" that can only happen through hard work . " zimmermann remembers the hectic days following eu enlargement . " but ever since then - and we knew that before - everything 's the same , " she said . even the czechs are hoping that the new streets promised by their leaders as the country was accepted into the eu , will soon be built . zimmernova , who has to deal daily with authorities from all three countries in the border triangle , however is glad about one aspect . " i no longer need three-quarters of an hour over the border , rather just ten minutes , " she said . imperceptible maybe , but change nonetheless german and polish border guards work side by side in this region , silently but harmoniously checking the passports held out through the windows by car drivers .
a second check point tower is now no longer occupied . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau 's main square " the personal hand-checked controls are very successful , " said arnd voigt , the mayor of zittau .
he added that the opening up of the borders has brought several improvements , many of which are n't immediately evident to the people . a wait and watch attitude is clearly visible in the eastern german border towns since the eu 's eastern enlargement . but the horror images painted by some politicians and economic experts of eastern germany - sandwiched between the richer western germany and the new eu states - being overrun by cheap labor have n't translated into reality . " it 's there for all to see that the fears were slightly exaggerated in the run up to enlargement , " said barbara lippert from the institute for european politics in berlin .
she added that with limitations placed on eastern european workers and markets gaining access to germany , the country 's economy is picking up . cashing in on enlargement lippert also pointed out there 's a reason why the eu 's eastern expansion is n't much of an issue among the people . " the expansion has been the result of years of preparation .
much has already happened on the economic front .
may 1 was simply an act of political integration , " she said , adding that there is n't much interest in the new eu members among the older eu states either . " the people there have no real relation to eastern europe , " according to lippert .
" that , in addition to a rise in prices , is a real disadvantage for the new eu members . " but for some in " old europe " , eastern enlargement has presented unforeseen opportunities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau 's surroundings the german authorities in zittau are using the time to cash in on their new-found fame in the border triangle while the neighbors play catch-up . " we 've never had so many tourists as at present , " said voigt , adding that former residents of zittau are coming from as far away as canada to visit . margret steffen -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what will change with eu expansion ?
though the 10 new eu states will become full members of the bloc and fully adopt community law , some exceptions will be applied - at least for interim periods .

but the demonstrations organized by german leftists and trade unions are highly controversial and have drawn strong reactions not only from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . organizers of the rallies in eastern german cities hope they can halt schröder ’ s sweeping cuts in benefits for the long-time jobless here , by drawing inspiration from the peaceful monday demonstrations that brought down communism in the region in 1989 . but leading social democrats , such as labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , have slammed the analogy as a shameless abuse of a shining moment in german history .
clement told a newspaper on monday that the comparison was a provocation and an insult to the civil courage that many east germans showed at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement , german minister for economy and labor vera lengsfeld , a former east german civil rights activists and a parliamentary deputy for the conservative christian democratic party , also said the comparison was untenable . " the demonstrations in 1989 were directed against a repressive regime that prevented freedom , " she said .
" but those taking to the streets today are protesting against necessary reforms that ultimately aim to maintain the welfare system in face of the current crisis .
with all due respect to those criticizing chancellor schröder , his government can not be compared with that of communist leader erich honecker . " the anti-communist monday demonstrations in autumn 1989 began with prayers for peace and candlelight marches in the city of leipzig , and towards the end drew more than 100,000 protesters .
last monday a few thousand people joined a rally in magdeburg against the reforms , but turnout is expected to rise this monday .
mouths shut ? the demonstrations ' organizers insist , however , that their actions are justified .
" i do n't understand all the excitement on the part of the political elites , " said christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig protests in 1989 .
it was unacceptable to suggest that " we accept that you took to the streets to oppose the communists , but now you should keep your mouths shut , " führer said .
but führer also criticized that some groups or parties were trying to use the demonstrations for their own purposes . saxon 's christian democratic premier , georg milbradt , said monday he would not rule out his party participating in the protests , " if we are invited . "
hard-hitting reforms the new reform law - set to take effect next year - will bring long-term unemployment benefits down to the amount of subsistence-level welfare payments .
eastern germans are hit hardest by the reforms because long-term joblessness is especially rife here . but the rallies in eastern germany are part of more widespread public outrage over schröder ‘ s agenda 2010 welfare reforms .
internal dissent within the spd over the chancellor ’ s course has also increased .
just last week an anonymous e-mail chain letter called for the chancellor to be toppled .
and on sunday , former spd finance minister oskar lafontaine threatened to help form a breakaway left-wing party if schröder persists with his reforms .
subsequently , social democratic party leader franz müntefering warned all spd rebels against playing with fire : " i accept that people are now taking to the streets , but i don ’ t think they are right , " he said .
" i think their fears are baseless because we actually want to preserve social welfare and not destroy it ...
and all those stoking public fears and resentment must know that they are going to be held responsible for their actions . " lafontaine ’ s comments mark a bid to establish himself as a champion of the spd 's disenchanted left wing , but they have drawn a withering response from spd leaders .
the threats of a breakaway party and the in-fighting about the reforms have already caused the social democrats ' popular support to plunge to a historic low .
sizable demonstrations on mondays are sure to dent the spd 's chances for comeback at the polls even further . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd angered by anti-schröder letter while it 's no secret that some social democrats disagree with chancellor gerhard schröder 's policies , a chain letter of insurgency that surfaced thursday hit too far below the belt for many from the spd .

last monday a few thousand people joined a rally in magdeburg against the reforms , but turnout is expected to rise this monday .
mouths shut ? the demonstrations ' organizers insist , however , that their actions are justified .
" i do n't understand all the excitement on the part of the political elites , " said christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig protests in 1989 .
it was unacceptable to suggest that " we accept that you took to the streets to oppose the communists , but now you should keep your mouths shut , " führer said .

eastern germans are hit hardest by the reforms because long-term joblessness is especially rife here . but the rallies in eastern germany are part of more widespread public outrage over schröder ‘ s agenda 2010 welfare reforms .
internal dissent within the spd over the chancellor ’ s course has also increased .
just last week an anonymous e-mail chain letter called for the chancellor to be toppled .
and on sunday , former spd finance minister oskar lafontaine threatened to help form a breakaway left-wing party if schröder persists with his reforms .
subsequently , social democratic party leader franz müntefering warned all spd rebels against playing with fire : " i accept that people are now taking to the streets , but i don ’ t think they are right , " he said .
" i think their fears are baseless because we actually want to preserve social welfare and not destroy it ...
and all those stoking public fears and resentment must know that they are going to be held responsible for their actions . " lafontaine ’ s comments mark a bid to establish himself as a champion of the spd 's disenchanted left wing , but they have drawn a withering response from spd leaders .
the threats of a breakaway party and the in-fighting about the reforms have already caused the social democrats ' popular support to plunge to a historic low .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2004 east germans stage anti-reform protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans protest cuts in welfare benefits at a leipzig protest in the tradition of the monday demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the communist state 15 years ago , east germans are planning to hold weekly protests against chancellor schröder 's reform package . some 10,000 eastern germans are expected to take to the streets of magdeburg monday evening with a number of other eastern cities set to host smaller rallies .
but the demonstrations organized by german leftists and trade unions are highly controversial and have drawn strong reactions not only from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . organizers of the rallies in eastern german cities hope they can halt schröder ’ s sweeping cuts in benefits for the long-time jobless here , by drawing inspiration from the peaceful monday demonstrations that brought down communism in the region in 1989 . but leading social democrats , such as labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , have slammed the analogy as a shameless abuse of a shining moment in german history .
clement told a newspaper on monday that the comparison was a provocation and an insult to the civil courage that many east germans showed at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement , german minister for economy and labor vera lengsfeld , a former east german civil rights activists and a parliamentary deputy for the conservative christian democratic party , also said the comparison was untenable . " the demonstrations in 1989 were directed against a repressive regime that prevented freedom , " she said .
" but those taking to the streets today are protesting against necessary reforms that ultimately aim to maintain the welfare system in face of the current crisis .
with all due respect to those criticizing chancellor schröder , his government can not be compared with that of communist leader erich honecker . " the anti-communist monday demonstrations in autumn 1989 began with prayers for peace and candlelight marches in the city of leipzig , and towards the end drew more than 100,000 protesters .
last monday a few thousand people joined a rally in magdeburg against the reforms , but turnout is expected to rise this monday .
mouths shut ? the demonstrations ' organizers insist , however , that their actions are justified .
" i do n't understand all the excitement on the part of the political elites , " said christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig protests in 1989 .
it was unacceptable to suggest that " we accept that you took to the streets to oppose the communists , but now you should keep your mouths shut , " führer said .
but führer also criticized that some groups or parties were trying to use the demonstrations for their own purposes . saxon 's christian democratic premier , georg milbradt , said monday he would not rule out his party participating in the protests , " if we are invited . "
hard-hitting reforms the new reform law - set to take effect next year - will bring long-term unemployment benefits down to the amount of subsistence-level welfare payments .
eastern germans are hit hardest by the reforms because long-term joblessness is especially rife here . but the rallies in eastern germany are part of more widespread public outrage over schröder ‘ s agenda 2010 welfare reforms .
internal dissent within the spd over the chancellor ’ s course has also increased .
just last week an anonymous e-mail chain letter called for the chancellor to be toppled .
and on sunday , former spd finance minister oskar lafontaine threatened to help form a breakaway left-wing party if schröder persists with his reforms .
subsequently , social democratic party leader franz müntefering warned all spd rebels against playing with fire : " i accept that people are now taking to the streets , but i don ’ t think they are right , " he said .
" i think their fears are baseless because we actually want to preserve social welfare and not destroy it ...
and all those stoking public fears and resentment must know that they are going to be held responsible for their actions . " lafontaine ’ s comments mark a bid to establish himself as a champion of the spd 's disenchanted left wing , but they have drawn a withering response from spd leaders .
the threats of a breakaway party and the in-fighting about the reforms have already caused the social democrats ' popular support to plunge to a historic low .
sizable demonstrations on mondays are sure to dent the spd 's chances for comeback at the polls even further . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd angered by anti-schröder letter while it 's no secret that some social democrats disagree with chancellor gerhard schröder 's policies , a chain letter of insurgency that surfaced thursday hit too far below the belt for many from the spd .

the reforms will particularly hurt regions of former east germany where unemployment is as high as 17 to 20 percent .
eastern germany has been plagued by high unemployment since national reunification in 1990 as unprofitable former state-run enterprises were closed down .
in july , the jobless rate was at 18.5 percent , more than double the figure in the wealthier western states .
the reforms , part of schröder 's controversial agenda 2010 package , would see benefits for the long-time unemployed slashed to the rate of subsistence-level welfare payments .

monday demos an east german tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germans in leipzig also held " monday demos " to express their dissent of the iraq war german protest organizers have called for regular " monday demonstrations , " recalling weekly demonstrations 15 years ago in east germany against the dying communist regime .
marches in autumn 1989 drew hundreds of thousands in leipzig , the epicenter of the pro-democracy movement under the communists , and helped set events in motion that led the berlin wall to fall that november .
christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig rallies , said he would join the new protests and dismissed claims that the demonstrators were putting schröder 's government on a par with the communists ' repressive regime .
" you ca n't say , ' we 're happy that you marched against the communists , but you should shut up now ' , " führer told the berlin radio station inforadio .
" that 's totally unacceptable . "
" the monday demonstrations is a brand name , " added winfried helbig from the leipzig social forum .
" the people also went out into the streets in 1989 because they could see no future for themselves . "
" we want to remember 1989 , when the people said : that 's enough , " said attac , an anti-globalization group .
germany 's federal labor agency said some one million people in the eastern states and 1.2 million in the more populous west would be affected by the reforms which also require those on the dole to dip deep into family savings and life insurance policies to support themselves .
schröder , faced with yawning public deficits and stagnant economic growth , has moved to cut government outlays for pensions , health care and other social welfare benefits .
but his plans have sparked waves of protest against the center-left government , with the spd currently trailing the conservative opposition christian union parties by more than 20 percentage points .
the government 's deputy spokesman , hans langguth , denounced monday 's demonstrations as " a higher level of hysteria . "
he accused the media of disinformation by emphasizing the sacrifices instead of the benefits of the reforms .
langguth called on demonstrators to make a clear difference in their minds between what was happening in east germany in 1989 and what was now in play .

but the demonstrations organized by german leftists and trade unions are highly controversial and have drawn strong reactions not only from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . organizers of the rallies in eastern german cities hope they can halt schröder ’ s sweeping cuts in benefits for the long-time jobless here , by drawing inspiration from the peaceful monday demonstrations that brought down communism in the region in 1989 . but leading social democrats , such as labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , have slammed the analogy as a shameless abuse of a shining moment in german history .
clement told a newspaper on monday that the comparison was a provocation and an insult to the civil courage that many east germans showed at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement , german minister for economy and labor vera lengsfeld , a former east german civil rights activists and a parliamentary deputy for the conservative christian democratic party , also said the comparison was untenable . " the demonstrations in 1989 were directed against a repressive regime that prevented freedom , " she said .
" but those taking to the streets today are protesting against necessary reforms that ultimately aim to maintain the welfare system in face of the current crisis .
with all due respect to those criticizing chancellor schröder , his government can not be compared with that of communist leader erich honecker . " the anti-communist monday demonstrations in autumn 1989 began with prayers for peace and candlelight marches in the city of leipzig , and towards the end drew more than 100,000 protesters .
last monday a few thousand people joined a rally in magdeburg against the reforms , but turnout is expected to rise this monday .
mouths shut ? the demonstrations ' organizers insist , however , that their actions are justified .
" i do n't understand all the excitement on the part of the political elites , " said christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig protests in 1989 .
it was unacceptable to suggest that " we accept that you took to the streets to oppose the communists , but now you should keep your mouths shut , " führer said .
but führer also criticized that some groups or parties were trying to use the demonstrations for their own purposes . saxon 's christian democratic premier , georg milbradt , said monday he would not rule out his party participating in the protests , " if we are invited . "
hard-hitting reforms the new reform law - set to take effect next year - will bring long-term unemployment benefits down to the amount of subsistence-level welfare payments .
eastern germans are hit hardest by the reforms because long-term joblessness is especially rife here . but the rallies in eastern germany are part of more widespread public outrage over schröder ‘ s agenda 2010 welfare reforms .
internal dissent within the spd over the chancellor ’ s course has also increased .
just last week an anonymous e-mail chain letter called for the chancellor to be toppled .
and on sunday , former spd finance minister oskar lafontaine threatened to help form a breakaway left-wing party if schröder persists with his reforms .
subsequently , social democratic party leader franz müntefering warned all spd rebels against playing with fire : " i accept that people are now taking to the streets , but i don ’ t think they are right , " he said .
" i think their fears are baseless because we actually want to preserve social welfare and not destroy it ...
and all those stoking public fears and resentment must know that they are going to be held responsible for their actions . " lafontaine ’ s comments mark a bid to establish himself as a champion of the spd 's disenchanted left wing , but they have drawn a withering response from spd leaders .
the threats of a breakaway party and the in-fighting about the reforms have already caused the social democrats ' popular support to plunge to a historic low .
sizable demonstrations on mondays are sure to dent the spd 's chances for comeback at the polls even further . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd angered by anti-schröder letter while it 's no secret that some social democrats disagree with chancellor gerhard schröder 's policies , a chain letter of insurgency that surfaced thursday hit too far below the belt for many from the spd .

eastern germans are hit hardest by the reforms because long-term joblessness is especially rife here . but the rallies in eastern germany are part of more widespread public outrage over schröder ‘ s agenda 2010 welfare reforms .
internal dissent within the spd over the chancellor ’ s course has also increased .
just last week an anonymous e-mail chain letter called for the chancellor to be toppled .
and on sunday , former spd finance minister oskar lafontaine threatened to help form a breakaway left-wing party if schröder persists with his reforms .
subsequently , social democratic party leader franz müntefering warned all spd rebels against playing with fire : " i accept that people are now taking to the streets , but i don ’ t think they are right , " he said .
" i think their fears are baseless because we actually want to preserve social welfare and not destroy it ...
and all those stoking public fears and resentment must know that they are going to be held responsible for their actions . " lafontaine ’ s comments mark a bid to establish himself as a champion of the spd 's disenchanted left wing , but they have drawn a withering response from spd leaders .
the threats of a breakaway party and the in-fighting about the reforms have already caused the social democrats ' popular support to plunge to a historic low .
sizable demonstrations on mondays are sure to dent the spd 's chances for comeback at the polls even further . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd angered by anti-schröder letter while it 's no secret that some social democrats disagree with chancellor gerhard schröder 's policies , a chain letter of insurgency that surfaced thursday hit too far below the belt for many from the spd .

rallies in leipzig , halle , magdeburg , rostock and suhl will add pressure on schröder to reverse his reforms in the face of record low opinion poll scores for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the reforms will particularly hurt regions of former east germany where unemployment is as high as 17 to 20 percent .
eastern germany has been plagued by high unemployment since national reunification in 1990 as unprofitable former state-run enterprises were closed down .
in july , the jobless rate was at 18.5 percent , more than double the figure in the wealthier western states .
the reforms , part of schröder 's controversial agenda 2010 package , would see benefits for the long-time unemployed slashed to the rate of subsistence-level welfare payments .
the two germanies reunited in 1990 after communism collapsed in east germany with the disintegration of the east bloc in the wake of reforms in the soviet union .
monday demos an east german tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germans in leipzig also held " monday demos " to express their dissent of the iraq war german protest organizers have called for regular " monday demonstrations , " recalling weekly demonstrations 15 years ago in east germany against the dying communist regime .
marches in autumn 1989 drew hundreds of thousands in leipzig , the epicenter of the pro-democracy movement under the communists , and helped set events in motion that led the berlin wall to fall that november .
christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig rallies , said he would join the new protests and dismissed claims that the demonstrators were putting schröder 's government on a par with the communists ' repressive regime .
" you ca n't say , ' we 're happy that you marched against the communists , but you should shut up now ' , " führer told the berlin radio station inforadio .
" that 's totally unacceptable . "
" the monday demonstrations is a brand name , " added winfried helbig from the leipzig social forum .
" the people also went out into the streets in 1989 because they could see no future for themselves . "
" we want to remember 1989 , when the people said : that 's enough , " said attac , an anti-globalization group .
germany 's federal labor agency said some one million people in the eastern states and 1.2 million in the more populous west would be affected by the reforms which also require those on the dole to dip deep into family savings and life insurance policies to support themselves .
schröder , faced with yawning public deficits and stagnant economic growth , has moved to cut government outlays for pensions , health care and other social welfare benefits .
but his plans have sparked waves of protest against the center-left government , with the spd currently trailing the conservative opposition christian union parties by more than 20 percentage points .
the government 's deputy spokesman , hans langguth , denounced monday 's demonstrations as " a higher level of hysteria . "
he accused the media of disinformation by emphasizing the sacrifices instead of the benefits of the reforms .
langguth called on demonstrators to make a clear difference in their minds between what was happening in east germany in 1989 and what was now in play .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.08.2004 enlarged eu sparks change along borders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euphoria that marked eu enlargement has n't all evaporated over 100 days have passed since the eu expanded to take in ten new members , who entered the bloc with a mixture of hope and euphoria on may 1 .
change is perceptible along the new eu borders . fireworks in malta , loud church bells in hungary , a sea of lights in lithuania and an elegant waltz at the brandenburg gate in berlin - that 's how the european union 's largest enlargement to date was ushered in on may 1 this year . but a 100 days later not much of the optimistic mood remains in zittau , an eastern german town located on the border triangle of poland , the czech republic and germany .
eu euphoria here seems as far away as brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , second right , poland 's then prime minister leszek miller , right , and eu commissioner guenter verheugen in zittau on may 1 " a mere blurb , a showy spectacle , " is how ralf richter , ceo of a company specializing in rust protection in zittau , described the enlargement celebrations , which saw german chancellor gerhard schröder flying in to shake hands with the leaders of poland and the czech republic and breaking ground for a new street in zittau . but now the chancellor and the media circus are gone and " we are n't any better off with the street , " richter said . for the past 10 years , richter has been struggling with his firm in the region which suffers from an acute lack of infrastructure .
now he wants to find quicker routes to new customers behind the border . " change only through hard work " but not everybody shares richter 's pessimism . just behind the border lies zittau 's partner city in the czech republic , hradek . hedvika zimmermanova , hradek 's deputy mayor , said she has no illusions about eu membership .
" we were n't so naive as to believe that the eu would immediately make everything better , " zimmermann said .
" that can only happen through hard work . " zimmermann remembers the hectic days following eu enlargement . " but ever since then - and we knew that before - everything 's the same , " she said . even the czechs are hoping that the new streets promised by their leaders as the country was accepted into the eu , will soon be built . zimmernova , who has to deal daily with authorities from all three countries in the border triangle , however is glad about one aspect .

rallies in leipzig , halle , magdeburg , rostock and suhl will add pressure on schröder to reverse his reforms in the face of record low opinion poll scores for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the reforms will particularly hurt regions of former east germany where unemployment is as high as 17 to 20 percent .
eastern germany has been plagued by high unemployment since national reunification in 1990 as unprofitable former state-run enterprises were closed down .
in july , the jobless rate was at 18.5 percent , more than double the figure in the wealthier western states .
the reforms , part of schröder 's controversial agenda 2010 package , would see benefits for the long-time unemployed slashed to the rate of subsistence-level welfare payments .
the two germanies reunited in 1990 after communism collapsed in east germany with the disintegration of the east bloc in the wake of reforms in the soviet union .
monday demos an east german tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germans in leipzig also held " monday demos " to express their dissent of the iraq war german protest organizers have called for regular " monday demonstrations , " recalling weekly demonstrations 15 years ago in east germany against the dying communist regime .
marches in autumn 1989 drew hundreds of thousands in leipzig , the epicenter of the pro-democracy movement under the communists , and helped set events in motion that led the berlin wall to fall that november .
christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig rallies , said he would join the new protests and dismissed claims that the demonstrators were putting schröder 's government on a par with the communists ' repressive regime .
" you ca n't say , ' we 're happy that you marched against the communists , but you should shut up now ' , " führer told the berlin radio station inforadio .
" that 's totally unacceptable . "
" the monday demonstrations is a brand name , " added winfried helbig from the leipzig social forum .
" the people also went out into the streets in 1989 because they could see no future for themselves . "
" we want to remember 1989 , when the people said : that 's enough , " said attac , an anti-globalization group .
germany 's federal labor agency said some one million people in the eastern states and 1.2 million in the more populous west would be affected by the reforms which also require those on the dole to dip deep into family savings and life insurance policies to support themselves .
schröder , faced with yawning public deficits and stagnant economic growth , has moved to cut government outlays for pensions , health care and other social welfare benefits .
but his plans have sparked waves of protest against the center-left government , with the spd currently trailing the conservative opposition christian union parties by more than 20 percentage points .
the government 's deputy spokesman , hans langguth , denounced monday 's demonstrations as " a higher level of hysteria . "
he accused the media of disinformation by emphasizing the sacrifices instead of the benefits of the reforms .
langguth called on demonstrators to make a clear difference in their minds between what was happening in east germany in 1989 and what was now in play .
economics minister wolfgang clement , the man behind the controversial reforms said the comparison with 1989 was " an insult to the civic courage shown by many east germans . "
the spd accuses former communists - currently enjoying a wave of new popularity , and the conservative opposition in germany of fanning the flames of discontent . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germans stage anti-reform protests in the tradition of the monday demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the communist state 15 years ago , east germans are planning to hold weekly protests against chancellor schröder 's reform package .

change is perceptible along the new eu borders . fireworks in malta , loud church bells in hungary , a sea of lights in lithuania and an elegant waltz at the brandenburg gate in berlin - that 's how the european union 's largest enlargement to date was ushered in on may 1 this year . but a 100 days later not much of the optimistic mood remains in zittau , an eastern german town located on the border triangle of poland , the czech republic and germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2004 east germans stage anti-reform protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans protest cuts in welfare benefits at a leipzig protest in the tradition of the monday demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the communist state 15 years ago , east germans are planning to hold weekly protests against chancellor schröder 's reform package . some 10,000 eastern germans are expected to take to the streets of magdeburg monday evening with a number of other eastern cities set to host smaller rallies .
but the demonstrations organized by german leftists and trade unions are highly controversial and have drawn strong reactions not only from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . organizers of the rallies in eastern german cities hope they can halt schröder ’ s sweeping cuts in benefits for the long-time jobless here , by drawing inspiration from the peaceful monday demonstrations that brought down communism in the region in 1989 . but leading social democrats , such as labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , have slammed the analogy as a shameless abuse of a shining moment in german history .
clement told a newspaper on monday that the comparison was a provocation and an insult to the civil courage that many east germans showed at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement , german minister for economy and labor vera lengsfeld , a former east german civil rights activists and a parliamentary deputy for the conservative christian democratic party , also said the comparison was untenable . " the demonstrations in 1989 were directed against a repressive regime that prevented freedom , " she said .
" but those taking to the streets today are protesting against necessary reforms that ultimately aim to maintain the welfare system in face of the current crisis .
with all due respect to those criticizing chancellor schröder , his government can not be compared with that of communist leader erich honecker . " the anti-communist monday demonstrations in autumn 1989 began with prayers for peace and candlelight marches in the city of leipzig , and towards the end drew more than 100,000 protesters .
last monday a few thousand people joined a rally in magdeburg against the reforms , but turnout is expected to rise this monday .
mouths shut ? the demonstrations ' organizers insist , however , that their actions are justified .
" i do n't understand all the excitement on the part of the political elites , " said christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig protests in 1989 .
it was unacceptable to suggest that " we accept that you took to the streets to oppose the communists , but now you should keep your mouths shut , " führer said .
but führer also criticized that some groups or parties were trying to use the demonstrations for their own purposes . saxon 's christian democratic premier , georg milbradt , said monday he would not rule out his party participating in the protests , " if we are invited . "
hard-hitting reforms the new reform law - set to take effect next year - will bring long-term unemployment benefits down to the amount of subsistence-level welfare payments .
eastern germans are hit hardest by the reforms because long-term joblessness is especially rife here . but the rallies in eastern germany are part of more widespread public outrage over schröder ‘ s agenda 2010 welfare reforms .
internal dissent within the spd over the chancellor ’ s course has also increased .
just last week an anonymous e-mail chain letter called for the chancellor to be toppled .
and on sunday , former spd finance minister oskar lafontaine threatened to help form a breakaway left-wing party if schröder persists with his reforms .
subsequently , social democratic party leader franz müntefering warned all spd rebels against playing with fire : " i accept that people are now taking to the streets , but i don ’ t think they are right , " he said .
" i think their fears are baseless because we actually want to preserve social welfare and not destroy it ...

but the demonstrations organized by german leftists and trade unions are highly controversial and have drawn strong reactions not only from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . organizers of the rallies in eastern german cities hope they can halt schröder ’ s sweeping cuts in benefits for the long-time jobless here , by drawing inspiration from the peaceful monday demonstrations that brought down communism in the region in 1989 . but leading social democrats , such as labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , have slammed the analogy as a shameless abuse of a shining moment in german history .
clement told a newspaper on monday that the comparison was a provocation and an insult to the civil courage that many east germans showed at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement , german minister for economy and labor vera lengsfeld , a former east german civil rights activists and a parliamentary deputy for the conservative christian democratic party , also said the comparison was untenable . " the demonstrations in 1989 were directed against a repressive regime that prevented freedom , " she said .
" but those taking to the streets today are protesting against necessary reforms that ultimately aim to maintain the welfare system in face of the current crisis .
with all due respect to those criticizing chancellor schröder , his government can not be compared with that of communist leader erich honecker . " the anti-communist monday demonstrations in autumn 1989 began with prayers for peace and candlelight marches in the city of leipzig , and towards the end drew more than 100,000 protesters .
last monday a few thousand people joined a rally in magdeburg against the reforms , but turnout is expected to rise this monday .
mouths shut ? the demonstrations ' organizers insist , however , that their actions are justified .
" i do n't understand all the excitement on the part of the political elites , " said christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig protests in 1989 .
it was unacceptable to suggest that " we accept that you took to the streets to oppose the communists , but now you should keep your mouths shut , " führer said .
but führer also criticized that some groups or parties were trying to use the demonstrations for their own purposes . saxon 's christian democratic premier , georg milbradt , said monday he would not rule out his party participating in the protests , " if we are invited . "
hard-hitting reforms the new reform law - set to take effect next year - will bring long-term unemployment benefits down to the amount of subsistence-level welfare payments .
eastern germans are hit hardest by the reforms because long-term joblessness is especially rife here . but the rallies in eastern germany are part of more widespread public outrage over schröder ‘ s agenda 2010 welfare reforms .
internal dissent within the spd over the chancellor ’ s course has also increased .
just last week an anonymous e-mail chain letter called for the chancellor to be toppled .
and on sunday , former spd finance minister oskar lafontaine threatened to help form a breakaway left-wing party if schröder persists with his reforms .
subsequently , social democratic party leader franz müntefering warned all spd rebels against playing with fire : " i accept that people are now taking to the streets , but i don ’ t think they are right , " he said .
" i think their fears are baseless because we actually want to preserve social welfare and not destroy it ...
and all those stoking public fears and resentment must know that they are going to be held responsible for their actions . " lafontaine ’ s comments mark a bid to establish himself as a champion of the spd 's disenchanted left wing , but they have drawn a withering response from spd leaders .
the threats of a breakaway party and the in-fighting about the reforms have already caused the social democrats ' popular support to plunge to a historic low .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2004 east german marches pile pressure on schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands gather for " monday protests " in eastern germany tens of thousands demonstrated monday in 30 cities of former communist east germany against economic reforms by the government of chancellor gerhard schroeder that would cut back unemployment benefits . demonstrators carried banners reading : " schröder must go , " and demanding the creation of a new party of the left .
rallies in leipzig , halle , magdeburg , rostock and suhl will add pressure on schröder to reverse his reforms in the face of record low opinion poll scores for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the reforms will particularly hurt regions of former east germany where unemployment is as high as 17 to 20 percent .
eastern germany has been plagued by high unemployment since national reunification in 1990 as unprofitable former state-run enterprises were closed down .
in july , the jobless rate was at 18.5 percent , more than double the figure in the wealthier western states .
the reforms , part of schröder 's controversial agenda 2010 package , would see benefits for the long-time unemployed slashed to the rate of subsistence-level welfare payments .
the two germanies reunited in 1990 after communism collapsed in east germany with the disintegration of the east bloc in the wake of reforms in the soviet union .
monday demos an east german tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germans in leipzig also held " monday demos " to express their dissent of the iraq war german protest organizers have called for regular " monday demonstrations , " recalling weekly demonstrations 15 years ago in east germany against the dying communist regime .
marches in autumn 1989 drew hundreds of thousands in leipzig , the epicenter of the pro-democracy movement under the communists , and helped set events in motion that led the berlin wall to fall that november .
christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig rallies , said he would join the new protests and dismissed claims that the demonstrators were putting schröder 's government on a par with the communists ' repressive regime .
" you ca n't say , ' we 're happy that you marched against the communists , but you should shut up now ' , " führer told the berlin radio station inforadio .
" that 's totally unacceptable . "
" the monday demonstrations is a brand name , " added winfried helbig from the leipzig social forum .
" the people also went out into the streets in 1989 because they could see no future for themselves . "
" we want to remember 1989 , when the people said : that 's enough , " said attac , an anti-globalization group .
germany 's federal labor agency said some one million people in the eastern states and 1.2 million in the more populous west would be affected by the reforms which also require those on the dole to dip deep into family savings and life insurance policies to support themselves .
schröder , faced with yawning public deficits and stagnant economic growth , has moved to cut government outlays for pensions , health care and other social welfare benefits .
but his plans have sparked waves of protest against the center-left government , with the spd currently trailing the conservative opposition christian union parties by more than 20 percentage points .
the government 's deputy spokesman , hans langguth , denounced monday 's demonstrations as " a higher level of hysteria . "
he accused the media of disinformation by emphasizing the sacrifices instead of the benefits of the reforms .
langguth called on demonstrators to make a clear difference in their minds between what was happening in east germany in 1989 and what was now in play .
economics minister wolfgang clement , the man behind the controversial reforms said the comparison with 1989 was " an insult to the civic courage shown by many east germans . "
the spd accuses former communists - currently enjoying a wave of new popularity , and the conservative opposition in germany of fanning the flames of discontent . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germans stage anti-reform protests in the tradition of the monday demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the communist state 15 years ago , east germans are planning to hold weekly protests against chancellor schröder 's reform package .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2004 east germans stage anti-reform protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans protest cuts in welfare benefits at a leipzig protest in the tradition of the monday demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the communist state 15 years ago , east germans are planning to hold weekly protests against chancellor schröder 's reform package . some 10,000 eastern germans are expected to take to the streets of magdeburg monday evening with a number of other eastern cities set to host smaller rallies .
but the demonstrations organized by german leftists and trade unions are highly controversial and have drawn strong reactions not only from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . organizers of the rallies in eastern german cities hope they can halt schröder ’ s sweeping cuts in benefits for the long-time jobless here , by drawing inspiration from the peaceful monday demonstrations that brought down communism in the region in 1989 . but leading social democrats , such as labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , have slammed the analogy as a shameless abuse of a shining moment in german history .
clement told a newspaper on monday that the comparison was a provocation and an insult to the civil courage that many east germans showed at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement , german minister for economy and labor vera lengsfeld , a former east german civil rights activists and a parliamentary deputy for the conservative christian democratic party , also said the comparison was untenable . " the demonstrations in 1989 were directed against a repressive regime that prevented freedom , " she said .
" but those taking to the streets today are protesting against necessary reforms that ultimately aim to maintain the welfare system in face of the current crisis .
with all due respect to those criticizing chancellor schröder , his government can not be compared with that of communist leader erich honecker . " the anti-communist monday demonstrations in autumn 1989 began with prayers for peace and candlelight marches in the city of leipzig , and towards the end drew more than 100,000 protesters .
last monday a few thousand people joined a rally in magdeburg against the reforms , but turnout is expected to rise this monday .
mouths shut ? the demonstrations ' organizers insist , however , that their actions are justified .
" i do n't understand all the excitement on the part of the political elites , " said christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig protests in 1989 .
it was unacceptable to suggest that " we accept that you took to the streets to oppose the communists , but now you should keep your mouths shut , " führer said .
but führer also criticized that some groups or parties were trying to use the demonstrations for their own purposes . saxon 's christian democratic premier , georg milbradt , said monday he would not rule out his party participating in the protests , " if we are invited . "
hard-hitting reforms the new reform law - set to take effect next year - will bring long-term unemployment benefits down to the amount of subsistence-level welfare payments .
eastern germans are hit hardest by the reforms because long-term joblessness is especially rife here . but the rallies in eastern germany are part of more widespread public outrage over schröder ‘ s agenda 2010 welfare reforms .
internal dissent within the spd over the chancellor ’ s course has also increased .
just last week an anonymous e-mail chain letter called for the chancellor to be toppled .
and on sunday , former spd finance minister oskar lafontaine threatened to help form a breakaway left-wing party if schröder persists with his reforms .
subsequently , social democratic party leader franz müntefering warned all spd rebels against playing with fire : " i accept that people are now taking to the streets , but i don ’ t think they are right , " he said .
" i think their fears are baseless because we actually want to preserve social welfare and not destroy it ...
and all those stoking public fears and resentment must know that they are going to be held responsible for their actions . " lafontaine ’ s comments mark a bid to establish himself as a champion of the spd 's disenchanted left wing , but they have drawn a withering response from spd leaders .
the threats of a breakaway party and the in-fighting about the reforms have already caused the social democrats ' popular support to plunge to a historic low .
sizable demonstrations on mondays are sure to dent the spd 's chances for comeback at the polls even further . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd angered by anti-schröder letter while it 's no secret that some social democrats disagree with chancellor gerhard schröder 's policies , a chain letter of insurgency that surfaced thursday hit too far below the belt for many from the spd .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2004 east germans stage anti-reform protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans protest cuts in welfare benefits at a leipzig protest in the tradition of the monday demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the communist state 15 years ago , east germans are planning to hold weekly protests against chancellor schröder 's reform package . some 10,000 eastern germans are expected to take to the streets of magdeburg monday evening with a number of other eastern cities set to host smaller rallies .
but the demonstrations organized by german leftists and trade unions are highly controversial and have drawn strong reactions not only from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . organizers of the rallies in eastern german cities hope they can halt schröder ’ s sweeping cuts in benefits for the long-time jobless here , by drawing inspiration from the peaceful monday demonstrations that brought down communism in the region in 1989 . but leading social democrats , such as labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , have slammed the analogy as a shameless abuse of a shining moment in german history .
clement told a newspaper on monday that the comparison was a provocation and an insult to the civil courage that many east germans showed at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement , german minister for economy and labor vera lengsfeld , a former east german civil rights activists and a parliamentary deputy for the conservative christian democratic party , also said the comparison was untenable . " the demonstrations in 1989 were directed against a repressive regime that prevented freedom , " she said .
" but those taking to the streets today are protesting against necessary reforms that ultimately aim to maintain the welfare system in face of the current crisis .
with all due respect to those criticizing chancellor schröder , his government can not be compared with that of communist leader erich honecker . " the anti-communist monday demonstrations in autumn 1989 began with prayers for peace and candlelight marches in the city of leipzig , and towards the end drew more than 100,000 protesters .
last monday a few thousand people joined a rally in magdeburg against the reforms , but turnout is expected to rise this monday .
mouths shut ? the demonstrations ' organizers insist , however , that their actions are justified .
" i do n't understand all the excitement on the part of the political elites , " said christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig protests in 1989 .
it was unacceptable to suggest that " we accept that you took to the streets to oppose the communists , but now you should keep your mouths shut , " führer said .
but führer also criticized that some groups or parties were trying to use the demonstrations for their own purposes . saxon 's christian democratic premier , georg milbradt , said monday he would not rule out his party participating in the protests , " if we are invited . "
hard-hitting reforms the new reform law - set to take effect next year - will bring long-term unemployment benefits down to the amount of subsistence-level welfare payments .
eastern germans are hit hardest by the reforms because long-term joblessness is especially rife here . but the rallies in eastern germany are part of more widespread public outrage over schröder ‘ s agenda 2010 welfare reforms .
internal dissent within the spd over the chancellor ’ s course has also increased .
just last week an anonymous e-mail chain letter called for the chancellor to be toppled .
and on sunday , former spd finance minister oskar lafontaine threatened to help form a breakaway left-wing party if schröder persists with his reforms .
subsequently , social democratic party leader franz müntefering warned all spd rebels against playing with fire : " i accept that people are now taking to the streets , but i don ’ t think they are right , " he said .

last week , a handful of germany 's biggest publishers , including the influential newsweekly der spiegel and the axel springer publishing conglomerate , which includes the mass-circulation bild tabloid , said they would abandon the rules and return to old ones .
the decision has had a domino effect and many publishing houses and broadcasters say they are keen to join the news outlets in their boycott of the new rules .
however , educational policy authorities in austria and switzerland have said they want to uphold the new spelling and language guidelines .
" having several simultaneously valid orthography rules would be fatal , " said christian schmidt , a spokesman for switzerland 's education authority .
german supporters of the reform also criticized the publishers ' move , saying that it was the publishers who were causing uncertainty among germans .
in a written statement issued last week , officials for the conference of german culture ministers , the government body that initiated the reforms , said media companies had so far supported the change . dw-world.de major german media reject spelling reform rejecting a six-year-old spelling reform , several publishing companies have announced they would switch back to the old system .
the move comes shortly after leading conservative politicians had proposed a reversal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2004 east germans stage anti-reform protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans protest cuts in welfare benefits at a leipzig protest in the tradition of the monday demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the communist state 15 years ago , east germans are planning to hold weekly protests against chancellor schröder 's reform package . some 10,000 eastern germans are expected to take to the streets of magdeburg monday evening with a number of other eastern cities set to host smaller rallies .
but the demonstrations organized by german leftists and trade unions are highly controversial and have drawn strong reactions not only from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . organizers of the rallies in eastern german cities hope they can halt schröder ’ s sweeping cuts in benefits for the long-time jobless here , by drawing inspiration from the peaceful monday demonstrations that brought down communism in the region in 1989 . but leading social democrats , such as labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , have slammed the analogy as a shameless abuse of a shining moment in german history .
clement told a newspaper on monday that the comparison was a provocation and an insult to the civil courage that many east germans showed at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement , german minister for economy and labor vera lengsfeld , a former east german civil rights activists and a parliamentary deputy for the conservative christian democratic party , also said the comparison was untenable . " the demonstrations in 1989 were directed against a repressive regime that prevented freedom , " she said .
" but those taking to the streets today are protesting against necessary reforms that ultimately aim to maintain the welfare system in face of the current crisis .
with all due respect to those criticizing chancellor schröder , his government can not be compared with that of communist leader erich honecker . " the anti-communist monday demonstrations in autumn 1989 began with prayers for peace and candlelight marches in the city of leipzig , and towards the end drew more than 100,000 protesters .
last monday a few thousand people joined a rally in magdeburg against the reforms , but turnout is expected to rise this monday .
mouths shut ? the demonstrations ' organizers insist , however , that their actions are justified .
" i do n't understand all the excitement on the part of the political elites , " said christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig protests in 1989 .
it was unacceptable to suggest that " we accept that you took to the streets to oppose the communists , but now you should keep your mouths shut , " führer said .
but führer also criticized that some groups or parties were trying to use the demonstrations for their own purposes . saxon 's christian democratic premier , georg milbradt , said monday he would not rule out his party participating in the protests , " if we are invited . "
hard-hitting reforms the new reform law - set to take effect next year - will bring long-term unemployment benefits down to the amount of subsistence-level welfare payments .
eastern germans are hit hardest by the reforms because long-term joblessness is especially rife here . but the rallies in eastern germany are part of more widespread public outrage over schröder ‘ s agenda 2010 welfare reforms .
internal dissent within the spd over the chancellor ’ s course has also increased .
just last week an anonymous e-mail chain letter called for the chancellor to be toppled .
and on sunday , former spd finance minister oskar lafontaine threatened to help form a breakaway left-wing party if schröder persists with his reforms .
subsequently , social democratic party leader franz müntefering warned all spd rebels against playing with fire : " i accept that people are now taking to the streets , but i don ’ t think they are right , " he said .
" i think their fears are baseless because we actually want to preserve social welfare and not destroy it ...
and all those stoking public fears and resentment must know that they are going to be held responsible for their actions . " lafontaine ’ s comments mark a bid to establish himself as a champion of the spd 's disenchanted left wing , but they have drawn a withering response from spd leaders .
the threats of a breakaway party and the in-fighting about the reforms have already caused the social democrats ' popular support to plunge to a historic low .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.08.2004 enlarged eu sparks change along borders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euphoria that marked eu enlargement has n't all evaporated over 100 days have passed since the eu expanded to take in ten new members , who entered the bloc with a mixture of hope and euphoria on may 1 .
change is perceptible along the new eu borders . fireworks in malta , loud church bells in hungary , a sea of lights in lithuania and an elegant waltz at the brandenburg gate in berlin - that 's how the european union 's largest enlargement to date was ushered in on may 1 this year . but a 100 days later not much of the optimistic mood remains in zittau , an eastern german town located on the border triangle of poland , the czech republic and germany .
eu euphoria here seems as far away as brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , second right , poland 's then prime minister leszek miller , right , and eu commissioner guenter verheugen in zittau on may 1 " a mere blurb , a showy spectacle , " is how ralf richter , ceo of a company specializing in rust protection in zittau , described the enlargement celebrations , which saw german chancellor gerhard schröder flying in to shake hands with the leaders of poland and the czech republic and breaking ground for a new street in zittau . but now the chancellor and the media circus are gone and " we are n't any better off with the street , " richter said . for the past 10 years , richter has been struggling with his firm in the region which suffers from an acute lack of infrastructure .
now he wants to find quicker routes to new customers behind the border . " change only through hard work " but not everybody shares richter 's pessimism . just behind the border lies zittau 's partner city in the czech republic , hradek . hedvika zimmermanova , hradek 's deputy mayor , said she has no illusions about eu membership .
" we were n't so naive as to believe that the eu would immediately make everything better , " zimmermann said .
" that can only happen through hard work . " zimmermann remembers the hectic days following eu enlargement . " but ever since then - and we knew that before - everything 's the same , " she said . even the czechs are hoping that the new streets promised by their leaders as the country was accepted into the eu , will soon be built . zimmernova , who has to deal daily with authorities from all three countries in the border triangle , however is glad about one aspect . " i no longer need three-quarters of an hour over the border , rather just ten minutes , " she said . imperceptible maybe , but change nonetheless german and polish border guards work side by side in this region , silently but harmoniously checking the passports held out through the windows by car drivers .
a second check point tower is now no longer occupied . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau 's main square " the personal hand-checked controls are very successful , " said arnd voigt , the mayor of zittau .
he added that the opening up of the borders has brought several improvements , many of which are n't immediately evident to the people . a wait and watch attitude is clearly visible in the eastern german border towns since the eu 's eastern enlargement . but the horror images painted by some politicians and economic experts of eastern germany - sandwiched between the richer western germany and the new eu states - being overrun by cheap labor have n't translated into reality . " it 's there for all to see that the fears were slightly exaggerated in the run up to enlargement , " said barbara lippert from the institute for european politics in berlin .
she added that with limitations placed on eastern european workers and markets gaining access to germany , the country 's economy is picking up . cashing in on enlargement lippert also pointed out there 's a reason why the eu 's eastern expansion is n't much of an issue among the people . " the expansion has been the result of years of preparation .
much has already happened on the economic front .
may 1 was simply an act of political integration , " she said , adding that there is n't much interest in the new eu members among the older eu states either . " the people there have no real relation to eastern europe , " according to lippert .
" that , in addition to a rise in prices , is a real disadvantage for the new eu members . " but for some in " old europe " , eastern enlargement has presented unforeseen opportunities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau 's surroundings the german authorities in zittau are using the time to cash in on their new-found fame in the border triangle while the neighbors play catch-up . " we 've never had so many tourists as at present , " said voigt , adding that former residents of zittau are coming from as far away as canada to visit . margret steffen -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what will change with eu expansion ?
though the 10 new eu states will become full members of the bloc and fully adopt community law , some exceptions will be applied - at least for interim periods .
here 's a list of the most important changes .
-lrb- april 30 , 2004 -rrb- germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.08.2004 enlarged eu sparks change along borders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euphoria that marked eu enlargement has n't all evaporated over 100 days have passed since the eu expanded to take in ten new members , who entered the bloc with a mixture of hope and euphoria on may 1 .
change is perceptible along the new eu borders . fireworks in malta , loud church bells in hungary , a sea of lights in lithuania and an elegant waltz at the brandenburg gate in berlin - that 's how the european union 's largest enlargement to date was ushered in on may 1 this year . but a 100 days later not much of the optimistic mood remains in zittau , an eastern german town located on the border triangle of poland , the czech republic and germany .
eu euphoria here seems as far away as brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , second right , poland 's then prime minister leszek miller , right , and eu commissioner guenter verheugen in zittau on may 1 " a mere blurb , a showy spectacle , " is how ralf richter , ceo of a company specializing in rust protection in zittau , described the enlargement celebrations , which saw german chancellor gerhard schröder flying in to shake hands with the leaders of poland and the czech republic and breaking ground for a new street in zittau . but now the chancellor and the media circus are gone and " we are n't any better off with the street , " richter said . for the past 10 years , richter has been struggling with his firm in the region which suffers from an acute lack of infrastructure .
now he wants to find quicker routes to new customers behind the border . " change only through hard work " but not everybody shares richter 's pessimism . just behind the border lies zittau 's partner city in the czech republic , hradek . hedvika zimmermanova , hradek 's deputy mayor , said she has no illusions about eu membership .
" we were n't so naive as to believe that the eu would immediately make everything better , " zimmermann said .
" that can only happen through hard work . " zimmermann remembers the hectic days following eu enlargement . " but ever since then - and we knew that before - everything 's the same , " she said . even the czechs are hoping that the new streets promised by their leaders as the country was accepted into the eu , will soon be built . zimmernova , who has to deal daily with authorities from all three countries in the border triangle , however is glad about one aspect . " i no longer need three-quarters of an hour over the border , rather just ten minutes , " she said . imperceptible maybe , but change nonetheless german and polish border guards work side by side in this region , silently but harmoniously checking the passports held out through the windows by car drivers .
a second check point tower is now no longer occupied . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau 's main square " the personal hand-checked controls are very successful , " said arnd voigt , the mayor of zittau .
he added that the opening up of the borders has brought several improvements , many of which are n't immediately evident to the people . a wait and watch attitude is clearly visible in the eastern german border towns since the eu 's eastern enlargement . but the horror images painted by some politicians and economic experts of eastern germany - sandwiched between the richer western germany and the new eu states - being overrun by cheap labor have n't translated into reality . " it 's there for all to see that the fears were slightly exaggerated in the run up to enlargement , " said barbara lippert from the institute for european politics in berlin .
she added that with limitations placed on eastern european workers and markets gaining access to germany , the country 's economy is picking up . cashing in on enlargement lippert also pointed out there 's a reason why the eu 's eastern expansion is n't much of an issue among the people . " the expansion has been the result of years of preparation .
much has already happened on the economic front .
may 1 was simply an act of political integration , " she said , adding that there is n't much interest in the new eu members among the older eu states either . " the people there have no real relation to eastern europe , " according to lippert .
" that , in addition to a rise in prices , is a real disadvantage for the new eu members . " but for some in " old europe " , eastern enlargement has presented unforeseen opportunities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau 's surroundings the german authorities in zittau are using the time to cash in on their new-found fame in the border triangle while the neighbors play catch-up . " we 've never had so many tourists as at present , " said voigt , adding that former residents of zittau are coming from as far away as canada to visit . margret steffen -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what will change with eu expansion ?
though the 10 new eu states will become full members of the bloc and fully adopt community law , some exceptions will be applied - at least for interim periods .
here 's a list of the most important changes .
-lrb- april 30 , 2004 -rrb- germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

rallies in leipzig , halle , magdeburg , rostock and suhl will add pressure on schröder to reverse his reforms in the face of record low opinion poll scores for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the reforms will particularly hurt regions of former east germany where unemployment is as high as 17 to 20 percent .
eastern germany has been plagued by high unemployment since national reunification in 1990 as unprofitable former state-run enterprises were closed down .
in july , the jobless rate was at 18.5 percent , more than double the figure in the wealthier western states .
the reforms , part of schröder 's controversial agenda 2010 package , would see benefits for the long-time unemployed slashed to the rate of subsistence-level welfare payments .
the two germanies reunited in 1990 after communism collapsed in east germany with the disintegration of the east bloc in the wake of reforms in the soviet union .
monday demos an east german tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germans in leipzig also held " monday demos " to express their dissent of the iraq war german protest organizers have called for regular " monday demonstrations , " recalling weekly demonstrations 15 years ago in east germany against the dying communist regime .
marches in autumn 1989 drew hundreds of thousands in leipzig , the epicenter of the pro-democracy movement under the communists , and helped set events in motion that led the berlin wall to fall that november .
christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig rallies , said he would join the new protests and dismissed claims that the demonstrators were putting schröder 's government on a par with the communists ' repressive regime .
" you ca n't say , ' we 're happy that you marched against the communists , but you should shut up now ' , " führer told the berlin radio station inforadio .
" that 's totally unacceptable . "
" the monday demonstrations is a brand name , " added winfried helbig from the leipzig social forum .
" the people also went out into the streets in 1989 because they could see no future for themselves . "
" we want to remember 1989 , when the people said : that 's enough , " said attac , an anti-globalization group .
germany 's federal labor agency said some one million people in the eastern states and 1.2 million in the more populous west would be affected by the reforms which also require those on the dole to dip deep into family savings and life insurance policies to support themselves .
schröder , faced with yawning public deficits and stagnant economic growth , has moved to cut government outlays for pensions , health care and other social welfare benefits .
but his plans have sparked waves of protest against the center-left government , with the spd currently trailing the conservative opposition christian union parties by more than 20 percentage points .
the government 's deputy spokesman , hans langguth , denounced monday 's demonstrations as " a higher level of hysteria . "
he accused the media of disinformation by emphasizing the sacrifices instead of the benefits of the reforms .
langguth called on demonstrators to make a clear difference in their minds between what was happening in east germany in 1989 and what was now in play .
economics minister wolfgang clement , the man behind the controversial reforms said the comparison with 1989 was " an insult to the civic courage shown by many east germans . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.08.2004 enlarged eu sparks change along borders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euphoria that marked eu enlargement has n't all evaporated over 100 days have passed since the eu expanded to take in ten new members , who entered the bloc with a mixture of hope and euphoria on may 1 .
change is perceptible along the new eu borders . fireworks in malta , loud church bells in hungary , a sea of lights in lithuania and an elegant waltz at the brandenburg gate in berlin - that 's how the european union 's largest enlargement to date was ushered in on may 1 this year . but a 100 days later not much of the optimistic mood remains in zittau , an eastern german town located on the border triangle of poland , the czech republic and germany .
eu euphoria here seems as far away as brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , second right , poland 's then prime minister leszek miller , right , and eu commissioner guenter verheugen in zittau on may 1 " a mere blurb , a showy spectacle , " is how ralf richter , ceo of a company specializing in rust protection in zittau , described the enlargement celebrations , which saw german chancellor gerhard schröder flying in to shake hands with the leaders of poland and the czech republic and breaking ground for a new street in zittau . but now the chancellor and the media circus are gone and " we are n't any better off with the street , " richter said . for the past 10 years , richter has been struggling with his firm in the region which suffers from an acute lack of infrastructure .
now he wants to find quicker routes to new customers behind the border . " change only through hard work " but not everybody shares richter 's pessimism . just behind the border lies zittau 's partner city in the czech republic , hradek . hedvika zimmermanova , hradek 's deputy mayor , said she has no illusions about eu membership .
" we were n't so naive as to believe that the eu would immediately make everything better , " zimmermann said .
" that can only happen through hard work . " zimmermann remembers the hectic days following eu enlargement . " but ever since then - and we knew that before - everything 's the same , " she said . even the czechs are hoping that the new streets promised by their leaders as the country was accepted into the eu , will soon be built . zimmernova , who has to deal daily with authorities from all three countries in the border triangle , however is glad about one aspect . " i no longer need three-quarters of an hour over the border , rather just ten minutes , " she said . imperceptible maybe , but change nonetheless german and polish border guards work side by side in this region , silently but harmoniously checking the passports held out through the windows by car drivers .
a second check point tower is now no longer occupied . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau 's main square " the personal hand-checked controls are very successful , " said arnd voigt , the mayor of zittau .
he added that the opening up of the borders has brought several improvements , many of which are n't immediately evident to the people . a wait and watch attitude is clearly visible in the eastern german border towns since the eu 's eastern enlargement . but the horror images painted by some politicians and economic experts of eastern germany - sandwiched between the richer western germany and the new eu states - being overrun by cheap labor have n't translated into reality . " it 's there for all to see that the fears were slightly exaggerated in the run up to enlargement , " said barbara lippert from the institute for european politics in berlin .
she added that with limitations placed on eastern european workers and markets gaining access to germany , the country 's economy is picking up . cashing in on enlargement lippert also pointed out there 's a reason why the eu 's eastern expansion is n't much of an issue among the people . " the expansion has been the result of years of preparation .
much has already happened on the economic front .
may 1 was simply an act of political integration , " she said , adding that there is n't much interest in the new eu members among the older eu states either . " the people there have no real relation to eastern europe , " according to lippert .
" that , in addition to a rise in prices , is a real disadvantage for the new eu members . " but for some in " old europe " , eastern enlargement has presented unforeseen opportunities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau 's surroundings the german authorities in zittau are using the time to cash in on their new-found fame in the border triangle while the neighbors play catch-up . " we 've never had so many tourists as at present , " said voigt , adding that former residents of zittau are coming from as far away as canada to visit . margret steffen -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what will change with eu expansion ?
though the 10 new eu states will become full members of the bloc and fully adopt community law , some exceptions will be applied - at least for interim periods .
here 's a list of the most important changes .

but the demonstrations organized by german leftists and trade unions are highly controversial and have drawn strong reactions not only from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . organizers of the rallies in eastern german cities hope they can halt schröder ’ s sweeping cuts in benefits for the long-time jobless here , by drawing inspiration from the peaceful monday demonstrations that brought down communism in the region in 1989 . but leading social democrats , such as labor minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , have slammed the analogy as a shameless abuse of a shining moment in german history .
clement told a newspaper on monday that the comparison was a provocation and an insult to the civil courage that many east germans showed at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement , german minister for economy and labor vera lengsfeld , a former east german civil rights activists and a parliamentary deputy for the conservative christian democratic party , also said the comparison was untenable . " the demonstrations in 1989 were directed against a repressive regime that prevented freedom , " she said .
" but those taking to the streets today are protesting against necessary reforms that ultimately aim to maintain the welfare system in face of the current crisis .
with all due respect to those criticizing chancellor schröder , his government can not be compared with that of communist leader erich honecker . " the anti-communist monday demonstrations in autumn 1989 began with prayers for peace and candlelight marches in the city of leipzig , and towards the end drew more than 100,000 protesters .
last monday a few thousand people joined a rally in magdeburg against the reforms , but turnout is expected to rise this monday .
mouths shut ? the demonstrations ' organizers insist , however , that their actions are justified .
" i do n't understand all the excitement on the part of the political elites , " said christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig protests in 1989 .
it was unacceptable to suggest that " we accept that you took to the streets to oppose the communists , but now you should keep your mouths shut , " führer said .
but führer also criticized that some groups or parties were trying to use the demonstrations for their own purposes . saxon 's christian democratic premier , georg milbradt , said monday he would not rule out his party participating in the protests , " if we are invited . "
hard-hitting reforms the new reform law - set to take effect next year - will bring long-term unemployment benefits down to the amount of subsistence-level welfare payments .
eastern germans are hit hardest by the reforms because long-term joblessness is especially rife here . but the rallies in eastern germany are part of more widespread public outrage over schröder ‘ s agenda 2010 welfare reforms .
internal dissent within the spd over the chancellor ’ s course has also increased .
just last week an anonymous e-mail chain letter called for the chancellor to be toppled .
and on sunday , former spd finance minister oskar lafontaine threatened to help form a breakaway left-wing party if schröder persists with his reforms .
subsequently , social democratic party leader franz müntefering warned all spd rebels against playing with fire : " i accept that people are now taking to the streets , but i don ’ t think they are right , " he said .
" i think their fears are baseless because we actually want to preserve social welfare and not destroy it ...
and all those stoking public fears and resentment must know that they are going to be held responsible for their actions . " lafontaine ’ s comments mark a bid to establish himself as a champion of the spd 's disenchanted left wing , but they have drawn a withering response from spd leaders .
the threats of a breakaway party and the in-fighting about the reforms have already caused the social democrats ' popular support to plunge to a historic low .
sizable demonstrations on mondays are sure to dent the spd 's chances for comeback at the polls even further . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd angered by anti-schröder letter while it 's no secret that some social democrats disagree with chancellor gerhard schröder 's policies , a chain letter of insurgency that surfaced thursday hit too far below the belt for many from the spd .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement , german minister for economy and labor vera lengsfeld , a former east german civil rights activists and a parliamentary deputy for the conservative christian democratic party , also said the comparison was untenable .

" but those taking to the streets today are protesting against necessary reforms that ultimately aim to maintain the welfare system in face of the current crisis .
with all due respect to those criticizing chancellor schröder , his government can not be compared with that of communist leader erich honecker . " the anti-communist monday demonstrations in autumn 1989 began with prayers for peace and candlelight marches in the city of leipzig , and towards the end drew more than 100,000 protesters .
last monday a few thousand people joined a rally in magdeburg against the reforms , but turnout is expected to rise this monday .
mouths shut ? the demonstrations ' organizers insist , however , that their actions are justified .
" i do n't understand all the excitement on the part of the political elites , " said christian führer , a pastor who helped organize the leipzig protests in 1989 .
it was unacceptable to suggest that " we accept that you took to the streets to oppose the communists , but now you should keep your mouths shut , " führer said .
but führer also criticized that some groups or parties were trying to use the demonstrations for their own purposes . saxon 's christian democratic premier , georg milbradt , said monday he would not rule out his party participating in the protests , " if we are invited . "
hard-hitting reforms the new reform law - set to take effect next year - will bring long-term unemployment benefits down to the amount of subsistence-level welfare payments .
eastern germans are hit hardest by the reforms because long-term joblessness is especially rife here . but the rallies in eastern germany are part of more widespread public outrage over schröder ‘ s agenda 2010 welfare reforms .
internal dissent within the spd over the chancellor ’ s course has also increased .
just last week an anonymous e-mail chain letter called for the chancellor to be toppled .
and on sunday , former spd finance minister oskar lafontaine threatened to help form a breakaway left-wing party if schröder persists with his reforms .
subsequently , social democratic party leader franz müntefering warned all spd rebels against playing with fire : " i accept that people are now taking to the streets , but i don ’ t think they are right , " he said .
" i think their fears are baseless because we actually want to preserve social welfare and not destroy it ...
and all those stoking public fears and resentment must know that they are going to be held responsible for their actions . " lafontaine ’ s comments mark a bid to establish himself as a champion of the spd 's disenchanted left wing , but they have drawn a withering response from spd leaders .
the threats of a breakaway party and the in-fighting about the reforms have already caused the social democrats ' popular support to plunge to a historic low .

the move follows a row over who should pay for the safety of bathers at croyde , woolacombe and saunton .
it ends a commitment by north devon district council to provide guards at privately-owned beaches .
christie estates , which owns saunton beach , believes the decision will seriously compromise people 's safety .
commercial organisations councillors have said they will consider supporting some owners who take on their own lifeguards .
the main beaches of croyde , woolacombe , saunton , putsbrough and instow are all privately-owned commercial organisations .
