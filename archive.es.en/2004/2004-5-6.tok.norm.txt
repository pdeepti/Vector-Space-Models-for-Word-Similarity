conscription could soon be scrapped in germany , as the ruling social democrats are reportedly realizing that switching to a professional army as in other nato countries might be a better option . the head of the policy and advisory staff of the german defense ministry , franz borkenhagen surprised members of the social democrat parliamentary fraction when he praised purely professional armies in other nato countries in a paper presented on wednesday . " the affected countries ruled that the intervention capabilities of the troops in foreign deployments had significantly improved , " german daily die welt quoted borkenhagen as saying .
" in general the troops welcomed the abolition of the draft and it even found a wide , positive resonance in society , " borkenhagen added . borkenhagen was addressing a special working group on security policies set up by the social democrats to examine ways to abolish the draft and the possible consequences of such a move . german defense minister peter struck is reportedly familiar with borkenhagen 's paper . pressure to scrap the draft borkenhagen 's findings are expected to add further fuel to a growing political debate in recent years on the future of mandatory military service , a feature of german life since the country was unified under bismarck in 1870 . the green party - the junior partner in the ruling coalition with the social democrats - have long pushed for the elimination of the nine-month conscription .
however , the social democrats led by defense minister struck have repeatedly rejected the calls , saying germany can not afford a professional army before 2010 . in recent months , pressure has increased on the government to abolish the draft .
in january this year an administrative court in cologne overturned the defense ministry 's eligibility rules for conscripts that exempt men who are married , are older than 23 or are found to be only partially fit for military service . the court said the rules violated the principle of fairness because fewer than half of the young men eligible for conscription are actually drafted .
though women have been allowed to serve by choice since 2001 , conscription is all-male with men between the ages of 18 to 45 eligible for nine-month duty . unable to meet modern challenges many also believe that the original aim of conscription - being a sort of citizens ' army to protect the homeland - now looks increasingly outdated in the face of modern military challenges such as global terrorism . germany - which remains one of the last major european countries with mandatory military service - has thus come under increasing pressure from its nato partners to scrap the system .
they consider it inefficient in dealing with crisis intervention and peacekeeping not least because the short duration of the conscription means that conscripts are generally not allowed to participate in combat missions overseas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan in addition , demands on the german army are currently greater than at any time since the second world war .
german troops are involved in more foreign operations than any other country apart from the u.s. , with peacekeeping troops stationed in afghanistan , the balkans and the horn of africa . armed forces undergoing revamp earlier this year , struck unveiled major plans to modernize and trim the armed forces and cut their budget - a move many believe may ultimately spell the end of conscription . struck 's reforms seek to reduce the number of soldiers -lrb- currently about 272,000 -rrb- by around 35,000 .
the new army will include a rapid-deployment force of 35,000 troops to be available for multinational missions , another 70,000 to trained for peacekeeping operations such as the one in afghanistan and the balkans .
he is also reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion . " despite his emphasis on maintaining the draft , he is pursuing a very pragmatic policy , which in reality is moving step by step away from the draft and toward a volunteer army , " winfried nachtwei , a defense expert for the green party said in an interview with news agency dpa earlier this year . abolition not without problems but the dismantling of the draft in germany is also expected to bring its fair share of problems .
young men who reject serving in the military for reasons of conscience are required to do compulsory community service for ten months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german social worker around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
the social democrats , who are set to take a final decision on the future of the draft at a party conference next year , are indicating they 're adopting a pragmatic approach .
" the working group on security policies is still of the view that conscription is the better decision for the armed forces and our society , " rainer arnold of defense spokesman of the social democratic parliamentary group told die welt .
" but it has to remain viable , " he added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany set to abolish the draft young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .

stability in the middle east and the fight against terrorism top the agenda at a meeting between eu foreign ministers and representatives from southern mediterranean states in dublin on thursday . just one day after a meeting of the middle east quartet in new york , the israeli and palestinian foreign ministers met face to face on wednesday as they joined a string of fellow ministers from europe and the middle east for high level talks in the irish capital .
israeli foreign minister silvan shalom and his palestinian counterpart nabil shaath were among three dozen ministers visiting the irish capital as part of a two-day euro-mediterranean gathering convened by the european union . the meeting in dublin castle will focus on prospects for bringing peace to the middle east and european relations to the 12 southern mediterranean states .
the event comes at a crucial time for israel and palestine , following on the heels of tuesday 's meeting of the quartet of middle east peace sponsors -lrb- united nations , united states , russia and the eu -rrb- and coming ahead of a summit of the arab league in tunisia later this month .
irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country as the current holder of the eu presidency is playing host to the euro-med conference , acknowledged the difficulties of bringing the two parties together , but said it was important for the peace process in the region .
" we need to use this forum , and there are very few where israeli and arab ministers can sit down and discuss issues , " he told reporters after an informal working dinner wednesday evening .
" we need to ensure that we get these parties together and try to get a ceasefire going .
we need a ceasefire in the middle east to give a chance to these parties to work together , " cowen said on behalf of the eu .
stability crucial for euro-med partnership since the mediterranean dialogue kicked off in barcelona in 1995 , bringing together the 15 countries that then made up the eu with algeria , cyprus , egypt , israel , jordan , lebanon , malta , morocco , the palestinian authority , syria , tunisia and turkey , the conflict in the middle east has been a constant topic of discussion .
diego de ojeda , the spokesman for eu 's external relations commissioner , chris patten , admitted the dispute between israel and the palestinians has been an undeniable " burden " for the forging of the euro-mediterranean partnership , often detracting from the other areas of cooperation .
the barcelona process of bringing europe and the mediterranean states closer together has succeeded primarily in areas not readily apparent in the political restructuring of the middle east , ojeda said .
chief among these are the many projects the eu finances to help build democratic institutions and promote economic development .
the eu has , for example , set up a training center for arab managers , funded youth exchanges , sponsored archeological excavations , renovations of villages and film projects - all at a cost of about a billion euros a year .
critics say that the barcelona process has been progressing too slowly , that it is no nearer to its goal of bringing democracy to north africa and the middle east .
but poul nielson , eu development commissioner , dismisses such criticism .
europe 's politics with regards to its neighbors is based on the principal of equality , he said .
" political and economic reforms can not simply be grafted onto the region .
successful cooperation flourishes only on the foundation of common interests among equal partners . "
common interests since the recent bomb attacks in madrid , istanbul and morocco , and even dating as far back as those in 2002 on the tunisian island of djerba , the threat of an increase in terrorism from extremist islamic circles has pushed the eu and the neighboring mediterranean states into a closer working relationship .
much has been made of the fact that after the train blasts in madrid in march , morocco immediately sent experts to the spanish capital to assist with the investigations .
things were quite different after the terror attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
eu ministers point to the improvement in cooperation as a signal that they are on the right track .
one way to fight extremism at its roots , they argue , is to reduce poverty .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has come out strong in favor of promoting economic ties to north africa to give the people , especially the 40 million youth , a perspective .
in order to do this , the eu has negotiated preferential trade agreements with all the euro-med countries .
whether the goal of establishing a free trade zone for the entire mediterranean region by 2010 will be achieved is still uncertain .
and as for inviting the 12 southern neighbors to join the eu , poul nielson has warned the mediterranean countries not to get their hopes up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.05.2004 third generation mobile phones arrive in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodafone deutschland head jürgen von kuczkowski shows off his company 's new do-it-all phone .
it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany . they take pictures , surf the web , send music and video clips - and they still fit in the palm of your hand and make telephone calls .
the long-awaited handsets for the new third generation of mobile phone systems are going on sale throughout germany starting this week .
but the mood on the market is a very different one from the euphoria when the big telecommunication companies first bought the rights to develop the new technology .
transmitting data at seven times the speed of the current mobile phone networks , the new universal mobile telecommunications system or umts promised to usher in a new age in mobile multimedia connectivity when it was launched back in 2000 .
at the time , people might have thought the 8.5 billion euros the participating telecommunications companies had to pay the government for access to the new networks was a bit steep .
but it was generally thought that the new mobile technology boom would go on for ever and the money was a good investment .
now that giant sum seems like a miscalculation .
deadlines for building up the network have come and gone , development of umts handsets were put on the back burner , and one provider - mobilcom - got out of the licensing altogether .
the deadline for offering the technology to the public was 2003 , but none of the german providers stuck to that date , and to make matters worse , the network does n't reach outside many urban areas yet .
the two big companies with a stake in the german market , british-based vodafone and the homegrown t-mobile , have only spent about a fifth of what the networks originally cost on developing technology for the new system .
for t-mobile , which is just beginning to bring out their own handsets , the investment in umts has ended up being an extensive endeavor .

it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany . they take pictures , surf the web , send music and video clips - and they still fit in the palm of your hand and make telephone calls .
the long-awaited handsets for the new third generation of mobile phone systems are going on sale throughout germany starting this week .
but the mood on the market is a very different one from the euphoria when the big telecommunication companies first bought the rights to develop the new technology .
transmitting data at seven times the speed of the current mobile phone networks , the new universal mobile telecommunications system or umts promised to usher in a new age in mobile multimedia connectivity when it was launched back in 2000 .
at the time , people might have thought the 8.5 billion euros the participating telecommunications companies had to pay the government for access to the new networks was a bit steep .
but it was generally thought that the new mobile technology boom would go on for ever and the money was a good investment .
now that giant sum seems like a miscalculation .
deadlines for building up the network have come and gone , development of umts handsets were put on the back burner , and one provider - mobilcom - got out of the licensing altogether .
the deadline for offering the technology to the public was 2003 , but none of the german providers stuck to that date , and to make matters worse , the network does n't reach outside many urban areas yet .
the two big companies with a stake in the german market , british-based vodafone and the homegrown t-mobile , have only spent about a fifth of what the networks originally cost on developing technology for the new system .
for t-mobile , which is just beginning to bring out their own handsets , the investment in umts has ended up being an extensive endeavor .
in the first years after purchasing the license , the german telecommunications giant reported its biggest-ever losses and pointed the finger directly at the new network technology .
slow market reception it 's unlikely that umts will turn into a gold mine any time soon , despite all the clever things the new technology promises .

stability in the middle east and the fight against terrorism top the agenda at a meeting between eu foreign ministers and representatives from southern mediterranean states in dublin on thursday . just one day after a meeting of the middle east quartet in new york , the israeli and palestinian foreign ministers met face to face on wednesday as they joined a string of fellow ministers from europe and the middle east for high level talks in the irish capital .
israeli foreign minister silvan shalom and his palestinian counterpart nabil shaath were among three dozen ministers visiting the irish capital as part of a two-day euro-mediterranean gathering convened by the european union . the meeting in dublin castle will focus on prospects for bringing peace to the middle east and european relations to the 12 southern mediterranean states .
the event comes at a crucial time for israel and palestine , following on the heels of tuesday 's meeting of the quartet of middle east peace sponsors -lrb- united nations , united states , russia and the eu -rrb- and coming ahead of a summit of the arab league in tunisia later this month .
irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country as the current holder of the eu presidency is playing host to the euro-med conference , acknowledged the difficulties of bringing the two parties together , but said it was important for the peace process in the region .
" we need to use this forum , and there are very few where israeli and arab ministers can sit down and discuss issues , " he told reporters after an informal working dinner wednesday evening .
" we need to ensure that we get these parties together and try to get a ceasefire going .
we need a ceasefire in the middle east to give a chance to these parties to work together , " cowen said on behalf of the eu .
stability crucial for euro-med partnership since the mediterranean dialogue kicked off in barcelona in 1995 , bringing together the 15 countries that then made up the eu with algeria , cyprus , egypt , israel , jordan , lebanon , malta , morocco , the palestinian authority , syria , tunisia and turkey , the conflict in the middle east has been a constant topic of discussion .
diego de ojeda , the spokesman for eu 's external relations commissioner , chris patten , admitted the dispute between israel and the palestinians has been an undeniable " burden " for the forging of the euro-mediterranean partnership , often detracting from the other areas of cooperation .
the barcelona process of bringing europe and the mediterranean states closer together has succeeded primarily in areas not readily apparent in the political restructuring of the middle east , ojeda said .
chief among these are the many projects the eu finances to help build democratic institutions and promote economic development .
the eu has , for example , set up a training center for arab managers , funded youth exchanges , sponsored archeological excavations , renovations of villages and film projects - all at a cost of about a billion euros a year .
critics say that the barcelona process has been progressing too slowly , that it is no nearer to its goal of bringing democracy to north africa and the middle east .
but poul nielson , eu development commissioner , dismisses such criticism .
europe 's politics with regards to its neighbors is based on the principal of equality , he said .
" political and economic reforms can not simply be grafted onto the region .
successful cooperation flourishes only on the foundation of common interests among equal partners . "
common interests since the recent bomb attacks in madrid , istanbul and morocco , and even dating as far back as those in 2002 on the tunisian island of djerba , the threat of an increase in terrorism from extremist islamic circles has pushed the eu and the neighboring mediterranean states into a closer working relationship .
much has been made of the fact that after the train blasts in madrid in march , morocco immediately sent experts to the spanish capital to assist with the investigations .
things were quite different after the terror attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
eu ministers point to the improvement in cooperation as a signal that they are on the right track .
one way to fight extremism at its roots , they argue , is to reduce poverty .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has come out strong in favor of promoting economic ties to north africa to give the people , especially the 40 million youth , a perspective .
in order to do this , the eu has negotiated preferential trade agreements with all the euro-med countries .
whether the goal of establishing a free trade zone for the entire mediterranean region by 2010 will be achieved is still uncertain .
and as for inviting the 12 southern neighbors to join the eu , poul nielson has warned the mediterranean countries not to get their hopes up .
" we 're not closing the door , but we 're also not talking about further enlargement , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels libya is the only north african state not in the euro-mediterranean partnership , but on a trip to brussles last week muammar gadhafi expressed interest in joining .

hollywood 's silly season of summer blockbusters kicks of this month with two movies tipped as mega-buck earners leading the way .
it sounds like business as usual until you discover that they 're both directed by germans . cinema audiences are preparing for the opening salvos in the annual battle of the summer blockbusters .
lavish posters boasting megastar actors and trailers promising epic set pieces have already got movie-goers salivating over the " money no object " offerings for this year 's release schedule . however , the first exchanges in the hollywood season will not come from american directors but from two germans who are ready to unleash films depicting global catastrophe and historical warfare onto effect junkies the world over . roland emmerich , no stranger to big budgets and special effects , unleashes the day after tomorrow on a world more than a little aware of the prophetic nature of the stuttgart-born director 's latest apocalyptical vision .
after bringing war-mongering aliens to earth in independence day and unleashing the radioactively-enhanced super lizard godzilla on film fans , the " swabian spielberg " has harnessed the fears of the kyoto generation to bring global warming to the silver screen for a cool € 118.5 million .
the german premiere is in berlin on may 21 . what emmerich attempted to do with aliens and monsters in the past , he now attempts with extreme weather with a film that has got the real-life powers-that-be sweating .
by ignoring the threat of climate change brought on by irresponsible attitudes to environmental damage , the u.s. government portrayed in the day after tomorrow literally reaps a whirlwind . first extreme heat , then tidal waves and snow storms sweep through manhattan and tornadoes destroy los angeles . emmerich calls for a change at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland emmerich .
not content with attaching an environmental message to his latest film , emmerich has even come out and criticized the current u.s. administration on its stance on global warming .
" president bush denies that there is global warming and that we cause this .
i don ’ t understand him , " the director said in a recent interview .
" i hope the americans make a more reasonable choice at the next election and elect democrat candidate john kerry . "
politicians on the left in the united states have spotted an opportunity and championed the film , which opens in the u.s. at the end of this month .
former presidential candidate al gore is already talking up the film , saying : “ millions of people will be coming out of movie theatres asking the question , ’ could this really happen ? ’ ”
meanwhile , voices on the other side of the political fence are offering their own opinions .
a bush spokesman has been quoted in reports as saying : “ people know what they ’ re watching is entertainment , and not grounded in basic scientific fact . ”
however , whether the same can be said about the other german-directed blockbuster is a matter for discussion .
wolfgang peterson 's troy is based on widely accepted historical fact but as with all things hollywood , there will be a certain amount of artistic license involved .
das boot director braves achilles ' heel peterson , born in emden in north germany , is probably best known for his claustrophobic world war ii classic das boot and his " man against the elements " sea spectacular the perfect storm .
this time , apart from the hugely impressive computer generated greek armada scenes in troy , the german director bases his latest epic on dry land - malta , to be precise . # b # the story follows events leading up to the legendary war circa 1200 b.c. which ignites when paris , prince of troy , steals away helen , the much younger wife of menelaus , the king of sparta .
the tribes of greece are then united to attack troy which leads to massive battle scenes , brad pitt in a skirt and , of course , that wooden horse . the film , boasting an impressive a-list cast and a budget of over € 150 million , is expected to be the biggest film of the year .
it premieres in peterson 's home country on may 9 with many of the stars expected to turn out for the showing in berlin . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to u.s. : cut emissions or face disaster in june , germany will host a global conference on renewable energies .

lavish posters boasting megastar actors and trailers promising epic set pieces have already got movie-goers salivating over the " money no object " offerings for this year 's release schedule . however , the first exchanges in the hollywood season will not come from american directors but from two germans who are ready to unleash films depicting global catastrophe and historical warfare onto effect junkies the world over . roland emmerich , no stranger to big budgets and special effects , unleashes the day after tomorrow on a world more than a little aware of the prophetic nature of the stuttgart-born director 's latest apocalyptical vision .
after bringing war-mongering aliens to earth in independence day and unleashing the radioactively-enhanced super lizard godzilla on film fans , the " swabian spielberg " has harnessed the fears of the kyoto generation to bring global warming to the silver screen for a cool € 118.5 million .

" i hope the americans make a more reasonable choice at the next election and elect democrat candidate john kerry . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.05.2004 will germany abolish the draft ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german men may soon be free of mandatory military service .
conscription could soon be scrapped in germany , as the ruling social democrats are reportedly realizing that switching to a professional army as in other nato countries might be a better option . the head of the policy and advisory staff of the german defense ministry , franz borkenhagen surprised members of the social democrat parliamentary fraction when he praised purely professional armies in other nato countries in a paper presented on wednesday . " the affected countries ruled that the intervention capabilities of the troops in foreign deployments had significantly improved , " german daily die welt quoted borkenhagen as saying .
" in general the troops welcomed the abolition of the draft and it even found a wide , positive resonance in society , " borkenhagen added . borkenhagen was addressing a special working group on security policies set up by the social democrats to examine ways to abolish the draft and the possible consequences of such a move . german defense minister peter struck is reportedly familiar with borkenhagen 's paper . pressure to scrap the draft borkenhagen 's findings are expected to add further fuel to a growing political debate in recent years on the future of mandatory military service , a feature of german life since the country was unified under bismarck in 1870 . the green party - the junior partner in the ruling coalition with the social democrats - have long pushed for the elimination of the nine-month conscription .
however , the social democrats led by defense minister struck have repeatedly rejected the calls , saying germany can not afford a professional army before 2010 . in recent months , pressure has increased on the government to abolish the draft .
in january this year an administrative court in cologne overturned the defense ministry 's eligibility rules for conscripts that exempt men who are married , are older than 23 or are found to be only partially fit for military service . the court said the rules violated the principle of fairness because fewer than half of the young men eligible for conscription are actually drafted .
though women have been allowed to serve by choice since 2001 , conscription is all-male with men between the ages of 18 to 45 eligible for nine-month duty . unable to meet modern challenges many also believe that the original aim of conscription - being a sort of citizens ' army to protect the homeland - now looks increasingly outdated in the face of modern military challenges such as global terrorism . germany - which remains one of the last major european countries with mandatory military service - has thus come under increasing pressure from its nato partners to scrap the system .
they consider it inefficient in dealing with crisis intervention and peacekeeping not least because the short duration of the conscription means that conscripts are generally not allowed to participate in combat missions overseas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan in addition , demands on the german army are currently greater than at any time since the second world war .
german troops are involved in more foreign operations than any other country apart from the u.s. , with peacekeeping troops stationed in afghanistan , the balkans and the horn of africa . armed forces undergoing revamp earlier this year , struck unveiled major plans to modernize and trim the armed forces and cut their budget - a move many believe may ultimately spell the end of conscription . struck 's reforms seek to reduce the number of soldiers -lrb- currently about 272,000 -rrb- by around 35,000 .
the new army will include a rapid-deployment force of 35,000 troops to be available for multinational missions , another 70,000 to trained for peacekeeping operations such as the one in afghanistan and the balkans .
he is also reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion . " despite his emphasis on maintaining the draft , he is pursuing a very pragmatic policy , which in reality is moving step by step away from the draft and toward a volunteer army , " winfried nachtwei , a defense expert for the green party said in an interview with news agency dpa earlier this year . abolition not without problems but the dismantling of the draft in germany is also expected to bring its fair share of problems .
young men who reject serving in the military for reasons of conscience are required to do compulsory community service for ten months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german social worker around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
the social democrats , who are set to take a final decision on the future of the draft at a party conference next year , are indicating they 're adopting a pragmatic approach .
" the working group on security policies is still of the view that conscription is the better decision for the armed forces and our society , " rainer arnold of defense spokesman of the social democratic parliamentary group told die welt .
" but it has to remain viable , " he added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany set to abolish the draft young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .

a bush spokesman has been quoted in reports as saying : “ people know what they ’ re watching is entertainment , and not grounded in basic scientific fact . ”
however , whether the same can be said about the other german-directed blockbuster is a matter for discussion .
wolfgang peterson 's troy is based on widely accepted historical fact but as with all things hollywood , there will be a certain amount of artistic license involved .
das boot director braves achilles ' heel peterson , born in emden in north germany , is probably best known for his claustrophobic world war ii classic das boot and his " man against the elements " sea spectacular the perfect storm .
this time , apart from the hugely impressive computer generated greek armada scenes in troy , the german director bases his latest epic on dry land - malta , to be precise . # b # the story follows events leading up to the legendary war circa 1200 b.c. which ignites when paris , prince of troy , steals away helen , the much younger wife of menelaus , the king of sparta .
the tribes of greece are then united to attack troy which leads to massive battle scenes , brad pitt in a skirt and , of course , that wooden horse . the film , boasting an impressive a-list cast and a budget of over € 150 million , is expected to be the biggest film of the year .

it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany . they take pictures , surf the web , send music and video clips - and they still fit in the palm of your hand and make telephone calls .
the long-awaited handsets for the new third generation of mobile phone systems are going on sale throughout germany starting this week .
but the mood on the market is a very different one from the euphoria when the big telecommunication companies first bought the rights to develop the new technology .
transmitting data at seven times the speed of the current mobile phone networks , the new universal mobile telecommunications system or umts promised to usher in a new age in mobile multimedia connectivity when it was launched back in 2000 .
at the time , people might have thought the 8.5 billion euros the participating telecommunications companies had to pay the government for access to the new networks was a bit steep .
but it was generally thought that the new mobile technology boom would go on for ever and the money was a good investment .
now that giant sum seems like a miscalculation .
deadlines for building up the network have come and gone , development of umts handsets were put on the back burner , and one provider - mobilcom - got out of the licensing altogether .
the deadline for offering the technology to the public was 2003 , but none of the german providers stuck to that date , and to make matters worse , the network does n't reach outside many urban areas yet .
the two big companies with a stake in the german market , british-based vodafone and the homegrown t-mobile , have only spent about a fifth of what the networks originally cost on developing technology for the new system .
for t-mobile , which is just beginning to bring out their own handsets , the investment in umts has ended up being an extensive endeavor .
in the first years after purchasing the license , the german telecommunications giant reported its biggest-ever losses and pointed the finger directly at the new network technology .
slow market reception it 's unlikely that umts will turn into a gold mine any time soon , despite all the clever things the new technology promises .
as with every new technology , there will only be a few early adaptors , who are prepared to pay the high price - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many will go after the new phones ? about 300 euros - and hefty connection charges for the thrill of possessing the latest gadget .
it will still take a while before the third-generation phones make their way into the pockets of mainstream german consumers , say many observers .
vodafone , the market leader , came out with the samsung z105 mobile video phone and t-mobile , deutsche telekom 's mobile offshoot and the perennial runner-up in the market , decided to follow up with the futuristic nokia 7600 music clip mobile .
back in february , vodafone had already beaten t-mobile in the race by introducing a card for a laptop computer which would allow people to transmit data at umts speeds of up to 384 kilobits per second .
but it was n't until recently that consumers could even purchase mobile phones for the super-speed network .
both companies had blamed the slow process on the manufacturers of the handsets , but by the time cebit rolled into hanover with the world 's largest trade fair for information technology in march , several companies were already displaying the next generation in mobile phones .
other umts license holders , such as the netherlands-based e-plus , have decided to hold off on launching their handsets until the big names have paved the rocky road to acceptance .
in the long term , experts say umts will help ease the shortage of mobile phone capacity on the existing networks , and thus help drive down the still relatively high prices of even conventional mobile phones .
but that will only happen when the umts providers have mopped up as much initial premium-price usage as the companies can squeeze out of it . michael lawton -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .

hollywood 's silly season of summer blockbusters kicks of this month with two movies tipped as mega-buck earners leading the way .
it sounds like business as usual until you discover that they 're both directed by germans . cinema audiences are preparing for the opening salvos in the annual battle of the summer blockbusters .
lavish posters boasting megastar actors and trailers promising epic set pieces have already got movie-goers salivating over the " money no object " offerings for this year 's release schedule . however , the first exchanges in the hollywood season will not come from american directors but from two germans who are ready to unleash films depicting global catastrophe and historical warfare onto effect junkies the world over . roland emmerich , no stranger to big budgets and special effects , unleashes the day after tomorrow on a world more than a little aware of the prophetic nature of the stuttgart-born director 's latest apocalyptical vision .
after bringing war-mongering aliens to earth in independence day and unleashing the radioactively-enhanced super lizard godzilla on film fans , the " swabian spielberg " has harnessed the fears of the kyoto generation to bring global warming to the silver screen for a cool € 118.5 million .
the german premiere is in berlin on may 21 . what emmerich attempted to do with aliens and monsters in the past , he now attempts with extreme weather with a film that has got the real-life powers-that-be sweating .
by ignoring the threat of climate change brought on by irresponsible attitudes to environmental damage , the u.s. government portrayed in the day after tomorrow literally reaps a whirlwind . first extreme heat , then tidal waves and snow storms sweep through manhattan and tornadoes destroy los angeles . emmerich calls for a change at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland emmerich .
not content with attaching an environmental message to his latest film , emmerich has even come out and criticized the current u.s. administration on its stance on global warming .
" president bush denies that there is global warming and that we cause this .
i don ’ t understand him , " the director said in a recent interview .
" i hope the americans make a more reasonable choice at the next election and elect democrat candidate john kerry . "
politicians on the left in the united states have spotted an opportunity and championed the film , which opens in the u.s. at the end of this month .
former presidential candidate al gore is already talking up the film , saying : “ millions of people will be coming out of movie theatres asking the question , ’ could this really happen ? ’ ”
meanwhile , voices on the other side of the political fence are offering their own opinions .
a bush spokesman has been quoted in reports as saying : “ people know what they ’ re watching is entertainment , and not grounded in basic scientific fact . ”
however , whether the same can be said about the other german-directed blockbuster is a matter for discussion .
wolfgang peterson 's troy is based on widely accepted historical fact but as with all things hollywood , there will be a certain amount of artistic license involved .
das boot director braves achilles ' heel peterson , born in emden in north germany , is probably best known for his claustrophobic world war ii classic das boot and his " man against the elements " sea spectacular the perfect storm .

stability in the middle east and the fight against terrorism top the agenda at a meeting between eu foreign ministers and representatives from southern mediterranean states in dublin on thursday . just one day after a meeting of the middle east quartet in new york , the israeli and palestinian foreign ministers met face to face on wednesday as they joined a string of fellow ministers from europe and the middle east for high level talks in the irish capital .
israeli foreign minister silvan shalom and his palestinian counterpart nabil shaath were among three dozen ministers visiting the irish capital as part of a two-day euro-mediterranean gathering convened by the european union . the meeting in dublin castle will focus on prospects for bringing peace to the middle east and european relations to the 12 southern mediterranean states .
the event comes at a crucial time for israel and palestine , following on the heels of tuesday 's meeting of the quartet of middle east peace sponsors -lrb- united nations , united states , russia and the eu -rrb- and coming ahead of a summit of the arab league in tunisia later this month .
irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country as the current holder of the eu presidency is playing host to the euro-med conference , acknowledged the difficulties of bringing the two parties together , but said it was important for the peace process in the region .
" we need to use this forum , and there are very few where israeli and arab ministers can sit down and discuss issues , " he told reporters after an informal working dinner wednesday evening .
" we need to ensure that we get these parties together and try to get a ceasefire going .
we need a ceasefire in the middle east to give a chance to these parties to work together , " cowen said on behalf of the eu .
stability crucial for euro-med partnership since the mediterranean dialogue kicked off in barcelona in 1995 , bringing together the 15 countries that then made up the eu with algeria , cyprus , egypt , israel , jordan , lebanon , malta , morocco , the palestinian authority , syria , tunisia and turkey , the conflict in the middle east has been a constant topic of discussion .
diego de ojeda , the spokesman for eu 's external relations commissioner , chris patten , admitted the dispute between israel and the palestinians has been an undeniable " burden " for the forging of the euro-mediterranean partnership , often detracting from the other areas of cooperation .
the barcelona process of bringing europe and the mediterranean states closer together has succeeded primarily in areas not readily apparent in the political restructuring of the middle east , ojeda said .
chief among these are the many projects the eu finances to help build democratic institutions and promote economic development .
the eu has , for example , set up a training center for arab managers , funded youth exchanges , sponsored archeological excavations , renovations of villages and film projects - all at a cost of about a billion euros a year .
critics say that the barcelona process has been progressing too slowly , that it is no nearer to its goal of bringing democracy to north africa and the middle east .
but poul nielson , eu development commissioner , dismisses such criticism .
europe 's politics with regards to its neighbors is based on the principal of equality , he said .
" political and economic reforms can not simply be grafted onto the region .
successful cooperation flourishes only on the foundation of common interests among equal partners . "
common interests since the recent bomb attacks in madrid , istanbul and morocco , and even dating as far back as those in 2002 on the tunisian island of djerba , the threat of an increase in terrorism from extremist islamic circles has pushed the eu and the neighboring mediterranean states into a closer working relationship .
much has been made of the fact that after the train blasts in madrid in march , morocco immediately sent experts to the spanish capital to assist with the investigations .
things were quite different after the terror attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
eu ministers point to the improvement in cooperation as a signal that they are on the right track .
one way to fight extremism at its roots , they argue , is to reduce poverty .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has come out strong in favor of promoting economic ties to north africa to give the people , especially the 40 million youth , a perspective .
in order to do this , the eu has negotiated preferential trade agreements with all the euro-med countries .
whether the goal of establishing a free trade zone for the entire mediterranean region by 2010 will be achieved is still uncertain .
and as for inviting the 12 southern neighbors to join the eu , poul nielson has warned the mediterranean countries not to get their hopes up .
" we 're not closing the door , but we 're also not talking about further enlargement , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels libya is the only north african state not in the euro-mediterranean partnership , but on a trip to brussles last week muammar gadhafi expressed interest in joining .

stability in the middle east and the fight against terrorism top the agenda at a meeting between eu foreign ministers and representatives from southern mediterranean states in dublin on thursday . just one day after a meeting of the middle east quartet in new york , the israeli and palestinian foreign ministers met face to face on wednesday as they joined a string of fellow ministers from europe and the middle east for high level talks in the irish capital .
israeli foreign minister silvan shalom and his palestinian counterpart nabil shaath were among three dozen ministers visiting the irish capital as part of a two-day euro-mediterranean gathering convened by the european union . the meeting in dublin castle will focus on prospects for bringing peace to the middle east and european relations to the 12 southern mediterranean states .
the event comes at a crucial time for israel and palestine , following on the heels of tuesday 's meeting of the quartet of middle east peace sponsors -lrb- united nations , united states , russia and the eu -rrb- and coming ahead of a summit of the arab league in tunisia later this month .
irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country as the current holder of the eu presidency is playing host to the euro-med conference , acknowledged the difficulties of bringing the two parties together , but said it was important for the peace process in the region .
" we need to use this forum , and there are very few where israeli and arab ministers can sit down and discuss issues , " he told reporters after an informal working dinner wednesday evening .
" we need to ensure that we get these parties together and try to get a ceasefire going .
we need a ceasefire in the middle east to give a chance to these parties to work together , " cowen said on behalf of the eu .
stability crucial for euro-med partnership since the mediterranean dialogue kicked off in barcelona in 1995 , bringing together the 15 countries that then made up the eu with algeria , cyprus , egypt , israel , jordan , lebanon , malta , morocco , the palestinian authority , syria , tunisia and turkey , the conflict in the middle east has been a constant topic of discussion .
diego de ojeda , the spokesman for eu 's external relations commissioner , chris patten , admitted the dispute between israel and the palestinians has been an undeniable " burden " for the forging of the euro-mediterranean partnership , often detracting from the other areas of cooperation .
the barcelona process of bringing europe and the mediterranean states closer together has succeeded primarily in areas not readily apparent in the political restructuring of the middle east , ojeda said .
chief among these are the many projects the eu finances to help build democratic institutions and promote economic development .
the eu has , for example , set up a training center for arab managers , funded youth exchanges , sponsored archeological excavations , renovations of villages and film projects - all at a cost of about a billion euros a year .
critics say that the barcelona process has been progressing too slowly , that it is no nearer to its goal of bringing democracy to north africa and the middle east .
but poul nielson , eu development commissioner , dismisses such criticism .
europe 's politics with regards to its neighbors is based on the principal of equality , he said .
" political and economic reforms can not simply be grafted onto the region .
successful cooperation flourishes only on the foundation of common interests among equal partners . "
common interests since the recent bomb attacks in madrid , istanbul and morocco , and even dating as far back as those in 2002 on the tunisian island of djerba , the threat of an increase in terrorism from extremist islamic circles has pushed the eu and the neighboring mediterranean states into a closer working relationship .
much has been made of the fact that after the train blasts in madrid in march , morocco immediately sent experts to the spanish capital to assist with the investigations .
things were quite different after the terror attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
eu ministers point to the improvement in cooperation as a signal that they are on the right track .
one way to fight extremism at its roots , they argue , is to reduce poverty .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has come out strong in favor of promoting economic ties to north africa to give the people , especially the 40 million youth , a perspective .
in order to do this , the eu has negotiated preferential trade agreements with all the euro-med countries .
whether the goal of establishing a free trade zone for the entire mediterranean region by 2010 will be achieved is still uncertain .
and as for inviting the 12 southern neighbors to join the eu , poul nielson has warned the mediterranean countries not to get their hopes up .
" we 're not closing the door , but we 're also not talking about further enlargement , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels libya is the only north african state not in the euro-mediterranean partnership , but on a trip to brussles last week muammar gadhafi expressed interest in joining .
europe pledges economic cooperation for north africa at a meeting of 10 mediterranean countries , europe agreed to boost ties between the wealthier northern states and the poorer south and to help in the fight on terror and stemming the flow of illegal immigration .

hollywood 's silly season of summer blockbusters kicks of this month with two movies tipped as mega-buck earners leading the way .
it sounds like business as usual until you discover that they 're both directed by germans . cinema audiences are preparing for the opening salvos in the annual battle of the summer blockbusters .
lavish posters boasting megastar actors and trailers promising epic set pieces have already got movie-goers salivating over the " money no object " offerings for this year 's release schedule . however , the first exchanges in the hollywood season will not come from american directors but from two germans who are ready to unleash films depicting global catastrophe and historical warfare onto effect junkies the world over . roland emmerich , no stranger to big budgets and special effects , unleashes the day after tomorrow on a world more than a little aware of the prophetic nature of the stuttgart-born director 's latest apocalyptical vision .
after bringing war-mongering aliens to earth in independence day and unleashing the radioactively-enhanced super lizard godzilla on film fans , the " swabian spielberg " has harnessed the fears of the kyoto generation to bring global warming to the silver screen for a cool € 118.5 million .
the german premiere is in berlin on may 21 . what emmerich attempted to do with aliens and monsters in the past , he now attempts with extreme weather with a film that has got the real-life powers-that-be sweating .
by ignoring the threat of climate change brought on by irresponsible attitudes to environmental damage , the u.s. government portrayed in the day after tomorrow literally reaps a whirlwind . first extreme heat , then tidal waves and snow storms sweep through manhattan and tornadoes destroy los angeles . emmerich calls for a change at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland emmerich .
not content with attaching an environmental message to his latest film , emmerich has even come out and criticized the current u.s. administration on its stance on global warming .
" president bush denies that there is global warming and that we cause this .
i don ’ t understand him , " the director said in a recent interview .
" i hope the americans make a more reasonable choice at the next election and elect democrat candidate john kerry . "
politicians on the left in the united states have spotted an opportunity and championed the film , which opens in the u.s. at the end of this month .
former presidential candidate al gore is already talking up the film , saying : “ millions of people will be coming out of movie theatres asking the question , ’ could this really happen ? ’ ”
meanwhile , voices on the other side of the political fence are offering their own opinions .
a bush spokesman has been quoted in reports as saying : “ people know what they ’ re watching is entertainment , and not grounded in basic scientific fact . ”
however , whether the same can be said about the other german-directed blockbuster is a matter for discussion .
wolfgang peterson 's troy is based on widely accepted historical fact but as with all things hollywood , there will be a certain amount of artistic license involved .
das boot director braves achilles ' heel peterson , born in emden in north germany , is probably best known for his claustrophobic world war ii classic das boot and his " man against the elements " sea spectacular the perfect storm .
this time , apart from the hugely impressive computer generated greek armada scenes in troy , the german director bases his latest epic on dry land - malta , to be precise . # b # the story follows events leading up to the legendary war circa 1200 b.c. which ignites when paris , prince of troy , steals away helen , the much younger wife of menelaus , the king of sparta .
the tribes of greece are then united to attack troy which leads to massive battle scenes , brad pitt in a skirt and , of course , that wooden horse . the film , boasting an impressive a-list cast and a budget of over € 150 million , is expected to be the biggest film of the year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.05.2004 third generation mobile phones arrive in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodafone deutschland head jürgen von kuczkowski shows off his company 's new do-it-all phone .
it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany . they take pictures , surf the web , send music and video clips - and they still fit in the palm of your hand and make telephone calls .
the long-awaited handsets for the new third generation of mobile phone systems are going on sale throughout germany starting this week .
but the mood on the market is a very different one from the euphoria when the big telecommunication companies first bought the rights to develop the new technology .
transmitting data at seven times the speed of the current mobile phone networks , the new universal mobile telecommunications system or umts promised to usher in a new age in mobile multimedia connectivity when it was launched back in 2000 .
at the time , people might have thought the 8.5 billion euros the participating telecommunications companies had to pay the government for access to the new networks was a bit steep .
but it was generally thought that the new mobile technology boom would go on for ever and the money was a good investment .
now that giant sum seems like a miscalculation .
deadlines for building up the network have come and gone , development of umts handsets were put on the back burner , and one provider - mobilcom - got out of the licensing altogether .
the deadline for offering the technology to the public was 2003 , but none of the german providers stuck to that date , and to make matters worse , the network does n't reach outside many urban areas yet .
the two big companies with a stake in the german market , british-based vodafone and the homegrown t-mobile , have only spent about a fifth of what the networks originally cost on developing technology for the new system .
for t-mobile , which is just beginning to bring out their own handsets , the investment in umts has ended up being an extensive endeavor .
in the first years after purchasing the license , the german telecommunications giant reported its biggest-ever losses and pointed the finger directly at the new network technology .
slow market reception it 's unlikely that umts will turn into a gold mine any time soon , despite all the clever things the new technology promises .
as with every new technology , there will only be a few early adaptors , who are prepared to pay the high price - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many will go after the new phones ? about 300 euros - and hefty connection charges for the thrill of possessing the latest gadget .
it will still take a while before the third-generation phones make their way into the pockets of mainstream german consumers , say many observers .
vodafone , the market leader , came out with the samsung z105 mobile video phone and t-mobile , deutsche telekom 's mobile offshoot and the perennial runner-up in the market , decided to follow up with the futuristic nokia 7600 music clip mobile .
back in february , vodafone had already beaten t-mobile in the race by introducing a card for a laptop computer which would allow people to transmit data at umts speeds of up to 384 kilobits per second .
but it was n't until recently that consumers could even purchase mobile phones for the super-speed network .
both companies had blamed the slow process on the manufacturers of the handsets , but by the time cebit rolled into hanover with the world 's largest trade fair for information technology in march , several companies were already displaying the next generation in mobile phones .
other umts license holders , such as the netherlands-based e-plus , have decided to hold off on launching their handsets until the big names have paved the rocky road to acceptance .
in the long term , experts say umts will help ease the shortage of mobile phone capacity on the existing networks , and thus help drive down the still relatively high prices of even conventional mobile phones .
but that will only happen when the umts providers have mopped up as much initial premium-price usage as the companies can squeeze out of it . michael lawton -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service .

politicians on the left in the united states have spotted an opportunity and championed the film , which opens in the u.s. at the end of this month .
former presidential candidate al gore is already talking up the film , saying : “ millions of people will be coming out of movie theatres asking the question , ’ could this really happen ? ’ ”
meanwhile , voices on the other side of the political fence are offering their own opinions .
a bush spokesman has been quoted in reports as saying : “ people know what they ’ re watching is entertainment , and not grounded in basic scientific fact . ”
however , whether the same can be said about the other german-directed blockbuster is a matter for discussion .
wolfgang peterson 's troy is based on widely accepted historical fact but as with all things hollywood , there will be a certain amount of artistic license involved .
das boot director braves achilles ' heel peterson , born in emden in north germany , is probably best known for his claustrophobic world war ii classic das boot and his " man against the elements " sea spectacular the perfect storm .
this time , apart from the hugely impressive computer generated greek armada scenes in troy , the german director bases his latest epic on dry land - malta , to be precise . # b # the story follows events leading up to the legendary war circa 1200 b.c. which ignites when paris , prince of troy , steals away helen , the much younger wife of menelaus , the king of sparta .
the tribes of greece are then united to attack troy which leads to massive battle scenes , brad pitt in a skirt and , of course , that wooden horse . the film , boasting an impressive a-list cast and a budget of over € 150 million , is expected to be the biggest film of the year .

it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany . they take pictures , surf the web , send music and video clips - and they still fit in the palm of your hand and make telephone calls .
the long-awaited handsets for the new third generation of mobile phone systems are going on sale throughout germany starting this week .
but the mood on the market is a very different one from the euphoria when the big telecommunication companies first bought the rights to develop the new technology .
transmitting data at seven times the speed of the current mobile phone networks , the new universal mobile telecommunications system or umts promised to usher in a new age in mobile multimedia connectivity when it was launched back in 2000 .
at the time , people might have thought the 8.5 billion euros the participating telecommunications companies had to pay the government for access to the new networks was a bit steep .
but it was generally thought that the new mobile technology boom would go on for ever and the money was a good investment .
now that giant sum seems like a miscalculation .
deadlines for building up the network have come and gone , development of umts handsets were put on the back burner , and one provider - mobilcom - got out of the licensing altogether .
the deadline for offering the technology to the public was 2003 , but none of the german providers stuck to that date , and to make matters worse , the network does n't reach outside many urban areas yet .
the two big companies with a stake in the german market , british-based vodafone and the homegrown t-mobile , have only spent about a fifth of what the networks originally cost on developing technology for the new system .
for t-mobile , which is just beginning to bring out their own handsets , the investment in umts has ended up being an extensive endeavor .
in the first years after purchasing the license , the german telecommunications giant reported its biggest-ever losses and pointed the finger directly at the new network technology .
slow market reception it 's unlikely that umts will turn into a gold mine any time soon , despite all the clever things the new technology promises .
as with every new technology , there will only be a few early adaptors , who are prepared to pay the high price - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many will go after the new phones ? about 300 euros - and hefty connection charges for the thrill of possessing the latest gadget .
it will still take a while before the third-generation phones make their way into the pockets of mainstream german consumers , say many observers .
vodafone , the market leader , came out with the samsung z105 mobile video phone and t-mobile , deutsche telekom 's mobile offshoot and the perennial runner-up in the market , decided to follow up with the futuristic nokia 7600 music clip mobile .
back in february , vodafone had already beaten t-mobile in the race by introducing a card for a laptop computer which would allow people to transmit data at umts speeds of up to 384 kilobits per second .
but it was n't until recently that consumers could even purchase mobile phones for the super-speed network .
both companies had blamed the slow process on the manufacturers of the handsets , but by the time cebit rolled into hanover with the world 's largest trade fair for information technology in march , several companies were already displaying the next generation in mobile phones .
other umts license holders , such as the netherlands-based e-plus , have decided to hold off on launching their handsets until the big names have paved the rocky road to acceptance .
in the long term , experts say umts will help ease the shortage of mobile phone capacity on the existing networks , and thus help drive down the still relatively high prices of even conventional mobile phones .
but that will only happen when the umts providers have mopped up as much initial premium-price usage as the companies can squeeze out of it . michael lawton -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .

transmitting data at seven times the speed of the current mobile phone networks , the new universal mobile telecommunications system or umts promised to usher in a new age in mobile multimedia connectivity when it was launched back in 2000 .
at the time , people might have thought the 8.5 billion euros the participating telecommunications companies had to pay the government for access to the new networks was a bit steep .
but it was generally thought that the new mobile technology boom would go on for ever and the money was a good investment .
now that giant sum seems like a miscalculation .
deadlines for building up the network have come and gone , development of umts handsets were put on the back burner , and one provider - mobilcom - got out of the licensing altogether .
the deadline for offering the technology to the public was 2003 , but none of the german providers stuck to that date , and to make matters worse , the network does n't reach outside many urban areas yet .
the two big companies with a stake in the german market , british-based vodafone and the homegrown t-mobile , have only spent about a fifth of what the networks originally cost on developing technology for the new system .
for t-mobile , which is just beginning to bring out their own handsets , the investment in umts has ended up being an extensive endeavor .
in the first years after purchasing the license , the german telecommunications giant reported its biggest-ever losses and pointed the finger directly at the new network technology .
slow market reception it 's unlikely that umts will turn into a gold mine any time soon , despite all the clever things the new technology promises .
as with every new technology , there will only be a few early adaptors , who are prepared to pay the high price - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many will go after the new phones ? about 300 euros - and hefty connection charges for the thrill of possessing the latest gadget .
it will still take a while before the third-generation phones make their way into the pockets of mainstream german consumers , say many observers .
vodafone , the market leader , came out with the samsung z105 mobile video phone and t-mobile , deutsche telekom 's mobile offshoot and the perennial runner-up in the market , decided to follow up with the futuristic nokia 7600 music clip mobile .
back in february , vodafone had already beaten t-mobile in the race by introducing a card for a laptop computer which would allow people to transmit data at umts speeds of up to 384 kilobits per second .
but it was n't until recently that consumers could even purchase mobile phones for the super-speed network .
both companies had blamed the slow process on the manufacturers of the handsets , but by the time cebit rolled into hanover with the world 's largest trade fair for information technology in march , several companies were already displaying the next generation in mobile phones .
other umts license holders , such as the netherlands-based e-plus , have decided to hold off on launching their handsets until the big names have paved the rocky road to acceptance .
in the long term , experts say umts will help ease the shortage of mobile phone capacity on the existing networks , and thus help drive down the still relatively high prices of even conventional mobile phones .
but that will only happen when the umts providers have mopped up as much initial premium-price usage as the companies can squeeze out of it . michael lawton -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .

hollywood 's silly season of summer blockbusters kicks of this month with two movies tipped as mega-buck earners leading the way .
it sounds like business as usual until you discover that they 're both directed by germans . cinema audiences are preparing for the opening salvos in the annual battle of the summer blockbusters .
lavish posters boasting megastar actors and trailers promising epic set pieces have already got movie-goers salivating over the " money no object " offerings for this year 's release schedule . however , the first exchanges in the hollywood season will not come from american directors but from two germans who are ready to unleash films depicting global catastrophe and historical warfare onto effect junkies the world over . roland emmerich , no stranger to big budgets and special effects , unleashes the day after tomorrow on a world more than a little aware of the prophetic nature of the stuttgart-born director 's latest apocalyptical vision .
after bringing war-mongering aliens to earth in independence day and unleashing the radioactively-enhanced super lizard godzilla on film fans , the " swabian spielberg " has harnessed the fears of the kyoto generation to bring global warming to the silver screen for a cool € 118.5 million .
the german premiere is in berlin on may 21 . what emmerich attempted to do with aliens and monsters in the past , he now attempts with extreme weather with a film that has got the real-life powers-that-be sweating .
by ignoring the threat of climate change brought on by irresponsible attitudes to environmental damage , the u.s. government portrayed in the day after tomorrow literally reaps a whirlwind . first extreme heat , then tidal waves and snow storms sweep through manhattan and tornadoes destroy los angeles . emmerich calls for a change at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland emmerich .
not content with attaching an environmental message to his latest film , emmerich has even come out and criticized the current u.s. administration on its stance on global warming .
" president bush denies that there is global warming and that we cause this .
i don ’ t understand him , " the director said in a recent interview .
" i hope the americans make a more reasonable choice at the next election and elect democrat candidate john kerry . "
politicians on the left in the united states have spotted an opportunity and championed the film , which opens in the u.s. at the end of this month .
former presidential candidate al gore is already talking up the film , saying : “ millions of people will be coming out of movie theatres asking the question , ’ could this really happen ? ’ ”
meanwhile , voices on the other side of the political fence are offering their own opinions .
a bush spokesman has been quoted in reports as saying : “ people know what they ’ re watching is entertainment , and not grounded in basic scientific fact . ”
however , whether the same can be said about the other german-directed blockbuster is a matter for discussion .
wolfgang peterson 's troy is based on widely accepted historical fact but as with all things hollywood , there will be a certain amount of artistic license involved .
das boot director braves achilles ' heel peterson , born in emden in north germany , is probably best known for his claustrophobic world war ii classic das boot and his " man against the elements " sea spectacular the perfect storm .
this time , apart from the hugely impressive computer generated greek armada scenes in troy , the german director bases his latest epic on dry land - malta , to be precise . # b # the story follows events leading up to the legendary war circa 1200 b.c. which ignites when paris , prince of troy , steals away helen , the much younger wife of menelaus , the king of sparta .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.05.2004 will germany abolish the draft ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german men may soon be free of mandatory military service .
conscription could soon be scrapped in germany , as the ruling social democrats are reportedly realizing that switching to a professional army as in other nato countries might be a better option . the head of the policy and advisory staff of the german defense ministry , franz borkenhagen surprised members of the social democrat parliamentary fraction when he praised purely professional armies in other nato countries in a paper presented on wednesday . " the affected countries ruled that the intervention capabilities of the troops in foreign deployments had significantly improved , " german daily die welt quoted borkenhagen as saying .
" in general the troops welcomed the abolition of the draft and it even found a wide , positive resonance in society , " borkenhagen added . borkenhagen was addressing a special working group on security policies set up by the social democrats to examine ways to abolish the draft and the possible consequences of such a move . german defense minister peter struck is reportedly familiar with borkenhagen 's paper . pressure to scrap the draft borkenhagen 's findings are expected to add further fuel to a growing political debate in recent years on the future of mandatory military service , a feature of german life since the country was unified under bismarck in 1870 . the green party - the junior partner in the ruling coalition with the social democrats - have long pushed for the elimination of the nine-month conscription .
however , the social democrats led by defense minister struck have repeatedly rejected the calls , saying germany can not afford a professional army before 2010 . in recent months , pressure has increased on the government to abolish the draft .
in january this year an administrative court in cologne overturned the defense ministry 's eligibility rules for conscripts that exempt men who are married , are older than 23 or are found to be only partially fit for military service . the court said the rules violated the principle of fairness because fewer than half of the young men eligible for conscription are actually drafted .
though women have been allowed to serve by choice since 2001 , conscription is all-male with men between the ages of 18 to 45 eligible for nine-month duty . unable to meet modern challenges many also believe that the original aim of conscription - being a sort of citizens ' army to protect the homeland - now looks increasingly outdated in the face of modern military challenges such as global terrorism . germany - which remains one of the last major european countries with mandatory military service - has thus come under increasing pressure from its nato partners to scrap the system .
they consider it inefficient in dealing with crisis intervention and peacekeeping not least because the short duration of the conscription means that conscripts are generally not allowed to participate in combat missions overseas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan in addition , demands on the german army are currently greater than at any time since the second world war .
german troops are involved in more foreign operations than any other country apart from the u.s. , with peacekeeping troops stationed in afghanistan , the balkans and the horn of africa . armed forces undergoing revamp earlier this year , struck unveiled major plans to modernize and trim the armed forces and cut their budget - a move many believe may ultimately spell the end of conscription . struck 's reforms seek to reduce the number of soldiers -lrb- currently about 272,000 -rrb- by around 35,000 .
the new army will include a rapid-deployment force of 35,000 troops to be available for multinational missions , another 70,000 to trained for peacekeeping operations such as the one in afghanistan and the balkans .
he is also reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion . " despite his emphasis on maintaining the draft , he is pursuing a very pragmatic policy , which in reality is moving step by step away from the draft and toward a volunteer army , " winfried nachtwei , a defense expert for the green party said in an interview with news agency dpa earlier this year . abolition not without problems but the dismantling of the draft in germany is also expected to bring its fair share of problems .
young men who reject serving in the military for reasons of conscience are required to do compulsory community service for ten months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german social worker around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
the social democrats , who are set to take a final decision on the future of the draft at a party conference next year , are indicating they 're adopting a pragmatic approach .
" the working group on security policies is still of the view that conscription is the better decision for the armed forces and our society , " rainer arnold of defense spokesman of the social democratic parliamentary group told die welt .
" but it has to remain viable , " he added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany set to abolish the draft young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service .

conscription could soon be scrapped in germany , as the ruling social democrats are reportedly realizing that switching to a professional army as in other nato countries might be a better option . the head of the policy and advisory staff of the german defense ministry , franz borkenhagen surprised members of the social democrat parliamentary fraction when he praised purely professional armies in other nato countries in a paper presented on wednesday . " the affected countries ruled that the intervention capabilities of the troops in foreign deployments had significantly improved , " german daily die welt quoted borkenhagen as saying .
" in general the troops welcomed the abolition of the draft and it even found a wide , positive resonance in society , " borkenhagen added . borkenhagen was addressing a special working group on security policies set up by the social democrats to examine ways to abolish the draft and the possible consequences of such a move . german defense minister peter struck is reportedly familiar with borkenhagen 's paper . pressure to scrap the draft borkenhagen 's findings are expected to add further fuel to a growing political debate in recent years on the future of mandatory military service , a feature of german life since the country was unified under bismarck in 1870 . the green party - the junior partner in the ruling coalition with the social democrats - have long pushed for the elimination of the nine-month conscription .
however , the social democrats led by defense minister struck have repeatedly rejected the calls , saying germany can not afford a professional army before 2010 . in recent months , pressure has increased on the government to abolish the draft .
in january this year an administrative court in cologne overturned the defense ministry 's eligibility rules for conscripts that exempt men who are married , are older than 23 or are found to be only partially fit for military service . the court said the rules violated the principle of fairness because fewer than half of the young men eligible for conscription are actually drafted .
though women have been allowed to serve by choice since 2001 , conscription is all-male with men between the ages of 18 to 45 eligible for nine-month duty . unable to meet modern challenges many also believe that the original aim of conscription - being a sort of citizens ' army to protect the homeland - now looks increasingly outdated in the face of modern military challenges such as global terrorism . germany - which remains one of the last major european countries with mandatory military service - has thus come under increasing pressure from its nato partners to scrap the system .
they consider it inefficient in dealing with crisis intervention and peacekeeping not least because the short duration of the conscription means that conscripts are generally not allowed to participate in combat missions overseas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan in addition , demands on the german army are currently greater than at any time since the second world war .
german troops are involved in more foreign operations than any other country apart from the u.s. , with peacekeeping troops stationed in afghanistan , the balkans and the horn of africa . armed forces undergoing revamp earlier this year , struck unveiled major plans to modernize and trim the armed forces and cut their budget - a move many believe may ultimately spell the end of conscription . struck 's reforms seek to reduce the number of soldiers -lrb- currently about 272,000 -rrb- by around 35,000 .
the new army will include a rapid-deployment force of 35,000 troops to be available for multinational missions , another 70,000 to trained for peacekeeping operations such as the one in afghanistan and the balkans .
he is also reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion . " despite his emphasis on maintaining the draft , he is pursuing a very pragmatic policy , which in reality is moving step by step away from the draft and toward a volunteer army , " winfried nachtwei , a defense expert for the green party said in an interview with news agency dpa earlier this year . abolition not without problems but the dismantling of the draft in germany is also expected to bring its fair share of problems .

charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
the social democrats , who are set to take a final decision on the future of the draft at a party conference next year , are indicating they 're adopting a pragmatic approach .

economists had forecast a rise , but the latest numbers appear to reinforce recent downward revisions of expected growth in germany .
decline in demand was most pronounced in consumer goods and semi-finished products , as well as in orders for intermediate goods such as chemicals .
economists are particularly concerned by the drop in demand for intermediate goods , as this is seen as an important early indicator for future growth .
" it gives you a bad feeling and makes you doubt that the upturn is really robust , " economist adolf rosenstock of nomura international told reuters .
recent surveys and reports had indicated that germany 's industrial outlook was buoyant , but thursday 's figures , despite a probable upward revision , tell a different story . more briefs 05.05.2004 -pipe- german government signs it security deal with microsoft 05.05.2004 -pipe- germany could take until 2010 to balance budget 04.05.2004 -pipe- german gasoline prices at near record highs 04.05.2004 -pipe- insurer gerling reaches century mark 03.05.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler to scale back ties with hyundai 03.05.2004 -pipe- siemens seals groundbreaking patent deal with microsoft 02.05.2004 -pipe- german media groups plan to merge printing operations 02.05.2004 -pipe- siemens to sell mobile phones in china radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

conscription could soon be scrapped in germany , as the ruling social democrats are reportedly realizing that switching to a professional army as in other nato countries might be a better option . the head of the policy and advisory staff of the german defense ministry , franz borkenhagen surprised members of the social democrat parliamentary fraction when he praised purely professional armies in other nato countries in a paper presented on wednesday . " the affected countries ruled that the intervention capabilities of the troops in foreign deployments had significantly improved , " german daily die welt quoted borkenhagen as saying .
" in general the troops welcomed the abolition of the draft and it even found a wide , positive resonance in society , " borkenhagen added . borkenhagen was addressing a special working group on security policies set up by the social democrats to examine ways to abolish the draft and the possible consequences of such a move . german defense minister peter struck is reportedly familiar with borkenhagen 's paper . pressure to scrap the draft borkenhagen 's findings are expected to add further fuel to a growing political debate in recent years on the future of mandatory military service , a feature of german life since the country was unified under bismarck in 1870 . the green party - the junior partner in the ruling coalition with the social democrats - have long pushed for the elimination of the nine-month conscription .
however , the social democrats led by defense minister struck have repeatedly rejected the calls , saying germany can not afford a professional army before 2010 . in recent months , pressure has increased on the government to abolish the draft .
in january this year an administrative court in cologne overturned the defense ministry 's eligibility rules for conscripts that exempt men who are married , are older than 23 or are found to be only partially fit for military service . the court said the rules violated the principle of fairness because fewer than half of the young men eligible for conscription are actually drafted .
though women have been allowed to serve by choice since 2001 , conscription is all-male with men between the ages of 18 to 45 eligible for nine-month duty . unable to meet modern challenges many also believe that the original aim of conscription - being a sort of citizens ' army to protect the homeland - now looks increasingly outdated in the face of modern military challenges such as global terrorism . germany - which remains one of the last major european countries with mandatory military service - has thus come under increasing pressure from its nato partners to scrap the system .

conscription could soon be scrapped in germany , as the ruling social democrats are reportedly realizing that switching to a professional army as in other nato countries might be a better option . the head of the policy and advisory staff of the german defense ministry , franz borkenhagen surprised members of the social democrat parliamentary fraction when he praised purely professional armies in other nato countries in a paper presented on wednesday . " the affected countries ruled that the intervention capabilities of the troops in foreign deployments had significantly improved , " german daily die welt quoted borkenhagen as saying .
" in general the troops welcomed the abolition of the draft and it even found a wide , positive resonance in society , " borkenhagen added . borkenhagen was addressing a special working group on security policies set up by the social democrats to examine ways to abolish the draft and the possible consequences of such a move . german defense minister peter struck is reportedly familiar with borkenhagen 's paper . pressure to scrap the draft borkenhagen 's findings are expected to add further fuel to a growing political debate in recent years on the future of mandatory military service , a feature of german life since the country was unified under bismarck in 1870 . the green party - the junior partner in the ruling coalition with the social democrats - have long pushed for the elimination of the nine-month conscription .
however , the social democrats led by defense minister struck have repeatedly rejected the calls , saying germany can not afford a professional army before 2010 . in recent months , pressure has increased on the government to abolish the draft .
in january this year an administrative court in cologne overturned the defense ministry 's eligibility rules for conscripts that exempt men who are married , are older than 23 or are found to be only partially fit for military service . the court said the rules violated the principle of fairness because fewer than half of the young men eligible for conscription are actually drafted .
though women have been allowed to serve by choice since 2001 , conscription is all-male with men between the ages of 18 to 45 eligible for nine-month duty . unable to meet modern challenges many also believe that the original aim of conscription - being a sort of citizens ' army to protect the homeland - now looks increasingly outdated in the face of modern military challenges such as global terrorism . germany - which remains one of the last major european countries with mandatory military service - has thus come under increasing pressure from its nato partners to scrap the system .

stability in the middle east and the fight against terrorism top the agenda at a meeting between eu foreign ministers and representatives from southern mediterranean states in dublin on thursday . just one day after a meeting of the middle east quartet in new york , the israeli and palestinian foreign ministers met face to face on wednesday as they joined a string of fellow ministers from europe and the middle east for high level talks in the irish capital .
israeli foreign minister silvan shalom and his palestinian counterpart nabil shaath were among three dozen ministers visiting the irish capital as part of a two-day euro-mediterranean gathering convened by the european union . the meeting in dublin castle will focus on prospects for bringing peace to the middle east and european relations to the 12 southern mediterranean states .
the event comes at a crucial time for israel and palestine , following on the heels of tuesday 's meeting of the quartet of middle east peace sponsors -lrb- united nations , united states , russia and the eu -rrb- and coming ahead of a summit of the arab league in tunisia later this month .
irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country as the current holder of the eu presidency is playing host to the euro-med conference , acknowledged the difficulties of bringing the two parties together , but said it was important for the peace process in the region .
" we need to use this forum , and there are very few where israeli and arab ministers can sit down and discuss issues , " he told reporters after an informal working dinner wednesday evening .
" we need to ensure that we get these parties together and try to get a ceasefire going .
we need a ceasefire in the middle east to give a chance to these parties to work together , " cowen said on behalf of the eu .
stability crucial for euro-med partnership since the mediterranean dialogue kicked off in barcelona in 1995 , bringing together the 15 countries that then made up the eu with algeria , cyprus , egypt , israel , jordan , lebanon , malta , morocco , the palestinian authority , syria , tunisia and turkey , the conflict in the middle east has been a constant topic of discussion .
diego de ojeda , the spokesman for eu 's external relations commissioner , chris patten , admitted the dispute between israel and the palestinians has been an undeniable " burden " for the forging of the euro-mediterranean partnership , often detracting from the other areas of cooperation .
the barcelona process of bringing europe and the mediterranean states closer together has succeeded primarily in areas not readily apparent in the political restructuring of the middle east , ojeda said .
chief among these are the many projects the eu finances to help build democratic institutions and promote economic development .
the eu has , for example , set up a training center for arab managers , funded youth exchanges , sponsored archeological excavations , renovations of villages and film projects - all at a cost of about a billion euros a year .
critics say that the barcelona process has been progressing too slowly , that it is no nearer to its goal of bringing democracy to north africa and the middle east .
but poul nielson , eu development commissioner , dismisses such criticism .
europe 's politics with regards to its neighbors is based on the principal of equality , he said .
" political and economic reforms can not simply be grafted onto the region .
successful cooperation flourishes only on the foundation of common interests among equal partners . "
common interests since the recent bomb attacks in madrid , istanbul and morocco , and even dating as far back as those in 2002 on the tunisian island of djerba , the threat of an increase in terrorism from extremist islamic circles has pushed the eu and the neighboring mediterranean states into a closer working relationship .
much has been made of the fact that after the train blasts in madrid in march , morocco immediately sent experts to the spanish capital to assist with the investigations .
things were quite different after the terror attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
eu ministers point to the improvement in cooperation as a signal that they are on the right track .
one way to fight extremism at its roots , they argue , is to reduce poverty .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has come out strong in favor of promoting economic ties to north africa to give the people , especially the 40 million youth , a perspective .
in order to do this , the eu has negotiated preferential trade agreements with all the euro-med countries .
whether the goal of establishing a free trade zone for the entire mediterranean region by 2010 will be achieved is still uncertain .
and as for inviting the 12 southern neighbors to join the eu , poul nielson has warned the mediterranean countries not to get their hopes up .
" we 're not closing the door , but we 're also not talking about further enlargement , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels libya is the only north african state not in the euro-mediterranean partnership , but on a trip to brussles last week muammar gadhafi expressed interest in joining .

stability in the middle east and the fight against terrorism top the agenda at a meeting between eu foreign ministers and representatives from southern mediterranean states in dublin on thursday . just one day after a meeting of the middle east quartet in new york , the israeli and palestinian foreign ministers met face to face on wednesday as they joined a string of fellow ministers from europe and the middle east for high level talks in the irish capital .
israeli foreign minister silvan shalom and his palestinian counterpart nabil shaath were among three dozen ministers visiting the irish capital as part of a two-day euro-mediterranean gathering convened by the european union . the meeting in dublin castle will focus on prospects for bringing peace to the middle east and european relations to the 12 southern mediterranean states .
the event comes at a crucial time for israel and palestine , following on the heels of tuesday 's meeting of the quartet of middle east peace sponsors -lrb- united nations , united states , russia and the eu -rrb- and coming ahead of a summit of the arab league in tunisia later this month .
irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country as the current holder of the eu presidency is playing host to the euro-med conference , acknowledged the difficulties of bringing the two parties together , but said it was important for the peace process in the region .
" we need to use this forum , and there are very few where israeli and arab ministers can sit down and discuss issues , " he told reporters after an informal working dinner wednesday evening .
" we need to ensure that we get these parties together and try to get a ceasefire going .
we need a ceasefire in the middle east to give a chance to these parties to work together , " cowen said on behalf of the eu .
stability crucial for euro-med partnership since the mediterranean dialogue kicked off in barcelona in 1995 , bringing together the 15 countries that then made up the eu with algeria , cyprus , egypt , israel , jordan , lebanon , malta , morocco , the palestinian authority , syria , tunisia and turkey , the conflict in the middle east has been a constant topic of discussion .
diego de ojeda , the spokesman for eu 's external relations commissioner , chris patten , admitted the dispute between israel and the palestinians has been an undeniable " burden " for the forging of the euro-mediterranean partnership , often detracting from the other areas of cooperation .
the barcelona process of bringing europe and the mediterranean states closer together has succeeded primarily in areas not readily apparent in the political restructuring of the middle east , ojeda said .
chief among these are the many projects the eu finances to help build democratic institutions and promote economic development .
the eu has , for example , set up a training center for arab managers , funded youth exchanges , sponsored archeological excavations , renovations of villages and film projects - all at a cost of about a billion euros a year .
critics say that the barcelona process has been progressing too slowly , that it is no nearer to its goal of bringing democracy to north africa and the middle east .
but poul nielson , eu development commissioner , dismisses such criticism .
europe 's politics with regards to its neighbors is based on the principal of equality , he said .
" political and economic reforms can not simply be grafted onto the region .
successful cooperation flourishes only on the foundation of common interests among equal partners . "
common interests since the recent bomb attacks in madrid , istanbul and morocco , and even dating as far back as those in 2002 on the tunisian island of djerba , the threat of an increase in terrorism from extremist islamic circles has pushed the eu and the neighboring mediterranean states into a closer working relationship .
much has been made of the fact that after the train blasts in madrid in march , morocco immediately sent experts to the spanish capital to assist with the investigations .
things were quite different after the terror attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
eu ministers point to the improvement in cooperation as a signal that they are on the right track .
one way to fight extremism at its roots , they argue , is to reduce poverty .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has come out strong in favor of promoting economic ties to north africa to give the people , especially the 40 million youth , a perspective .
in order to do this , the eu has negotiated preferential trade agreements with all the euro-med countries .
whether the goal of establishing a free trade zone for the entire mediterranean region by 2010 will be achieved is still uncertain .
and as for inviting the 12 southern neighbors to join the eu , poul nielson has warned the mediterranean countries not to get their hopes up .
" we 're not closing the door , but we 're also not talking about further enlargement , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels libya is the only north african state not in the euro-mediterranean partnership , but on a trip to brussles last week muammar gadhafi expressed interest in joining .
europe pledges economic cooperation for north africa at a meeting of 10 mediterranean countries , europe agreed to boost ties between the wealthier northern states and the poorer south and to help in the fight on terror and stemming the flow of illegal immigration .

stability in the middle east and the fight against terrorism top the agenda at a meeting between eu foreign ministers and representatives from southern mediterranean states in dublin on thursday . just one day after a meeting of the middle east quartet in new york , the israeli and palestinian foreign ministers met face to face on wednesday as they joined a string of fellow ministers from europe and the middle east for high level talks in the irish capital .
israeli foreign minister silvan shalom and his palestinian counterpart nabil shaath were among three dozen ministers visiting the irish capital as part of a two-day euro-mediterranean gathering convened by the european union . the meeting in dublin castle will focus on prospects for bringing peace to the middle east and european relations to the 12 southern mediterranean states .
the event comes at a crucial time for israel and palestine , following on the heels of tuesday 's meeting of the quartet of middle east peace sponsors -lrb- united nations , united states , russia and the eu -rrb- and coming ahead of a summit of the arab league in tunisia later this month .
irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country as the current holder of the eu presidency is playing host to the euro-med conference , acknowledged the difficulties of bringing the two parties together , but said it was important for the peace process in the region .
" we need to use this forum , and there are very few where israeli and arab ministers can sit down and discuss issues , " he told reporters after an informal working dinner wednesday evening .
" we need to ensure that we get these parties together and try to get a ceasefire going .
we need a ceasefire in the middle east to give a chance to these parties to work together , " cowen said on behalf of the eu .
stability crucial for euro-med partnership since the mediterranean dialogue kicked off in barcelona in 1995 , bringing together the 15 countries that then made up the eu with algeria , cyprus , egypt , israel , jordan , lebanon , malta , morocco , the palestinian authority , syria , tunisia and turkey , the conflict in the middle east has been a constant topic of discussion .
diego de ojeda , the spokesman for eu 's external relations commissioner , chris patten , admitted the dispute between israel and the palestinians has been an undeniable " burden " for the forging of the euro-mediterranean partnership , often detracting from the other areas of cooperation .
the barcelona process of bringing europe and the mediterranean states closer together has succeeded primarily in areas not readily apparent in the political restructuring of the middle east , ojeda said .
chief among these are the many projects the eu finances to help build democratic institutions and promote economic development .
the eu has , for example , set up a training center for arab managers , funded youth exchanges , sponsored archeological excavations , renovations of villages and film projects - all at a cost of about a billion euros a year .
critics say that the barcelona process has been progressing too slowly , that it is no nearer to its goal of bringing democracy to north africa and the middle east .
but poul nielson , eu development commissioner , dismisses such criticism .

" 40,000 dead on the spot , 300,000 injured .
a radiation cloud spreads over belgium , northern france , the netherlands and germany , bringing terror and death .
the old continent plunged into chaos , " is the doomsday scenario painted by the simulation , according to french daily le figaro .
the military exercise presupposes that terrorist group al-qaeda had managed to procure enriched uranium from nuclear research facilities in eastern europe and succeeded in building a 10 kiloton bomb .
the war game , named " black dawn , " was attended by senior military personnel and the eu 's high representative for foreign policy , javier solana .
the conclusion drawn after these simulations , according to le figaro , is that once a group like al-qaeda has obtained the materials , the military is then powerless to stop them .
preventing them from acquiring nuclear products is therefore the priority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.05.2004 -pipe- 11:00 utc turkey has alternative options to eu speaking on tuesday , turkey ’ s prime minister recep tayyip erdogan warned : " if the eu does n't take the decision we want , turkey wo n't have any difficulties in finding a new course to follow thanks to its big potential . "
according to ankara anatolia news agency the turkish leader said the eu " will have difficulties in talking about european ideals as of that day . "
eu officials , including those from the 10 new countries , will decide in december on the basis of a commission 's report whether accession talks with turkey should begin .
at a meeting of his justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- in the turkish parliament , erdogan said it would be wrong and unjust for the eu to keep turkey waiting more .
turkey 's formal relations with the eu date back to an association agreement in 1963 and was granted candidate country status in 1999 .
however , the fear is that the eu will not deliver on its promise at a time when turkey has reached a critical stage in its reform process .
erdogan said the reforms which involve significant political , constitutional and social changes would continue regardless of whether turkey gets a date to start accession negations with the eu .
however , there are concerns that if brussels delivers a negative response at the end of this year , the reform process might come to a halt .
" the real issue is whether the changes that are being introduced will be consolidated without a negotiating date from the eu " , kemal kirisci , a political scientist at bosphorus university was quoted saying by the financial times .

"
according to ankara anatolia news agency the turkish leader said the eu " will have difficulties in talking about european ideals as of that day . "
eu officials , including those from the 10 new countries , will decide in december on the basis of a commission 's report whether accession talks with turkey should begin .
at a meeting of his justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- in the turkish parliament , erdogan said it would be wrong and unjust for the eu to keep turkey waiting more .
turkey 's formal relations with the eu date back to an association agreement in 1963 and was granted candidate country status in 1999 .
however , the fear is that the eu will not deliver on its promise at a time when turkey has reached a critical stage in its reform process .
erdogan said the reforms which involve significant political , constitutional and social changes would continue regardless of whether turkey gets a date to start accession negations with the eu .
however , there are concerns that if brussels delivers a negative response at the end of this year , the reform process might come to a halt .
" the real issue is whether the changes that are being introduced will be consolidated without a negotiating date from the eu " , kemal kirisci , a political scientist at bosphorus university was quoted saying by the financial times .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.05.2004 -pipe- 11:00 utc turkey has alternative options to eu speaking on tuesday , turkey ’ s prime minister recep tayyip erdogan warned : " if the eu does n't take the decision we want , turkey wo n't have any difficulties in finding a new course to follow thanks to its big potential . "
according to ankara anatolia news agency the turkish leader said the eu " will have difficulties in talking about european ideals as of that day . "
eu officials , including those from the 10 new countries , will decide in december on the basis of a commission 's report whether accession talks with turkey should begin .
at a meeting of his justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- in the turkish parliament , erdogan said it would be wrong and unjust for the eu to keep turkey waiting more .
turkey 's formal relations with the eu date back to an association agreement in 1963 and was granted candidate country status in 1999 .
however , the fear is that the eu will not deliver on its promise at a time when turkey has reached a critical stage in its reform process .
erdogan said the reforms which involve significant political , constitutional and social changes would continue regardless of whether turkey gets a date to start accession negations with the eu .
however , there are concerns that if brussels delivers a negative response at the end of this year , the reform process might come to a halt .
" the real issue is whether the changes that are being introduced will be consolidated without a negotiating date from the eu " , kemal kirisci , a political scientist at bosphorus university was quoted saying by the financial times .

hollywood 's silly season of summer blockbusters kicks of this month with two movies tipped as mega-buck earners leading the way .
it sounds like business as usual until you discover that they 're both directed by germans . cinema audiences are preparing for the opening salvos in the annual battle of the summer blockbusters .
lavish posters boasting megastar actors and trailers promising epic set pieces have already got movie-goers salivating over the " money no object " offerings for this year 's release schedule . however , the first exchanges in the hollywood season will not come from american directors but from two germans who are ready to unleash films depicting global catastrophe and historical warfare onto effect junkies the world over . roland emmerich , no stranger to big budgets and special effects , unleashes the day after tomorrow on a world more than a little aware of the prophetic nature of the stuttgart-born director 's latest apocalyptical vision .
after bringing war-mongering aliens to earth in independence day and unleashing the radioactively-enhanced super lizard godzilla on film fans , the " swabian spielberg " has harnessed the fears of the kyoto generation to bring global warming to the silver screen for a cool € 118.5 million .
the german premiere is in berlin on may 21 . what emmerich attempted to do with aliens and monsters in the past , he now attempts with extreme weather with a film that has got the real-life powers-that-be sweating .
by ignoring the threat of climate change brought on by irresponsible attitudes to environmental damage , the u.s. government portrayed in the day after tomorrow literally reaps a whirlwind . first extreme heat , then tidal waves and snow storms sweep through manhattan and tornadoes destroy los angeles . emmerich calls for a change at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland emmerich .
not content with attaching an environmental message to his latest film , emmerich has even come out and criticized the current u.s. administration on its stance on global warming .
" president bush denies that there is global warming and that we cause this .
i don ’ t understand him , " the director said in a recent interview .
" i hope the americans make a more reasonable choice at the next election and elect democrat candidate john kerry . "
politicians on the left in the united states have spotted an opportunity and championed the film , which opens in the u.s. at the end of this month .
former presidential candidate al gore is already talking up the film , saying : “ millions of people will be coming out of movie theatres asking the question , ’ could this really happen ? ’ ”
meanwhile , voices on the other side of the political fence are offering their own opinions .
a bush spokesman has been quoted in reports as saying : “ people know what they ’ re watching is entertainment , and not grounded in basic scientific fact . ”
however , whether the same can be said about the other german-directed blockbuster is a matter for discussion .
wolfgang peterson 's troy is based on widely accepted historical fact but as with all things hollywood , there will be a certain amount of artistic license involved .
das boot director braves achilles ' heel peterson , born in emden in north germany , is probably best known for his claustrophobic world war ii classic das boot and his " man against the elements " sea spectacular the perfect storm .
this time , apart from the hugely impressive computer generated greek armada scenes in troy , the german director bases his latest epic on dry land - malta , to be precise . # b # the story follows events leading up to the legendary war circa 1200 b.c. which ignites when paris , prince of troy , steals away helen , the much younger wife of menelaus , the king of sparta .
the tribes of greece are then united to attack troy which leads to massive battle scenes , brad pitt in a skirt and , of course , that wooden horse . the film , boasting an impressive a-list cast and a budget of over € 150 million , is expected to be the biggest film of the year .
it premieres in peterson 's home country on may 9 with many of the stars expected to turn out for the showing in berlin . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to u.s. : cut emissions or face disaster in june , germany will host a global conference on renewable energies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.05.2004 third generation mobile phones arrive in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodafone deutschland head jürgen von kuczkowski shows off his company 's new do-it-all phone .
it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany . they take pictures , surf the web , send music and video clips - and they still fit in the palm of your hand and make telephone calls .
the long-awaited handsets for the new third generation of mobile phone systems are going on sale throughout germany starting this week .
but the mood on the market is a very different one from the euphoria when the big telecommunication companies first bought the rights to develop the new technology .
transmitting data at seven times the speed of the current mobile phone networks , the new universal mobile telecommunications system or umts promised to usher in a new age in mobile multimedia connectivity when it was launched back in 2000 .
at the time , people might have thought the 8.5 billion euros the participating telecommunications companies had to pay the government for access to the new networks was a bit steep .
but it was generally thought that the new mobile technology boom would go on for ever and the money was a good investment .
now that giant sum seems like a miscalculation .
deadlines for building up the network have come and gone , development of umts handsets were put on the back burner , and one provider - mobilcom - got out of the licensing altogether .
the deadline for offering the technology to the public was 2003 , but none of the german providers stuck to that date , and to make matters worse , the network does n't reach outside many urban areas yet .
the two big companies with a stake in the german market , british-based vodafone and the homegrown t-mobile , have only spent about a fifth of what the networks originally cost on developing technology for the new system .
for t-mobile , which is just beginning to bring out their own handsets , the investment in umts has ended up being an extensive endeavor .
in the first years after purchasing the license , the german telecommunications giant reported its biggest-ever losses and pointed the finger directly at the new network technology .

the long-awaited handsets for the new third generation of mobile phone systems are going on sale throughout germany starting this week .
but the mood on the market is a very different one from the euphoria when the big telecommunication companies first bought the rights to develop the new technology .

conscription could soon be scrapped in germany , as the ruling social democrats are reportedly realizing that switching to a professional army as in other nato countries might be a better option . the head of the policy and advisory staff of the german defense ministry , franz borkenhagen surprised members of the social democrat parliamentary fraction when he praised purely professional armies in other nato countries in a paper presented on wednesday . " the affected countries ruled that the intervention capabilities of the troops in foreign deployments had significantly improved , " german daily die welt quoted borkenhagen as saying .
" in general the troops welcomed the abolition of the draft and it even found a wide , positive resonance in society , " borkenhagen added . borkenhagen was addressing a special working group on security policies set up by the social democrats to examine ways to abolish the draft and the possible consequences of such a move . german defense minister peter struck is reportedly familiar with borkenhagen 's paper . pressure to scrap the draft borkenhagen 's findings are expected to add further fuel to a growing political debate in recent years on the future of mandatory military service , a feature of german life since the country was unified under bismarck in 1870 . the green party - the junior partner in the ruling coalition with the social democrats - have long pushed for the elimination of the nine-month conscription .
however , the social democrats led by defense minister struck have repeatedly rejected the calls , saying germany can not afford a professional army before 2010 . in recent months , pressure has increased on the government to abolish the draft .
in january this year an administrative court in cologne overturned the defense ministry 's eligibility rules for conscripts that exempt men who are married , are older than 23 or are found to be only partially fit for military service . the court said the rules violated the principle of fairness because fewer than half of the young men eligible for conscription are actually drafted .
though women have been allowed to serve by choice since 2001 , conscription is all-male with men between the ages of 18 to 45 eligible for nine-month duty . unable to meet modern challenges many also believe that the original aim of conscription - being a sort of citizens ' army to protect the homeland - now looks increasingly outdated in the face of modern military challenges such as global terrorism . germany - which remains one of the last major european countries with mandatory military service - has thus come under increasing pressure from its nato partners to scrap the system .
they consider it inefficient in dealing with crisis intervention and peacekeeping not least because the short duration of the conscription means that conscripts are generally not allowed to participate in combat missions overseas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan in addition , demands on the german army are currently greater than at any time since the second world war .
german troops are involved in more foreign operations than any other country apart from the u.s. , with peacekeeping troops stationed in afghanistan , the balkans and the horn of africa . armed forces undergoing revamp earlier this year , struck unveiled major plans to modernize and trim the armed forces and cut their budget - a move many believe may ultimately spell the end of conscription . struck 's reforms seek to reduce the number of soldiers -lrb- currently about 272,000 -rrb- by around 35,000 .
the new army will include a rapid-deployment force of 35,000 troops to be available for multinational missions , another 70,000 to trained for peacekeeping operations such as the one in afghanistan and the balkans .
he is also reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion . " despite his emphasis on maintaining the draft , he is pursuing a very pragmatic policy , which in reality is moving step by step away from the draft and toward a volunteer army , " winfried nachtwei , a defense expert for the green party said in an interview with news agency dpa earlier this year . abolition not without problems but the dismantling of the draft in germany is also expected to bring its fair share of problems .
young men who reject serving in the military for reasons of conscience are required to do compulsory community service for ten months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german social worker around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
the social democrats , who are set to take a final decision on the future of the draft at a party conference next year , are indicating they 're adopting a pragmatic approach .
" the working group on security policies is still of the view that conscription is the better decision for the armed forces and our society , " rainer arnold of defense spokesman of the social democratic parliamentary group told die welt .
" but it has to remain viable , " he added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany set to abolish the draft young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .

hollywood 's silly season of summer blockbusters kicks of this month with two movies tipped as mega-buck earners leading the way .
it sounds like business as usual until you discover that they 're both directed by germans . cinema audiences are preparing for the opening salvos in the annual battle of the summer blockbusters .
lavish posters boasting megastar actors and trailers promising epic set pieces have already got movie-goers salivating over the " money no object " offerings for this year 's release schedule . however , the first exchanges in the hollywood season will not come from american directors but from two germans who are ready to unleash films depicting global catastrophe and historical warfare onto effect junkies the world over . roland emmerich , no stranger to big budgets and special effects , unleashes the day after tomorrow on a world more than a little aware of the prophetic nature of the stuttgart-born director 's latest apocalyptical vision .
after bringing war-mongering aliens to earth in independence day and unleashing the radioactively-enhanced super lizard godzilla on film fans , the " swabian spielberg " has harnessed the fears of the kyoto generation to bring global warming to the silver screen for a cool € 118.5 million .
the german premiere is in berlin on may 21 . what emmerich attempted to do with aliens and monsters in the past , he now attempts with extreme weather with a film that has got the real-life powers-that-be sweating .
by ignoring the threat of climate change brought on by irresponsible attitudes to environmental damage , the u.s. government portrayed in the day after tomorrow literally reaps a whirlwind . first extreme heat , then tidal waves and snow storms sweep through manhattan and tornadoes destroy los angeles . emmerich calls for a change at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland emmerich .
not content with attaching an environmental message to his latest film , emmerich has even come out and criticized the current u.s. administration on its stance on global warming .
" president bush denies that there is global warming and that we cause this .
i don ’ t understand him , " the director said in a recent interview .
" i hope the americans make a more reasonable choice at the next election and elect democrat candidate john kerry . "
politicians on the left in the united states have spotted an opportunity and championed the film , which opens in the u.s. at the end of this month .
former presidential candidate al gore is already talking up the film , saying : “ millions of people will be coming out of movie theatres asking the question , ’ could this really happen ? ’ ”
meanwhile , voices on the other side of the political fence are offering their own opinions .
a bush spokesman has been quoted in reports as saying : “ people know what they ’ re watching is entertainment , and not grounded in basic scientific fact . ”
however , whether the same can be said about the other german-directed blockbuster is a matter for discussion .
wolfgang peterson 's troy is based on widely accepted historical fact but as with all things hollywood , there will be a certain amount of artistic license involved .
das boot director braves achilles ' heel peterson , born in emden in north germany , is probably best known for his claustrophobic world war ii classic das boot and his " man against the elements " sea spectacular the perfect storm .
this time , apart from the hugely impressive computer generated greek armada scenes in troy , the german director bases his latest epic on dry land - malta , to be precise . # b # the story follows events leading up to the legendary war circa 1200 b.c. which ignites when paris , prince of troy , steals away helen , the much younger wife of menelaus , the king of sparta .
the tribes of greece are then united to attack troy which leads to massive battle scenes , brad pitt in a skirt and , of course , that wooden horse . the film , boasting an impressive a-list cast and a budget of over € 150 million , is expected to be the biggest film of the year .
it premieres in peterson 's home country on may 9 with many of the stars expected to turn out for the showing in berlin . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to u.s. : cut emissions or face disaster in june , germany will host a global conference on renewable energies .

it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany . they take pictures , surf the web , send music and video clips - and they still fit in the palm of your hand and make telephone calls .
the long-awaited handsets for the new third generation of mobile phone systems are going on sale throughout germany starting this week .
but the mood on the market is a very different one from the euphoria when the big telecommunication companies first bought the rights to develop the new technology .
transmitting data at seven times the speed of the current mobile phone networks , the new universal mobile telecommunications system or umts promised to usher in a new age in mobile multimedia connectivity when it was launched back in 2000 .
at the time , people might have thought the 8.5 billion euros the participating telecommunications companies had to pay the government for access to the new networks was a bit steep .
but it was generally thought that the new mobile technology boom would go on for ever and the money was a good investment .
now that giant sum seems like a miscalculation .
deadlines for building up the network have come and gone , development of umts handsets were put on the back burner , and one provider - mobilcom - got out of the licensing altogether .
the deadline for offering the technology to the public was 2003 , but none of the german providers stuck to that date , and to make matters worse , the network does n't reach outside many urban areas yet .
the two big companies with a stake in the german market , british-based vodafone and the homegrown t-mobile , have only spent about a fifth of what the networks originally cost on developing technology for the new system .
for t-mobile , which is just beginning to bring out their own handsets , the investment in umts has ended up being an extensive endeavor .
in the first years after purchasing the license , the german telecommunications giant reported its biggest-ever losses and pointed the finger directly at the new network technology .
slow market reception it 's unlikely that umts will turn into a gold mine any time soon , despite all the clever things the new technology promises .
as with every new technology , there will only be a few early adaptors , who are prepared to pay the high price - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many will go after the new phones ? about 300 euros - and hefty connection charges for the thrill of possessing the latest gadget .
it will still take a while before the third-generation phones make their way into the pockets of mainstream german consumers , say many observers .
vodafone , the market leader , came out with the samsung z105 mobile video phone and t-mobile , deutsche telekom 's mobile offshoot and the perennial runner-up in the market , decided to follow up with the futuristic nokia 7600 music clip mobile .
back in february , vodafone had already beaten t-mobile in the race by introducing a card for a laptop computer which would allow people to transmit data at umts speeds of up to 384 kilobits per second .
but it was n't until recently that consumers could even purchase mobile phones for the super-speed network .
both companies had blamed the slow process on the manufacturers of the handsets , but by the time cebit rolled into hanover with the world 's largest trade fair for information technology in march , several companies were already displaying the next generation in mobile phones .
other umts license holders , such as the netherlands-based e-plus , have decided to hold off on launching their handsets until the big names have paved the rocky road to acceptance .
in the long term , experts say umts will help ease the shortage of mobile phone capacity on the existing networks , and thus help drive down the still relatively high prices of even conventional mobile phones .
but that will only happen when the umts providers have mopped up as much initial premium-price usage as the companies can squeeze out of it . michael lawton -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.05.2004 will germany abolish the draft ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german men may soon be free of mandatory military service .
conscription could soon be scrapped in germany , as the ruling social democrats are reportedly realizing that switching to a professional army as in other nato countries might be a better option . the head of the policy and advisory staff of the german defense ministry , franz borkenhagen surprised members of the social democrat parliamentary fraction when he praised purely professional armies in other nato countries in a paper presented on wednesday . " the affected countries ruled that the intervention capabilities of the troops in foreign deployments had significantly improved , " german daily die welt quoted borkenhagen as saying .
" in general the troops welcomed the abolition of the draft and it even found a wide , positive resonance in society , " borkenhagen added . borkenhagen was addressing a special working group on security policies set up by the social democrats to examine ways to abolish the draft and the possible consequences of such a move . german defense minister peter struck is reportedly familiar with borkenhagen 's paper . pressure to scrap the draft borkenhagen 's findings are expected to add further fuel to a growing political debate in recent years on the future of mandatory military service , a feature of german life since the country was unified under bismarck in 1870 . the green party - the junior partner in the ruling coalition with the social democrats - have long pushed for the elimination of the nine-month conscription .
however , the social democrats led by defense minister struck have repeatedly rejected the calls , saying germany can not afford a professional army before 2010 . in recent months , pressure has increased on the government to abolish the draft .
in january this year an administrative court in cologne overturned the defense ministry 's eligibility rules for conscripts that exempt men who are married , are older than 23 or are found to be only partially fit for military service . the court said the rules violated the principle of fairness because fewer than half of the young men eligible for conscription are actually drafted .
though women have been allowed to serve by choice since 2001 , conscription is all-male with men between the ages of 18 to 45 eligible for nine-month duty . unable to meet modern challenges many also believe that the original aim of conscription - being a sort of citizens ' army to protect the homeland - now looks increasingly outdated in the face of modern military challenges such as global terrorism . germany - which remains one of the last major european countries with mandatory military service - has thus come under increasing pressure from its nato partners to scrap the system .
they consider it inefficient in dealing with crisis intervention and peacekeeping not least because the short duration of the conscription means that conscripts are generally not allowed to participate in combat missions overseas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan in addition , demands on the german army are currently greater than at any time since the second world war .
german troops are involved in more foreign operations than any other country apart from the u.s. , with peacekeeping troops stationed in afghanistan , the balkans and the horn of africa . armed forces undergoing revamp earlier this year , struck unveiled major plans to modernize and trim the armed forces and cut their budget - a move many believe may ultimately spell the end of conscription . struck 's reforms seek to reduce the number of soldiers -lrb- currently about 272,000 -rrb- by around 35,000 .
the new army will include a rapid-deployment force of 35,000 troops to be available for multinational missions , another 70,000 to trained for peacekeeping operations such as the one in afghanistan and the balkans .
he is also reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion . " despite his emphasis on maintaining the draft , he is pursuing a very pragmatic policy , which in reality is moving step by step away from the draft and toward a volunteer army , " winfried nachtwei , a defense expert for the green party said in an interview with news agency dpa earlier this year . abolition not without problems but the dismantling of the draft in germany is also expected to bring its fair share of problems .
young men who reject serving in the military for reasons of conscience are required to do compulsory community service for ten months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german social worker around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
the social democrats , who are set to take a final decision on the future of the draft at a party conference next year , are indicating they 're adopting a pragmatic approach .

conscription could soon be scrapped in germany , as the ruling social democrats are reportedly realizing that switching to a professional army as in other nato countries might be a better option . the head of the policy and advisory staff of the german defense ministry , franz borkenhagen surprised members of the social democrat parliamentary fraction when he praised purely professional armies in other nato countries in a paper presented on wednesday . " the affected countries ruled that the intervention capabilities of the troops in foreign deployments had significantly improved , " german daily die welt quoted borkenhagen as saying .
" in general the troops welcomed the abolition of the draft and it even found a wide , positive resonance in society , " borkenhagen added . borkenhagen was addressing a special working group on security policies set up by the social democrats to examine ways to abolish the draft and the possible consequences of such a move . german defense minister peter struck is reportedly familiar with borkenhagen 's paper . pressure to scrap the draft borkenhagen 's findings are expected to add further fuel to a growing political debate in recent years on the future of mandatory military service , a feature of german life since the country was unified under bismarck in 1870 . the green party - the junior partner in the ruling coalition with the social democrats - have long pushed for the elimination of the nine-month conscription .
however , the social democrats led by defense minister struck have repeatedly rejected the calls , saying germany can not afford a professional army before 2010 . in recent months , pressure has increased on the government to abolish the draft .
in january this year an administrative court in cologne overturned the defense ministry 's eligibility rules for conscripts that exempt men who are married , are older than 23 or are found to be only partially fit for military service . the court said the rules violated the principle of fairness because fewer than half of the young men eligible for conscription are actually drafted .
though women have been allowed to serve by choice since 2001 , conscription is all-male with men between the ages of 18 to 45 eligible for nine-month duty . unable to meet modern challenges many also believe that the original aim of conscription - being a sort of citizens ' army to protect the homeland - now looks increasingly outdated in the face of modern military challenges such as global terrorism . germany - which remains one of the last major european countries with mandatory military service - has thus come under increasing pressure from its nato partners to scrap the system .

stability in the middle east and the fight against terrorism top the agenda at a meeting between eu foreign ministers and representatives from southern mediterranean states in dublin on thursday . just one day after a meeting of the middle east quartet in new york , the israeli and palestinian foreign ministers met face to face on wednesday as they joined a string of fellow ministers from europe and the middle east for high level talks in the irish capital .
israeli foreign minister silvan shalom and his palestinian counterpart nabil shaath were among three dozen ministers visiting the irish capital as part of a two-day euro-mediterranean gathering convened by the european union . the meeting in dublin castle will focus on prospects for bringing peace to the middle east and european relations to the 12 southern mediterranean states .
the event comes at a crucial time for israel and palestine , following on the heels of tuesday 's meeting of the quartet of middle east peace sponsors -lrb- united nations , united states , russia and the eu -rrb- and coming ahead of a summit of the arab league in tunisia later this month .
irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country as the current holder of the eu presidency is playing host to the euro-med conference , acknowledged the difficulties of bringing the two parties together , but said it was important for the peace process in the region .
" we need to use this forum , and there are very few where israeli and arab ministers can sit down and discuss issues , " he told reporters after an informal working dinner wednesday evening .
" we need to ensure that we get these parties together and try to get a ceasefire going .
we need a ceasefire in the middle east to give a chance to these parties to work together , " cowen said on behalf of the eu .
stability crucial for euro-med partnership since the mediterranean dialogue kicked off in barcelona in 1995 , bringing together the 15 countries that then made up the eu with algeria , cyprus , egypt , israel , jordan , lebanon , malta , morocco , the palestinian authority , syria , tunisia and turkey , the conflict in the middle east has been a constant topic of discussion .
diego de ojeda , the spokesman for eu 's external relations commissioner , chris patten , admitted the dispute between israel and the palestinians has been an undeniable " burden " for the forging of the euro-mediterranean partnership , often detracting from the other areas of cooperation .
the barcelona process of bringing europe and the mediterranean states closer together has succeeded primarily in areas not readily apparent in the political restructuring of the middle east , ojeda said .
chief among these are the many projects the eu finances to help build democratic institutions and promote economic development .
the eu has , for example , set up a training center for arab managers , funded youth exchanges , sponsored archeological excavations , renovations of villages and film projects - all at a cost of about a billion euros a year .
critics say that the barcelona process has been progressing too slowly , that it is no nearer to its goal of bringing democracy to north africa and the middle east .
but poul nielson , eu development commissioner , dismisses such criticism .
europe 's politics with regards to its neighbors is based on the principal of equality , he said .
" political and economic reforms can not simply be grafted onto the region .
successful cooperation flourishes only on the foundation of common interests among equal partners . "
common interests since the recent bomb attacks in madrid , istanbul and morocco , and even dating as far back as those in 2002 on the tunisian island of djerba , the threat of an increase in terrorism from extremist islamic circles has pushed the eu and the neighboring mediterranean states into a closer working relationship .
much has been made of the fact that after the train blasts in madrid in march , morocco immediately sent experts to the spanish capital to assist with the investigations .
things were quite different after the terror attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
eu ministers point to the improvement in cooperation as a signal that they are on the right track .
one way to fight extremism at its roots , they argue , is to reduce poverty .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has come out strong in favor of promoting economic ties to north africa to give the people , especially the 40 million youth , a perspective .
in order to do this , the eu has negotiated preferential trade agreements with all the euro-med countries .
whether the goal of establishing a free trade zone for the entire mediterranean region by 2010 will be achieved is still uncertain .
and as for inviting the 12 southern neighbors to join the eu , poul nielson has warned the mediterranean countries not to get their hopes up .
" we 're not closing the door , but we 're also not talking about further enlargement , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels libya is the only north african state not in the euro-mediterranean partnership , but on a trip to brussles last week muammar gadhafi expressed interest in joining .

stability in the middle east and the fight against terrorism top the agenda at a meeting between eu foreign ministers and representatives from southern mediterranean states in dublin on thursday . just one day after a meeting of the middle east quartet in new york , the israeli and palestinian foreign ministers met face to face on wednesday as they joined a string of fellow ministers from europe and the middle east for high level talks in the irish capital .
israeli foreign minister silvan shalom and his palestinian counterpart nabil shaath were among three dozen ministers visiting the irish capital as part of a two-day euro-mediterranean gathering convened by the european union . the meeting in dublin castle will focus on prospects for bringing peace to the middle east and european relations to the 12 southern mediterranean states .
the event comes at a crucial time for israel and palestine , following on the heels of tuesday 's meeting of the quartet of middle east peace sponsors -lrb- united nations , united states , russia and the eu -rrb- and coming ahead of a summit of the arab league in tunisia later this month .
irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country as the current holder of the eu presidency is playing host to the euro-med conference , acknowledged the difficulties of bringing the two parties together , but said it was important for the peace process in the region .
" we need to use this forum , and there are very few where israeli and arab ministers can sit down and discuss issues , " he told reporters after an informal working dinner wednesday evening .
" we need to ensure that we get these parties together and try to get a ceasefire going .
we need a ceasefire in the middle east to give a chance to these parties to work together , " cowen said on behalf of the eu .
stability crucial for euro-med partnership since the mediterranean dialogue kicked off in barcelona in 1995 , bringing together the 15 countries that then made up the eu with algeria , cyprus , egypt , israel , jordan , lebanon , malta , morocco , the palestinian authority , syria , tunisia and turkey , the conflict in the middle east has been a constant topic of discussion .
diego de ojeda , the spokesman for eu 's external relations commissioner , chris patten , admitted the dispute between israel and the palestinians has been an undeniable " burden " for the forging of the euro-mediterranean partnership , often detracting from the other areas of cooperation .
the barcelona process of bringing europe and the mediterranean states closer together has succeeded primarily in areas not readily apparent in the political restructuring of the middle east , ojeda said .
chief among these are the many projects the eu finances to help build democratic institutions and promote economic development .
the eu has , for example , set up a training center for arab managers , funded youth exchanges , sponsored archeological excavations , renovations of villages and film projects - all at a cost of about a billion euros a year .
critics say that the barcelona process has been progressing too slowly , that it is no nearer to its goal of bringing democracy to north africa and the middle east .
but poul nielson , eu development commissioner , dismisses such criticism .
europe 's politics with regards to its neighbors is based on the principal of equality , he said .
" political and economic reforms can not simply be grafted onto the region .
successful cooperation flourishes only on the foundation of common interests among equal partners . "
common interests since the recent bomb attacks in madrid , istanbul and morocco , and even dating as far back as those in 2002 on the tunisian island of djerba , the threat of an increase in terrorism from extremist islamic circles has pushed the eu and the neighboring mediterranean states into a closer working relationship .
much has been made of the fact that after the train blasts in madrid in march , morocco immediately sent experts to the spanish capital to assist with the investigations .
things were quite different after the terror attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
eu ministers point to the improvement in cooperation as a signal that they are on the right track .
one way to fight extremism at its roots , they argue , is to reduce poverty .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has come out strong in favor of promoting economic ties to north africa to give the people , especially the 40 million youth , a perspective .
in order to do this , the eu has negotiated preferential trade agreements with all the euro-med countries .
whether the goal of establishing a free trade zone for the entire mediterranean region by 2010 will be achieved is still uncertain .
and as for inviting the 12 southern neighbors to join the eu , poul nielson has warned the mediterranean countries not to get their hopes up .
" we 're not closing the door , but we 're also not talking about further enlargement , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels libya is the only north african state not in the euro-mediterranean partnership , but on a trip to brussles last week muammar gadhafi expressed interest in joining .
europe pledges economic cooperation for north africa at a meeting of 10 mediterranean countries , europe agreed to boost ties between the wealthier northern states and the poorer south and to help in the fight on terror and stemming the flow of illegal immigration .

the eu has , for example , set up a training center for arab managers , funded youth exchanges , sponsored archeological excavations , renovations of villages and film projects - all at a cost of about a billion euros a year .
critics say that the barcelona process has been progressing too slowly , that it is no nearer to its goal of bringing democracy to north africa and the middle east .
but poul nielson , eu development commissioner , dismisses such criticism .
europe 's politics with regards to its neighbors is based on the principal of equality , he said .
" political and economic reforms can not simply be grafted onto the region .
successful cooperation flourishes only on the foundation of common interests among equal partners . "
common interests since the recent bomb attacks in madrid , istanbul and morocco , and even dating as far back as those in 2002 on the tunisian island of djerba , the threat of an increase in terrorism from extremist islamic circles has pushed the eu and the neighboring mediterranean states into a closer working relationship .
much has been made of the fact that after the train blasts in madrid in march , morocco immediately sent experts to the spanish capital to assist with the investigations .
things were quite different after the terror attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
eu ministers point to the improvement in cooperation as a signal that they are on the right track .
one way to fight extremism at its roots , they argue , is to reduce poverty .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has come out strong in favor of promoting economic ties to north africa to give the people , especially the 40 million youth , a perspective .
in order to do this , the eu has negotiated preferential trade agreements with all the euro-med countries .
whether the goal of establishing a free trade zone for the entire mediterranean region by 2010 will be achieved is still uncertain .
and as for inviting the 12 southern neighbors to join the eu , poul nielson has warned the mediterranean countries not to get their hopes up .
" we 're not closing the door , but we 're also not talking about further enlargement , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels libya is the only north african state not in the euro-mediterranean partnership , but on a trip to brussles last week muammar gadhafi expressed interest in joining .
europe pledges economic cooperation for north africa at a meeting of 10 mediterranean countries , europe agreed to boost ties between the wealthier northern states and the poorer south and to help in the fight on terror and stemming the flow of illegal immigration .

hollywood 's silly season of summer blockbusters kicks of this month with two movies tipped as mega-buck earners leading the way .
it sounds like business as usual until you discover that they 're both directed by germans . cinema audiences are preparing for the opening salvos in the annual battle of the summer blockbusters .
lavish posters boasting megastar actors and trailers promising epic set pieces have already got movie-goers salivating over the " money no object " offerings for this year 's release schedule . however , the first exchanges in the hollywood season will not come from american directors but from two germans who are ready to unleash films depicting global catastrophe and historical warfare onto effect junkies the world over . roland emmerich , no stranger to big budgets and special effects , unleashes the day after tomorrow on a world more than a little aware of the prophetic nature of the stuttgart-born director 's latest apocalyptical vision .
after bringing war-mongering aliens to earth in independence day and unleashing the radioactively-enhanced super lizard godzilla on film fans , the " swabian spielberg " has harnessed the fears of the kyoto generation to bring global warming to the silver screen for a cool € 118.5 million .
the german premiere is in berlin on may 21 . what emmerich attempted to do with aliens and monsters in the past , he now attempts with extreme weather with a film that has got the real-life powers-that-be sweating .
by ignoring the threat of climate change brought on by irresponsible attitudes to environmental damage , the u.s. government portrayed in the day after tomorrow literally reaps a whirlwind . first extreme heat , then tidal waves and snow storms sweep through manhattan and tornadoes destroy los angeles . emmerich calls for a change at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland emmerich .
not content with attaching an environmental message to his latest film , emmerich has even come out and criticized the current u.s. administration on its stance on global warming .
" president bush denies that there is global warming and that we cause this .
i don ’ t understand him , " the director said in a recent interview .
" i hope the americans make a more reasonable choice at the next election and elect democrat candidate john kerry . "
politicians on the left in the united states have spotted an opportunity and championed the film , which opens in the u.s. at the end of this month .
former presidential candidate al gore is already talking up the film , saying : “ millions of people will be coming out of movie theatres asking the question , ’ could this really happen ? ’ ”
meanwhile , voices on the other side of the political fence are offering their own opinions .
a bush spokesman has been quoted in reports as saying : “ people know what they ’ re watching is entertainment , and not grounded in basic scientific fact . ”
however , whether the same can be said about the other german-directed blockbuster is a matter for discussion .
wolfgang peterson 's troy is based on widely accepted historical fact but as with all things hollywood , there will be a certain amount of artistic license involved .
das boot director braves achilles ' heel peterson , born in emden in north germany , is probably best known for his claustrophobic world war ii classic das boot and his " man against the elements " sea spectacular the perfect storm .
this time , apart from the hugely impressive computer generated greek armada scenes in troy , the german director bases his latest epic on dry land - malta , to be precise . # b # the story follows events leading up to the legendary war circa 1200 b.c. which ignites when paris , prince of troy , steals away helen , the much younger wife of menelaus , the king of sparta .
the tribes of greece are then united to attack troy which leads to massive battle scenes , brad pitt in a skirt and , of course , that wooden horse . the film , boasting an impressive a-list cast and a budget of over € 150 million , is expected to be the biggest film of the year .

hollywood 's silly season of summer blockbusters kicks of this month with two movies tipped as mega-buck earners leading the way .
it sounds like business as usual until you discover that they 're both directed by germans . cinema audiences are preparing for the opening salvos in the annual battle of the summer blockbusters .
lavish posters boasting megastar actors and trailers promising epic set pieces have already got movie-goers salivating over the " money no object " offerings for this year 's release schedule . however , the first exchanges in the hollywood season will not come from american directors but from two germans who are ready to unleash films depicting global catastrophe and historical warfare onto effect junkies the world over . roland emmerich , no stranger to big budgets and special effects , unleashes the day after tomorrow on a world more than a little aware of the prophetic nature of the stuttgart-born director 's latest apocalyptical vision .
after bringing war-mongering aliens to earth in independence day and unleashing the radioactively-enhanced super lizard godzilla on film fans , the " swabian spielberg " has harnessed the fears of the kyoto generation to bring global warming to the silver screen for a cool € 118.5 million .
the german premiere is in berlin on may 21 . what emmerich attempted to do with aliens and monsters in the past , he now attempts with extreme weather with a film that has got the real-life powers-that-be sweating .
by ignoring the threat of climate change brought on by irresponsible attitudes to environmental damage , the u.s. government portrayed in the day after tomorrow literally reaps a whirlwind . first extreme heat , then tidal waves and snow storms sweep through manhattan and tornadoes destroy los angeles . emmerich calls for a change at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland emmerich .
not content with attaching an environmental message to his latest film , emmerich has even come out and criticized the current u.s. administration on its stance on global warming .
" president bush denies that there is global warming and that we cause this .
i don ’ t understand him , " the director said in a recent interview .
" i hope the americans make a more reasonable choice at the next election and elect democrat candidate john kerry . "
politicians on the left in the united states have spotted an opportunity and championed the film , which opens in the u.s. at the end of this month .
former presidential candidate al gore is already talking up the film , saying : “ millions of people will be coming out of movie theatres asking the question , ’ could this really happen ? ’ ”
meanwhile , voices on the other side of the political fence are offering their own opinions .
a bush spokesman has been quoted in reports as saying : “ people know what they ’ re watching is entertainment , and not grounded in basic scientific fact . ”
however , whether the same can be said about the other german-directed blockbuster is a matter for discussion .
wolfgang peterson 's troy is based on widely accepted historical fact but as with all things hollywood , there will be a certain amount of artistic license involved .
das boot director braves achilles ' heel peterson , born in emden in north germany , is probably best known for his claustrophobic world war ii classic das boot and his " man against the elements " sea spectacular the perfect storm .
this time , apart from the hugely impressive computer generated greek armada scenes in troy , the german director bases his latest epic on dry land - malta , to be precise . # b # the story follows events leading up to the legendary war circa 1200 b.c. which ignites when paris , prince of troy , steals away helen , the much younger wife of menelaus , the king of sparta .
the tribes of greece are then united to attack troy which leads to massive battle scenes , brad pitt in a skirt and , of course , that wooden horse . the film , boasting an impressive a-list cast and a budget of over € 150 million , is expected to be the biggest film of the year .
it premieres in peterson 's home country on may 9 with many of the stars expected to turn out for the showing in berlin . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to u.s. : cut emissions or face disaster in june , germany will host a global conference on renewable energies .

conscription could soon be scrapped in germany , as the ruling social democrats are reportedly realizing that switching to a professional army as in other nato countries might be a better option . the head of the policy and advisory staff of the german defense ministry , franz borkenhagen surprised members of the social democrat parliamentary fraction when he praised purely professional armies in other nato countries in a paper presented on wednesday . " the affected countries ruled that the intervention capabilities of the troops in foreign deployments had significantly improved , " german daily die welt quoted borkenhagen as saying .
" in general the troops welcomed the abolition of the draft and it even found a wide , positive resonance in society , " borkenhagen added . borkenhagen was addressing a special working group on security policies set up by the social democrats to examine ways to abolish the draft and the possible consequences of such a move . german defense minister peter struck is reportedly familiar with borkenhagen 's paper . pressure to scrap the draft borkenhagen 's findings are expected to add further fuel to a growing political debate in recent years on the future of mandatory military service , a feature of german life since the country was unified under bismarck in 1870 . the green party - the junior partner in the ruling coalition with the social democrats - have long pushed for the elimination of the nine-month conscription .
however , the social democrats led by defense minister struck have repeatedly rejected the calls , saying germany can not afford a professional army before 2010 . in recent months , pressure has increased on the government to abolish the draft .
in january this year an administrative court in cologne overturned the defense ministry 's eligibility rules for conscripts that exempt men who are married , are older than 23 or are found to be only partially fit for military service . the court said the rules violated the principle of fairness because fewer than half of the young men eligible for conscription are actually drafted .
though women have been allowed to serve by choice since 2001 , conscription is all-male with men between the ages of 18 to 45 eligible for nine-month duty . unable to meet modern challenges many also believe that the original aim of conscription - being a sort of citizens ' army to protect the homeland - now looks increasingly outdated in the face of modern military challenges such as global terrorism . germany - which remains one of the last major european countries with mandatory military service - has thus come under increasing pressure from its nato partners to scrap the system .

" despite his emphasis on maintaining the draft , he is pursuing a very pragmatic policy , which in reality is moving step by step away from the draft and toward a volunteer army , " winfried nachtwei , a defense expert for the green party said in an interview with news agency dpa earlier this year . abolition not without problems but the dismantling of the draft in germany is also expected to bring its fair share of problems .

charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
the social democrats , who are set to take a final decision on the future of the draft at a party conference next year , are indicating they 're adopting a pragmatic approach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.05.2004 third generation mobile phones arrive in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodafone deutschland head jürgen von kuczkowski shows off his company 's new do-it-all phone .
it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany . they take pictures , surf the web , send music and video clips - and they still fit in the palm of your hand and make telephone calls .
the long-awaited handsets for the new third generation of mobile phone systems are going on sale throughout germany starting this week .
but the mood on the market is a very different one from the euphoria when the big telecommunication companies first bought the rights to develop the new technology .
transmitting data at seven times the speed of the current mobile phone networks , the new universal mobile telecommunications system or umts promised to usher in a new age in mobile multimedia connectivity when it was launched back in 2000 .
at the time , people might have thought the 8.5 billion euros the participating telecommunications companies had to pay the government for access to the new networks was a bit steep .
but it was generally thought that the new mobile technology boom would go on for ever and the money was a good investment .
now that giant sum seems like a miscalculation .
deadlines for building up the network have come and gone , development of umts handsets were put on the back burner , and one provider - mobilcom - got out of the licensing altogether .
the deadline for offering the technology to the public was 2003 , but none of the german providers stuck to that date , and to make matters worse , the network does n't reach outside many urban areas yet .
the two big companies with a stake in the german market , british-based vodafone and the homegrown t-mobile , have only spent about a fifth of what the networks originally cost on developing technology for the new system .
for t-mobile , which is just beginning to bring out their own handsets , the investment in umts has ended up being an extensive endeavor .
in the first years after purchasing the license , the german telecommunications giant reported its biggest-ever losses and pointed the finger directly at the new network technology .
slow market reception it 's unlikely that umts will turn into a gold mine any time soon , despite all the clever things the new technology promises .
as with every new technology , there will only be a few early adaptors , who are prepared to pay the high price - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many will go after the new phones ? about 300 euros - and hefty connection charges for the thrill of possessing the latest gadget .
it will still take a while before the third-generation phones make their way into the pockets of mainstream german consumers , say many observers .
vodafone , the market leader , came out with the samsung z105 mobile video phone and t-mobile , deutsche telekom 's mobile offshoot and the perennial runner-up in the market , decided to follow up with the futuristic nokia 7600 music clip mobile .
back in february , vodafone had already beaten t-mobile in the race by introducing a card for a laptop computer which would allow people to transmit data at umts speeds of up to 384 kilobits per second .
but it was n't until recently that consumers could even purchase mobile phones for the super-speed network .
both companies had blamed the slow process on the manufacturers of the handsets , but by the time cebit rolled into hanover with the world 's largest trade fair for information technology in march , several companies were already displaying the next generation in mobile phones .
other umts license holders , such as the netherlands-based e-plus , have decided to hold off on launching their handsets until the big names have paved the rocky road to acceptance .
in the long term , experts say umts will help ease the shortage of mobile phone capacity on the existing networks , and thus help drive down the still relatively high prices of even conventional mobile phones .
but that will only happen when the umts providers have mopped up as much initial premium-price usage as the companies can squeeze out of it . michael lawton -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service .

conscription could soon be scrapped in germany , as the ruling social democrats are reportedly realizing that switching to a professional army as in other nato countries might be a better option . the head of the policy and advisory staff of the german defense ministry , franz borkenhagen surprised members of the social democrat parliamentary fraction when he praised purely professional armies in other nato countries in a paper presented on wednesday . " the affected countries ruled that the intervention capabilities of the troops in foreign deployments had significantly improved , " german daily die welt quoted borkenhagen as saying .
" in general the troops welcomed the abolition of the draft and it even found a wide , positive resonance in society , " borkenhagen added . borkenhagen was addressing a special working group on security policies set up by the social democrats to examine ways to abolish the draft and the possible consequences of such a move . german defense minister peter struck is reportedly familiar with borkenhagen 's paper . pressure to scrap the draft borkenhagen 's findings are expected to add further fuel to a growing political debate in recent years on the future of mandatory military service , a feature of german life since the country was unified under bismarck in 1870 . the green party - the junior partner in the ruling coalition with the social democrats - have long pushed for the elimination of the nine-month conscription .
however , the social democrats led by defense minister struck have repeatedly rejected the calls , saying germany can not afford a professional army before 2010 . in recent months , pressure has increased on the government to abolish the draft .
in january this year an administrative court in cologne overturned the defense ministry 's eligibility rules for conscripts that exempt men who are married , are older than 23 or are found to be only partially fit for military service . the court said the rules violated the principle of fairness because fewer than half of the young men eligible for conscription are actually drafted .

stability in the middle east and the fight against terrorism top the agenda at a meeting between eu foreign ministers and representatives from southern mediterranean states in dublin on thursday . just one day after a meeting of the middle east quartet in new york , the israeli and palestinian foreign ministers met face to face on wednesday as they joined a string of fellow ministers from europe and the middle east for high level talks in the irish capital .
israeli foreign minister silvan shalom and his palestinian counterpart nabil shaath were among three dozen ministers visiting the irish capital as part of a two-day euro-mediterranean gathering convened by the european union . the meeting in dublin castle will focus on prospects for bringing peace to the middle east and european relations to the 12 southern mediterranean states .
the event comes at a crucial time for israel and palestine , following on the heels of tuesday 's meeting of the quartet of middle east peace sponsors -lrb- united nations , united states , russia and the eu -rrb- and coming ahead of a summit of the arab league in tunisia later this month .
irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country as the current holder of the eu presidency is playing host to the euro-med conference , acknowledged the difficulties of bringing the two parties together , but said it was important for the peace process in the region .
" we need to use this forum , and there are very few where israeli and arab ministers can sit down and discuss issues , " he told reporters after an informal working dinner wednesday evening .
" we need to ensure that we get these parties together and try to get a ceasefire going .
we need a ceasefire in the middle east to give a chance to these parties to work together , " cowen said on behalf of the eu .
stability crucial for euro-med partnership since the mediterranean dialogue kicked off in barcelona in 1995 , bringing together the 15 countries that then made up the eu with algeria , cyprus , egypt , israel , jordan , lebanon , malta , morocco , the palestinian authority , syria , tunisia and turkey , the conflict in the middle east has been a constant topic of discussion .
diego de ojeda , the spokesman for eu 's external relations commissioner , chris patten , admitted the dispute between israel and the palestinians has been an undeniable " burden " for the forging of the euro-mediterranean partnership , often detracting from the other areas of cooperation .
the barcelona process of bringing europe and the mediterranean states closer together has succeeded primarily in areas not readily apparent in the political restructuring of the middle east , ojeda said .
chief among these are the many projects the eu finances to help build democratic institutions and promote economic development .
the eu has , for example , set up a training center for arab managers , funded youth exchanges , sponsored archeological excavations , renovations of villages and film projects - all at a cost of about a billion euros a year .
critics say that the barcelona process has been progressing too slowly , that it is no nearer to its goal of bringing democracy to north africa and the middle east .
but poul nielson , eu development commissioner , dismisses such criticism .
europe 's politics with regards to its neighbors is based on the principal of equality , he said .
" political and economic reforms can not simply be grafted onto the region .
successful cooperation flourishes only on the foundation of common interests among equal partners . "
common interests since the recent bomb attacks in madrid , istanbul and morocco , and even dating as far back as those in 2002 on the tunisian island of djerba , the threat of an increase in terrorism from extremist islamic circles has pushed the eu and the neighboring mediterranean states into a closer working relationship .
much has been made of the fact that after the train blasts in madrid in march , morocco immediately sent experts to the spanish capital to assist with the investigations .
things were quite different after the terror attacks in the united states on sept .

eu ministers point to the improvement in cooperation as a signal that they are on the right track .
one way to fight extremism at its roots , they argue , is to reduce poverty .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has come out strong in favor of promoting economic ties to north africa to give the people , especially the 40 million youth , a perspective .
in order to do this , the eu has negotiated preferential trade agreements with all the euro-med countries .
whether the goal of establishing a free trade zone for the entire mediterranean region by 2010 will be achieved is still uncertain .
and as for inviting the 12 southern neighbors to join the eu , poul nielson has warned the mediterranean countries not to get their hopes up .

stability in the middle east and the fight against terrorism top the agenda at a meeting between eu foreign ministers and representatives from southern mediterranean states in dublin on thursday . just one day after a meeting of the middle east quartet in new york , the israeli and palestinian foreign ministers met face to face on wednesday as they joined a string of fellow ministers from europe and the middle east for high level talks in the irish capital .
israeli foreign minister silvan shalom and his palestinian counterpart nabil shaath were among three dozen ministers visiting the irish capital as part of a two-day euro-mediterranean gathering convened by the european union . the meeting in dublin castle will focus on prospects for bringing peace to the middle east and european relations to the 12 southern mediterranean states .
the event comes at a crucial time for israel and palestine , following on the heels of tuesday 's meeting of the quartet of middle east peace sponsors -lrb- united nations , united states , russia and the eu -rrb- and coming ahead of a summit of the arab league in tunisia later this month .
irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country as the current holder of the eu presidency is playing host to the euro-med conference , acknowledged the difficulties of bringing the two parties together , but said it was important for the peace process in the region .
" we need to use this forum , and there are very few where israeli and arab ministers can sit down and discuss issues , " he told reporters after an informal working dinner wednesday evening .
" we need to ensure that we get these parties together and try to get a ceasefire going .
we need a ceasefire in the middle east to give a chance to these parties to work together , " cowen said on behalf of the eu .
stability crucial for euro-med partnership since the mediterranean dialogue kicked off in barcelona in 1995 , bringing together the 15 countries that then made up the eu with algeria , cyprus , egypt , israel , jordan , lebanon , malta , morocco , the palestinian authority , syria , tunisia and turkey , the conflict in the middle east has been a constant topic of discussion .
diego de ojeda , the spokesman for eu 's external relations commissioner , chris patten , admitted the dispute between israel and the palestinians has been an undeniable " burden " for the forging of the euro-mediterranean partnership , often detracting from the other areas of cooperation .
the barcelona process of bringing europe and the mediterranean states closer together has succeeded primarily in areas not readily apparent in the political restructuring of the middle east , ojeda said .
chief among these are the many projects the eu finances to help build democratic institutions and promote economic development .
the eu has , for example , set up a training center for arab managers , funded youth exchanges , sponsored archeological excavations , renovations of villages and film projects - all at a cost of about a billion euros a year .
critics say that the barcelona process has been progressing too slowly , that it is no nearer to its goal of bringing democracy to north africa and the middle east .
but poul nielson , eu development commissioner , dismisses such criticism .
europe 's politics with regards to its neighbors is based on the principal of equality , he said .

it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany . they take pictures , surf the web , send music and video clips - and they still fit in the palm of your hand and make telephone calls .
the long-awaited handsets for the new third generation of mobile phone systems are going on sale throughout germany starting this week .
but the mood on the market is a very different one from the euphoria when the big telecommunication companies first bought the rights to develop the new technology .
transmitting data at seven times the speed of the current mobile phone networks , the new universal mobile telecommunications system or umts promised to usher in a new age in mobile multimedia connectivity when it was launched back in 2000 .
at the time , people might have thought the 8.5 billion euros the participating telecommunications companies had to pay the government for access to the new networks was a bit steep .
but it was generally thought that the new mobile technology boom would go on for ever and the money was a good investment .
now that giant sum seems like a miscalculation .
deadlines for building up the network have come and gone , development of umts handsets were put on the back burner , and one provider - mobilcom - got out of the licensing altogether .
the deadline for offering the technology to the public was 2003 , but none of the german providers stuck to that date , and to make matters worse , the network does n't reach outside many urban areas yet .
the two big companies with a stake in the german market , british-based vodafone and the homegrown t-mobile , have only spent about a fifth of what the networks originally cost on developing technology for the new system .
for t-mobile , which is just beginning to bring out their own handsets , the investment in umts has ended up being an extensive endeavor .
in the first years after purchasing the license , the german telecommunications giant reported its biggest-ever losses and pointed the finger directly at the new network technology .
slow market reception it 's unlikely that umts will turn into a gold mine any time soon , despite all the clever things the new technology promises .
as with every new technology , there will only be a few early adaptors , who are prepared to pay the high price - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many will go after the new phones ? about 300 euros - and hefty connection charges for the thrill of possessing the latest gadget .
it will still take a while before the third-generation phones make their way into the pockets of mainstream german consumers , say many observers .
vodafone , the market leader , came out with the samsung z105 mobile video phone and t-mobile , deutsche telekom 's mobile offshoot and the perennial runner-up in the market , decided to follow up with the futuristic nokia 7600 music clip mobile .
back in february , vodafone had already beaten t-mobile in the race by introducing a card for a laptop computer which would allow people to transmit data at umts speeds of up to 384 kilobits per second .
but it was n't until recently that consumers could even purchase mobile phones for the super-speed network .
both companies had blamed the slow process on the manufacturers of the handsets , but by the time cebit rolled into hanover with the world 's largest trade fair for information technology in march , several companies were already displaying the next generation in mobile phones .
other umts license holders , such as the netherlands-based e-plus , have decided to hold off on launching their handsets until the big names have paved the rocky road to acceptance .
in the long term , experts say umts will help ease the shortage of mobile phone capacity on the existing networks , and thus help drive down the still relatively high prices of even conventional mobile phones .
but that will only happen when the umts providers have mopped up as much initial premium-price usage as the companies can squeeze out of it . michael lawton -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service .

it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany . they take pictures , surf the web , send music and video clips - and they still fit in the palm of your hand and make telephone calls .
the long-awaited handsets for the new third generation of mobile phone systems are going on sale throughout germany starting this week .
but the mood on the market is a very different one from the euphoria when the big telecommunication companies first bought the rights to develop the new technology .
transmitting data at seven times the speed of the current mobile phone networks , the new universal mobile telecommunications system or umts promised to usher in a new age in mobile multimedia connectivity when it was launched back in 2000 .
at the time , people might have thought the 8.5 billion euros the participating telecommunications companies had to pay the government for access to the new networks was a bit steep .
but it was generally thought that the new mobile technology boom would go on for ever and the money was a good investment .
now that giant sum seems like a miscalculation .
deadlines for building up the network have come and gone , development of umts handsets were put on the back burner , and one provider - mobilcom - got out of the licensing altogether .
the deadline for offering the technology to the public was 2003 , but none of the german providers stuck to that date , and to make matters worse , the network does n't reach outside many urban areas yet .
the two big companies with a stake in the german market , british-based vodafone and the homegrown t-mobile , have only spent about a fifth of what the networks originally cost on developing technology for the new system .
for t-mobile , which is just beginning to bring out their own handsets , the investment in umts has ended up being an extensive endeavor .
in the first years after purchasing the license , the german telecommunications giant reported its biggest-ever losses and pointed the finger directly at the new network technology .
slow market reception it 's unlikely that umts will turn into a gold mine any time soon , despite all the clever things the new technology promises .
as with every new technology , there will only be a few early adaptors , who are prepared to pay the high price - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many will go after the new phones ? about 300 euros - and hefty connection charges for the thrill of possessing the latest gadget .
it will still take a while before the third-generation phones make their way into the pockets of mainstream german consumers , say many observers .
vodafone , the market leader , came out with the samsung z105 mobile video phone and t-mobile , deutsche telekom 's mobile offshoot and the perennial runner-up in the market , decided to follow up with the futuristic nokia 7600 music clip mobile .
back in february , vodafone had already beaten t-mobile in the race by introducing a card for a laptop computer which would allow people to transmit data at umts speeds of up to 384 kilobits per second .
but it was n't until recently that consumers could even purchase mobile phones for the super-speed network .
both companies had blamed the slow process on the manufacturers of the handsets , but by the time cebit rolled into hanover with the world 's largest trade fair for information technology in march , several companies were already displaying the next generation in mobile phones .
other umts license holders , such as the netherlands-based e-plus , have decided to hold off on launching their handsets until the big names have paved the rocky road to acceptance .
in the long term , experts say umts will help ease the shortage of mobile phone capacity on the existing networks , and thus help drive down the still relatively high prices of even conventional mobile phones .
but that will only happen when the umts providers have mopped up as much initial premium-price usage as the companies can squeeze out of it . michael lawton -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service .

hollywood 's silly season of summer blockbusters kicks of this month with two movies tipped as mega-buck earners leading the way .
it sounds like business as usual until you discover that they 're both directed by germans . cinema audiences are preparing for the opening salvos in the annual battle of the summer blockbusters .
lavish posters boasting megastar actors and trailers promising epic set pieces have already got movie-goers salivating over the " money no object " offerings for this year 's release schedule . however , the first exchanges in the hollywood season will not come from american directors but from two germans who are ready to unleash films depicting global catastrophe and historical warfare onto effect junkies the world over . roland emmerich , no stranger to big budgets and special effects , unleashes the day after tomorrow on a world more than a little aware of the prophetic nature of the stuttgart-born director 's latest apocalyptical vision .
after bringing war-mongering aliens to earth in independence day and unleashing the radioactively-enhanced super lizard godzilla on film fans , the " swabian spielberg " has harnessed the fears of the kyoto generation to bring global warming to the silver screen for a cool € 118.5 million .
the german premiere is in berlin on may 21 . what emmerich attempted to do with aliens and monsters in the past , he now attempts with extreme weather with a film that has got the real-life powers-that-be sweating .
by ignoring the threat of climate change brought on by irresponsible attitudes to environmental damage , the u.s. government portrayed in the day after tomorrow literally reaps a whirlwind . first extreme heat , then tidal waves and snow storms sweep through manhattan and tornadoes destroy los angeles . emmerich calls for a change at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland emmerich .
not content with attaching an environmental message to his latest film , emmerich has even come out and criticized the current u.s. administration on its stance on global warming .
" president bush denies that there is global warming and that we cause this .
i don ’ t understand him , " the director said in a recent interview .
" i hope the americans make a more reasonable choice at the next election and elect democrat candidate john kerry . "
politicians on the left in the united states have spotted an opportunity and championed the film , which opens in the u.s. at the end of this month .
former presidential candidate al gore is already talking up the film , saying : “ millions of people will be coming out of movie theatres asking the question , ’ could this really happen ? ’ ”
meanwhile , voices on the other side of the political fence are offering their own opinions .
a bush spokesman has been quoted in reports as saying : “ people know what they ’ re watching is entertainment , and not grounded in basic scientific fact . ”
however , whether the same can be said about the other german-directed blockbuster is a matter for discussion .
wolfgang peterson 's troy is based on widely accepted historical fact but as with all things hollywood , there will be a certain amount of artistic license involved .
das boot director braves achilles ' heel peterson , born in emden in north germany , is probably best known for his claustrophobic world war ii classic das boot and his " man against the elements " sea spectacular the perfect storm .
this time , apart from the hugely impressive computer generated greek armada scenes in troy , the german director bases his latest epic on dry land - malta , to be precise . # b # the story follows events leading up to the legendary war circa 1200 b.c. which ignites when paris , prince of troy , steals away helen , the much younger wife of menelaus , the king of sparta .
the tribes of greece are then united to attack troy which leads to massive battle scenes , brad pitt in a skirt and , of course , that wooden horse . the film , boasting an impressive a-list cast and a budget of over € 150 million , is expected to be the biggest film of the year .
it premieres in peterson 's home country on may 9 with many of the stars expected to turn out for the showing in berlin . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to u.s. : cut emissions or face disaster in june , germany will host a global conference on renewable energies .

hollywood 's silly season of summer blockbusters kicks of this month with two movies tipped as mega-buck earners leading the way .
it sounds like business as usual until you discover that they 're both directed by germans . cinema audiences are preparing for the opening salvos in the annual battle of the summer blockbusters .
lavish posters boasting megastar actors and trailers promising epic set pieces have already got movie-goers salivating over the " money no object " offerings for this year 's release schedule . however , the first exchanges in the hollywood season will not come from american directors but from two germans who are ready to unleash films depicting global catastrophe and historical warfare onto effect junkies the world over . roland emmerich , no stranger to big budgets and special effects , unleashes the day after tomorrow on a world more than a little aware of the prophetic nature of the stuttgart-born director 's latest apocalyptical vision .
after bringing war-mongering aliens to earth in independence day and unleashing the radioactively-enhanced super lizard godzilla on film fans , the " swabian spielberg " has harnessed the fears of the kyoto generation to bring global warming to the silver screen for a cool € 118.5 million .
the german premiere is in berlin on may 21 . what emmerich attempted to do with aliens and monsters in the past , he now attempts with extreme weather with a film that has got the real-life powers-that-be sweating .
by ignoring the threat of climate change brought on by irresponsible attitudes to environmental damage , the u.s. government portrayed in the day after tomorrow literally reaps a whirlwind . first extreme heat , then tidal waves and snow storms sweep through manhattan and tornadoes destroy los angeles . emmerich calls for a change at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland emmerich .
not content with attaching an environmental message to his latest film , emmerich has even come out and criticized the current u.s. administration on its stance on global warming .
" president bush denies that there is global warming and that we cause this .
i don ’ t understand him , " the director said in a recent interview .
" i hope the americans make a more reasonable choice at the next election and elect democrat candidate john kerry . "
politicians on the left in the united states have spotted an opportunity and championed the film , which opens in the u.s. at the end of this month .
former presidential candidate al gore is already talking up the film , saying : “ millions of people will be coming out of movie theatres asking the question , ’ could this really happen ? ’ ”
meanwhile , voices on the other side of the political fence are offering their own opinions .
a bush spokesman has been quoted in reports as saying : “ people know what they ’ re watching is entertainment , and not grounded in basic scientific fact . ”
however , whether the same can be said about the other german-directed blockbuster is a matter for discussion .
wolfgang peterson 's troy is based on widely accepted historical fact but as with all things hollywood , there will be a certain amount of artistic license involved .
das boot director braves achilles ' heel peterson , born in emden in north germany , is probably best known for his claustrophobic world war ii classic das boot and his " man against the elements " sea spectacular the perfect storm .
this time , apart from the hugely impressive computer generated greek armada scenes in troy , the german director bases his latest epic on dry land - malta , to be precise . # b # the story follows events leading up to the legendary war circa 1200 b.c. which ignites when paris , prince of troy , steals away helen , the much younger wife of menelaus , the king of sparta .
the tribes of greece are then united to attack troy which leads to massive battle scenes , brad pitt in a skirt and , of course , that wooden horse . the film , boasting an impressive a-list cast and a budget of over € 150 million , is expected to be the biggest film of the year .

das boot director braves achilles ' heel peterson , born in emden in north germany , is probably best known for his claustrophobic world war ii classic das boot and his " man against the elements " sea spectacular the perfect storm .
this time , apart from the hugely impressive computer generated greek armada scenes in troy , the german director bases his latest epic on dry land - malta , to be precise . # b # the story follows events leading up to the legendary war circa 1200 b.c. which ignites when paris , prince of troy , steals away helen , the much younger wife of menelaus , the king of sparta .
the tribes of greece are then united to attack troy which leads to massive battle scenes , brad pitt in a skirt and , of course , that wooden horse . the film , boasting an impressive a-list cast and a budget of over € 150 million , is expected to be the biggest film of the year .
it premieres in peterson 's home country on may 9 with many of the stars expected to turn out for the showing in berlin . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to u.s. : cut emissions or face disaster in june , germany will host a global conference on renewable energies .

conscription could soon be scrapped in germany , as the ruling social democrats are reportedly realizing that switching to a professional army as in other nato countries might be a better option . the head of the policy and advisory staff of the german defense ministry , franz borkenhagen surprised members of the social democrat parliamentary fraction when he praised purely professional armies in other nato countries in a paper presented on wednesday . " the affected countries ruled that the intervention capabilities of the troops in foreign deployments had significantly improved , " german daily die welt quoted borkenhagen as saying .
" in general the troops welcomed the abolition of the draft and it even found a wide , positive resonance in society , " borkenhagen added . borkenhagen was addressing a special working group on security policies set up by the social democrats to examine ways to abolish the draft and the possible consequences of such a move . german defense minister peter struck is reportedly familiar with borkenhagen 's paper . pressure to scrap the draft borkenhagen 's findings are expected to add further fuel to a growing political debate in recent years on the future of mandatory military service , a feature of german life since the country was unified under bismarck in 1870 . the green party - the junior partner in the ruling coalition with the social democrats - have long pushed for the elimination of the nine-month conscription .
however , the social democrats led by defense minister struck have repeatedly rejected the calls , saying germany can not afford a professional army before 2010 . in recent months , pressure has increased on the government to abolish the draft .
in january this year an administrative court in cologne overturned the defense ministry 's eligibility rules for conscripts that exempt men who are married , are older than 23 or are found to be only partially fit for military service . the court said the rules violated the principle of fairness because fewer than half of the young men eligible for conscription are actually drafted .
though women have been allowed to serve by choice since 2001 , conscription is all-male with men between the ages of 18 to 45 eligible for nine-month duty . unable to meet modern challenges many also believe that the original aim of conscription - being a sort of citizens ' army to protect the homeland - now looks increasingly outdated in the face of modern military challenges such as global terrorism . germany - which remains one of the last major european countries with mandatory military service - has thus come under increasing pressure from its nato partners to scrap the system .
they consider it inefficient in dealing with crisis intervention and peacekeeping not least because the short duration of the conscription means that conscripts are generally not allowed to participate in combat missions overseas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan in addition , demands on the german army are currently greater than at any time since the second world war .
german troops are involved in more foreign operations than any other country apart from the u.s. , with peacekeeping troops stationed in afghanistan , the balkans and the horn of africa . armed forces undergoing revamp earlier this year , struck unveiled major plans to modernize and trim the armed forces and cut their budget - a move many believe may ultimately spell the end of conscription . struck 's reforms seek to reduce the number of soldiers -lrb- currently about 272,000 -rrb- by around 35,000 .
the new army will include a rapid-deployment force of 35,000 troops to be available for multinational missions , another 70,000 to trained for peacekeeping operations such as the one in afghanistan and the balkans .
he is also reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion . " despite his emphasis on maintaining the draft , he is pursuing a very pragmatic policy , which in reality is moving step by step away from the draft and toward a volunteer army , " winfried nachtwei , a defense expert for the green party said in an interview with news agency dpa earlier this year . abolition not without problems but the dismantling of the draft in germany is also expected to bring its fair share of problems .
young men who reject serving in the military for reasons of conscience are required to do compulsory community service for ten months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german social worker around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
the social democrats , who are set to take a final decision on the future of the draft at a party conference next year , are indicating they 're adopting a pragmatic approach .
" the working group on security policies is still of the view that conscription is the better decision for the armed forces and our society , " rainer arnold of defense spokesman of the social democratic parliamentary group told die welt .

it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany . they take pictures , surf the web , send music and video clips - and they still fit in the palm of your hand and make telephone calls .
the long-awaited handsets for the new third generation of mobile phone systems are going on sale throughout germany starting this week .
but the mood on the market is a very different one from the euphoria when the big telecommunication companies first bought the rights to develop the new technology .
transmitting data at seven times the speed of the current mobile phone networks , the new universal mobile telecommunications system or umts promised to usher in a new age in mobile multimedia connectivity when it was launched back in 2000 .
at the time , people might have thought the 8.5 billion euros the participating telecommunications companies had to pay the government for access to the new networks was a bit steep .
but it was generally thought that the new mobile technology boom would go on for ever and the money was a good investment .
now that giant sum seems like a miscalculation .
deadlines for building up the network have come and gone , development of umts handsets were put on the back burner , and one provider - mobilcom - got out of the licensing altogether .
the deadline for offering the technology to the public was 2003 , but none of the german providers stuck to that date , and to make matters worse , the network does n't reach outside many urban areas yet .
the two big companies with a stake in the german market , british-based vodafone and the homegrown t-mobile , have only spent about a fifth of what the networks originally cost on developing technology for the new system .
for t-mobile , which is just beginning to bring out their own handsets , the investment in umts has ended up being an extensive endeavor .
in the first years after purchasing the license , the german telecommunications giant reported its biggest-ever losses and pointed the finger directly at the new network technology .
slow market reception it 's unlikely that umts will turn into a gold mine any time soon , despite all the clever things the new technology promises .
as with every new technology , there will only be a few early adaptors , who are prepared to pay the high price - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many will go after the new phones ? about 300 euros - and hefty connection charges for the thrill of possessing the latest gadget .
it will still take a while before the third-generation phones make their way into the pockets of mainstream german consumers , say many observers .
vodafone , the market leader , came out with the samsung z105 mobile video phone and t-mobile , deutsche telekom 's mobile offshoot and the perennial runner-up in the market , decided to follow up with the futuristic nokia 7600 music clip mobile .
back in february , vodafone had already beaten t-mobile in the race by introducing a card for a laptop computer which would allow people to transmit data at umts speeds of up to 384 kilobits per second .
but it was n't until recently that consumers could even purchase mobile phones for the super-speed network .
both companies had blamed the slow process on the manufacturers of the handsets , but by the time cebit rolled into hanover with the world 's largest trade fair for information technology in march , several companies were already displaying the next generation in mobile phones .
other umts license holders , such as the netherlands-based e-plus , have decided to hold off on launching their handsets until the big names have paved the rocky road to acceptance .
in the long term , experts say umts will help ease the shortage of mobile phone capacity on the existing networks , and thus help drive down the still relatively high prices of even conventional mobile phones .
but that will only happen when the umts providers have mopped up as much initial premium-price usage as the companies can squeeze out of it . michael lawton -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .

it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany . they take pictures , surf the web , send music and video clips - and they still fit in the palm of your hand and make telephone calls .
the long-awaited handsets for the new third generation of mobile phone systems are going on sale throughout germany starting this week .
but the mood on the market is a very different one from the euphoria when the big telecommunication companies first bought the rights to develop the new technology .
transmitting data at seven times the speed of the current mobile phone networks , the new universal mobile telecommunications system or umts promised to usher in a new age in mobile multimedia connectivity when it was launched back in 2000 .
at the time , people might have thought the 8.5 billion euros the participating telecommunications companies had to pay the government for access to the new networks was a bit steep .
but it was generally thought that the new mobile technology boom would go on for ever and the money was a good investment .
now that giant sum seems like a miscalculation .
deadlines for building up the network have come and gone , development of umts handsets were put on the back burner , and one provider - mobilcom - got out of the licensing altogether .
the deadline for offering the technology to the public was 2003 , but none of the german providers stuck to that date , and to make matters worse , the network does n't reach outside many urban areas yet .
the two big companies with a stake in the german market , british-based vodafone and the homegrown t-mobile , have only spent about a fifth of what the networks originally cost on developing technology for the new system .
for t-mobile , which is just beginning to bring out their own handsets , the investment in umts has ended up being an extensive endeavor .
in the first years after purchasing the license , the german telecommunications giant reported its biggest-ever losses and pointed the finger directly at the new network technology .
slow market reception it 's unlikely that umts will turn into a gold mine any time soon , despite all the clever things the new technology promises .
as with every new technology , there will only be a few early adaptors , who are prepared to pay the high price - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many will go after the new phones ? about 300 euros - and hefty connection charges for the thrill of possessing the latest gadget .
it will still take a while before the third-generation phones make their way into the pockets of mainstream german consumers , say many observers .
vodafone , the market leader , came out with the samsung z105 mobile video phone and t-mobile , deutsche telekom 's mobile offshoot and the perennial runner-up in the market , decided to follow up with the futuristic nokia 7600 music clip mobile .
back in february , vodafone had already beaten t-mobile in the race by introducing a card for a laptop computer which would allow people to transmit data at umts speeds of up to 384 kilobits per second .
but it was n't until recently that consumers could even purchase mobile phones for the super-speed network .
both companies had blamed the slow process on the manufacturers of the handsets , but by the time cebit rolled into hanover with the world 's largest trade fair for information technology in march , several companies were already displaying the next generation in mobile phones .
other umts license holders , such as the netherlands-based e-plus , have decided to hold off on launching their handsets until the big names have paved the rocky road to acceptance .
in the long term , experts say umts will help ease the shortage of mobile phone capacity on the existing networks , and thus help drive down the still relatively high prices of even conventional mobile phones .

back in february , vodafone had already beaten t-mobile in the race by introducing a card for a laptop computer which would allow people to transmit data at umts speeds of up to 384 kilobits per second .
but it was n't until recently that consumers could even purchase mobile phones for the super-speed network .
both companies had blamed the slow process on the manufacturers of the handsets , but by the time cebit rolled into hanover with the world 's largest trade fair for information technology in march , several companies were already displaying the next generation in mobile phones .

in the long term , experts say umts will help ease the shortage of mobile phone capacity on the existing networks , and thus help drive down the still relatively high prices of even conventional mobile phones .

it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany . they take pictures , surf the web , send music and video clips - and they still fit in the palm of your hand and make telephone calls .
the long-awaited handsets for the new third generation of mobile phone systems are going on sale throughout germany starting this week .
but the mood on the market is a very different one from the euphoria when the big telecommunication companies first bought the rights to develop the new technology .
transmitting data at seven times the speed of the current mobile phone networks , the new universal mobile telecommunications system or umts promised to usher in a new age in mobile multimedia connectivity when it was launched back in 2000 .
at the time , people might have thought the 8.5 billion euros the participating telecommunications companies had to pay the government for access to the new networks was a bit steep .
but it was generally thought that the new mobile technology boom would go on for ever and the money was a good investment .
now that giant sum seems like a miscalculation .
deadlines for building up the network have come and gone , development of umts handsets were put on the back burner , and one provider - mobilcom - got out of the licensing altogether .
the deadline for offering the technology to the public was 2003 , but none of the german providers stuck to that date , and to make matters worse , the network does n't reach outside many urban areas yet .
the two big companies with a stake in the german market , british-based vodafone and the homegrown t-mobile , have only spent about a fifth of what the networks originally cost on developing technology for the new system .
for t-mobile , which is just beginning to bring out their own handsets , the investment in umts has ended up being an extensive endeavor .
in the first years after purchasing the license , the german telecommunications giant reported its biggest-ever losses and pointed the finger directly at the new network technology .

hollywood 's silly season of summer blockbusters kicks of this month with two movies tipped as mega-buck earners leading the way .
it sounds like business as usual until you discover that they 're both directed by germans . cinema audiences are preparing for the opening salvos in the annual battle of the summer blockbusters .
lavish posters boasting megastar actors and trailers promising epic set pieces have already got movie-goers salivating over the " money no object " offerings for this year 's release schedule . however , the first exchanges in the hollywood season will not come from american directors but from two germans who are ready to unleash films depicting global catastrophe and historical warfare onto effect junkies the world over . roland emmerich , no stranger to big budgets and special effects , unleashes the day after tomorrow on a world more than a little aware of the prophetic nature of the stuttgart-born director 's latest apocalyptical vision .
after bringing war-mongering aliens to earth in independence day and unleashing the radioactively-enhanced super lizard godzilla on film fans , the " swabian spielberg " has harnessed the fears of the kyoto generation to bring global warming to the silver screen for a cool € 118.5 million .
the german premiere is in berlin on may 21 . what emmerich attempted to do with aliens and monsters in the past , he now attempts with extreme weather with a film that has got the real-life powers-that-be sweating .
by ignoring the threat of climate change brought on by irresponsible attitudes to environmental damage , the u.s. government portrayed in the day after tomorrow literally reaps a whirlwind . first extreme heat , then tidal waves and snow storms sweep through manhattan and tornadoes destroy los angeles . emmerich calls for a change at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland emmerich .
not content with attaching an environmental message to his latest film , emmerich has even come out and criticized the current u.s. administration on its stance on global warming .
" president bush denies that there is global warming and that we cause this .
i don ’ t understand him , " the director said in a recent interview .
" i hope the americans make a more reasonable choice at the next election and elect democrat candidate john kerry . "
politicians on the left in the united states have spotted an opportunity and championed the film , which opens in the u.s. at the end of this month .
former presidential candidate al gore is already talking up the film , saying : “ millions of people will be coming out of movie theatres asking the question , ’ could this really happen ? ’ ”
meanwhile , voices on the other side of the political fence are offering their own opinions .
a bush spokesman has been quoted in reports as saying : “ people know what they ’ re watching is entertainment , and not grounded in basic scientific fact . ”
however , whether the same can be said about the other german-directed blockbuster is a matter for discussion .
wolfgang peterson 's troy is based on widely accepted historical fact but as with all things hollywood , there will be a certain amount of artistic license involved .
das boot director braves achilles ' heel peterson , born in emden in north germany , is probably best known for his claustrophobic world war ii classic das boot and his " man against the elements " sea spectacular the perfect storm .
this time , apart from the hugely impressive computer generated greek armada scenes in troy , the german director bases his latest epic on dry land - malta , to be precise . # b # the story follows events leading up to the legendary war circa 1200 b.c. which ignites when paris , prince of troy , steals away helen , the much younger wife of menelaus , the king of sparta .
the tribes of greece are then united to attack troy which leads to massive battle scenes , brad pitt in a skirt and , of course , that wooden horse . the film , boasting an impressive a-list cast and a budget of over € 150 million , is expected to be the biggest film of the year .

lavish posters boasting megastar actors and trailers promising epic set pieces have already got movie-goers salivating over the " money no object " offerings for this year 's release schedule . however , the first exchanges in the hollywood season will not come from american directors but from two germans who are ready to unleash films depicting global catastrophe and historical warfare onto effect junkies the world over . roland emmerich , no stranger to big budgets and special effects , unleashes the day after tomorrow on a world more than a little aware of the prophetic nature of the stuttgart-born director 's latest apocalyptical vision .
after bringing war-mongering aliens to earth in independence day and unleashing the radioactively-enhanced super lizard godzilla on film fans , the " swabian spielberg " has harnessed the fears of the kyoto generation to bring global warming to the silver screen for a cool € 118.5 million .
the german premiere is in berlin on may 21 . what emmerich attempted to do with aliens and monsters in the past , he now attempts with extreme weather with a film that has got the real-life powers-that-be sweating .
by ignoring the threat of climate change brought on by irresponsible attitudes to environmental damage , the u.s. government portrayed in the day after tomorrow literally reaps a whirlwind . first extreme heat , then tidal waves and snow storms sweep through manhattan and tornadoes destroy los angeles . emmerich calls for a change at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland emmerich .
not content with attaching an environmental message to his latest film , emmerich has even come out and criticized the current u.s. administration on its stance on global warming .
" president bush denies that there is global warming and that we cause this .
i don ’ t understand him , " the director said in a recent interview .
" i hope the americans make a more reasonable choice at the next election and elect democrat candidate john kerry . "
politicians on the left in the united states have spotted an opportunity and championed the film , which opens in the u.s. at the end of this month .
former presidential candidate al gore is already talking up the film , saying : “ millions of people will be coming out of movie theatres asking the question , ’ could this really happen ? ’ ”
meanwhile , voices on the other side of the political fence are offering their own opinions .
a bush spokesman has been quoted in reports as saying : “ people know what they ’ re watching is entertainment , and not grounded in basic scientific fact . ”
however , whether the same can be said about the other german-directed blockbuster is a matter for discussion .
wolfgang peterson 's troy is based on widely accepted historical fact but as with all things hollywood , there will be a certain amount of artistic license involved .
das boot director braves achilles ' heel peterson , born in emden in north germany , is probably best known for his claustrophobic world war ii classic das boot and his " man against the elements " sea spectacular the perfect storm .
this time , apart from the hugely impressive computer generated greek armada scenes in troy , the german director bases his latest epic on dry land - malta , to be precise . # b # the story follows events leading up to the legendary war circa 1200 b.c. which ignites when paris , prince of troy , steals away helen , the much younger wife of menelaus , the king of sparta .
the tribes of greece are then united to attack troy which leads to massive battle scenes , brad pitt in a skirt and , of course , that wooden horse . the film , boasting an impressive a-list cast and a budget of over € 150 million , is expected to be the biggest film of the year .

hollywood 's silly season of summer blockbusters kicks of this month with two movies tipped as mega-buck earners leading the way .
it sounds like business as usual until you discover that they 're both directed by germans . cinema audiences are preparing for the opening salvos in the annual battle of the summer blockbusters .
lavish posters boasting megastar actors and trailers promising epic set pieces have already got movie-goers salivating over the " money no object " offerings for this year 's release schedule . however , the first exchanges in the hollywood season will not come from american directors but from two germans who are ready to unleash films depicting global catastrophe and historical warfare onto effect junkies the world over . roland emmerich , no stranger to big budgets and special effects , unleashes the day after tomorrow on a world more than a little aware of the prophetic nature of the stuttgart-born director 's latest apocalyptical vision .
after bringing war-mongering aliens to earth in independence day and unleashing the radioactively-enhanced super lizard godzilla on film fans , the " swabian spielberg " has harnessed the fears of the kyoto generation to bring global warming to the silver screen for a cool € 118.5 million .
the german premiere is in berlin on may 21 . what emmerich attempted to do with aliens and monsters in the past , he now attempts with extreme weather with a film that has got the real-life powers-that-be sweating .
by ignoring the threat of climate change brought on by irresponsible attitudes to environmental damage , the u.s. government portrayed in the day after tomorrow literally reaps a whirlwind . first extreme heat , then tidal waves and snow storms sweep through manhattan and tornadoes destroy los angeles . emmerich calls for a change at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland emmerich .
not content with attaching an environmental message to his latest film , emmerich has even come out and criticized the current u.s. administration on its stance on global warming .
" president bush denies that there is global warming and that we cause this .
i don ’ t understand him , " the director said in a recent interview .
" i hope the americans make a more reasonable choice at the next election and elect democrat candidate john kerry . "
politicians on the left in the united states have spotted an opportunity and championed the film , which opens in the u.s. at the end of this month .
former presidential candidate al gore is already talking up the film , saying : “ millions of people will be coming out of movie theatres asking the question , ’ could this really happen ? ’ ”
meanwhile , voices on the other side of the political fence are offering their own opinions .
a bush spokesman has been quoted in reports as saying : “ people know what they ’ re watching is entertainment , and not grounded in basic scientific fact . ”
however , whether the same can be said about the other german-directed blockbuster is a matter for discussion .
wolfgang peterson 's troy is based on widely accepted historical fact but as with all things hollywood , there will be a certain amount of artistic license involved .
das boot director braves achilles ' heel peterson , born in emden in north germany , is probably best known for his claustrophobic world war ii classic das boot and his " man against the elements " sea spectacular the perfect storm .
this time , apart from the hugely impressive computer generated greek armada scenes in troy , the german director bases his latest epic on dry land - malta , to be precise . # b # the story follows events leading up to the legendary war circa 1200 b.c. which ignites when paris , prince of troy , steals away helen , the much younger wife of menelaus , the king of sparta .
the tribes of greece are then united to attack troy which leads to massive battle scenes , brad pitt in a skirt and , of course , that wooden horse . the film , boasting an impressive a-list cast and a budget of over € 150 million , is expected to be the biggest film of the year .

the judges said that housework as well as bringing up children was a valuable role that enhanced the living standard of the working partner .
that 's why , they said , maintenance claims after a divorce had to take into account the household duties as well as the income of the marriage partner .
the court stressed that nothing had changed about the fact that a person could , after divorce , continue to work in the household of a new partner .
the ruling thus revoked an earlier contradictory decision by a court in oldenburg and sanctioned the regular payment of € 180 monthly to a young , divorced housewife . more briefs 05.05.2004 -pipe- development minister intends more r & d funding 05.05.2004 -pipe- environment council issues reprimand 05.05.2004 -pipe- ex-hostage 's wife flies into germany 05.05.2004 -pipe- wagner 's great-granddaughter to make bayreuth debut 05.05.2004 -pipe- german labor market takes a hit in april 04.05.2004 -pipe- germany raises security alert at air bases 04.05.2004 -pipe- search for the " most beautiful " german word 04.05.2004 -pipe- german universities fear a brain drain radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.05.2004 europe-med forum to push for middle east ceasefire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe and north africa : so close and yet so far .
stability in the middle east and the fight against terrorism top the agenda at a meeting between eu foreign ministers and representatives from southern mediterranean states in dublin on thursday . just one day after a meeting of the middle east quartet in new york , the israeli and palestinian foreign ministers met face to face on wednesday as they joined a string of fellow ministers from europe and the middle east for high level talks in the irish capital .
israeli foreign minister silvan shalom and his palestinian counterpart nabil shaath were among three dozen ministers visiting the irish capital as part of a two-day euro-mediterranean gathering convened by the european union . the meeting in dublin castle will focus on prospects for bringing peace to the middle east and european relations to the 12 southern mediterranean states .
the event comes at a crucial time for israel and palestine , following on the heels of tuesday 's meeting of the quartet of middle east peace sponsors -lrb- united nations , united states , russia and the eu -rrb- and coming ahead of a summit of the arab league in tunisia later this month .
irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country as the current holder of the eu presidency is playing host to the euro-med conference , acknowledged the difficulties of bringing the two parties together , but said it was important for the peace process in the region .
" we need to use this forum , and there are very few where israeli and arab ministers can sit down and discuss issues , " he told reporters after an informal working dinner wednesday evening .
" we need to ensure that we get these parties together and try to get a ceasefire going .
we need a ceasefire in the middle east to give a chance to these parties to work together , " cowen said on behalf of the eu .
stability crucial for euro-med partnership since the mediterranean dialogue kicked off in barcelona in 1995 , bringing together the 15 countries that then made up the eu with algeria , cyprus , egypt , israel , jordan , lebanon , malta , morocco , the palestinian authority , syria , tunisia and turkey , the conflict in the middle east has been a constant topic of discussion .
diego de ojeda , the spokesman for eu 's external relations commissioner , chris patten , admitted the dispute between israel and the palestinians has been an undeniable " burden " for the forging of the euro-mediterranean partnership , often detracting from the other areas of cooperation .
the barcelona process of bringing europe and the mediterranean states closer together has succeeded primarily in areas not readily apparent in the political restructuring of the middle east , ojeda said .
chief among these are the many projects the eu finances to help build democratic institutions and promote economic development .
the eu has , for example , set up a training center for arab managers , funded youth exchanges , sponsored archeological excavations , renovations of villages and film projects - all at a cost of about a billion euros a year .
critics say that the barcelona process has been progressing too slowly , that it is no nearer to its goal of bringing democracy to north africa and the middle east .
but poul nielson , eu development commissioner , dismisses such criticism .
europe 's politics with regards to its neighbors is based on the principal of equality , he said .
" political and economic reforms can not simply be grafted onto the region .
successful cooperation flourishes only on the foundation of common interests among equal partners . "
common interests since the recent bomb attacks in madrid , istanbul and morocco , and even dating as far back as those in 2002 on the tunisian island of djerba , the threat of an increase in terrorism from extremist islamic circles has pushed the eu and the neighboring mediterranean states into a closer working relationship .
much has been made of the fact that after the train blasts in madrid in march , morocco immediately sent experts to the spanish capital to assist with the investigations .
things were quite different after the terror attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .

stability in the middle east and the fight against terrorism top the agenda at a meeting between eu foreign ministers and representatives from southern mediterranean states in dublin on thursday . just one day after a meeting of the middle east quartet in new york , the israeli and palestinian foreign ministers met face to face on wednesday as they joined a string of fellow ministers from europe and the middle east for high level talks in the irish capital .
israeli foreign minister silvan shalom and his palestinian counterpart nabil shaath were among three dozen ministers visiting the irish capital as part of a two-day euro-mediterranean gathering convened by the european union . the meeting in dublin castle will focus on prospects for bringing peace to the middle east and european relations to the 12 southern mediterranean states .
the event comes at a crucial time for israel and palestine , following on the heels of tuesday 's meeting of the quartet of middle east peace sponsors -lrb- united nations , united states , russia and the eu -rrb- and coming ahead of a summit of the arab league in tunisia later this month .
irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country as the current holder of the eu presidency is playing host to the euro-med conference , acknowledged the difficulties of bringing the two parties together , but said it was important for the peace process in the region .
" we need to use this forum , and there are very few where israeli and arab ministers can sit down and discuss issues , " he told reporters after an informal working dinner wednesday evening .
" we need to ensure that we get these parties together and try to get a ceasefire going .
we need a ceasefire in the middle east to give a chance to these parties to work together , " cowen said on behalf of the eu .
stability crucial for euro-med partnership since the mediterranean dialogue kicked off in barcelona in 1995 , bringing together the 15 countries that then made up the eu with algeria , cyprus , egypt , israel , jordan , lebanon , malta , morocco , the palestinian authority , syria , tunisia and turkey , the conflict in the middle east has been a constant topic of discussion .
diego de ojeda , the spokesman for eu 's external relations commissioner , chris patten , admitted the dispute between israel and the palestinians has been an undeniable " burden " for the forging of the euro-mediterranean partnership , often detracting from the other areas of cooperation .
the barcelona process of bringing europe and the mediterranean states closer together has succeeded primarily in areas not readily apparent in the political restructuring of the middle east , ojeda said .
chief among these are the many projects the eu finances to help build democratic institutions and promote economic development .
the eu has , for example , set up a training center for arab managers , funded youth exchanges , sponsored archeological excavations , renovations of villages and film projects - all at a cost of about a billion euros a year .
critics say that the barcelona process has been progressing too slowly , that it is no nearer to its goal of bringing democracy to north africa and the middle east .
but poul nielson , eu development commissioner , dismisses such criticism .
europe 's politics with regards to its neighbors is based on the principal of equality , he said .
" political and economic reforms can not simply be grafted onto the region .
successful cooperation flourishes only on the foundation of common interests among equal partners . "
common interests since the recent bomb attacks in madrid , istanbul and morocco , and even dating as far back as those in 2002 on the tunisian island of djerba , the threat of an increase in terrorism from extremist islamic circles has pushed the eu and the neighboring mediterranean states into a closer working relationship .
much has been made of the fact that after the train blasts in madrid in march , morocco immediately sent experts to the spanish capital to assist with the investigations .
things were quite different after the terror attacks in the united states on sept .

hollywood 's silly season of summer blockbusters kicks of this month with two movies tipped as mega-buck earners leading the way .
it sounds like business as usual until you discover that they 're both directed by germans . cinema audiences are preparing for the opening salvos in the annual battle of the summer blockbusters .
lavish posters boasting megastar actors and trailers promising epic set pieces have already got movie-goers salivating over the " money no object " offerings for this year 's release schedule . however , the first exchanges in the hollywood season will not come from american directors but from two germans who are ready to unleash films depicting global catastrophe and historical warfare onto effect junkies the world over . roland emmerich , no stranger to big budgets and special effects , unleashes the day after tomorrow on a world more than a little aware of the prophetic nature of the stuttgart-born director 's latest apocalyptical vision .
after bringing war-mongering aliens to earth in independence day and unleashing the radioactively-enhanced super lizard godzilla on film fans , the " swabian spielberg " has harnessed the fears of the kyoto generation to bring global warming to the silver screen for a cool € 118.5 million .
the german premiere is in berlin on may 21 . what emmerich attempted to do with aliens and monsters in the past , he now attempts with extreme weather with a film that has got the real-life powers-that-be sweating .
by ignoring the threat of climate change brought on by irresponsible attitudes to environmental damage , the u.s. government portrayed in the day after tomorrow literally reaps a whirlwind . first extreme heat , then tidal waves and snow storms sweep through manhattan and tornadoes destroy los angeles . emmerich calls for a change at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland emmerich .
not content with attaching an environmental message to his latest film , emmerich has even come out and criticized the current u.s. administration on its stance on global warming .
" president bush denies that there is global warming and that we cause this .
i don ’ t understand him , " the director said in a recent interview .
" i hope the americans make a more reasonable choice at the next election and elect democrat candidate john kerry . "
politicians on the left in the united states have spotted an opportunity and championed the film , which opens in the u.s. at the end of this month .
former presidential candidate al gore is already talking up the film , saying : “ millions of people will be coming out of movie theatres asking the question , ’ could this really happen ? ’ ”
meanwhile , voices on the other side of the political fence are offering their own opinions .
a bush spokesman has been quoted in reports as saying : “ people know what they ’ re watching is entertainment , and not grounded in basic scientific fact . ”
however , whether the same can be said about the other german-directed blockbuster is a matter for discussion .
wolfgang peterson 's troy is based on widely accepted historical fact but as with all things hollywood , there will be a certain amount of artistic license involved .
das boot director braves achilles ' heel peterson , born in emden in north germany , is probably best known for his claustrophobic world war ii classic das boot and his " man against the elements " sea spectacular the perfect storm .
this time , apart from the hugely impressive computer generated greek armada scenes in troy , the german director bases his latest epic on dry land - malta , to be precise . # b # the story follows events leading up to the legendary war circa 1200 b.c. which ignites when paris , prince of troy , steals away helen , the much younger wife of menelaus , the king of sparta .
the tribes of greece are then united to attack troy which leads to massive battle scenes , brad pitt in a skirt and , of course , that wooden horse . the film , boasting an impressive a-list cast and a budget of over € 150 million , is expected to be the biggest film of the year .
it premieres in peterson 's home country on may 9 with many of the stars expected to turn out for the showing in berlin . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to u.s. : cut emissions or face disaster in june , germany will host a global conference on renewable energies .

it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany . they take pictures , surf the web , send music and video clips - and they still fit in the palm of your hand and make telephone calls .
the long-awaited handsets for the new third generation of mobile phone systems are going on sale throughout germany starting this week .
but the mood on the market is a very different one from the euphoria when the big telecommunication companies first bought the rights to develop the new technology .
transmitting data at seven times the speed of the current mobile phone networks , the new universal mobile telecommunications system or umts promised to usher in a new age in mobile multimedia connectivity when it was launched back in 2000 .
at the time , people might have thought the 8.5 billion euros the participating telecommunications companies had to pay the government for access to the new networks was a bit steep .
but it was generally thought that the new mobile technology boom would go on for ever and the money was a good investment .
now that giant sum seems like a miscalculation .
deadlines for building up the network have come and gone , development of umts handsets were put on the back burner , and one provider - mobilcom - got out of the licensing altogether .
the deadline for offering the technology to the public was 2003 , but none of the german providers stuck to that date , and to make matters worse , the network does n't reach outside many urban areas yet .
the two big companies with a stake in the german market , british-based vodafone and the homegrown t-mobile , have only spent about a fifth of what the networks originally cost on developing technology for the new system .
for t-mobile , which is just beginning to bring out their own handsets , the investment in umts has ended up being an extensive endeavor .
in the first years after purchasing the license , the german telecommunications giant reported its biggest-ever losses and pointed the finger directly at the new network technology .
slow market reception it 's unlikely that umts will turn into a gold mine any time soon , despite all the clever things the new technology promises .
as with every new technology , there will only be a few early adaptors , who are prepared to pay the high price - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many will go after the new phones ? about 300 euros - and hefty connection charges for the thrill of possessing the latest gadget .
it will still take a while before the third-generation phones make their way into the pockets of mainstream german consumers , say many observers .
vodafone , the market leader , came out with the samsung z105 mobile video phone and t-mobile , deutsche telekom 's mobile offshoot and the perennial runner-up in the market , decided to follow up with the futuristic nokia 7600 music clip mobile .
back in february , vodafone had already beaten t-mobile in the race by introducing a card for a laptop computer which would allow people to transmit data at umts speeds of up to 384 kilobits per second .
but it was n't until recently that consumers could even purchase mobile phones for the super-speed network .
both companies had blamed the slow process on the manufacturers of the handsets , but by the time cebit rolled into hanover with the world 's largest trade fair for information technology in march , several companies were already displaying the next generation in mobile phones .
other umts license holders , such as the netherlands-based e-plus , have decided to hold off on launching their handsets until the big names have paved the rocky road to acceptance .
in the long term , experts say umts will help ease the shortage of mobile phone capacity on the existing networks , and thus help drive down the still relatively high prices of even conventional mobile phones .
but that will only happen when the umts providers have mopped up as much initial premium-price usage as the companies can squeeze out of it . michael lawton -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service .

the two big companies with a stake in the german market , british-based vodafone and the homegrown t-mobile , have only spent about a fifth of what the networks originally cost on developing technology for the new system .

both companies had blamed the slow process on the manufacturers of the handsets , but by the time cebit rolled into hanover with the world 's largest trade fair for information technology in march , several companies were already displaying the next generation in mobile phones .
other umts license holders , such as the netherlands-based e-plus , have decided to hold off on launching their handsets until the big names have paved the rocky road to acceptance .
in the long term , experts say umts will help ease the shortage of mobile phone capacity on the existing networks , and thus help drive down the still relatively high prices of even conventional mobile phones .

it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany . they take pictures , surf the web , send music and video clips - and they still fit in the palm of your hand and make telephone calls .

stability in the middle east and the fight against terrorism top the agenda at a meeting between eu foreign ministers and representatives from southern mediterranean states in dublin on thursday . just one day after a meeting of the middle east quartet in new york , the israeli and palestinian foreign ministers met face to face on wednesday as they joined a string of fellow ministers from europe and the middle east for high level talks in the irish capital .
israeli foreign minister silvan shalom and his palestinian counterpart nabil shaath were among three dozen ministers visiting the irish capital as part of a two-day euro-mediterranean gathering convened by the european union . the meeting in dublin castle will focus on prospects for bringing peace to the middle east and european relations to the 12 southern mediterranean states .
the event comes at a crucial time for israel and palestine , following on the heels of tuesday 's meeting of the quartet of middle east peace sponsors -lrb- united nations , united states , russia and the eu -rrb- and coming ahead of a summit of the arab league in tunisia later this month .
irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country as the current holder of the eu presidency is playing host to the euro-med conference , acknowledged the difficulties of bringing the two parties together , but said it was important for the peace process in the region .
" we need to use this forum , and there are very few where israeli and arab ministers can sit down and discuss issues , " he told reporters after an informal working dinner wednesday evening .
" we need to ensure that we get these parties together and try to get a ceasefire going .
we need a ceasefire in the middle east to give a chance to these parties to work together , " cowen said on behalf of the eu .
stability crucial for euro-med partnership since the mediterranean dialogue kicked off in barcelona in 1995 , bringing together the 15 countries that then made up the eu with algeria , cyprus , egypt , israel , jordan , lebanon , malta , morocco , the palestinian authority , syria , tunisia and turkey , the conflict in the middle east has been a constant topic of discussion .
diego de ojeda , the spokesman for eu 's external relations commissioner , chris patten , admitted the dispute between israel and the palestinians has been an undeniable " burden " for the forging of the euro-mediterranean partnership , often detracting from the other areas of cooperation .
the barcelona process of bringing europe and the mediterranean states closer together has succeeded primarily in areas not readily apparent in the political restructuring of the middle east , ojeda said .
chief among these are the many projects the eu finances to help build democratic institutions and promote economic development .
the eu has , for example , set up a training center for arab managers , funded youth exchanges , sponsored archeological excavations , renovations of villages and film projects - all at a cost of about a billion euros a year .
critics say that the barcelona process has been progressing too slowly , that it is no nearer to its goal of bringing democracy to north africa and the middle east .
but poul nielson , eu development commissioner , dismisses such criticism .
europe 's politics with regards to its neighbors is based on the principal of equality , he said .
" political and economic reforms can not simply be grafted onto the region .
successful cooperation flourishes only on the foundation of common interests among equal partners . "
common interests since the recent bomb attacks in madrid , istanbul and morocco , and even dating as far back as those in 2002 on the tunisian island of djerba , the threat of an increase in terrorism from extremist islamic circles has pushed the eu and the neighboring mediterranean states into a closer working relationship .
much has been made of the fact that after the train blasts in madrid in march , morocco immediately sent experts to the spanish capital to assist with the investigations .
things were quite different after the terror attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
eu ministers point to the improvement in cooperation as a signal that they are on the right track .
one way to fight extremism at its roots , they argue , is to reduce poverty .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has come out strong in favor of promoting economic ties to north africa to give the people , especially the 40 million youth , a perspective .
in order to do this , the eu has negotiated preferential trade agreements with all the euro-med countries .
whether the goal of establishing a free trade zone for the entire mediterranean region by 2010 will be achieved is still uncertain .
and as for inviting the 12 southern neighbors to join the eu , poul nielson has warned the mediterranean countries not to get their hopes up .
" we 're not closing the door , but we 're also not talking about further enlargement , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels libya is the only north african state not in the euro-mediterranean partnership , but on a trip to brussles last week muammar gadhafi expressed interest in joining .
europe pledges economic cooperation for north africa at a meeting of 10 mediterranean countries , europe agreed to boost ties between the wealthier northern states and the poorer south and to help in the fight on terror and stemming the flow of illegal immigration .

hollywood 's silly season of summer blockbusters kicks of this month with two movies tipped as mega-buck earners leading the way .
it sounds like business as usual until you discover that they 're both directed by germans . cinema audiences are preparing for the opening salvos in the annual battle of the summer blockbusters .
lavish posters boasting megastar actors and trailers promising epic set pieces have already got movie-goers salivating over the " money no object " offerings for this year 's release schedule . however , the first exchanges in the hollywood season will not come from american directors but from two germans who are ready to unleash films depicting global catastrophe and historical warfare onto effect junkies the world over . roland emmerich , no stranger to big budgets and special effects , unleashes the day after tomorrow on a world more than a little aware of the prophetic nature of the stuttgart-born director 's latest apocalyptical vision .
after bringing war-mongering aliens to earth in independence day and unleashing the radioactively-enhanced super lizard godzilla on film fans , the " swabian spielberg " has harnessed the fears of the kyoto generation to bring global warming to the silver screen for a cool € 118.5 million .
the german premiere is in berlin on may 21 . what emmerich attempted to do with aliens and monsters in the past , he now attempts with extreme weather with a film that has got the real-life powers-that-be sweating .
by ignoring the threat of climate change brought on by irresponsible attitudes to environmental damage , the u.s. government portrayed in the day after tomorrow literally reaps a whirlwind . first extreme heat , then tidal waves and snow storms sweep through manhattan and tornadoes destroy los angeles . emmerich calls for a change at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland emmerich .
not content with attaching an environmental message to his latest film , emmerich has even come out and criticized the current u.s. administration on its stance on global warming .
" president bush denies that there is global warming and that we cause this .
i don ’ t understand him , " the director said in a recent interview .
" i hope the americans make a more reasonable choice at the next election and elect democrat candidate john kerry . "
politicians on the left in the united states have spotted an opportunity and championed the film , which opens in the u.s. at the end of this month .
former presidential candidate al gore is already talking up the film , saying : “ millions of people will be coming out of movie theatres asking the question , ’ could this really happen ? ’ ”
meanwhile , voices on the other side of the political fence are offering their own opinions .
a bush spokesman has been quoted in reports as saying : “ people know what they ’ re watching is entertainment , and not grounded in basic scientific fact . ”
however , whether the same can be said about the other german-directed blockbuster is a matter for discussion .
wolfgang peterson 's troy is based on widely accepted historical fact but as with all things hollywood , there will be a certain amount of artistic license involved .
das boot director braves achilles ' heel peterson , born in emden in north germany , is probably best known for his claustrophobic world war ii classic das boot and his " man against the elements " sea spectacular the perfect storm .
this time , apart from the hugely impressive computer generated greek armada scenes in troy , the german director bases his latest epic on dry land - malta , to be precise . # b # the story follows events leading up to the legendary war circa 1200 b.c. which ignites when paris , prince of troy , steals away helen , the much younger wife of menelaus , the king of sparta .
the tribes of greece are then united to attack troy which leads to massive battle scenes , brad pitt in a skirt and , of course , that wooden horse . the film , boasting an impressive a-list cast and a budget of over € 150 million , is expected to be the biggest film of the year .
it premieres in peterson 's home country on may 9 with many of the stars expected to turn out for the showing in berlin . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to u.s. : cut emissions or face disaster in june , germany will host a global conference on renewable energies .

hollywood 's silly season of summer blockbusters kicks of this month with two movies tipped as mega-buck earners leading the way .
it sounds like business as usual until you discover that they 're both directed by germans . cinema audiences are preparing for the opening salvos in the annual battle of the summer blockbusters .
lavish posters boasting megastar actors and trailers promising epic set pieces have already got movie-goers salivating over the " money no object " offerings for this year 's release schedule . however , the first exchanges in the hollywood season will not come from american directors but from two germans who are ready to unleash films depicting global catastrophe and historical warfare onto effect junkies the world over . roland emmerich , no stranger to big budgets and special effects , unleashes the day after tomorrow on a world more than a little aware of the prophetic nature of the stuttgart-born director 's latest apocalyptical vision .
after bringing war-mongering aliens to earth in independence day and unleashing the radioactively-enhanced super lizard godzilla on film fans , the " swabian spielberg " has harnessed the fears of the kyoto generation to bring global warming to the silver screen for a cool € 118.5 million .
the german premiere is in berlin on may 21 . what emmerich attempted to do with aliens and monsters in the past , he now attempts with extreme weather with a film that has got the real-life powers-that-be sweating .
by ignoring the threat of climate change brought on by irresponsible attitudes to environmental damage , the u.s. government portrayed in the day after tomorrow literally reaps a whirlwind . first extreme heat , then tidal waves and snow storms sweep through manhattan and tornadoes destroy los angeles . emmerich calls for a change at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland emmerich .
not content with attaching an environmental message to his latest film , emmerich has even come out and criticized the current u.s. administration on its stance on global warming .
" president bush denies that there is global warming and that we cause this .
i don ’ t understand him , " the director said in a recent interview .
" i hope the americans make a more reasonable choice at the next election and elect democrat candidate john kerry . "
politicians on the left in the united states have spotted an opportunity and championed the film , which opens in the u.s. at the end of this month .
former presidential candidate al gore is already talking up the film , saying : “ millions of people will be coming out of movie theatres asking the question , ’ could this really happen ? ’ ”
meanwhile , voices on the other side of the political fence are offering their own opinions .
a bush spokesman has been quoted in reports as saying : “ people know what they ’ re watching is entertainment , and not grounded in basic scientific fact . ”
however , whether the same can be said about the other german-directed blockbuster is a matter for discussion .
wolfgang peterson 's troy is based on widely accepted historical fact but as with all things hollywood , there will be a certain amount of artistic license involved .
das boot director braves achilles ' heel peterson , born in emden in north germany , is probably best known for his claustrophobic world war ii classic das boot and his " man against the elements " sea spectacular the perfect storm .
this time , apart from the hugely impressive computer generated greek armada scenes in troy , the german director bases his latest epic on dry land - malta , to be precise . # b # the story follows events leading up to the legendary war circa 1200 b.c. which ignites when paris , prince of troy , steals away helen , the much younger wife of menelaus , the king of sparta .
the tribes of greece are then united to attack troy which leads to massive battle scenes , brad pitt in a skirt and , of course , that wooden horse . the film , boasting an impressive a-list cast and a budget of over € 150 million , is expected to be the biggest film of the year .

it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany . they take pictures , surf the web , send music and video clips - and they still fit in the palm of your hand and make telephone calls .
the long-awaited handsets for the new third generation of mobile phone systems are going on sale throughout germany starting this week .
but the mood on the market is a very different one from the euphoria when the big telecommunication companies first bought the rights to develop the new technology .
transmitting data at seven times the speed of the current mobile phone networks , the new universal mobile telecommunications system or umts promised to usher in a new age in mobile multimedia connectivity when it was launched back in 2000 .
at the time , people might have thought the 8.5 billion euros the participating telecommunications companies had to pay the government for access to the new networks was a bit steep .
but it was generally thought that the new mobile technology boom would go on for ever and the money was a good investment .
now that giant sum seems like a miscalculation .
deadlines for building up the network have come and gone , development of umts handsets were put on the back burner , and one provider - mobilcom - got out of the licensing altogether .
the deadline for offering the technology to the public was 2003 , but none of the german providers stuck to that date , and to make matters worse , the network does n't reach outside many urban areas yet .
the two big companies with a stake in the german market , british-based vodafone and the homegrown t-mobile , have only spent about a fifth of what the networks originally cost on developing technology for the new system .
for t-mobile , which is just beginning to bring out their own handsets , the investment in umts has ended up being an extensive endeavor .
in the first years after purchasing the license , the german telecommunications giant reported its biggest-ever losses and pointed the finger directly at the new network technology .
slow market reception it 's unlikely that umts will turn into a gold mine any time soon , despite all the clever things the new technology promises .
as with every new technology , there will only be a few early adaptors , who are prepared to pay the high price - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many will go after the new phones ? about 300 euros - and hefty connection charges for the thrill of possessing the latest gadget .
it will still take a while before the third-generation phones make their way into the pockets of mainstream german consumers , say many observers .
vodafone , the market leader , came out with the samsung z105 mobile video phone and t-mobile , deutsche telekom 's mobile offshoot and the perennial runner-up in the market , decided to follow up with the futuristic nokia 7600 music clip mobile .
back in february , vodafone had already beaten t-mobile in the race by introducing a card for a laptop computer which would allow people to transmit data at umts speeds of up to 384 kilobits per second .
but it was n't until recently that consumers could even purchase mobile phones for the super-speed network .
both companies had blamed the slow process on the manufacturers of the handsets , but by the time cebit rolled into hanover with the world 's largest trade fair for information technology in march , several companies were already displaying the next generation in mobile phones .
other umts license holders , such as the netherlands-based e-plus , have decided to hold off on launching their handsets until the big names have paved the rocky road to acceptance .
in the long term , experts say umts will help ease the shortage of mobile phone capacity on the existing networks , and thus help drive down the still relatively high prices of even conventional mobile phones .
but that will only happen when the umts providers have mopped up as much initial premium-price usage as the companies can squeeze out of it . michael lawton -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .

stability in the middle east and the fight against terrorism top the agenda at a meeting between eu foreign ministers and representatives from southern mediterranean states in dublin on thursday . just one day after a meeting of the middle east quartet in new york , the israeli and palestinian foreign ministers met face to face on wednesday as they joined a string of fellow ministers from europe and the middle east for high level talks in the irish capital .
israeli foreign minister silvan shalom and his palestinian counterpart nabil shaath were among three dozen ministers visiting the irish capital as part of a two-day euro-mediterranean gathering convened by the european union . the meeting in dublin castle will focus on prospects for bringing peace to the middle east and european relations to the 12 southern mediterranean states .
the event comes at a crucial time for israel and palestine , following on the heels of tuesday 's meeting of the quartet of middle east peace sponsors -lrb- united nations , united states , russia and the eu -rrb- and coming ahead of a summit of the arab league in tunisia later this month .
irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country as the current holder of the eu presidency is playing host to the euro-med conference , acknowledged the difficulties of bringing the two parties together , but said it was important for the peace process in the region .
" we need to use this forum , and there are very few where israeli and arab ministers can sit down and discuss issues , " he told reporters after an informal working dinner wednesday evening .
" we need to ensure that we get these parties together and try to get a ceasefire going .
we need a ceasefire in the middle east to give a chance to these parties to work together , " cowen said on behalf of the eu .
stability crucial for euro-med partnership since the mediterranean dialogue kicked off in barcelona in 1995 , bringing together the 15 countries that then made up the eu with algeria , cyprus , egypt , israel , jordan , lebanon , malta , morocco , the palestinian authority , syria , tunisia and turkey , the conflict in the middle east has been a constant topic of discussion .
diego de ojeda , the spokesman for eu 's external relations commissioner , chris patten , admitted the dispute between israel and the palestinians has been an undeniable " burden " for the forging of the euro-mediterranean partnership , often detracting from the other areas of cooperation .
the barcelona process of bringing europe and the mediterranean states closer together has succeeded primarily in areas not readily apparent in the political restructuring of the middle east , ojeda said .
chief among these are the many projects the eu finances to help build democratic institutions and promote economic development .
the eu has , for example , set up a training center for arab managers , funded youth exchanges , sponsored archeological excavations , renovations of villages and film projects - all at a cost of about a billion euros a year .
critics say that the barcelona process has been progressing too slowly , that it is no nearer to its goal of bringing democracy to north africa and the middle east .
but poul nielson , eu development commissioner , dismisses such criticism .
europe 's politics with regards to its neighbors is based on the principal of equality , he said .
" political and economic reforms can not simply be grafted onto the region .
successful cooperation flourishes only on the foundation of common interests among equal partners . "
common interests since the recent bomb attacks in madrid , istanbul and morocco , and even dating as far back as those in 2002 on the tunisian island of djerba , the threat of an increase in terrorism from extremist islamic circles has pushed the eu and the neighboring mediterranean states into a closer working relationship .
much has been made of the fact that after the train blasts in madrid in march , morocco immediately sent experts to the spanish capital to assist with the investigations .
things were quite different after the terror attacks in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 .
eu ministers point to the improvement in cooperation as a signal that they are on the right track .
one way to fight extremism at its roots , they argue , is to reduce poverty .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has come out strong in favor of promoting economic ties to north africa to give the people , especially the 40 million youth , a perspective .
in order to do this , the eu has negotiated preferential trade agreements with all the euro-med countries .
whether the goal of establishing a free trade zone for the entire mediterranean region by 2010 will be achieved is still uncertain .
and as for inviting the 12 southern neighbors to join the eu , poul nielson has warned the mediterranean countries not to get their hopes up .
" we 're not closing the door , but we 're also not talking about further enlargement , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels libya is the only north african state not in the euro-mediterranean partnership , but on a trip to brussles last week muammar gadhafi expressed interest in joining .

conscription could soon be scrapped in germany , as the ruling social democrats are reportedly realizing that switching to a professional army as in other nato countries might be a better option . the head of the policy and advisory staff of the german defense ministry , franz borkenhagen surprised members of the social democrat parliamentary fraction when he praised purely professional armies in other nato countries in a paper presented on wednesday . " the affected countries ruled that the intervention capabilities of the troops in foreign deployments had significantly improved , " german daily die welt quoted borkenhagen as saying .
" in general the troops welcomed the abolition of the draft and it even found a wide , positive resonance in society , " borkenhagen added . borkenhagen was addressing a special working group on security policies set up by the social democrats to examine ways to abolish the draft and the possible consequences of such a move . german defense minister peter struck is reportedly familiar with borkenhagen 's paper . pressure to scrap the draft borkenhagen 's findings are expected to add further fuel to a growing political debate in recent years on the future of mandatory military service , a feature of german life since the country was unified under bismarck in 1870 . the green party - the junior partner in the ruling coalition with the social democrats - have long pushed for the elimination of the nine-month conscription .
however , the social democrats led by defense minister struck have repeatedly rejected the calls , saying germany can not afford a professional army before 2010 . in recent months , pressure has increased on the government to abolish the draft .
in january this year an administrative court in cologne overturned the defense ministry 's eligibility rules for conscripts that exempt men who are married , are older than 23 or are found to be only partially fit for military service . the court said the rules violated the principle of fairness because fewer than half of the young men eligible for conscription are actually drafted .

conscription could soon be scrapped in germany , as the ruling social democrats are reportedly realizing that switching to a professional army as in other nato countries might be a better option . the head of the policy and advisory staff of the german defense ministry , franz borkenhagen surprised members of the social democrat parliamentary fraction when he praised purely professional armies in other nato countries in a paper presented on wednesday . " the affected countries ruled that the intervention capabilities of the troops in foreign deployments had significantly improved , " german daily die welt quoted borkenhagen as saying .
" in general the troops welcomed the abolition of the draft and it even found a wide , positive resonance in society , " borkenhagen added . borkenhagen was addressing a special working group on security policies set up by the social democrats to examine ways to abolish the draft and the possible consequences of such a move . german defense minister peter struck is reportedly familiar with borkenhagen 's paper . pressure to scrap the draft borkenhagen 's findings are expected to add further fuel to a growing political debate in recent years on the future of mandatory military service , a feature of german life since the country was unified under bismarck in 1870 . the green party - the junior partner in the ruling coalition with the social democrats - have long pushed for the elimination of the nine-month conscription .
however , the social democrats led by defense minister struck have repeatedly rejected the calls , saying germany can not afford a professional army before 2010 . in recent months , pressure has increased on the government to abolish the draft .
in january this year an administrative court in cologne overturned the defense ministry 's eligibility rules for conscripts that exempt men who are married , are older than 23 or are found to be only partially fit for military service . the court said the rules violated the principle of fairness because fewer than half of the young men eligible for conscription are actually drafted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.05.2004 third generation mobile phones arrive in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vodafone deutschland head jürgen von kuczkowski shows off his company 's new do-it-all phone .
it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany . they take pictures , surf the web , send music and video clips - and they still fit in the palm of your hand and make telephone calls .
the long-awaited handsets for the new third generation of mobile phone systems are going on sale throughout germany starting this week .
but the mood on the market is a very different one from the euphoria when the big telecommunication companies first bought the rights to develop the new technology .
transmitting data at seven times the speed of the current mobile phone networks , the new universal mobile telecommunications system or umts promised to usher in a new age in mobile multimedia connectivity when it was launched back in 2000 .
at the time , people might have thought the 8.5 billion euros the participating telecommunications companies had to pay the government for access to the new networks was a bit steep .
but it was generally thought that the new mobile technology boom would go on for ever and the money was a good investment .
now that giant sum seems like a miscalculation .
deadlines for building up the network have come and gone , development of umts handsets were put on the back burner , and one provider - mobilcom - got out of the licensing altogether .
the deadline for offering the technology to the public was 2003 , but none of the german providers stuck to that date , and to make matters worse , the network does n't reach outside many urban areas yet .
the two big companies with a stake in the german market , british-based vodafone and the homegrown t-mobile , have only spent about a fifth of what the networks originally cost on developing technology for the new system .
for t-mobile , which is just beginning to bring out their own handsets , the investment in umts has ended up being an extensive endeavor .
in the first years after purchasing the license , the german telecommunications giant reported its biggest-ever losses and pointed the finger directly at the new network technology .
slow market reception it 's unlikely that umts will turn into a gold mine any time soon , despite all the clever things the new technology promises .
as with every new technology , there will only be a few early adaptors , who are prepared to pay the high price - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many will go after the new phones ? about 300 euros - and hefty connection charges for the thrill of possessing the latest gadget .
it will still take a while before the third-generation phones make their way into the pockets of mainstream german consumers , say many observers .
vodafone , the market leader , came out with the samsung z105 mobile video phone and t-mobile , deutsche telekom 's mobile offshoot and the perennial runner-up in the market , decided to follow up with the futuristic nokia 7600 music clip mobile .
back in february , vodafone had already beaten t-mobile in the race by introducing a card for a laptop computer which would allow people to transmit data at umts speeds of up to 384 kilobits per second .
but it was n't until recently that consumers could even purchase mobile phones for the super-speed network .
both companies had blamed the slow process on the manufacturers of the handsets , but by the time cebit rolled into hanover with the world 's largest trade fair for information technology in march , several companies were already displaying the next generation in mobile phones .
other umts license holders , such as the netherlands-based e-plus , have decided to hold off on launching their handsets until the big names have paved the rocky road to acceptance .
in the long term , experts say umts will help ease the shortage of mobile phone capacity on the existing networks , and thus help drive down the still relatively high prices of even conventional mobile phones .
but that will only happen when the umts providers have mopped up as much initial premium-price usage as the companies can squeeze out of it . michael lawton -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vodafone launches umts service in europe after years in the planning , europe 's first umts service for laptops hits the market monday .
however , continuing problems with technology mean mobile phone users still have to wait until later this year for the service .

conscription could soon be scrapped in germany , as the ruling social democrats are reportedly realizing that switching to a professional army as in other nato countries might be a better option . the head of the policy and advisory staff of the german defense ministry , franz borkenhagen surprised members of the social democrat parliamentary fraction when he praised purely professional armies in other nato countries in a paper presented on wednesday . " the affected countries ruled that the intervention capabilities of the troops in foreign deployments had significantly improved , " german daily die welt quoted borkenhagen as saying .
" in general the troops welcomed the abolition of the draft and it even found a wide , positive resonance in society , " borkenhagen added . borkenhagen was addressing a special working group on security policies set up by the social democrats to examine ways to abolish the draft and the possible consequences of such a move . german defense minister peter struck is reportedly familiar with borkenhagen 's paper . pressure to scrap the draft borkenhagen 's findings are expected to add further fuel to a growing political debate in recent years on the future of mandatory military service , a feature of german life since the country was unified under bismarck in 1870 . the green party - the junior partner in the ruling coalition with the social democrats - have long pushed for the elimination of the nine-month conscription .
however , the social democrats led by defense minister struck have repeatedly rejected the calls , saying germany can not afford a professional army before 2010 . in recent months , pressure has increased on the government to abolish the draft .
in january this year an administrative court in cologne overturned the defense ministry 's eligibility rules for conscripts that exempt men who are married , are older than 23 or are found to be only partially fit for military service . the court said the rules violated the principle of fairness because fewer than half of the young men eligible for conscription are actually drafted .
though women have been allowed to serve by choice since 2001 , conscription is all-male with men between the ages of 18 to 45 eligible for nine-month duty . unable to meet modern challenges many also believe that the original aim of conscription - being a sort of citizens ' army to protect the homeland - now looks increasingly outdated in the face of modern military challenges such as global terrorism . germany - which remains one of the last major european countries with mandatory military service - has thus come under increasing pressure from its nato partners to scrap the system .
they consider it inefficient in dealing with crisis intervention and peacekeeping not least because the short duration of the conscription means that conscripts are generally not allowed to participate in combat missions overseas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan in addition , demands on the german army are currently greater than at any time since the second world war .
german troops are involved in more foreign operations than any other country apart from the u.s. , with peacekeeping troops stationed in afghanistan , the balkans and the horn of africa . armed forces undergoing revamp earlier this year , struck unveiled major plans to modernize and trim the armed forces and cut their budget - a move many believe may ultimately spell the end of conscription . struck 's reforms seek to reduce the number of soldiers -lrb- currently about 272,000 -rrb- by around 35,000 .
the new army will include a rapid-deployment force of 35,000 troops to be available for multinational missions , another 70,000 to trained for peacekeeping operations such as the one in afghanistan and the balkans .
he is also reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion . " despite his emphasis on maintaining the draft , he is pursuing a very pragmatic policy , which in reality is moving step by step away from the draft and toward a volunteer army , " winfried nachtwei , a defense expert for the green party said in an interview with news agency dpa earlier this year . abolition not without problems but the dismantling of the draft in germany is also expected to bring its fair share of problems .
young men who reject serving in the military for reasons of conscience are required to do compulsory community service for ten months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german social worker around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
the social democrats , who are set to take a final decision on the future of the draft at a party conference next year , are indicating they 're adopting a pragmatic approach .
" the working group on security policies is still of the view that conscription is the better decision for the armed forces and our society , " rainer arnold of defense spokesman of the social democratic parliamentary group told die welt .

the wales domestic abuse helpline will offer bilingual support and advice to women , men and children .
a woman who spent seven years in a violent relationship in north wales has told bbc news online of the ordeal .
" i had never witnessed violence before , " said the woman , who has been involved in setting up the service , but can not be named for legal reasons .
" it started with emotional and mental abuse and became physical as well - the physical aspect was easier to get over as it was visible .
" i lived on a farm - it was very rural and i felt very isolated .
i knew if i did n't get out , i would be seriously hurt or worse woman who experienced abuse " my partner was well-known in the community and seen as a popular person .
" for me , the abuse tended to happen late at night , when there is no-one you can access .
" i was taken to hospital twice - the worst was broken ribs and a broken arm .
" it built up and was getting worse every time . "
the woman had two children from a previous marriage and said she left her partner because of the effect on them .
" i knew if i did n't get out , i would be seriously hurt or worse .
" i did leave several times - about four times prior to the final time , but he kept finding me .
it is not all about breaking up relationships - there are times when something can be done woman who experienced abuse " you get more confident each time and get to know what your rights are . "
the woman contacted women 's aid eventually , but it took her time to build up the courage .
" for a lot of women , it is just talking to someone and get moral support and change things before it gets too bad .
" some men are abusive and wo n't change .
but if it is caught early enough , some might be able to work it out together . "
" it is not all about breaking up relationships - there are times when something can be done . "
the fact the service was bilingual and for people in wales made it more relevant .
men can suffer abuse too - i think the number of people coming forward is growing .
woman who experienced abuse " as a first language welsh speaker , it is a lot easier to speak welsh when in an emotional state .
" but because it is a service in wales , it will help english speakers as well , as they can speak to someone on a local level .
" people on the helpline will know what the situation in the area is , and what options are available - and give information like names of solicitors to get legal aid . "
men and children should call the line if they were in a domestic abuse situation , she said .
" men can suffer abuse too - i think the number of people coming forward is growing .
" and children have their own problems , and can be witnessing violence of their parents . "
the helpline is open from 8am-2pm and 8pm-2am all-year round on the freephone number 0808 80 10 800 .
launching the service in caernarfon on thursday , assembly business minister karen sinclair said : " too many people suffer the devastating impact of domestic abuse .
" it 's important that people do n't feel they have to suffer in silence and that help is available . "

" i had never witnessed violence before , " said the woman , who has been involved in setting up the service , but can not be named for legal reasons .
" it started with emotional and mental abuse and became physical as well - the physical aspect was easier to get over as it was visible .
" i lived on a farm - it was very rural and i felt very isolated .
i knew if i did n't get out , i would be seriously hurt or worse woman who experienced abuse " my partner was well-known in the community and seen as a popular person .
" for me , the abuse tended to happen late at night , when there is no-one you can access .
" i was taken to hospital twice - the worst was broken ribs and a broken arm .
" it built up and was getting worse every time . "
the woman had two children from a previous marriage and said she left her partner because of the effect on them .

woman who experienced abuse " as a first language welsh speaker , it is a lot easier to speak welsh when in an emotional state .

men and children should call the line if they were in a domestic abuse situation , she said .

yet he applied for the indaba scholarship , an award created by wine distributors cape classics , to help black south africans study areas of the wine industry .
" i was a student doing chemical engineering when i got the opportunity to come to stellenbosch university to study wine making , " he said .
" it was a time of change in the country and i took a chance . "
black winemakers the government 's attempts to promote greater black participation in all sectors of the economy gave him the confidence to take that chance .
mr mvemve started a bachelor of science degree in agriculture in 1997 and four years later became south africa 's first black winemaker .
there are now many more black winemakers in south africa , a significant breakthrough for an industry dominated by whites .
but there are none with mr mvemve 's level of responsibilities .
he began working for cape classics in 2001 as an assistant winemaker .
now he chooses and manages the vineyard and decides how and when to harvest the grapes .
he also has complete control over the winemaking process right through to the finished product .
slow change the end of apartheid has created new opportunities for the wine industry as the world rediscovers south africa , according to andre shearer , the chief executive of cape classics which owns and markets indaba wines , one of the fastest selling south african wines in the united states .
but while wine styles have changed , he admits that the industry has yet to really open its doors to black south africans .
" i 'm not sure if as much ... has changed -lsb- at the grass root level -rsb- in terms of the empowerment process , " he says .
" there 's hesitancy on some parts .
" some people , frankly , think that things are going ok and that there are empowerment developments . "
" but i 'm not sure that the -lsb- changes -rsb- are , in the main , enough . "
black ownership the government 's decision to formalise its approach to black economic empowerment came about because industries were hesitant and in some cases openly hostile .
the mining sector , seen as the backbone of the economy , was the first to be targeted and was forced to meet legally prescribed timetables to ensure greater black involvement .
mining firms must ensure that 15 % of their equity is black owned by 2009 , with a further boost to 26 % by 2014 .
since the mining charter in 2002 , no sector specific laws have been introduced , but other industries are now putting together voluntary charters .
the wine industry is expected to publish its charter before the end of the year .
mr mvemve is hoping the charter will help him fulfil his dream to become a vineyard owner .
" i 'm pretty much betting on the black economic empowerment charter that is being discussed currently , " said mr mvemve , insisting that as this should help him find out what roles black people are able to play in the wine industry .
eventually , mr mvemve hopes to raise a quarter of a million rand to release his own label .

mzokhona mvemve is dreaming about becoming a vineyard owner yet he applied for the indaba scholarship , an award created by wine distributors cape classics , to help black south africans study areas of the wine industry .
" i was a student doing chemical engineering when i got the opportunity to come to stellenbosch university to study wine making , " he said .
" it was a time of change in the country and i took a chance . "
black winemakers the government 's attempts to promote greater black participation in all sectors of the economy gave him the confidence to take that chance .
the world has rediscovered south african wines mr mvemve started a bachelor of science degree in agriculture in 1997 and four years later became south africa 's first black winemaker .
there are now many more black winemakers in south africa , a significant breakthrough for an industry dominated by whites .
but there are none with mr mvemve 's level of responsibilities .
he began working for cape classics in 2001 as an assistant winemaker .
now he chooses and manages the vineyard and decides how and when to harvest the grapes .
he also has complete control over the winemaking process right through to the finished product .
slow change the end of apartheid has created new opportunities for the wine industry as the world rediscovers south africa , according to andre shearer , the chief executive of cape classics which owns and markets indaba wines , one of the fastest selling south african wines in the united states .
few black people have , as yet , studies wine making but while wine styles have changed , he admits that the industry has yet to really open its doors to black south africans .
" i 'm not sure if as much ... has changed -lsb- at the grass root level -rsb- in terms of the empowerment process , " he says .
" there 's hesitancy on some parts .
" some people , frankly , think that things are going ok and that there are empowerment developments . "
" but i 'm not sure that the -lsb- changes -rsb- are , in the main , enough . "
black ownership the government 's decision to formalise its approach to black economic empowerment came about because industries were hesitant and in some cases openly hostile .
the wine industry should publish its black empowerment charter this year the mining sector , seen as the backbone of the economy , was the first to be targeted and was forced to meet legally prescribed timetables to ensure greater black involvement .
mining firms must ensure that 15 % of their equity is black owned by 2009 , with a further boost to 26 % by 2014 .
since the mining charter in 2002 , no sector specific laws have been introduced , but other industries are now putting together voluntary charters .
the wine industry is expected to publish its charter before the end of the year .
mr mvemve is hoping the charter will help him fulfil his dream to become a vineyard owner .

some believe the virus , which has wrought havoc on computers around the world , will slow down as more and more people fit additional security patches .
yet others warn that sasser could now merge with earlier virus-like programs to wreak yet more havoc .
meanwhile the fbi has started to search for sasser 's creator , taking the sasser code apart as it looks for clues .
" the infection is showing signs of slowing down , but the worm is still very active , " said ang ah sin , from security firm trend micro .
computer ' vulnerabilities ' he said the outbreak was now largely contained because of the number of people who had now cleaned up their computers and upgraded their virus protection .
however , jimmy kuo from fellow firm network associates disagrees , saying sasser could mutate and merge with previous computer virus netsky to become even more of a problem .
" my expectation is that netsky and sasser variants will merge and become what we can one ' abundant threat ' that attacks through email and software vulnerabilities , " he said .
the sasser worm first appeared on 1 may and between 150,000 and 1 million computers worldwide running on microsoft windows have been affected .
machines at investment bank goldman sachs , the european commission and british airways and 19 regional offices of the uk maritime and coastguard agency all fell victim to sasser .
open windows up to 500 computers in hospitals in new orleans were shut down for several hours and social and health services in washington state were also hit by the worm .
the virus can infect pcs running windows 2000 and xp that are not patched against the loophole it exploits or do not have a firewall to protect themselves .
according to anti-virus firms , machines running windows 95 , 98 and millennium edition can help spread sasser even though they can not be infected by it .

the hobbiton site in new zealand has few touristic trappings if you have ever visited a major film studio in hollywood you will know how glitzy the whole experience is with tours of famous sets , and if you are lucky a glimpse of a celebrity or two .
so you might expect a similar degree of glamour when you trek to the other side of the world to middle earth to see where they filmed one of the biggest blockbusters of all time , namely lord of the rings .
but you would be in for a bit of a culture shock .
they just do n't do tinseltown in new zealand .
they have a style all their own that has more to do with rugby and farming than fame .
there was great excitement as my partner ian and two daughters tallulah , 15 and aurora , 10 , and i drove two hours south of auckland to see where movie history was made .
we had expected giant signposts , bunting and perhaps the occasional orc on the roadside to point us in the right direction .
triona holden and her family try out the hobbit lifestyle in new zealand as it turned out there was only a small cardboard sign attached to a lamppost and we missed the turning .
in our defence it 's easy to overshoot the tiny town of matamata , with a population of just over 6,000 .
it 's a sleepy place with only a few shops , that is until you eventually find your way to the tourist information centre .
the new red brick building was buzzing with activity , it was like a mini un with groups of chattering visitors from just about any country you cared to mention .
this was where rings tours was based - the company set up by the alexander family , the fortunate farmers who own the 10-acre site chosen by the director peter jackson as the site for the hobbiton village .
business was brisk with more than 250 tourists turning up every day for the tours , paying $ 50 nzd per adult and $ 25 nzd a child .
hobbit frodo left his home to save middle earth no-one was more surprised at this success than the alexanders , who have benefited hugely from their patch of once useless swampland .
our guide , eric , told us that it all began for the family back in september 1998 when the three brothers were sitting watching rugby with their father .
when new line cinema told them they wanted to make a major film on their land , mr alexander senior told them to go away and come back when the game was over .
but when the family was told about the film in question , mr alexander reportedly said " lord of the what ?
never heard of it , i do n't know what you are talking about . "
the return of the king was a global success luckily that did n't stop him agreeing to let the team use his land .
when we arrived at the site we could see why director peter jackson was drawn to it - there was certainly a magical quality with the perfectly formed giant pine tree on the edge of a placid lake overlooked by gentle green slopes .
i asked eric if the lake had a name .
he looked at me as if i was a bit potty and said : " it 's a swamp , swamps do n't have names . "
clutching umbrellas we climbed the lush green hillside to bag end , where hobbit frodo baggins -lrb- elijah wood -rrb- lived in the film .
it was sad to see that some of the " holes " were deteriorating .
but eric reminded us that they were part of a set and as such were built to last only for a few months ; four years down the line the wood was rotting .
peter jackson took seven years to make the rings films most of the hobbit homes were just frontages .
bag end , where hobbit frodo baggins lived , was the exception ; it did have an inside but there was only enough space for a hobbit or two .
the four of us managed to squeeze in for the obligatory photo taken for us by eric .
it was n't the luxurious entrance hall you see in the film , the floor was made up of soggy wooden planks that were covered in sheep and possum droppings .
apparently each evening when the tourists stopped coming the animals turned bag end into a makeshift superloo- they obviously did n't know much about the rings films either .
according to eric we were lucky to have any of the site left at all .
sir ian mckellen 's character , gandalf , visited hobbiton the contract with new line said the land had to be restored to its original condition after filming , so a bulldozer began demolishing the hobbit holes .
but torrential rain meant the workman felt it was too dangerous to continue and he downed tools .
it was only then that the alexanders realised they were sitting on a goldmine and called a halt to the work altogether .
only 17 " holes " had survived , but it was enough to get a feel for how it must have looked when peter jackson and his team were filming there .
it 's not a large site and the driving rain might have saved the holes for posterity but it was n't conducive to lingering .
anyway the next lot of tourists had arrived in a thrifty-car-rental-shuttle-bus and as there were only so many courtesy umbrellas we had to hand ours over to them before heading back to matamata and , of course , the souvenir shop .

the return of the king was a global success luckily that did n't stop him agreeing to let the team use his land .
when we arrived at the site we could see why director peter jackson was drawn to it - there was certainly a magical quality with the perfectly formed giant pine tree on the edge of a placid lake overlooked by gentle green slopes .
i asked eric if the lake had a name .
he looked at me as if i was a bit potty and said : " it 's a swamp , swamps do n't have names . "
clutching umbrellas we climbed the lush green hillside to bag end , where hobbit frodo baggins -lrb- elijah wood -rrb- lived in the film .
it was sad to see that some of the " holes " were deteriorating .
but eric reminded us that they were part of a set and as such were built to last only for a few months ; four years down the line the wood was rotting .
peter jackson took seven years to make the rings films most of the hobbit homes were just frontages .
bag end , where hobbit frodo baggins lived , was the exception ; it did have an inside but there was only enough space for a hobbit or two .
the four of us managed to squeeze in for the obligatory photo taken for us by eric .
it was n't the luxurious entrance hall you see in the film , the floor was made up of soggy wooden planks that were covered in sheep and possum droppings .
apparently each evening when the tourists stopped coming the animals turned bag end into a makeshift superloo- they obviously did n't know much about the rings films either .
according to eric we were lucky to have any of the site left at all .
sir ian mckellen 's character , gandalf , visited hobbiton the contract with new line said the land had to be restored to its original condition after filming , so a bulldozer began demolishing the hobbit holes .
but torrential rain meant the workman felt it was too dangerous to continue and he downed tools .
it was only then that the alexanders realised they were sitting on a goldmine and called a halt to the work altogether .
only 17 " holes " had survived , but it was enough to get a feel for how it must have looked when peter jackson and his team were filming there .
it 's not a large site and the driving rain might have saved the holes for posterity but it was n't conducive to lingering .
anyway the next lot of tourists had arrived in a thrifty-car-rental-shuttle-bus and as there were only so many courtesy umbrellas we had to hand ours over to them before heading back to matamata and , of course , the souvenir shop .

the hobbiton site in new zealand has few touristic trappings if you have ever visited a major film studio in hollywood you will know how glitzy the whole experience is with tours of famous sets , and if you are lucky a glimpse of a celebrity or two .
so you might expect a similar degree of glamour when you trek to the other side of the world to middle earth to see where they filmed one of the biggest blockbusters of all time , namely lord of the rings .
but you would be in for a bit of a culture shock .
they just do n't do tinseltown in new zealand .
they have a style all their own that has more to do with rugby and farming than fame .
there was great excitement as my partner ian and two daughters tallulah , 15 and aurora , 10 , and i drove two hours south of auckland to see where movie history was made .
we had expected giant signposts , bunting and perhaps the occasional orc on the roadside to point us in the right direction .
triona holden and her family try out the hobbit lifestyle in new zealand as it turned out there was only a small cardboard sign attached to a lamppost and we missed the turning .
in our defence it 's easy to overshoot the tiny town of matamata , with a population of just over 6,000 .
it 's a sleepy place with only a few shops , that is until you eventually find your way to the tourist information centre .
the new red brick building was buzzing with activity , it was like a mini un with groups of chattering visitors from just about any country you cared to mention .
this was where rings tours was based - the company set up by the alexander family , the fortunate farmers who own the 10-acre site chosen by the director peter jackson as the site for the hobbiton village .
business was brisk with more than 250 tourists turning up every day for the tours , paying $ 50 nzd per adult and $ 25 nzd a child .
hobbit frodo left his home to save middle earth no-one was more surprised at this success than the alexanders , who have benefited hugely from their patch of once useless swampland .
our guide , eric , told us that it all began for the family back in september 1998 when the three brothers were sitting watching rugby with their father .
when new line cinema told them they wanted to make a major film on their land , mr alexander senior told them to go away and come back when the game was over .
