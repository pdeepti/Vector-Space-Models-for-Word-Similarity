program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.09.2004 new eu commission faces intense grilling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incoming eu commissioners are under the magnifying glass the eu parliament has begun questioning incoming eu commissioners , largely to sniff out potential conflicts of interests of a few wealthy members .
the hearings will determine whether the 24-member team will be accepted . tough but fair is how eu parliamentarians say they want to be , as they began grilling the first of 24 designated eu commissioners appointed by eu commission president-designate jose manuel barroso on monday . each of the members of the european union executive will face three hours of questioning by parliamentary committees on issues ranging from turkey 's membership bid , immigration , fiscal discipline and taxation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel durao barroso barroso won strong endorsement in july from the 732-member parliament , but his team still needs parliamentary approval to take office on november 1 for a five-year term .
the eu parliament can reject barroso 's entire team but not individual commissioners . most of the questioning over the next two weeks will focus on potential conflicts of interest in barroso 's team , which is considered more market friendly than the last one and includes some wealthy and influential members . all 24 commissioner-designates have to file statements of financial interests , declare their assets and fill out a questionnaire before they submit themselves to the grilling . a controversial candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes one of the most controversial members of barroso 's team to take the stand on tuesday is dutch politician and businesswoman neelie kroes , who is to succeed mario monti as the european union 's antitrust chief , arguably one of the eu 's most powerful offices . kroes , who is a member of the dutch free-market liberal party and has served two terms as minister for transport , public works and telecommunications during the 1980s , also has considerable links to big business .
she has sat on the boards of a dozen top european companies and is reported to be fabulously wealthy , owning a house in an upscale neighborhood of the hague as well as two office buildings . eu parliamentary members have already cast doubts on whether kroes can take on a job that so obviously clashes with her vested interests in the world of politics and business .
" neelie kroes was on the supervisory board of numerous companies which are directly or indirectly affected by the activities of the commission 's competition authority , " said pervenche beres , chairwoman of the parliamentary committee on economic and monetary affairs . " that 's why it 's a justified ethical issue to scrutinize her . " for her part , kroes has said she has already sold all stocks and options and resigned from company boards as well as pledged to distance herself from cases concerning firms she may have been involved in .
she also promised that if decisions are to be made by the eu antitrust authority which involve former employers , she will restrain from voting on it . but , it remains to be seen whether kroes will sufficiently convince all parliamentary members of her neutrality . conflict of interest not only sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione other incoming eu commissioners , who , like kroes , may be in for a rough ride during the interrogation include mariann fischer boel , nominee for the eu 's agriculture portfolio , and italian rocco buttiglione , assigned by barroso to be in charge of asylum and immigration policy . boel attracted the attention of eu parliamentarians because she owns land that includes a farm receiving eu subsidies and buttiglione has stirred controversy by his support for plans to set up asylum camps outside eu borders .
boel , however , has since been cleared after she sold her shares in danish sugar producer danisco . expertise of candidates also checked but it 's not just potential conflict of interest that the eu questioners are interested in .
other nagging conflict points include the political past of some commissioners from the new eastern european members as well as the expertise and experience of some incoming commissioners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen for instance , there is little doubt that german eu commissioner günter verheugen , who has been responsible for eastern european expansion so far , has gathered valuable experience when it comes to eu diplomacy and working methods .

the hearings will determine whether the 24-member team will be accepted . tough but fair is how eu parliamentarians say they want to be , as they began grilling the first of 24 designated eu commissioners appointed by eu commission president-designate jose manuel barroso on monday . each of the members of the european union executive will face three hours of questioning by parliamentary committees on issues ranging from turkey 's membership bid , immigration , fiscal discipline and taxation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel durao barroso barroso won strong endorsement in july from the 732-member parliament , but his team still needs parliamentary approval to take office on november 1 for a five-year term .
the eu parliament can reject barroso 's entire team but not individual commissioners . most of the questioning over the next two weeks will focus on potential conflicts of interest in barroso 's team , which is considered more market friendly than the last one and includes some wealthy and influential members . all 24 commissioner-designates have to file statements of financial interests , declare their assets and fill out a questionnaire before they submit themselves to the grilling . a controversial candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes one of the most controversial members of barroso 's team to take the stand on tuesday is dutch politician and businesswoman neelie kroes , who is to succeed mario monti as the european union 's antitrust chief , arguably one of the eu 's most powerful offices . kroes , who is a member of the dutch free-market liberal party and has served two terms as minister for transport , public works and telecommunications during the 1980s , also has considerable links to big business .
she has sat on the boards of a dozen top european companies and is reported to be fabulously wealthy , owning a house in an upscale neighborhood of the hague as well as two office buildings . eu parliamentary members have already cast doubts on whether kroes can take on a job that so obviously clashes with her vested interests in the world of politics and business .
" neelie kroes was on the supervisory board of numerous companies which are directly or indirectly affected by the activities of the commission 's competition authority , " said pervenche beres , chairwoman of the parliamentary committee on economic and monetary affairs . " that 's why it 's a justified ethical issue to scrutinize her . " for her part , kroes has said she has already sold all stocks and options and resigned from company boards as well as pledged to distance herself from cases concerning firms she may have been involved in .
she also promised that if decisions are to be made by the eu antitrust authority which involve former employers , she will restrain from voting on it . but , it remains to be seen whether kroes will sufficiently convince all parliamentary members of her neutrality . conflict of interest not only sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione other incoming eu commissioners , who , like kroes , may be in for a rough ride during the interrogation include mariann fischer boel , nominee for the eu 's agriculture portfolio , and italian rocco buttiglione , assigned by barroso to be in charge of asylum and immigration policy . boel attracted the attention of eu parliamentarians because she owns land that includes a farm receiving eu subsidies and buttiglione has stirred controversy by his support for plans to set up asylum camps outside eu borders .
boel , however , has since been cleared after she sold her shares in danish sugar producer danisco . expertise of candidates also checked but it 's not just potential conflict of interest that the eu questioners are interested in .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.09.2004 new eu commission faces intense grilling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incoming eu commissioners are under the magnifying glass the eu parliament has begun questioning incoming eu commissioners , largely to sniff out potential conflicts of interests of a few wealthy members .
the hearings will determine whether the 24-member team will be accepted . tough but fair is how eu parliamentarians say they want to be , as they began grilling the first of 24 designated eu commissioners appointed by eu commission president-designate jose manuel barroso on monday . each of the members of the european union executive will face three hours of questioning by parliamentary committees on issues ranging from turkey 's membership bid , immigration , fiscal discipline and taxation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel durao barroso barroso won strong endorsement in july from the 732-member parliament , but his team still needs parliamentary approval to take office on november 1 for a five-year term .
the eu parliament can reject barroso 's entire team but not individual commissioners . most of the questioning over the next two weeks will focus on potential conflicts of interest in barroso 's team , which is considered more market friendly than the last one and includes some wealthy and influential members . all 24 commissioner-designates have to file statements of financial interests , declare their assets and fill out a questionnaire before they submit themselves to the grilling . a controversial candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes one of the most controversial members of barroso 's team to take the stand on tuesday is dutch politician and businesswoman neelie kroes , who is to succeed mario monti as the european union 's antitrust chief , arguably one of the eu 's most powerful offices . kroes , who is a member of the dutch free-market liberal party and has served two terms as minister for transport , public works and telecommunications during the 1980s , also has considerable links to big business .
she has sat on the boards of a dozen top european companies and is reported to be fabulously wealthy , owning a house in an upscale neighborhood of the hague as well as two office buildings . eu parliamentary members have already cast doubts on whether kroes can take on a job that so obviously clashes with her vested interests in the world of politics and business .
" neelie kroes was on the supervisory board of numerous companies which are directly or indirectly affected by the activities of the commission 's competition authority , " said pervenche beres , chairwoman of the parliamentary committee on economic and monetary affairs . " that 's why it 's a justified ethical issue to scrutinize her . " for her part , kroes has said she has already sold all stocks and options and resigned from company boards as well as pledged to distance herself from cases concerning firms she may have been involved in .
she also promised that if decisions are to be made by the eu antitrust authority which involve former employers , she will restrain from voting on it . but , it remains to be seen whether kroes will sufficiently convince all parliamentary members of her neutrality . conflict of interest not only sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione other incoming eu commissioners , who , like kroes , may be in for a rough ride during the interrogation include mariann fischer boel , nominee for the eu 's agriculture portfolio , and italian rocco buttiglione , assigned by barroso to be in charge of asylum and immigration policy . boel attracted the attention of eu parliamentarians because she owns land that includes a farm receiving eu subsidies and buttiglione has stirred controversy by his support for plans to set up asylum camps outside eu borders .
boel , however , has since been cleared after she sold her shares in danish sugar producer danisco . expertise of candidates also checked but it 's not just potential conflict of interest that the eu questioners are interested in .
other nagging conflict points include the political past of some commissioners from the new eastern european members as well as the expertise and experience of some incoming commissioners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen for instance , there is little doubt that german eu commissioner günter verheugen , who has been responsible for eastern european expansion so far , has gathered valuable experience when it comes to eu diplomacy and working methods .

kirch had filed a 39-page complaint with a court in new york in january , accusing deutsche bank and liberty media and their chairmen of plotting the destruction of the kirch group in a bid to rid liberty media of an unwelcome rival in the german cable television market and secure fat commissions for deutsche bank .
the court found that kirch had failed to prove his case and " dimissed -lrb- the suit -rrb- for failure to state a claim , " according to a copy of the ruling made available by deutsche bank on tuesday .
the new york lawsuit was part of a long and bitter legal battle between kirch and deutsche bank since the kirch media empire collapsed in april 2002 .
the conflict dates back to comments by deutsche bank 's then chairman breuer made on television in 2002 , in which he publicly questioned the creditworthiness of the kirch group .
soon afterwards , banks refused to lend kirch any more money and kirchmedia , the main pillar of the kirch group , filed for insolvency in april 2002 .
in december , a munich court ruled in kirch 's favour , finding that breuer had violated his duty of client confidentiality .

dw-world readers comment on whether the country should join the union . i can only hope that turkey is never allowed into the eu .
it would be a disaster .
it would not only open the doors to more terrorists , it would bring racial and cultural differences to a boiling point across europe that would spell and end to eu .
a mass exodus of countries from the eu would soon ensue , thus all the hard work put towards bringing europe together would be for naught .
the very thought of turkey joining the eu is preposterous .
turkey is not a part of europe .
they share no cultural , political or social commonality with europe .
even without all of this the simple fact is that the people of europe do not want turkey to join .
this alone should be enough to prevent it from happening . - john young the most disturbing provision of the proposed laws in turkey is not the adultery issue .
it is a law which makes any criticism of the official government position on various issues -lrb- for example the armenian genocide and the occupation army in cyprus -rrb- punishable by law .
i am rather surprised at the lack of attention to such an infringement of the freedom of speech .
i thought turkey was a democracy and the eu defended and insisted on freedom of speech .
i was mistaken , as neither -lrb- turkish premier -rrb- erdogan nor the eu commissioner find this frightening law problematic . - m.g. ikossi a turkey operating within the european political parameters would be a great step towards reconciling west with the islamic world but it would signal the end to efforts to create a european state that could defend and promote our interests on the international arena .
the eu would then need to go back to the drawing table and re-define its purpose of existence as with turkey in the eu very few would feel comfortable integrating any further .
this may sound attractive for us and the uk but not so attractive to those of us who have supported the eu in expanding and achieving the critical mass for bolstering it 's economic power .
i simply hope that our leaders find a way out of this dangerous territory without enraging turkey and the us . - pantelis koul , britain i think that neither turkey nor eu is ready for turkey 's membership to eu .
the europeans are unable to get over their historical prejudice against turks and turks are in a daydream that eu membership will make them rich overnight without having to go through hard work . - sedat akkurt even though our religions might differ , we aim for the same type of life style as you do .
at the end , we are as european as you are and have always been ...
turkey 's place must definitely be in the eu . - emre sungur , usa as an outsider looking in at the one part of the first world that pays attention to more than just economic expansion , i wish for europe that you find some middle path between inexorable globalization on the one hand and crude , vicious racism on the other .
right now , europe looks neither willing to truly assimilate demographically large numbers of muslims nor able to set a boundary and choose in a humane and moral way to remain europe .
please at least recognize that obedience to the commercial logic of globalization is propelling europe into cultural changes that few in europe really want and many resent deeply , but without intelligent voicing . - kevin rooney turkey is a country that has a dynamic and strong economy , even though is has some problems .
it will recover by 2015 with the eu 's help and then this economy will turn into a dynamo for the eu .
when its comes to society , turkish people are not only the ones you see in europe - those have left turkey at least 30 years ago . - mustafa aydogan , britain while turkey was fulfilling the requirements for admission to the eu , turkey showed it had clout and would use it to advance its own self-perceived interests as an independent sovereign nation .
turkey 's conduct continually confirms it is not a compliant tool of the west .
turkey is unique in many ways beyond its geographic location .
turkey is a muslim but democratic nation .
turkey has a strong , well-equipped , and modern military that is very capable of defending the causes and advancing the interests to which it is committed .
but , since the eu has an urgent and existing necessity to defend against the ubiquitous threat of terrorism and turkey has proven itself worthy of membership to this organization , the eu needs to accept turkey as a eu member without any further delay . - donald slazinski send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey adopts key eu reforms turkey 's parliament on sunday passed a crucial package of reforms aimed at boosting the country 's chances for starting membership talks with the european union .

" bilateral relations and above all , economic interests , will be at the forefront .
the chancellor will be accompanied by representatives of large german energy companies , " a german government spokesman told dw-world .
" but norway 's relationship to the eu and oslo 's possible rapprochement with brussels will also be on the agenda , " he added . professor heiko uecker , a norway expert at the university of bonn said economics was at the heart of bilateral relations .
" gas and oil interests in particular largely define ties between norway and germany , " he told dw-world . oil and gas the focus germany currently relies on norway for 20 percent of its oil and gas needs .
following recent deals signed between oslo and berlin , that share is expected to rise to over 30 percent by 2010 , when the nordic country will replace russia as germany 's largest oil supplier .
germany remains norway 's most important export market for oil and gas . though individual german companies , among them several medium-sized industries , have set up shop in norway , german oil and energy firms have hardly made a dent in norway 's massive offshore sector : natural oil and gas company rwe / dea is the only german company to be involved in oil production and exploration in norway , though it accounts for less than one percent of total overall production . in june this year during a visit to norway , german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said it would be " exciting and sensible in the long-term " if german companies such as rwe or ruhrgas , one of the biggest customers for norwegian oil producers , were to get more oil production rights in norway . that issue is expected to be taken up by chancellor schröder on tuesday . special attention to berlin experts say that in addition to burgeoning economic ties , political relations between the two countries have never been better . stephan michael schröder , a lecturer on scandinavian studies at berlin 's humboldt university , said the second world war did strain relations .
germany invaded norway in 1940 and occupied it until the end of the war .
" it was a painful period , but both norway and postwar germany joined the nato fairly early against a common enemy and the historic rift has been forgotten .
traditionally good relations have been smooth since the 1960s . " oslo , in particular , has been at pains to cultivate close relations with germany .
in 1999 , the then social democratic norwegian government unveiled a so-called " strategy for germany , " an exhaustive report detailing areas of potential cooperation which touches upon developing intensive political , economic , cultural and scientific ties and includes measures such as encouraging norwegians to learn german , setting up an online portal on norway in german , and executing a labor exchange . " there is enormous interest in germany from the norwegian side , " said stephan michael schröder .
" there 's a lot of money flowing for academics and cultural exchange and scientific research . " wary of the eu but there remains little doubt that one of the reasons for oslo 's wooing of berlin is the country 's difficult relationship to brussels and its deep-seated reluctance to join the 25-member bloc . " the very word ' european union ' is like a bad odor in norway , " said uecker .
" it 's a young country , it does n't want to lose its independence so soon . " but it 's not just its political sovereignty that norway , which voted against eu membership in referendums in 1972 and 1994 , is scared of losing . the country , with its 4.5 million inhabitants is the world 's third-largest exporter of oil after saudi arabia and russia and one of the richest in the world .
norway is expected to pump north sea oil for another 50 years and gas for a century . the country has also been cannily funneling 80 percent of its oil revenues into a petroleum fund that is invested overseas so the benefits can be used to finance its lavish social systems for generations to come . " the prospect of eu membership , particularly after the bloc 's eastward expansion , worries many norwegians that illegal workers might come into their country and pick off their generous welfare system and that their country might become poorer , " said uecker .
neighboring eu member sweden 's thumbs-down to joining the common euro currency in a referendum last year did n't help to bolster pro-eu feelings in norway either . can norway afford to stay out ? however , near-daily eu barometer polls published in the country 's media show that norwegians may be gradually reconciling themselves to the fact that remaining on the fringes of the european union may not be a viable option in the long run . norway - along with liechtenstein , iceland and switzerland - is a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- , which provides for free movement of goods , services , capital and labor between the union and european countries that have remained outside .
but , as norway is discovering , non-membership of the eu is still costing it money in other ways . from 2004 , norway -lrb- along with iceland , another non-eu nordic country -rrb- will pay five times their present membership fee of the efta .
in addition , norway will also channel existing bilateral aid for eastern europe through the eu , so its total transfer to the union will top nkr1.7 billion -lrb- € 203 million -rrb- a year , a tenfold rise . in addition to the money , experts say norway also has to adopt directives from brussels such as export duties on fish products as its own law .
" norway just ca n't afford to remain on the sidelines in the long run because though it has to implement decisions from brussels , it has no power to influence them , " said uecker .
" they will be in the union in ten years . " germans could represent oslo 's interests germany , in the meantime , could play a vital role in representing norway 's interests in the eu on account of its location , size and clout in the club , experts say .
" right since chancellor helmut kohl 's time , the germans have always been in favor of norway joining the eu , " said uecker . " developing a so-called " northern dimension , " which includes involving oil-rich russia in european cooperation , as a counterweight to the southern part of europe is also an idea that finds resonance both in norway and germany , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union dw-world 's special dossier on eu expansion and the run-up to the historic event .

" bilateral relations and above all , economic interests , will be at the forefront .
the chancellor will be accompanied by representatives of large german energy companies , " a german government spokesman told dw-world .
" but norway 's relationship to the eu and oslo 's possible rapprochement with brussels will also be on the agenda , " he added . professor heiko uecker , a norway expert at the university of bonn said economics was at the heart of bilateral relations .
" gas and oil interests in particular largely define ties between norway and germany , " he told dw-world . oil and gas the focus germany currently relies on norway for 20 percent of its oil and gas needs .
following recent deals signed between oslo and berlin , that share is expected to rise to over 30 percent by 2010 , when the nordic country will replace russia as germany 's largest oil supplier .
germany remains norway 's most important export market for oil and gas . though individual german companies , among them several medium-sized industries , have set up shop in norway , german oil and energy firms have hardly made a dent in norway 's massive offshore sector : natural oil and gas company rwe / dea is the only german company to be involved in oil production and exploration in norway , though it accounts for less than one percent of total overall production . in june this year during a visit to norway , german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said it would be " exciting and sensible in the long-term " if german companies such as rwe or ruhrgas , one of the biggest customers for norwegian oil producers , were to get more oil production rights in norway . that issue is expected to be taken up by chancellor schröder on tuesday . special attention to berlin experts say that in addition to burgeoning economic ties , political relations between the two countries have never been better . stephan michael schröder , a lecturer on scandinavian studies at berlin 's humboldt university , said the second world war did strain relations .
germany invaded norway in 1940 and occupied it until the end of the war .
" it was a painful period , but both norway and postwar germany joined the nato fairly early against a common enemy and the historic rift has been forgotten .
traditionally good relations have been smooth since the 1960s . " oslo , in particular , has been at pains to cultivate close relations with germany .
in 1999 , the then social democratic norwegian government unveiled a so-called " strategy for germany , " an exhaustive report detailing areas of potential cooperation which touches upon developing intensive political , economic , cultural and scientific ties and includes measures such as encouraging norwegians to learn german , setting up an online portal on norway in german , and executing a labor exchange . " there is enormous interest in germany from the norwegian side , " said stephan michael schröder .
" there 's a lot of money flowing for academics and cultural exchange and scientific research . " wary of the eu but there remains little doubt that one of the reasons for oslo 's wooing of berlin is the country 's difficult relationship to brussels and its deep-seated reluctance to join the 25-member bloc . " the very word ' european union ' is like a bad odor in norway , " said uecker .
" it 's a young country , it does n't want to lose its independence so soon . " but it 's not just its political sovereignty that norway , which voted against eu membership in referendums in 1972 and 1994 , is scared of losing . the country , with its 4.5 million inhabitants is the world 's third-largest exporter of oil after saudi arabia and russia and one of the richest in the world .
norway is expected to pump north sea oil for another 50 years and gas for a century . the country has also been cannily funneling 80 percent of its oil revenues into a petroleum fund that is invested overseas so the benefits can be used to finance its lavish social systems for generations to come . " the prospect of eu membership , particularly after the bloc 's eastward expansion , worries many norwegians that illegal workers might come into their country and pick off their generous welfare system and that their country might become poorer , " said uecker .
neighboring eu member sweden 's thumbs-down to joining the common euro currency in a referendum last year did n't help to bolster pro-eu feelings in norway either . can norway afford to stay out ? however , near-daily eu barometer polls published in the country 's media show that norwegians may be gradually reconciling themselves to the fact that remaining on the fringes of the european union may not be a viable option in the long run . norway - along with liechtenstein , iceland and switzerland - is a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- , which provides for free movement of goods , services , capital and labor between the union and european countries that have remained outside .
but , as norway is discovering , non-membership of the eu is still costing it money in other ways . from 2004 , norway -lrb- along with iceland , another non-eu nordic country -rrb- will pay five times their present membership fee of the efta .
in addition , norway will also channel existing bilateral aid for eastern europe through the eu , so its total transfer to the union will top nkr1.7 billion -lrb- € 203 million -rrb- a year , a tenfold rise . in addition to the money , experts say norway also has to adopt directives from brussels such as export duties on fish products as its own law .

" bilateral relations and above all , economic interests , will be at the forefront .
the chancellor will be accompanied by representatives of large german energy companies , " a german government spokesman told dw-world .
" but norway 's relationship to the eu and oslo 's possible rapprochement with brussels will also be on the agenda , " he added . professor heiko uecker , a norway expert at the university of bonn said economics was at the heart of bilateral relations .
" gas and oil interests in particular largely define ties between norway and germany , " he told dw-world . oil and gas the focus germany currently relies on norway for 20 percent of its oil and gas needs .
following recent deals signed between oslo and berlin , that share is expected to rise to over 30 percent by 2010 , when the nordic country will replace russia as germany 's largest oil supplier .
germany remains norway 's most important export market for oil and gas . though individual german companies , among them several medium-sized industries , have set up shop in norway , german oil and energy firms have hardly made a dent in norway 's massive offshore sector : natural oil and gas company rwe / dea is the only german company to be involved in oil production and exploration in norway , though it accounts for less than one percent of total overall production . in june this year during a visit to norway , german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said it would be " exciting and sensible in the long-term " if german companies such as rwe or ruhrgas , one of the biggest customers for norwegian oil producers , were to get more oil production rights in norway . that issue is expected to be taken up by chancellor schröder on tuesday . special attention to berlin experts say that in addition to burgeoning economic ties , political relations between the two countries have never been better . stephan michael schröder , a lecturer on scandinavian studies at berlin 's humboldt university , said the second world war did strain relations .
germany invaded norway in 1940 and occupied it until the end of the war .
" it was a painful period , but both norway and postwar germany joined the nato fairly early against a common enemy and the historic rift has been forgotten .
traditionally good relations have been smooth since the 1960s . " oslo , in particular , has been at pains to cultivate close relations with germany .
in 1999 , the then social democratic norwegian government unveiled a so-called " strategy for germany , " an exhaustive report detailing areas of potential cooperation which touches upon developing intensive political , economic , cultural and scientific ties and includes measures such as encouraging norwegians to learn german , setting up an online portal on norway in german , and executing a labor exchange . " there is enormous interest in germany from the norwegian side , " said stephan michael schröder .
" there 's a lot of money flowing for academics and cultural exchange and scientific research . " wary of the eu but there remains little doubt that one of the reasons for oslo 's wooing of berlin is the country 's difficult relationship to brussels and its deep-seated reluctance to join the 25-member bloc . " the very word ' european union ' is like a bad odor in norway , " said uecker .
" it 's a young country , it does n't want to lose its independence so soon . " but it 's not just its political sovereignty that norway , which voted against eu membership in referendums in 1972 and 1994 , is scared of losing . the country , with its 4.5 million inhabitants is the world 's third-largest exporter of oil after saudi arabia and russia and one of the richest in the world .
norway is expected to pump north sea oil for another 50 years and gas for a century . the country has also been cannily funneling 80 percent of its oil revenues into a petroleum fund that is invested overseas so the benefits can be used to finance its lavish social systems for generations to come . " the prospect of eu membership , particularly after the bloc 's eastward expansion , worries many norwegians that illegal workers might come into their country and pick off their generous welfare system and that their country might become poorer , " said uecker .
neighboring eu member sweden 's thumbs-down to joining the common euro currency in a referendum last year did n't help to bolster pro-eu feelings in norway either . can norway afford to stay out ? however , near-daily eu barometer polls published in the country 's media show that norwegians may be gradually reconciling themselves to the fact that remaining on the fringes of the european union may not be a viable option in the long run . norway - along with liechtenstein , iceland and switzerland - is a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- , which provides for free movement of goods , services , capital and labor between the union and european countries that have remained outside .

experts say the new high was pushed by political instability in nigeria . crude oil futures remained above $ 50 dollars a barrel in asian trade on tuesday after breaking through the key psychological barrier as concerns over supply continued to dominate the market , dealers said .
at 2:30 pm -lrb- 0630 utc -rrb- , new york 's reference contract , light sweet crude for november delivery was at $ 50.42 a barrel , up from the record closing high of 49.64 in new york on monday .
it hit $ 50.47 in an intra-day high . analysts said factors driving prices up include unrest in nigeria and saudi arabia , hurricanes in the united states , continued violence in iraq and the legal and supply woes of russian energy giant yukos . nigerian rebels threaten war nigeria is the world 's seventh largest oil exporter , pumping out 2.3 million barrels per day .
nigerian rebels have warned oil companies to shut down production in the niger delta , or face " all-out war " starting on oct.1.
they said anyone assisting the state would be considered an enemy . the rebels are seeking to force political reforms and independence for the oil-rich , yet impoverished niger delta .
kurt barrow , a singapore-based principal at us energy consultancy purvin and gertz , said the high oil prices could also be blamed on tight supply amid strong demand from the united states , china and india which had caught the market by surprise . he said surplus production has fallen to only one million barrels of oil a day from three to five million over the past few years . threats of disruption to these already tight supplies are conspiring to keep the volatile situation boiling . " fundamentaly , there is a very tight supply-demand balance in the petroleum market , " barrow told afp , adding that any disturbances in major producers such as iraq , nigeria , russia and venezuela are bound to affect prices . prices to remain high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stacked oil drums barrow said prices are expected to remain high for some time . " much depends on what world events happen over the next six to 18 months , " he said . " our view is that the price will remain high and volatile really until some additional production come on stream , perhaps later this year or likely next year . " " once we rebuild this supply cushion , then it 's likely that prices will come back down .
until then , we expect oil prices to stay high . " barrow said hedge funds and speculative trading were acting " to exacerbate the volatility but i think that even without these you will still see high oil prices . " germany 's economics minister wolfgang clement described the high price of oil as a danger for the global economy . " they definitely pose a risk , " clement said late monday in berlin .
he added that governments must find a way to prevent oil prices from spiralling even higher due to speculation . the current oil crisis is expected to feature in tuesday 's meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder , and norwegian prime minister kjell magne bondevik .

one bishop said it was like unleashing a virus .
other european countries already allow some form of gay unions . when spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero took office in april he promised to remove the catholic church 's influence on spanish society by easing divorce rules , softening abortion laws and legalizing gay marriage .
it was the last measure that has raised the most resentment with the church .
the legislation would be like " imposing a virus on society , something false that will have negative consequences for social life , " juan antonio martinez camino , spokesman for the spanish bishops conference , told spain 's national television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church said allowing homosexuals to marry would be like unleashing a virus on society if the bill passes the cabinet , it will also need to be approved by spain 's parliament before becoming law .
the country 's previous , conservative government rebuffed several calls to legalize gay marriage during its administration .
some nations allow gay marriage although surveys show nearly half of spain 's population no longer goes to mass , enactment would still mean a social change in the largely catholic country , and bring it into the ranks of the mostly northern european countries that permit gay marriage or another legally recognized form of gay union .
in germany , gay couples have been able to register their relationships since 2001 .
over the summer , gay marriage became a nationally debated issue when the leader of the business-friendly free democratic party , guido westerwelle , acknowledged his homosexuality in july and called for more equality for gay couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- and his partner michael mronz homosexual partners should have the right to adopt any child , not only the legal child of a partner , and receive the same tax status as married couples , westerwelle said at the time .
a bill extending homosexuals ' rights , including the legalization of gay marriage , drafted in june by germany 's ruling social democratic-green party coalition government received sharp criticism from the conservative opposition , and the nation 's parliament has not yet taken action on the measure . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de being turkish and gay in germany germany may be considered a tolerant place for homosexuals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.09.2004 new eu commission faces intense grilling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incoming eu commissioners are under the magnifying glass the eu parliament has begun questioning incoming eu commissioners , largely to sniff out potential conflicts of interests of a few wealthy members .
the hearings will determine whether the 24-member team will be accepted . tough but fair is how eu parliamentarians say they want to be , as they began grilling the first of 24 designated eu commissioners appointed by eu commission president-designate jose manuel barroso on monday . each of the members of the european union executive will face three hours of questioning by parliamentary committees on issues ranging from turkey 's membership bid , immigration , fiscal discipline and taxation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel durao barroso barroso won strong endorsement in july from the 732-member parliament , but his team still needs parliamentary approval to take office on november 1 for a five-year term .
the eu parliament can reject barroso 's entire team but not individual commissioners . most of the questioning over the next two weeks will focus on potential conflicts of interest in barroso 's team , which is considered more market friendly than the last one and includes some wealthy and influential members . all 24 commissioner-designates have to file statements of financial interests , declare their assets and fill out a questionnaire before they submit themselves to the grilling . a controversial candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes one of the most controversial members of barroso 's team to take the stand on tuesday is dutch politician and businesswoman neelie kroes , who is to succeed mario monti as the european union 's antitrust chief , arguably one of the eu 's most powerful offices . kroes , who is a member of the dutch free-market liberal party and has served two terms as minister for transport , public works and telecommunications during the 1980s , also has considerable links to big business .
she has sat on the boards of a dozen top european companies and is reported to be fabulously wealthy , owning a house in an upscale neighborhood of the hague as well as two office buildings . eu parliamentary members have already cast doubts on whether kroes can take on a job that so obviously clashes with her vested interests in the world of politics and business .
" neelie kroes was on the supervisory board of numerous companies which are directly or indirectly affected by the activities of the commission 's competition authority , " said pervenche beres , chairwoman of the parliamentary committee on economic and monetary affairs . " that 's why it 's a justified ethical issue to scrutinize her . " for her part , kroes has said she has already sold all stocks and options and resigned from company boards as well as pledged to distance herself from cases concerning firms she may have been involved in .
she also promised that if decisions are to be made by the eu antitrust authority which involve former employers , she will restrain from voting on it . but , it remains to be seen whether kroes will sufficiently convince all parliamentary members of her neutrality . conflict of interest not only sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione other incoming eu commissioners , who , like kroes , may be in for a rough ride during the interrogation include mariann fischer boel , nominee for the eu 's agriculture portfolio , and italian rocco buttiglione , assigned by barroso to be in charge of asylum and immigration policy . boel attracted the attention of eu parliamentarians because she owns land that includes a farm receiving eu subsidies and buttiglione has stirred controversy by his support for plans to set up asylum camps outside eu borders .
boel , however , has since been cleared after she sold her shares in danish sugar producer danisco . expertise of candidates also checked but it 's not just potential conflict of interest that the eu questioners are interested in .
other nagging conflict points include the political past of some commissioners from the new eastern european members as well as the expertise and experience of some incoming commissioners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen for instance , there is little doubt that german eu commissioner günter verheugen , who has been responsible for eastern european expansion so far , has gathered valuable experience when it comes to eu diplomacy and working methods .
but it remains questionable whether he has the necessary skills for his new portfolio of " industries and companies , " which verheugen has agreed to take on following pressure from the german government . the chairman of the parliamentary committee on industry , research and energy , giles chichester , has said verheugen will be examined thoroughly .
verheugen is expected to be grilled on his intentions and whether he will pursue a liberal market course as well as ideas for growth and innovation within the framework of the so-called lisbon agenda , which refers to a march 2000 eu summit when eu leaders and governments agreed to make the eu " the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy by 2010 . " " i want to hear from mr verheugen , how he plans to enforce the lisbon agenda , which so far has only been talked of , but not implemented , " chichester said . the eu parliament is expected to vote on the new team by the end of october .

the hearings will determine whether the 24-member team will be accepted . tough but fair is how eu parliamentarians say they want to be , as they began grilling the first of 24 designated eu commissioners appointed by eu commission president-designate jose manuel barroso on monday . each of the members of the european union executive will face three hours of questioning by parliamentary committees on issues ranging from turkey 's membership bid , immigration , fiscal discipline and taxation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel durao barroso barroso won strong endorsement in july from the 732-member parliament , but his team still needs parliamentary approval to take office on november 1 for a five-year term .
the eu parliament can reject barroso 's entire team but not individual commissioners . most of the questioning over the next two weeks will focus on potential conflicts of interest in barroso 's team , which is considered more market friendly than the last one and includes some wealthy and influential members . all 24 commissioner-designates have to file statements of financial interests , declare their assets and fill out a questionnaire before they submit themselves to the grilling . a controversial candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes one of the most controversial members of barroso 's team to take the stand on tuesday is dutch politician and businesswoman neelie kroes , who is to succeed mario monti as the european union 's antitrust chief , arguably one of the eu 's most powerful offices . kroes , who is a member of the dutch free-market liberal party and has served two terms as minister for transport , public works and telecommunications during the 1980s , also has considerable links to big business .
she has sat on the boards of a dozen top european companies and is reported to be fabulously wealthy , owning a house in an upscale neighborhood of the hague as well as two office buildings . eu parliamentary members have already cast doubts on whether kroes can take on a job that so obviously clashes with her vested interests in the world of politics and business .
" neelie kroes was on the supervisory board of numerous companies which are directly or indirectly affected by the activities of the commission 's competition authority , " said pervenche beres , chairwoman of the parliamentary committee on economic and monetary affairs . " that 's why it 's a justified ethical issue to scrutinize her . " for her part , kroes has said she has already sold all stocks and options and resigned from company boards as well as pledged to distance herself from cases concerning firms she may have been involved in .
she also promised that if decisions are to be made by the eu antitrust authority which involve former employers , she will restrain from voting on it . but , it remains to be seen whether kroes will sufficiently convince all parliamentary members of her neutrality . conflict of interest not only sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione other incoming eu commissioners , who , like kroes , may be in for a rough ride during the interrogation include mariann fischer boel , nominee for the eu 's agriculture portfolio , and italian rocco buttiglione , assigned by barroso to be in charge of asylum and immigration policy . boel attracted the attention of eu parliamentarians because she owns land that includes a farm receiving eu subsidies and buttiglione has stirred controversy by his support for plans to set up asylum camps outside eu borders .

verheugen is expected to be grilled on his intentions and whether he will pursue a liberal market course as well as ideas for growth and innovation within the framework of the so-called lisbon agenda , which refers to a march 2000 eu summit when eu leaders and governments agreed to make the eu " the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy by 2010 .

german radio quota debate goes live netting the big fish germany -pipe- 28.09.2004 mp3 inventor wants a chat with his stereo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you like marilyn manson ?
maybe you 'll like cher as well bought the latest coldplay album and wonder what else you might like ?
four german companies are competing to offer the best online music-recommendation software .
in the mix : the inventor of the mp3 . some time in the near future , karlheinz brandenburg would like to have a conversation with his stereo .
he 'd like to tell it to play the kind of music he likes to typically hear at that time of day and what music direction it could consider .
" that ’ s a vision i ’ ve had for four or five years , " he said .
for the inventor of mp3 technology -lrb- photo -rrb- , the preferences would lean towards bach and beethoven .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlheinz brandenburg , one of the inventors of the mp3 but new software brandenburg and his colleague markus cremer have developed at germany ’ s renowned semi-public think tank , the fraunhofer institute , will enable his stereo to guide him to a 19th century string quartet he ’ s never heard of - or maybe even some björk .
in the cut-throat world of music downloading sites , the survivors will be those that offer the best service , said brandenburg .
one option aimed at adding value to a music download site : music-recommendation systems that link users to songs that fit their taste , but that they might otherwise never have come across .
like marilyn manson ?
you 'll love cher !
" the task of a piece of software to help you on one hand to make it easier to find things , on the other hand to find the unexpected , " said brandenburg in an interview with dw-world .
" to find things you like even if they weren ’ t in the same catalogue or next to each other . "
at present , four german companies are competing for the chance to help consumers match music to their tastes .
brandenburg and cremer think the answer lies in computer software that analyses the music itself .
their program , called soundslike , measures song ingredients such as rhythm , melody and instrumentalization , then recommends songs that have similar patterns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cher performing that leads to tips like billy idol ’ s “ cradle of love ” for users buying the rolling stones ’ “ sympathy for the devil . ”
but it can also lead to a recommendation of cher ’ s -lrb- left -rrb- “ alive again ” to buyers of marilyn manson ’ s version of “ tainted love . ”
“ i wouldn ’ t rule out that there are some kinks to work out , ” said brandenburg , chuckling .
brandenburg knows all about working out the kinks .
after all , years passed between the first time brandenburg compressed a digital music file of susanne vega ’ s “ uncle tom ’ s diner , ” in the mid-1980s , to the point in the mid-1990s when his mp3 technology began to take off .
he thinks soundslike technology could be ready for a company to implement in a few months .
the human touch but his competitors say the program has fundamental flaws .
it 's not the music that should be measured , but rather the consumer 's taste .
“ it ’ s not possible for a machine to differentiate between a piece of grunge music or heavy metal from the 1980s , because it looks very similar acoustically , ” daniel müllensiefen , project manager at musicline.de told dw-world .
his system , soundprofiler , features a database compiled through a mix of human suggestions and software .
after rating a list of 40 songs , ten at a time , users are given a final list that is supposed to match their tastes perfectly .
beginning at the popkomm music trade fair in berlin on sept .
29 , internet users worldwide will be allowed to test the two programs .
they can then decide which of them - or one of two others designed by hamburg-based hifind and software developer ddd systems - works the best .
the winner gets an exclusive partnership with phonoline , which provides the software to germany ’ s music download portals .
along with the internet voting , a jury of music and technology journalists will help decide who gets the contract. itunes cool to the idea but whether big names like apple or microsoft will bite is still unclear .
alex luke , director of music programming and label relations at itunes , said that apple continues to recommend songs based on what buyers have bought and what they suggest .
“ how users buy and build their collections is valuable , but it 's only one of the ways we recommend music on itunes , ” he wrote in an e-mail .
but buyer statistics and suggestions don ’ t go far enough , argues brandenburg .
" there you have the problem that ... you always get to the same mainstream music , " he said .
" we clearly didn ’ t want that to happen .
you need to have something unexpected in there . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links musicline sound profiler one of the four sites competing hi find their recommendation system is fueled by the suggestions of music composers and journalists ddd system their recommendation system , musiclens , is a mix between human suggestions and software the competition beginning sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.09.2004 new eu commission faces intense grilling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incoming eu commissioners are under the magnifying glass the eu parliament has begun questioning incoming eu commissioners , largely to sniff out potential conflicts of interests of a few wealthy members .
the hearings will determine whether the 24-member team will be accepted . tough but fair is how eu parliamentarians say they want to be , as they began grilling the first of 24 designated eu commissioners appointed by eu commission president-designate jose manuel barroso on monday . each of the members of the european union executive will face three hours of questioning by parliamentary committees on issues ranging from turkey 's membership bid , immigration , fiscal discipline and taxation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel durao barroso barroso won strong endorsement in july from the 732-member parliament , but his team still needs parliamentary approval to take office on november 1 for a five-year term .
the eu parliament can reject barroso 's entire team but not individual commissioners . most of the questioning over the next two weeks will focus on potential conflicts of interest in barroso 's team , which is considered more market friendly than the last one and includes some wealthy and influential members . all 24 commissioner-designates have to file statements of financial interests , declare their assets and fill out a questionnaire before they submit themselves to the grilling . a controversial candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes one of the most controversial members of barroso 's team to take the stand on tuesday is dutch politician and businesswoman neelie kroes , who is to succeed mario monti as the european union 's antitrust chief , arguably one of the eu 's most powerful offices . kroes , who is a member of the dutch free-market liberal party and has served two terms as minister for transport , public works and telecommunications during the 1980s , also has considerable links to big business .
she has sat on the boards of a dozen top european companies and is reported to be fabulously wealthy , owning a house in an upscale neighborhood of the hague as well as two office buildings . eu parliamentary members have already cast doubts on whether kroes can take on a job that so obviously clashes with her vested interests in the world of politics and business .
" neelie kroes was on the supervisory board of numerous companies which are directly or indirectly affected by the activities of the commission 's competition authority , " said pervenche beres , chairwoman of the parliamentary committee on economic and monetary affairs . " that 's why it 's a justified ethical issue to scrutinize her . " for her part , kroes has said she has already sold all stocks and options and resigned from company boards as well as pledged to distance herself from cases concerning firms she may have been involved in .
she also promised that if decisions are to be made by the eu antitrust authority which involve former employers , she will restrain from voting on it . but , it remains to be seen whether kroes will sufficiently convince all parliamentary members of her neutrality . conflict of interest not only sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione other incoming eu commissioners , who , like kroes , may be in for a rough ride during the interrogation include mariann fischer boel , nominee for the eu 's agriculture portfolio , and italian rocco buttiglione , assigned by barroso to be in charge of asylum and immigration policy . boel attracted the attention of eu parliamentarians because she owns land that includes a farm receiving eu subsidies and buttiglione has stirred controversy by his support for plans to set up asylum camps outside eu borders .
boel , however , has since been cleared after she sold her shares in danish sugar producer danisco . expertise of candidates also checked but it 's not just potential conflict of interest that the eu questioners are interested in .
other nagging conflict points include the political past of some commissioners from the new eastern european members as well as the expertise and experience of some incoming commissioners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen for instance , there is little doubt that german eu commissioner günter verheugen , who has been responsible for eastern european expansion so far , has gathered valuable experience when it comes to eu diplomacy and working methods .
but it remains questionable whether he has the necessary skills for his new portfolio of " industries and companies , " which verheugen has agreed to take on following pressure from the german government . the chairman of the parliamentary committee on industry , research and energy , giles chichester , has said verheugen will be examined thoroughly .
verheugen is expected to be grilled on his intentions and whether he will pursue a liberal market course as well as ideas for growth and innovation within the framework of the so-called lisbon agenda , which refers to a march 2000 eu summit when eu leaders and governments agreed to make the eu " the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy by 2010 . " " i want to hear from mr verheugen , how he plans to enforce the lisbon agenda , which so far has only been talked of , but not implemented , " chichester said . the eu parliament is expected to vote on the new team by the end of october .
the questioning of the eu commissioner-designates is public and can be followed live on the internet under www.europarl.eu.int in 19 languages . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission to focus on economic growth in its first meeting , the next eu commission set its priorities for the five-year term starting in november .

experts say the new high was pushed by political instability in nigeria . crude oil futures remained above $ 50 dollars a barrel in asian trade on tuesday after breaking through the key psychological barrier as concerns over supply continued to dominate the market , dealers said .
at 2:30 pm -lrb- 0630 utc -rrb- , new york 's reference contract , light sweet crude for november delivery was at $ 50.42 a barrel , up from the record closing high of 49.64 in new york on monday .
it hit $ 50.47 in an intra-day high . analysts said factors driving prices up include unrest in nigeria and saudi arabia , hurricanes in the united states , continued violence in iraq and the legal and supply woes of russian energy giant yukos . nigerian rebels threaten war nigeria is the world 's seventh largest oil exporter , pumping out 2.3 million barrels per day .
nigerian rebels have warned oil companies to shut down production in the niger delta , or face " all-out war " starting on oct.1.
they said anyone assisting the state would be considered an enemy . the rebels are seeking to force political reforms and independence for the oil-rich , yet impoverished niger delta .
kurt barrow , a singapore-based principal at us energy consultancy purvin and gertz , said the high oil prices could also be blamed on tight supply amid strong demand from the united states , china and india which had caught the market by surprise . he said surplus production has fallen to only one million barrels of oil a day from three to five million over the past few years . threats of disruption to these already tight supplies are conspiring to keep the volatile situation boiling . " fundamentaly , there is a very tight supply-demand balance in the petroleum market , " barrow told afp , adding that any disturbances in major producers such as iraq , nigeria , russia and venezuela are bound to affect prices . prices to remain high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stacked oil drums barrow said prices are expected to remain high for some time . " much depends on what world events happen over the next six to 18 months , " he said . " our view is that the price will remain high and volatile really until some additional production come on stream , perhaps later this year or likely next year . " " once we rebuild this supply cushion , then it 's likely that prices will come back down .
until then , we expect oil prices to stay high . " barrow said hedge funds and speculative trading were acting " to exacerbate the volatility but i think that even without these you will still see high oil prices . " germany 's economics minister wolfgang clement described the high price of oil as a danger for the global economy . " they definitely pose a risk , " clement said late monday in berlin .
he added that governments must find a way to prevent oil prices from spiralling even higher due to speculation . the current oil crisis is expected to feature in tuesday 's meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder , and norwegian prime minister kjell magne bondevik .

dw-world readers comment on whether the country should join the union . i can only hope that turkey is never allowed into the eu .
it would be a disaster .
it would not only open the doors to more terrorists , it would bring racial and cultural differences to a boiling point across europe that would spell and end to eu .
a mass exodus of countries from the eu would soon ensue , thus all the hard work put towards bringing europe together would be for naught .
the very thought of turkey joining the eu is preposterous .
turkey is not a part of europe .
they share no cultural , political or social commonality with europe .
even without all of this the simple fact is that the people of europe do not want turkey to join .
this alone should be enough to prevent it from happening . - john young the most disturbing provision of the proposed laws in turkey is not the adultery issue .
it is a law which makes any criticism of the official government position on various issues -lrb- for example the armenian genocide and the occupation army in cyprus -rrb- punishable by law .
i am rather surprised at the lack of attention to such an infringement of the freedom of speech .
i thought turkey was a democracy and the eu defended and insisted on freedom of speech .
i was mistaken , as neither -lrb- turkish premier -rrb- erdogan nor the eu commissioner find this frightening law problematic . - m.g. ikossi a turkey operating within the european political parameters would be a great step towards reconciling west with the islamic world but it would signal the end to efforts to create a european state that could defend and promote our interests on the international arena .
the eu would then need to go back to the drawing table and re-define its purpose of existence as with turkey in the eu very few would feel comfortable integrating any further .
this may sound attractive for us and the uk but not so attractive to those of us who have supported the eu in expanding and achieving the critical mass for bolstering it 's economic power .
i simply hope that our leaders find a way out of this dangerous territory without enraging turkey and the us . - pantelis koul , britain i think that neither turkey nor eu is ready for turkey 's membership to eu .
the europeans are unable to get over their historical prejudice against turks and turks are in a daydream that eu membership will make them rich overnight without having to go through hard work . - sedat akkurt even though our religions might differ , we aim for the same type of life style as you do .
at the end , we are as european as you are and have always been ...
turkey 's place must definitely be in the eu . - emre sungur , usa as an outsider looking in at the one part of the first world that pays attention to more than just economic expansion , i wish for europe that you find some middle path between inexorable globalization on the one hand and crude , vicious racism on the other .
right now , europe looks neither willing to truly assimilate demographically large numbers of muslims nor able to set a boundary and choose in a humane and moral way to remain europe .

german radio quota debate goes live netting the big fish germany -pipe- 28.09.2004 mp3 inventor wants a chat with his stereo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you like marilyn manson ?
maybe you 'll like cher as well bought the latest coldplay album and wonder what else you might like ?
four german companies are competing to offer the best online music-recommendation software .
in the mix : the inventor of the mp3 . some time in the near future , karlheinz brandenburg would like to have a conversation with his stereo .
he 'd like to tell it to play the kind of music he likes to typically hear at that time of day and what music direction it could consider .
" that ’ s a vision i ’ ve had for four or five years , " he said .
for the inventor of mp3 technology -lrb- photo -rrb- , the preferences would lean towards bach and beethoven .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlheinz brandenburg , one of the inventors of the mp3 but new software brandenburg and his colleague markus cremer have developed at germany ’ s renowned semi-public think tank , the fraunhofer institute , will enable his stereo to guide him to a 19th century string quartet he ’ s never heard of - or maybe even some björk .
in the cut-throat world of music downloading sites , the survivors will be those that offer the best service , said brandenburg .
one option aimed at adding value to a music download site : music-recommendation systems that link users to songs that fit their taste , but that they might otherwise never have come across .
like marilyn manson ?
you 'll love cher !
" the task of a piece of software to help you on one hand to make it easier to find things , on the other hand to find the unexpected , " said brandenburg in an interview with dw-world .
" to find things you like even if they weren ’ t in the same catalogue or next to each other . "
at present , four german companies are competing for the chance to help consumers match music to their tastes .
brandenburg and cremer think the answer lies in computer software that analyses the music itself .
their program , called soundslike , measures song ingredients such as rhythm , melody and instrumentalization , then recommends songs that have similar patterns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cher performing that leads to tips like billy idol ’ s “ cradle of love ” for users buying the rolling stones ’ “ sympathy for the devil . ”
but it can also lead to a recommendation of cher ’ s -lrb- left -rrb- “ alive again ” to buyers of marilyn manson ’ s version of “ tainted love . ”
“ i wouldn ’ t rule out that there are some kinks to work out , ” said brandenburg , chuckling .
brandenburg knows all about working out the kinks .
after all , years passed between the first time brandenburg compressed a digital music file of susanne vega ’ s “ uncle tom ’ s diner , ” in the mid-1980s , to the point in the mid-1990s when his mp3 technology began to take off .
he thinks soundslike technology could be ready for a company to implement in a few months .
the human touch but his competitors say the program has fundamental flaws .
it 's not the music that should be measured , but rather the consumer 's taste .
“ it ’ s not possible for a machine to differentiate between a piece of grunge music or heavy metal from the 1980s , because it looks very similar acoustically , ” daniel müllensiefen , project manager at musicline.de told dw-world .
his system , soundprofiler , features a database compiled through a mix of human suggestions and software .
after rating a list of 40 songs , ten at a time , users are given a final list that is supposed to match their tastes perfectly .
beginning at the popkomm music trade fair in berlin on sept .
29 , internet users worldwide will be allowed to test the two programs .
they can then decide which of them - or one of two others designed by hamburg-based hifind and software developer ddd systems - works the best .
the winner gets an exclusive partnership with phonoline , which provides the software to germany ’ s music download portals .
along with the internet voting , a jury of music and technology journalists will help decide who gets the contract. itunes cool to the idea but whether big names like apple or microsoft will bite is still unclear .
alex luke , director of music programming and label relations at itunes , said that apple continues to recommend songs based on what buyers have bought and what they suggest .
“ how users buy and build their collections is valuable , but it 's only one of the ways we recommend music on itunes , ” he wrote in an e-mail .
but buyer statistics and suggestions don ’ t go far enough , argues brandenburg .
" there you have the problem that ... you always get to the same mainstream music , " he said .
" we clearly didn ’ t want that to happen .
you need to have something unexpected in there . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links musicline sound profiler one of the four sites competing hi find their recommendation system is fueled by the suggestions of music composers and journalists ddd system their recommendation system , musiclens , is a mix between human suggestions and software the competition beginning sept .
30 , you can test out each system and vote for your favorite feedback would you trust a computer to lead you to good songs ?

" bilateral relations and above all , economic interests , will be at the forefront .
the chancellor will be accompanied by representatives of large german energy companies , " a german government spokesman told dw-world .
" but norway 's relationship to the eu and oslo 's possible rapprochement with brussels will also be on the agenda , " he added . professor heiko uecker , a norway expert at the university of bonn said economics was at the heart of bilateral relations .
" gas and oil interests in particular largely define ties between norway and germany , " he told dw-world . oil and gas the focus germany currently relies on norway for 20 percent of its oil and gas needs .
following recent deals signed between oslo and berlin , that share is expected to rise to over 30 percent by 2010 , when the nordic country will replace russia as germany 's largest oil supplier .
germany remains norway 's most important export market for oil and gas . though individual german companies , among them several medium-sized industries , have set up shop in norway , german oil and energy firms have hardly made a dent in norway 's massive offshore sector : natural oil and gas company rwe / dea is the only german company to be involved in oil production and exploration in norway , though it accounts for less than one percent of total overall production . in june this year during a visit to norway , german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said it would be " exciting and sensible in the long-term " if german companies such as rwe or ruhrgas , one of the biggest customers for norwegian oil producers , were to get more oil production rights in norway . that issue is expected to be taken up by chancellor schröder on tuesday . special attention to berlin experts say that in addition to burgeoning economic ties , political relations between the two countries have never been better . stephan michael schröder , a lecturer on scandinavian studies at berlin 's humboldt university , said the second world war did strain relations .
germany invaded norway in 1940 and occupied it until the end of the war .
" it was a painful period , but both norway and postwar germany joined the nato fairly early against a common enemy and the historic rift has been forgotten .
traditionally good relations have been smooth since the 1960s . " oslo , in particular , has been at pains to cultivate close relations with germany .
in 1999 , the then social democratic norwegian government unveiled a so-called " strategy for germany , " an exhaustive report detailing areas of potential cooperation which touches upon developing intensive political , economic , cultural and scientific ties and includes measures such as encouraging norwegians to learn german , setting up an online portal on norway in german , and executing a labor exchange . " there is enormous interest in germany from the norwegian side , " said stephan michael schröder .
" there 's a lot of money flowing for academics and cultural exchange and scientific research . " wary of the eu but there remains little doubt that one of the reasons for oslo 's wooing of berlin is the country 's difficult relationship to brussels and its deep-seated reluctance to join the 25-member bloc . " the very word ' european union ' is like a bad odor in norway , " said uecker .
" it 's a young country , it does n't want to lose its independence so soon . " but it 's not just its political sovereignty that norway , which voted against eu membership in referendums in 1972 and 1994 , is scared of losing . the country , with its 4.5 million inhabitants is the world 's third-largest exporter of oil after saudi arabia and russia and one of the richest in the world .
norway is expected to pump north sea oil for another 50 years and gas for a century . the country has also been cannily funneling 80 percent of its oil revenues into a petroleum fund that is invested overseas so the benefits can be used to finance its lavish social systems for generations to come . " the prospect of eu membership , particularly after the bloc 's eastward expansion , worries many norwegians that illegal workers might come into their country and pick off their generous welfare system and that their country might become poorer , " said uecker .
neighboring eu member sweden 's thumbs-down to joining the common euro currency in a referendum last year did n't help to bolster pro-eu feelings in norway either . can norway afford to stay out ? however , near-daily eu barometer polls published in the country 's media show that norwegians may be gradually reconciling themselves to the fact that remaining on the fringes of the european union may not be a viable option in the long run . norway - along with liechtenstein , iceland and switzerland - is a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- , which provides for free movement of goods , services , capital and labor between the union and european countries that have remained outside .
but , as norway is discovering , non-membership of the eu is still costing it money in other ways . from 2004 , norway -lrb- along with iceland , another non-eu nordic country -rrb- will pay five times their present membership fee of the efta .
in addition , norway will also channel existing bilateral aid for eastern europe through the eu , so its total transfer to the union will top nkr1.7 billion -lrb- € 203 million -rrb- a year , a tenfold rise . in addition to the money , experts say norway also has to adopt directives from brussels such as export duties on fish products as its own law .
" norway just ca n't afford to remain on the sidelines in the long run because though it has to implement decisions from brussels , it has no power to influence them , " said uecker .
" they will be in the union in ten years . " germans could represent oslo 's interests germany , in the meantime , could play a vital role in representing norway 's interests in the eu on account of its location , size and clout in the club , experts say .
" right since chancellor helmut kohl 's time , the germans have always been in favor of norway joining the eu , " said uecker . " developing a so-called " northern dimension , " which includes involving oil-rich russia in european cooperation , as a counterweight to the southern part of europe is also an idea that finds resonance both in norway and germany , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union dw-world 's special dossier on eu expansion and the run-up to the historic event .

plenty of german taxpayers ' money is senselessly spent on pet projects and there 's overspending ripe to be cut from the nation 's budget , according to a watchdog group . whether it was laser light and intergalactic roller coasters at bremen 's now bankrupt space park -lrb- € 197 million or $ 243 million -rrb- , a multicultural center turned disco temple in halle -lrb- € 4.6 million -rrb- or € 46 million companies waste jumping though bureaucratic hoops each year , the german taxpayer association brought these and other cases of squandered money - totaling € 30 billion , about 5 percent of all money the state spends - to light in a press conference tuesday .
a road that leads nowhere , a bus stop on a street with no bus lines and military jets the army does n't need are among the 111 cases of money being thrown out the window that fill the 32ned edition of the association 's " black book . "
the fact that no one in the town of hagen realized there was € 127,000 worth of marriage license fees sitting in a desk drawer instead of a bank account earning interest was n't one of the book 's major finds , but a typical example for how money is wasted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public 's money is thrown away in many different ways " there 's an incredible thoughtlessness , a hey-it 's-not-my-money mentality , " said association president karl heinz däke , who also called for creating new ways to prosecute civil servants caught wasting money .
" there is a system of collective irresponsibility , " he said .
plenty of ways to waste money another case mentioned in the book was german tv , a pay-per-view german language service shown in the united states that cost the government € 20 million .
it 's having difficulty finding subscribers and the taxpayer association believes it wo n't last much longer .
german tv is a joint project of german public broadcasters ard and zdf and deutsche welle .
then there 's the rider-information system .
after investing € 5.2 million , the system should have informed bus riders about delays and cancellations via a satellite system , but software problems kept the users from being able to use the information panels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you mean we still do n't have any blueprints ?
project overruns resulted in many expensive mistakes , the association said - such as the german labor office 's virtual job market , which cost € 33 million more than the € 65 million set aside for the project .
construction delays and design changes for a police headquaters in frankfurt cost the state € 38 million because there were no finished plans when building began in 1998 .
dieter ondracek , head of germany 's tax union , said he doubted the veracity of the book 's figures after errors were found in last year 's edition and labor unions called the book 's figures , which the association bases on official calculations as well as media reports , exaggerated . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germans abuse state system amid continuing protests over benefit cuts , chancellor schröder has sharply criticized his countrymen who he says take more than their fair share of state allowances .
the comments have raised the ire of social groups .

" bilateral relations and above all , economic interests , will be at the forefront .
the chancellor will be accompanied by representatives of large german energy companies , " a german government spokesman told dw-world .
" but norway 's relationship to the eu and oslo 's possible rapprochement with brussels will also be on the agenda , " he added . professor heiko uecker , a norway expert at the university of bonn said economics was at the heart of bilateral relations .
" gas and oil interests in particular largely define ties between norway and germany , " he told dw-world . oil and gas the focus germany currently relies on norway for 20 percent of its oil and gas needs .
following recent deals signed between oslo and berlin , that share is expected to rise to over 30 percent by 2010 , when the nordic country will replace russia as germany 's largest oil supplier .
germany remains norway 's most important export market for oil and gas . though individual german companies , among them several medium-sized industries , have set up shop in norway , german oil and energy firms have hardly made a dent in norway 's massive offshore sector : natural oil and gas company rwe / dea is the only german company to be involved in oil production and exploration in norway , though it accounts for less than one percent of total overall production . in june this year during a visit to norway , german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said it would be " exciting and sensible in the long-term " if german companies such as rwe or ruhrgas , one of the biggest customers for norwegian oil producers , were to get more oil production rights in norway . that issue is expected to be taken up by chancellor schröder on tuesday . special attention to berlin experts say that in addition to burgeoning economic ties , political relations between the two countries have never been better . stephan michael schröder , a lecturer on scandinavian studies at berlin 's humboldt university , said the second world war did strain relations .
germany invaded norway in 1940 and occupied it until the end of the war .
" it was a painful period , but both norway and postwar germany joined the nato fairly early against a common enemy and the historic rift has been forgotten .
traditionally good relations have been smooth since the 1960s . " oslo , in particular , has been at pains to cultivate close relations with germany .
in 1999 , the then social democratic norwegian government unveiled a so-called " strategy for germany , " an exhaustive report detailing areas of potential cooperation which touches upon developing intensive political , economic , cultural and scientific ties and includes measures such as encouraging norwegians to learn german , setting up an online portal on norway in german , and executing a labor exchange . " there is enormous interest in germany from the norwegian side , " said stephan michael schröder .
" there 's a lot of money flowing for academics and cultural exchange and scientific research . " wary of the eu but there remains little doubt that one of the reasons for oslo 's wooing of berlin is the country 's difficult relationship to brussels and its deep-seated reluctance to join the 25-member bloc . " the very word ' european union ' is like a bad odor in norway , " said uecker .
" it 's a young country , it does n't want to lose its independence so soon . " but it 's not just its political sovereignty that norway , which voted against eu membership in referendums in 1972 and 1994 , is scared of losing . the country , with its 4.5 million inhabitants is the world 's third-largest exporter of oil after saudi arabia and russia and one of the richest in the world .
norway is expected to pump north sea oil for another 50 years and gas for a century . the country has also been cannily funneling 80 percent of its oil revenues into a petroleum fund that is invested overseas so the benefits can be used to finance its lavish social systems for generations to come . " the prospect of eu membership , particularly after the bloc 's eastward expansion , worries many norwegians that illegal workers might come into their country and pick off their generous welfare system and that their country might become poorer , " said uecker .
neighboring eu member sweden 's thumbs-down to joining the common euro currency in a referendum last year did n't help to bolster pro-eu feelings in norway either . can norway afford to stay out ? however , near-daily eu barometer polls published in the country 's media show that norwegians may be gradually reconciling themselves to the fact that remaining on the fringes of the european union may not be a viable option in the long run . norway - along with liechtenstein , iceland and switzerland - is a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- , which provides for free movement of goods , services , capital and labor between the union and european countries that have remained outside .
but , as norway is discovering , non-membership of the eu is still costing it money in other ways . from 2004 , norway -lrb- along with iceland , another non-eu nordic country -rrb- will pay five times their present membership fee of the efta .
in addition , norway will also channel existing bilateral aid for eastern europe through the eu , so its total transfer to the union will top nkr1.7 billion -lrb- € 203 million -rrb- a year , a tenfold rise . in addition to the money , experts say norway also has to adopt directives from brussels such as export duties on fish products as its own law .
" norway just ca n't afford to remain on the sidelines in the long run because though it has to implement decisions from brussels , it has no power to influence them , " said uecker .
" they will be in the union in ten years . " germans could represent oslo 's interests germany , in the meantime , could play a vital role in representing norway 's interests in the eu on account of its location , size and clout in the club , experts say .
" right since chancellor helmut kohl 's time , the germans have always been in favor of norway joining the eu , " said uecker . " developing a so-called " northern dimension , " which includes involving oil-rich russia in european cooperation , as a counterweight to the southern part of europe is also an idea that finds resonance both in norway and germany , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union dw-world 's special dossier on eu expansion and the run-up to the historic event .

german radio quota debate goes live netting the big fish germany -pipe- 28.09.2004 mp3 inventor wants a chat with his stereo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you like marilyn manson ?
maybe you 'll like cher as well bought the latest coldplay album and wonder what else you might like ?
four german companies are competing to offer the best online music-recommendation software .
in the mix : the inventor of the mp3 . some time in the near future , karlheinz brandenburg would like to have a conversation with his stereo .
he 'd like to tell it to play the kind of music he likes to typically hear at that time of day and what music direction it could consider .
" that ’ s a vision i ’ ve had for four or five years , " he said .
for the inventor of mp3 technology -lrb- photo -rrb- , the preferences would lean towards bach and beethoven .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlheinz brandenburg , one of the inventors of the mp3 but new software brandenburg and his colleague markus cremer have developed at germany ’ s renowned semi-public think tank , the fraunhofer institute , will enable his stereo to guide him to a 19th century string quartet he ’ s never heard of - or maybe even some björk .
in the cut-throat world of music downloading sites , the survivors will be those that offer the best service , said brandenburg .
one option aimed at adding value to a music download site : music-recommendation systems that link users to songs that fit their taste , but that they might otherwise never have come across .
like marilyn manson ?
you 'll love cher !
" the task of a piece of software to help you on one hand to make it easier to find things , on the other hand to find the unexpected , " said brandenburg in an interview with dw-world .
" to find things you like even if they weren ’ t in the same catalogue or next to each other . "
at present , four german companies are competing for the chance to help consumers match music to their tastes .
brandenburg and cremer think the answer lies in computer software that analyses the music itself .
their program , called soundslike , measures song ingredients such as rhythm , melody and instrumentalization , then recommends songs that have similar patterns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cher performing that leads to tips like billy idol ’ s “ cradle of love ” for users buying the rolling stones ’ “ sympathy for the devil . ”
but it can also lead to a recommendation of cher ’ s -lrb- left -rrb- “ alive again ” to buyers of marilyn manson ’ s version of “ tainted love . ”
“ i wouldn ’ t rule out that there are some kinks to work out , ” said brandenburg , chuckling .
brandenburg knows all about working out the kinks .
after all , years passed between the first time brandenburg compressed a digital music file of susanne vega ’ s “ uncle tom ’ s diner , ” in the mid-1980s , to the point in the mid-1990s when his mp3 technology began to take off .
he thinks soundslike technology could be ready for a company to implement in a few months .
the human touch but his competitors say the program has fundamental flaws .
it 's not the music that should be measured , but rather the consumer 's taste .
“ it ’ s not possible for a machine to differentiate between a piece of grunge music or heavy metal from the 1980s , because it looks very similar acoustically , ” daniel müllensiefen , project manager at musicline.de told dw-world .
his system , soundprofiler , features a database compiled through a mix of human suggestions and software .
after rating a list of 40 songs , ten at a time , users are given a final list that is supposed to match their tastes perfectly .
beginning at the popkomm music trade fair in berlin on sept .
29 , internet users worldwide will be allowed to test the two programs .
they can then decide which of them - or one of two others designed by hamburg-based hifind and software developer ddd systems - works the best .
the winner gets an exclusive partnership with phonoline , which provides the software to germany ’ s music download portals .
along with the internet voting , a jury of music and technology journalists will help decide who gets the contract. itunes cool to the idea but whether big names like apple or microsoft will bite is still unclear .
alex luke , director of music programming and label relations at itunes , said that apple continues to recommend songs based on what buyers have bought and what they suggest .
“ how users buy and build their collections is valuable , but it 's only one of the ways we recommend music on itunes , ” he wrote in an e-mail .
but buyer statistics and suggestions don ’ t go far enough , argues brandenburg .
" there you have the problem that ... you always get to the same mainstream music , " he said .
" we clearly didn ’ t want that to happen .
you need to have something unexpected in there .

kirch had filed a 39-page complaint with a court in new york in january , accusing deutsche bank and liberty media and their chairmen of plotting the destruction of the kirch group in a bid to rid liberty media of an unwelcome rival in the german cable television market and secure fat commissions for deutsche bank .
the court found that kirch had failed to prove his case and " dimissed -lrb- the suit -rrb- for failure to state a claim , " according to a copy of the ruling made available by deutsche bank on tuesday .
the new york lawsuit was part of a long and bitter legal battle between kirch and deutsche bank since the kirch media empire collapsed in april 2002 .
the conflict dates back to comments by deutsche bank 's then chairman breuer made on television in 2002 , in which he publicly questioned the creditworthiness of the kirch group .
soon afterwards , banks refused to lend kirch any more money and kirchmedia , the main pillar of the kirch group , filed for insolvency in april 2002 .
in december , a munich court ruled in kirch 's favour , finding that breuer had violated his duty of client confidentiality .

" we must get away from this fixation on the monday demonstrations , " attack member peter wahl told the berlin daily tagesspiegel .
" the west has not reacted .
the spark has n't carried over . " in an interview with the paper published on tuesday , wahl said people in eastern germany would n't achieve anything if they continued to protest without the support of the west . dwindling numbers a month ago , attac estimated that as many as 150,000 people nation-wide were taking part in the protests .
but this week , that number had dwindled to just 10,000 .
about 1,600 people protested in berlin in two separate marches .
in dresden , police said only 500 people turned out . last week , the other major protest organizer , service union verdi , withdrew its support for the demos . chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens has held firm in the face of pressure from protesters , refusing to abandon the package of reforms known as hartz iv . some analysts have said the government 's stance has helped it to stave off further losses in regional and local elections , especially in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , where voters appeared to have taken on board the spd 's message that the opposition parties would be just as tough - if not tougher - on the issue of reforms . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fewer germans protest against reforms tens of thousands of germans hit the streets again late monday , particularly in the poorer east , in protest against the government 's job market reforms , ahead of two key state elections this weekend .

experts say the new high was pushed by political instability in nigeria . crude oil futures remained above $ 50 dollars a barrel in asian trade on tuesday after breaking through the key psychological barrier as concerns over supply continued to dominate the market , dealers said .

it hit $ 50.47 in an intra-day high . analysts said factors driving prices up include unrest in nigeria and saudi arabia , hurricanes in the united states , continued violence in iraq and the legal and supply woes of russian energy giant yukos . nigerian rebels threaten war nigeria is the world 's seventh largest oil exporter , pumping out 2.3 million barrels per day .
nigerian rebels have warned oil companies to shut down production in the niger delta , or face " all-out war " starting on oct.1.
they said anyone assisting the state would be considered an enemy . the rebels are seeking to force political reforms and independence for the oil-rich , yet impoverished niger delta .
kurt barrow , a singapore-based principal at us energy consultancy purvin and gertz , said the high oil prices could also be blamed on tight supply amid strong demand from the united states , china and india which had caught the market by surprise . he said surplus production has fallen to only one million barrels of oil a day from three to five million over the past few years . threats of disruption to these already tight supplies are conspiring to keep the volatile situation boiling . " fundamentaly , there is a very tight supply-demand balance in the petroleum market , " barrow told afp , adding that any disturbances in major producers such as iraq , nigeria , russia and venezuela are bound to affect prices . prices to remain high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stacked oil drums barrow said prices are expected to remain high for some time . " much depends on what world events happen over the next six to 18 months , " he said .

" " once we rebuild this supply cushion , then it 's likely that prices will come back down .
until then , we expect oil prices to stay high . " barrow said hedge funds and speculative trading were acting " to exacerbate the volatility but i think that even without these you will still see high oil prices . " germany 's economics minister wolfgang clement described the high price of oil as a danger for the global economy . " they definitely pose a risk , " clement said late monday in berlin .
he added that governments must find a way to prevent oil prices from spiralling even higher due to speculation . the current oil crisis is expected to feature in tuesday 's meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder , and norwegian prime minister kjell magne bondevik .

german radio quota debate goes live netting the big fish germany -pipe- 28.09.2004 mp3 inventor wants a chat with his stereo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you like marilyn manson ?
maybe you 'll like cher as well bought the latest coldplay album and wonder what else you might like ?
four german companies are competing to offer the best online music-recommendation software .
in the mix : the inventor of the mp3 . some time in the near future , karlheinz brandenburg would like to have a conversation with his stereo .
he 'd like to tell it to play the kind of music he likes to typically hear at that time of day and what music direction it could consider .
" that ’ s a vision i ’ ve had for four or five years , " he said .
for the inventor of mp3 technology -lrb- photo -rrb- , the preferences would lean towards bach and beethoven .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlheinz brandenburg , one of the inventors of the mp3 but new software brandenburg and his colleague markus cremer have developed at germany ’ s renowned semi-public think tank , the fraunhofer institute , will enable his stereo to guide him to a 19th century string quartet he ’ s never heard of - or maybe even some björk .
in the cut-throat world of music downloading sites , the survivors will be those that offer the best service , said brandenburg .
one option aimed at adding value to a music download site : music-recommendation systems that link users to songs that fit their taste , but that they might otherwise never have come across .
like marilyn manson ?
you 'll love cher !
" the task of a piece of software to help you on one hand to make it easier to find things , on the other hand to find the unexpected , " said brandenburg in an interview with dw-world .
" to find things you like even if they weren ’ t in the same catalogue or next to each other . "
at present , four german companies are competing for the chance to help consumers match music to their tastes .
brandenburg and cremer think the answer lies in computer software that analyses the music itself .
their program , called soundslike , measures song ingredients such as rhythm , melody and instrumentalization , then recommends songs that have similar patterns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cher performing that leads to tips like billy idol ’ s “ cradle of love ” for users buying the rolling stones ’ “ sympathy for the devil . ”
but it can also lead to a recommendation of cher ’ s -lrb- left -rrb- “ alive again ” to buyers of marilyn manson ’ s version of “ tainted love . ”
“ i wouldn ’ t rule out that there are some kinks to work out , ” said brandenburg , chuckling .
brandenburg knows all about working out the kinks .
after all , years passed between the first time brandenburg compressed a digital music file of susanne vega ’ s “ uncle tom ’ s diner , ” in the mid-1980s , to the point in the mid-1990s when his mp3 technology began to take off .
he thinks soundslike technology could be ready for a company to implement in a few months .
the human touch but his competitors say the program has fundamental flaws .
it 's not the music that should be measured , but rather the consumer 's taste .
“ it ’ s not possible for a machine to differentiate between a piece of grunge music or heavy metal from the 1980s , because it looks very similar acoustically , ” daniel müllensiefen , project manager at musicline.de told dw-world .
his system , soundprofiler , features a database compiled through a mix of human suggestions and software .
after rating a list of 40 songs , ten at a time , users are given a final list that is supposed to match their tastes perfectly .
beginning at the popkomm music trade fair in berlin on sept .
29 , internet users worldwide will be allowed to test the two programs .
they can then decide which of them - or one of two others designed by hamburg-based hifind and software developer ddd systems - works the best .
the winner gets an exclusive partnership with phonoline , which provides the software to germany ’ s music download portals .
along with the internet voting , a jury of music and technology journalists will help decide who gets the contract. itunes cool to the idea but whether big names like apple or microsoft will bite is still unclear .
alex luke , director of music programming and label relations at itunes , said that apple continues to recommend songs based on what buyers have bought and what they suggest .
“ how users buy and build their collections is valuable , but it 's only one of the ways we recommend music on itunes , ” he wrote in an e-mail .
but buyer statistics and suggestions don ’ t go far enough , argues brandenburg .
" there you have the problem that ... you always get to the same mainstream music , " he said .
" we clearly didn ’ t want that to happen .
you need to have something unexpected in there . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links musicline sound profiler one of the four sites competing hi find their recommendation system is fueled by the suggestions of music composers and journalists ddd system their recommendation system , musiclens , is a mix between human suggestions and software the competition beginning sept .
30 , you can test out each system and vote for your favorite feedback would you trust a computer to lead you to good songs ?

the hearings will determine whether the 24-member team will be accepted . tough but fair is how eu parliamentarians say they want to be , as they began grilling the first of 24 designated eu commissioners appointed by eu commission president-designate jose manuel barroso on monday . each of the members of the european union executive will face three hours of questioning by parliamentary committees on issues ranging from turkey 's membership bid , immigration , fiscal discipline and taxation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel durao barroso barroso won strong endorsement in july from the 732-member parliament , but his team still needs parliamentary approval to take office on november 1 for a five-year term .
the eu parliament can reject barroso 's entire team but not individual commissioners . most of the questioning over the next two weeks will focus on potential conflicts of interest in barroso 's team , which is considered more market friendly than the last one and includes some wealthy and influential members . all 24 commissioner-designates have to file statements of financial interests , declare their assets and fill out a questionnaire before they submit themselves to the grilling . a controversial candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes one of the most controversial members of barroso 's team to take the stand on tuesday is dutch politician and businesswoman neelie kroes , who is to succeed mario monti as the european union 's antitrust chief , arguably one of the eu 's most powerful offices . kroes , who is a member of the dutch free-market liberal party and has served two terms as minister for transport , public works and telecommunications during the 1980s , also has considerable links to big business .
she has sat on the boards of a dozen top european companies and is reported to be fabulously wealthy , owning a house in an upscale neighborhood of the hague as well as two office buildings . eu parliamentary members have already cast doubts on whether kroes can take on a job that so obviously clashes with her vested interests in the world of politics and business .
" neelie kroes was on the supervisory board of numerous companies which are directly or indirectly affected by the activities of the commission 's competition authority , " said pervenche beres , chairwoman of the parliamentary committee on economic and monetary affairs . " that 's why it 's a justified ethical issue to scrutinize her . " for her part , kroes has said she has already sold all stocks and options and resigned from company boards as well as pledged to distance herself from cases concerning firms she may have been involved in .

boel , however , has since been cleared after she sold her shares in danish sugar producer danisco . expertise of candidates also checked but it 's not just potential conflict of interest that the eu questioners are interested in .
other nagging conflict points include the political past of some commissioners from the new eastern european members as well as the expertise and experience of some incoming commissioners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen for instance , there is little doubt that german eu commissioner günter verheugen , who has been responsible for eastern european expansion so far , has gathered valuable experience when it comes to eu diplomacy and working methods .
but it remains questionable whether he has the necessary skills for his new portfolio of " industries and companies , " which verheugen has agreed to take on following pressure from the german government . the chairman of the parliamentary committee on industry , research and energy , giles chichester , has said verheugen will be examined thoroughly .
verheugen is expected to be grilled on his intentions and whether he will pursue a liberal market course as well as ideas for growth and innovation within the framework of the so-called lisbon agenda , which refers to a march 2000 eu summit when eu leaders and governments agreed to make the eu " the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy by 2010 .

the hearings will determine whether the 24-member team will be accepted . tough but fair is how eu parliamentarians say they want to be , as they began grilling the first of 24 designated eu commissioners appointed by eu commission president-designate jose manuel barroso on monday . each of the members of the european union executive will face three hours of questioning by parliamentary committees on issues ranging from turkey 's membership bid , immigration , fiscal discipline and taxation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel durao barroso barroso won strong endorsement in july from the 732-member parliament , but his team still needs parliamentary approval to take office on november 1 for a five-year term .
the eu parliament can reject barroso 's entire team but not individual commissioners . most of the questioning over the next two weeks will focus on potential conflicts of interest in barroso 's team , which is considered more market friendly than the last one and includes some wealthy and influential members . all 24 commissioner-designates have to file statements of financial interests , declare their assets and fill out a questionnaire before they submit themselves to the grilling . a controversial candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes one of the most controversial members of barroso 's team to take the stand on tuesday is dutch politician and businesswoman neelie kroes , who is to succeed mario monti as the european union 's antitrust chief , arguably one of the eu 's most powerful offices . kroes , who is a member of the dutch free-market liberal party and has served two terms as minister for transport , public works and telecommunications during the 1980s , also has considerable links to big business .
she has sat on the boards of a dozen top european companies and is reported to be fabulously wealthy , owning a house in an upscale neighborhood of the hague as well as two office buildings . eu parliamentary members have already cast doubts on whether kroes can take on a job that so obviously clashes with her vested interests in the world of politics and business .
" neelie kroes was on the supervisory board of numerous companies which are directly or indirectly affected by the activities of the commission 's competition authority , " said pervenche beres , chairwoman of the parliamentary committee on economic and monetary affairs . " that 's why it 's a justified ethical issue to scrutinize her . " for her part , kroes has said she has already sold all stocks and options and resigned from company boards as well as pledged to distance herself from cases concerning firms she may have been involved in .
she also promised that if decisions are to be made by the eu antitrust authority which involve former employers , she will restrain from voting on it . but , it remains to be seen whether kroes will sufficiently convince all parliamentary members of her neutrality . conflict of interest not only sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione other incoming eu commissioners , who , like kroes , may be in for a rough ride during the interrogation include mariann fischer boel , nominee for the eu 's agriculture portfolio , and italian rocco buttiglione , assigned by barroso to be in charge of asylum and immigration policy . boel attracted the attention of eu parliamentarians because she owns land that includes a farm receiving eu subsidies and buttiglione has stirred controversy by his support for plans to set up asylum camps outside eu borders .

but it remains questionable whether he has the necessary skills for his new portfolio of " industries and companies , " which verheugen has agreed to take on following pressure from the german government . the chairman of the parliamentary committee on industry , research and energy , giles chichester , has said verheugen will be examined thoroughly .
verheugen is expected to be grilled on his intentions and whether he will pursue a liberal market course as well as ideas for growth and innovation within the framework of the so-called lisbon agenda , which refers to a march 2000 eu summit when eu leaders and governments agreed to make the eu " the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy by 2010 .

dw-world readers comment on whether the country should join the union . i can only hope that turkey is never allowed into the eu .
it would be a disaster .
it would not only open the doors to more terrorists , it would bring racial and cultural differences to a boiling point across europe that would spell and end to eu .
a mass exodus of countries from the eu would soon ensue , thus all the hard work put towards bringing europe together would be for naught .
the very thought of turkey joining the eu is preposterous .
turkey is not a part of europe .
they share no cultural , political or social commonality with europe .
even without all of this the simple fact is that the people of europe do not want turkey to join .
this alone should be enough to prevent it from happening . - john young the most disturbing provision of the proposed laws in turkey is not the adultery issue .
it is a law which makes any criticism of the official government position on various issues -lrb- for example the armenian genocide and the occupation army in cyprus -rrb- punishable by law .
i am rather surprised at the lack of attention to such an infringement of the freedom of speech .
i thought turkey was a democracy and the eu defended and insisted on freedom of speech .
i was mistaken , as neither -lrb- turkish premier -rrb- erdogan nor the eu commissioner find this frightening law problematic . - m.g. ikossi a turkey operating within the european political parameters would be a great step towards reconciling west with the islamic world but it would signal the end to efforts to create a european state that could defend and promote our interests on the international arena .
the eu would then need to go back to the drawing table and re-define its purpose of existence as with turkey in the eu very few would feel comfortable integrating any further .
this may sound attractive for us and the uk but not so attractive to those of us who have supported the eu in expanding and achieving the critical mass for bolstering it 's economic power .
i simply hope that our leaders find a way out of this dangerous territory without enraging turkey and the us . - pantelis koul , britain i think that neither turkey nor eu is ready for turkey 's membership to eu .
the europeans are unable to get over their historical prejudice against turks and turks are in a daydream that eu membership will make them rich overnight without having to go through hard work . - sedat akkurt even though our religions might differ , we aim for the same type of life style as you do .
at the end , we are as european as you are and have always been ...
turkey 's place must definitely be in the eu . - emre sungur , usa as an outsider looking in at the one part of the first world that pays attention to more than just economic expansion , i wish for europe that you find some middle path between inexorable globalization on the one hand and crude , vicious racism on the other .
right now , europe looks neither willing to truly assimilate demographically large numbers of muslims nor able to set a boundary and choose in a humane and moral way to remain europe .
please at least recognize that obedience to the commercial logic of globalization is propelling europe into cultural changes that few in europe really want and many resent deeply , but without intelligent voicing . - kevin rooney turkey is a country that has a dynamic and strong economy , even though is has some problems .
it will recover by 2015 with the eu 's help and then this economy will turn into a dynamo for the eu .
when its comes to society , turkish people are not only the ones you see in europe - those have left turkey at least 30 years ago . - mustafa aydogan , britain while turkey was fulfilling the requirements for admission to the eu , turkey showed it had clout and would use it to advance its own self-perceived interests as an independent sovereign nation .
turkey 's conduct continually confirms it is not a compliant tool of the west .
turkey is unique in many ways beyond its geographic location .
turkey is a muslim but democratic nation .
turkey has a strong , well-equipped , and modern military that is very capable of defending the causes and advancing the interests to which it is committed .
but , since the eu has an urgent and existing necessity to defend against the ubiquitous threat of terrorism and turkey has proven itself worthy of membership to this organization , the eu needs to accept turkey as a eu member without any further delay . - donald slazinski send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey adopts key eu reforms turkey 's parliament on sunday passed a crucial package of reforms aimed at boosting the country 's chances for starting membership talks with the european union .

dw-world readers comment on whether the country should join the union . i can only hope that turkey is never allowed into the eu .
it would be a disaster .
it would not only open the doors to more terrorists , it would bring racial and cultural differences to a boiling point across europe that would spell and end to eu .
a mass exodus of countries from the eu would soon ensue , thus all the hard work put towards bringing europe together would be for naught .
the very thought of turkey joining the eu is preposterous .
turkey is not a part of europe .
they share no cultural , political or social commonality with europe .
even without all of this the simple fact is that the people of europe do not want turkey to join .
this alone should be enough to prevent it from happening . - john young the most disturbing provision of the proposed laws in turkey is not the adultery issue .
it is a law which makes any criticism of the official government position on various issues -lrb- for example the armenian genocide and the occupation army in cyprus -rrb- punishable by law .
i am rather surprised at the lack of attention to such an infringement of the freedom of speech .
i thought turkey was a democracy and the eu defended and insisted on freedom of speech .
i was mistaken , as neither -lrb- turkish premier -rrb- erdogan nor the eu commissioner find this frightening law problematic . - m.g. ikossi a turkey operating within the european political parameters would be a great step towards reconciling west with the islamic world but it would signal the end to efforts to create a european state that could defend and promote our interests on the international arena .
the eu would then need to go back to the drawing table and re-define its purpose of existence as with turkey in the eu very few would feel comfortable integrating any further .
this may sound attractive for us and the uk but not so attractive to those of us who have supported the eu in expanding and achieving the critical mass for bolstering it 's economic power .
i simply hope that our leaders find a way out of this dangerous territory without enraging turkey and the us . - pantelis koul , britain i think that neither turkey nor eu is ready for turkey 's membership to eu .
the europeans are unable to get over their historical prejudice against turks and turks are in a daydream that eu membership will make them rich overnight without having to go through hard work . - sedat akkurt even though our religions might differ , we aim for the same type of life style as you do .
at the end , we are as european as you are and have always been ...
turkey 's place must definitely be in the eu . - emre sungur , usa as an outsider looking in at the one part of the first world that pays attention to more than just economic expansion , i wish for europe that you find some middle path between inexorable globalization on the one hand and crude , vicious racism on the other .
right now , europe looks neither willing to truly assimilate demographically large numbers of muslims nor able to set a boundary and choose in a humane and moral way to remain europe .
please at least recognize that obedience to the commercial logic of globalization is propelling europe into cultural changes that few in europe really want and many resent deeply , but without intelligent voicing . - kevin rooney turkey is a country that has a dynamic and strong economy , even though is has some problems .
it will recover by 2015 with the eu 's help and then this economy will turn into a dynamo for the eu .
when its comes to society , turkish people are not only the ones you see in europe - those have left turkey at least 30 years ago . - mustafa aydogan , britain while turkey was fulfilling the requirements for admission to the eu , turkey showed it had clout and would use it to advance its own self-perceived interests as an independent sovereign nation .
turkey 's conduct continually confirms it is not a compliant tool of the west .
turkey is unique in many ways beyond its geographic location .
turkey is a muslim but democratic nation .
turkey has a strong , well-equipped , and modern military that is very capable of defending the causes and advancing the interests to which it is committed .
but , since the eu has an urgent and existing necessity to defend against the ubiquitous threat of terrorism and turkey has proven itself worthy of membership to this organization , the eu needs to accept turkey as a eu member without any further delay . - donald slazinski send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey adopts key eu reforms turkey 's parliament on sunday passed a crucial package of reforms aimed at boosting the country 's chances for starting membership talks with the european union .

but the party 's secretary general , aliki panayides , defended the campaign , saying candidates for naturalization must show they are truly integrated .
recently , however , swiss communities have shown they believe some people can never be integrated - candidates with balkan or african roots are often rejected , even if they fulfill all the legal requirements for naturalization .

" bilateral relations and above all , economic interests , will be at the forefront .
the chancellor will be accompanied by representatives of large german energy companies , " a german government spokesman told dw-world .
" but norway 's relationship to the eu and oslo 's possible rapprochement with brussels will also be on the agenda , " he added . professor heiko uecker , a norway expert at the university of bonn said economics was at the heart of bilateral relations .
" gas and oil interests in particular largely define ties between norway and germany , " he told dw-world . oil and gas the focus germany currently relies on norway for 20 percent of its oil and gas needs .
following recent deals signed between oslo and berlin , that share is expected to rise to over 30 percent by 2010 , when the nordic country will replace russia as germany 's largest oil supplier .
germany remains norway 's most important export market for oil and gas . though individual german companies , among them several medium-sized industries , have set up shop in norway , german oil and energy firms have hardly made a dent in norway 's massive offshore sector : natural oil and gas company rwe / dea is the only german company to be involved in oil production and exploration in norway , though it accounts for less than one percent of total overall production . in june this year during a visit to norway , german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said it would be " exciting and sensible in the long-term " if german companies such as rwe or ruhrgas , one of the biggest customers for norwegian oil producers , were to get more oil production rights in norway . that issue is expected to be taken up by chancellor schröder on tuesday . special attention to berlin experts say that in addition to burgeoning economic ties , political relations between the two countries have never been better . stephan michael schröder , a lecturer on scandinavian studies at berlin 's humboldt university , said the second world war did strain relations .
germany invaded norway in 1940 and occupied it until the end of the war .
" it was a painful period , but both norway and postwar germany joined the nato fairly early against a common enemy and the historic rift has been forgotten .
traditionally good relations have been smooth since the 1960s . " oslo , in particular , has been at pains to cultivate close relations with germany .
in 1999 , the then social democratic norwegian government unveiled a so-called " strategy for germany , " an exhaustive report detailing areas of potential cooperation which touches upon developing intensive political , economic , cultural and scientific ties and includes measures such as encouraging norwegians to learn german , setting up an online portal on norway in german , and executing a labor exchange . " there is enormous interest in germany from the norwegian side , " said stephan michael schröder .
" there 's a lot of money flowing for academics and cultural exchange and scientific research . " wary of the eu but there remains little doubt that one of the reasons for oslo 's wooing of berlin is the country 's difficult relationship to brussels and its deep-seated reluctance to join the 25-member bloc . " the very word ' european union ' is like a bad odor in norway , " said uecker .
" it 's a young country , it does n't want to lose its independence so soon . " but it 's not just its political sovereignty that norway , which voted against eu membership in referendums in 1972 and 1994 , is scared of losing . the country , with its 4.5 million inhabitants is the world 's third-largest exporter of oil after saudi arabia and russia and one of the richest in the world .
norway is expected to pump north sea oil for another 50 years and gas for a century . the country has also been cannily funneling 80 percent of its oil revenues into a petroleum fund that is invested overseas so the benefits can be used to finance its lavish social systems for generations to come . " the prospect of eu membership , particularly after the bloc 's eastward expansion , worries many norwegians that illegal workers might come into their country and pick off their generous welfare system and that their country might become poorer , " said uecker .
neighboring eu member sweden 's thumbs-down to joining the common euro currency in a referendum last year did n't help to bolster pro-eu feelings in norway either . can norway afford to stay out ? however , near-daily eu barometer polls published in the country 's media show that norwegians may be gradually reconciling themselves to the fact that remaining on the fringes of the european union may not be a viable option in the long run . norway - along with liechtenstein , iceland and switzerland - is a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- , which provides for free movement of goods , services , capital and labor between the union and european countries that have remained outside .
but , as norway is discovering , non-membership of the eu is still costing it money in other ways . from 2004 , norway -lrb- along with iceland , another non-eu nordic country -rrb- will pay five times their present membership fee of the efta .
in addition , norway will also channel existing bilateral aid for eastern europe through the eu , so its total transfer to the union will top nkr1.7 billion -lrb- € 203 million -rrb- a year , a tenfold rise . in addition to the money , experts say norway also has to adopt directives from brussels such as export duties on fish products as its own law .

" we must get away from this fixation on the monday demonstrations , " attack member peter wahl told the berlin daily tagesspiegel .
" the west has not reacted .

but this week , that number had dwindled to just 10,000 .
about 1,600 people protested in berlin in two separate marches .
in dresden , police said only 500 people turned out . last week , the other major protest organizer , service union verdi , withdrew its support for the demos . chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens has held firm in the face of pressure from protesters , refusing to abandon the package of reforms known as hartz iv . some analysts have said the government 's stance has helped it to stave off further losses in regional and local elections , especially in the western state of north rhine-westphalia , where voters appeared to have taken on board the spd 's message that the opposition parties would be just as tough - if not tougher - on the issue of reforms . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fewer germans protest against reforms tens of thousands of germans hit the streets again late monday , particularly in the poorer east , in protest against the government 's job market reforms , ahead of two key state elections this weekend .

germany remains norway 's most important export market for oil and gas . though individual german companies , among them several medium-sized industries , have set up shop in norway , german oil and energy firms have hardly made a dent in norway 's massive offshore sector : natural oil and gas company rwe / dea is the only german company to be involved in oil production and exploration in norway , though it accounts for less than one percent of total overall production . in june this year during a visit to norway , german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said it would be " exciting and sensible in the long-term " if german companies such as rwe or ruhrgas , one of the biggest customers for norwegian oil producers , were to get more oil production rights in norway . that issue is expected to be taken up by chancellor schröder on tuesday . special attention to berlin experts say that in addition to burgeoning economic ties , political relations between the two countries have never been better . stephan michael schröder , a lecturer on scandinavian studies at berlin 's humboldt university , said the second world war did strain relations .
germany invaded norway in 1940 and occupied it until the end of the war .
" it was a painful period , but both norway and postwar germany joined the nato fairly early against a common enemy and the historic rift has been forgotten .
traditionally good relations have been smooth since the 1960s . " oslo , in particular , has been at pains to cultivate close relations with germany .
in 1999 , the then social democratic norwegian government unveiled a so-called " strategy for germany , " an exhaustive report detailing areas of potential cooperation which touches upon developing intensive political , economic , cultural and scientific ties and includes measures such as encouraging norwegians to learn german , setting up an online portal on norway in german , and executing a labor exchange . " there is enormous interest in germany from the norwegian side , " said stephan michael schröder .
" there 's a lot of money flowing for academics and cultural exchange and scientific research . " wary of the eu but there remains little doubt that one of the reasons for oslo 's wooing of berlin is the country 's difficult relationship to brussels and its deep-seated reluctance to join the 25-member bloc . " the very word ' european union ' is like a bad odor in norway , " said uecker .
" it 's a young country , it does n't want to lose its independence so soon . " but it 's not just its political sovereignty that norway , which voted against eu membership in referendums in 1972 and 1994 , is scared of losing . the country , with its 4.5 million inhabitants is the world 's third-largest exporter of oil after saudi arabia and russia and one of the richest in the world .
norway is expected to pump north sea oil for another 50 years and gas for a century . the country has also been cannily funneling 80 percent of its oil revenues into a petroleum fund that is invested overseas so the benefits can be used to finance its lavish social systems for generations to come . " the prospect of eu membership , particularly after the bloc 's eastward expansion , worries many norwegians that illegal workers might come into their country and pick off their generous welfare system and that their country might become poorer , " said uecker .
neighboring eu member sweden 's thumbs-down to joining the common euro currency in a referendum last year did n't help to bolster pro-eu feelings in norway either . can norway afford to stay out ? however , near-daily eu barometer polls published in the country 's media show that norwegians may be gradually reconciling themselves to the fact that remaining on the fringes of the european union may not be a viable option in the long run . norway - along with liechtenstein , iceland and switzerland - is a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- , which provides for free movement of goods , services , capital and labor between the union and european countries that have remained outside .
but , as norway is discovering , non-membership of the eu is still costing it money in other ways . from 2004 , norway -lrb- along with iceland , another non-eu nordic country -rrb- will pay five times their present membership fee of the efta .
in addition , norway will also channel existing bilateral aid for eastern europe through the eu , so its total transfer to the union will top nkr1.7 billion -lrb- € 203 million -rrb- a year , a tenfold rise . in addition to the money , experts say norway also has to adopt directives from brussels such as export duties on fish products as its own law .
" norway just ca n't afford to remain on the sidelines in the long run because though it has to implement decisions from brussels , it has no power to influence them , " said uecker .
" they will be in the union in ten years . " germans could represent oslo 's interests germany , in the meantime , could play a vital role in representing norway 's interests in the eu on account of its location , size and clout in the club , experts say .
" right since chancellor helmut kohl 's time , the germans have always been in favor of norway joining the eu , " said uecker . " developing a so-called " northern dimension , " which includes involving oil-rich russia in european cooperation , as a counterweight to the southern part of europe is also an idea that finds resonance both in norway and germany , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union dw-world 's special dossier on eu expansion and the run-up to the historic event .

kirch had filed a 39-page complaint with a court in new york in january , accusing deutsche bank and liberty media and their chairmen of plotting the destruction of the kirch group in a bid to rid liberty media of an unwelcome rival in the german cable television market and secure fat commissions for deutsche bank .
the court found that kirch had failed to prove his case and " dimissed -lrb- the suit -rrb- for failure to state a claim , " according to a copy of the ruling made available by deutsche bank on tuesday .
the new york lawsuit was part of a long and bitter legal battle between kirch and deutsche bank since the kirch media empire collapsed in april 2002 .
the conflict dates back to comments by deutsche bank 's then chairman breuer made on television in 2002 , in which he publicly questioned the creditworthiness of the kirch group .
soon afterwards , banks refused to lend kirch any more money and kirchmedia , the main pillar of the kirch group , filed for insolvency in april 2002 .
in december , a munich court ruled in kirch 's favour , finding that breuer had violated his duty of client confidentiality .
the munich court ordered deutsche bank to pay unspecified compensation to kirch .
-lrb- afp -rrb- dw-world.de court rules deutsche bank must pay kirch an appeals court in munich ruled on wednesday that banking giant deutsche bank must pay damages to fallen media mogul leo kirch that could reach € 100 million -lrb- $ 122 million -rrb- .

kirch had filed a 39-page complaint with a court in new york in january , accusing deutsche bank and liberty media and their chairmen of plotting the destruction of the kirch group in a bid to rid liberty media of an unwelcome rival in the german cable television market and secure fat commissions for deutsche bank .
the court found that kirch had failed to prove his case and " dimissed -lrb- the suit -rrb- for failure to state a claim , " according to a copy of the ruling made available by deutsche bank on tuesday .
the new york lawsuit was part of a long and bitter legal battle between kirch and deutsche bank since the kirch media empire collapsed in april 2002 .
the conflict dates back to comments by deutsche bank 's then chairman breuer made on television in 2002 , in which he publicly questioned the creditworthiness of the kirch group .
soon afterwards , banks refused to lend kirch any more money and kirchmedia , the main pillar of the kirch group , filed for insolvency in april 2002 .
in december , a munich court ruled in kirch 's favour , finding that breuer had violated his duty of client confidentiality .
the munich court ordered deutsche bank to pay unspecified compensation to kirch .

experts say the new high was pushed by political instability in nigeria . crude oil futures remained above $ 50 dollars a barrel in asian trade on tuesday after breaking through the key psychological barrier as concerns over supply continued to dominate the market , dealers said .
at 2:30 pm -lrb- 0630 utc -rrb- , new york 's reference contract , light sweet crude for november delivery was at $ 50.42 a barrel , up from the record closing high of 49.64 in new york on monday .
it hit $ 50.47 in an intra-day high . analysts said factors driving prices up include unrest in nigeria and saudi arabia , hurricanes in the united states , continued violence in iraq and the legal and supply woes of russian energy giant yukos . nigerian rebels threaten war nigeria is the world 's seventh largest oil exporter , pumping out 2.3 million barrels per day .
nigerian rebels have warned oil companies to shut down production in the niger delta , or face " all-out war " starting on oct.1.
they said anyone assisting the state would be considered an enemy . the rebels are seeking to force political reforms and independence for the oil-rich , yet impoverished niger delta .
kurt barrow , a singapore-based principal at us energy consultancy purvin and gertz , said the high oil prices could also be blamed on tight supply amid strong demand from the united states , china and india which had caught the market by surprise . he said surplus production has fallen to only one million barrels of oil a day from three to five million over the past few years . threats of disruption to these already tight supplies are conspiring to keep the volatile situation boiling . " fundamentaly , there is a very tight supply-demand balance in the petroleum market , " barrow told afp , adding that any disturbances in major producers such as iraq , nigeria , russia and venezuela are bound to affect prices . prices to remain high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stacked oil drums barrow said prices are expected to remain high for some time . " much depends on what world events happen over the next six to 18 months , " he said . " our view is that the price will remain high and volatile really until some additional production come on stream , perhaps later this year or likely next year . " " once we rebuild this supply cushion , then it 's likely that prices will come back down .
until then , we expect oil prices to stay high .

plenty of german taxpayers ' money is senselessly spent on pet projects and there 's overspending ripe to be cut from the nation 's budget , according to a watchdog group . whether it was laser light and intergalactic roller coasters at bremen 's now bankrupt space park -lrb- € 197 million or $ 243 million -rrb- , a multicultural center turned disco temple in halle -lrb- € 4.6 million -rrb- or € 46 million companies waste jumping though bureaucratic hoops each year , the german taxpayer association brought these and other cases of squandered money - totaling € 30 billion , about 5 percent of all money the state spends - to light in a press conference tuesday .
a road that leads nowhere , a bus stop on a street with no bus lines and military jets the army does n't need are among the 111 cases of money being thrown out the window that fill the 32ned edition of the association 's " black book . "
the fact that no one in the town of hagen realized there was € 127,000 worth of marriage license fees sitting in a desk drawer instead of a bank account earning interest was n't one of the book 's major finds , but a typical example for how money is wasted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public 's money is thrown away in many different ways " there 's an incredible thoughtlessness , a hey-it 's-not-my-money mentality , " said association president karl heinz däke , who also called for creating new ways to prosecute civil servants caught wasting money .
" there is a system of collective irresponsibility , " he said .
plenty of ways to waste money another case mentioned in the book was german tv , a pay-per-view german language service shown in the united states that cost the government € 20 million .
it 's having difficulty finding subscribers and the taxpayer association believes it wo n't last much longer .
german tv is a joint project of german public broadcasters ard and zdf and deutsche welle .
then there 's the rider-information system .
after investing € 5.2 million , the system should have informed bus riders about delays and cancellations via a satellite system , but software problems kept the users from being able to use the information panels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you mean we still do n't have any blueprints ?
project overruns resulted in many expensive mistakes , the association said - such as the german labor office 's virtual job market , which cost € 33 million more than the € 65 million set aside for the project .
construction delays and design changes for a police headquaters in frankfurt cost the state € 38 million because there were no finished plans when building began in 1998 .
dieter ondracek , head of germany 's tax union , said he doubted the veracity of the book 's figures after errors were found in last year 's edition and labor unions called the book 's figures , which the association bases on official calculations as well as media reports , exaggerated . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germans abuse state system amid continuing protests over benefit cuts , chancellor schröder has sharply criticized his countrymen who he says take more than their fair share of state allowances .

german radio quota debate goes live netting the big fish germany -pipe- 28.09.2004 mp3 inventor wants a chat with his stereo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you like marilyn manson ?
maybe you 'll like cher as well bought the latest coldplay album and wonder what else you might like ?
four german companies are competing to offer the best online music-recommendation software .
in the mix : the inventor of the mp3 . some time in the near future , karlheinz brandenburg would like to have a conversation with his stereo .
he 'd like to tell it to play the kind of music he likes to typically hear at that time of day and what music direction it could consider .
" that ’ s a vision i ’ ve had for four or five years , " he said .
for the inventor of mp3 technology -lrb- photo -rrb- , the preferences would lean towards bach and beethoven .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlheinz brandenburg , one of the inventors of the mp3 but new software brandenburg and his colleague markus cremer have developed at germany ’ s renowned semi-public think tank , the fraunhofer institute , will enable his stereo to guide him to a 19th century string quartet he ’ s never heard of - or maybe even some björk .
in the cut-throat world of music downloading sites , the survivors will be those that offer the best service , said brandenburg .
one option aimed at adding value to a music download site : music-recommendation systems that link users to songs that fit their taste , but that they might otherwise never have come across .
like marilyn manson ?
you 'll love cher !
" the task of a piece of software to help you on one hand to make it easier to find things , on the other hand to find the unexpected , " said brandenburg in an interview with dw-world .
" to find things you like even if they weren ’ t in the same catalogue or next to each other . "
at present , four german companies are competing for the chance to help consumers match music to their tastes .
brandenburg and cremer think the answer lies in computer software that analyses the music itself .
their program , called soundslike , measures song ingredients such as rhythm , melody and instrumentalization , then recommends songs that have similar patterns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cher performing that leads to tips like billy idol ’ s “ cradle of love ” for users buying the rolling stones ’ “ sympathy for the devil . ”
but it can also lead to a recommendation of cher ’ s -lrb- left -rrb- “ alive again ” to buyers of marilyn manson ’ s version of “ tainted love . ”
“ i wouldn ’ t rule out that there are some kinks to work out , ” said brandenburg , chuckling .
brandenburg knows all about working out the kinks .
after all , years passed between the first time brandenburg compressed a digital music file of susanne vega ’ s “ uncle tom ’ s diner , ” in the mid-1980s , to the point in the mid-1990s when his mp3 technology began to take off .
he thinks soundslike technology could be ready for a company to implement in a few months .
the human touch but his competitors say the program has fundamental flaws .
it 's not the music that should be measured , but rather the consumer 's taste .
“ it ’ s not possible for a machine to differentiate between a piece of grunge music or heavy metal from the 1980s , because it looks very similar acoustically , ” daniel müllensiefen , project manager at musicline.de told dw-world .
his system , soundprofiler , features a database compiled through a mix of human suggestions and software .
after rating a list of 40 songs , ten at a time , users are given a final list that is supposed to match their tastes perfectly .
beginning at the popkomm music trade fair in berlin on sept .
29 , internet users worldwide will be allowed to test the two programs .
they can then decide which of them - or one of two others designed by hamburg-based hifind and software developer ddd systems - works the best .
the winner gets an exclusive partnership with phonoline , which provides the software to germany ’ s music download portals .
along with the internet voting , a jury of music and technology journalists will help decide who gets the contract. itunes cool to the idea but whether big names like apple or microsoft will bite is still unclear .
alex luke , director of music programming and label relations at itunes , said that apple continues to recommend songs based on what buyers have bought and what they suggest .
“ how users buy and build their collections is valuable , but it 's only one of the ways we recommend music on itunes , ” he wrote in an e-mail .
but buyer statistics and suggestions don ’ t go far enough , argues brandenburg .
" there you have the problem that ... you always get to the same mainstream music , " he said .
" we clearly didn ’ t want that to happen .
you need to have something unexpected in there . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links musicline sound profiler one of the four sites competing hi find their recommendation system is fueled by the suggestions of music composers and journalists ddd system their recommendation system , musiclens , is a mix between human suggestions and software the competition beginning sept .

experts say the new high was pushed by political instability in nigeria . crude oil futures remained above $ 50 dollars a barrel in asian trade on tuesday after breaking through the key psychological barrier as concerns over supply continued to dominate the market , dealers said .
at 2:30 pm -lrb- 0630 utc -rrb- , new york 's reference contract , light sweet crude for november delivery was at $ 50.42 a barrel , up from the record closing high of 49.64 in new york on monday .
it hit $ 50.47 in an intra-day high . analysts said factors driving prices up include unrest in nigeria and saudi arabia , hurricanes in the united states , continued violence in iraq and the legal and supply woes of russian energy giant yukos . nigerian rebels threaten war nigeria is the world 's seventh largest oil exporter , pumping out 2.3 million barrels per day .
nigerian rebels have warned oil companies to shut down production in the niger delta , or face " all-out war " starting on oct.1.
they said anyone assisting the state would be considered an enemy . the rebels are seeking to force political reforms and independence for the oil-rich , yet impoverished niger delta .
kurt barrow , a singapore-based principal at us energy consultancy purvin and gertz , said the high oil prices could also be blamed on tight supply amid strong demand from the united states , china and india which had caught the market by surprise . he said surplus production has fallen to only one million barrels of oil a day from three to five million over the past few years . threats of disruption to these already tight supplies are conspiring to keep the volatile situation boiling . " fundamentaly , there is a very tight supply-demand balance in the petroleum market , " barrow told afp , adding that any disturbances in major producers such as iraq , nigeria , russia and venezuela are bound to affect prices . prices to remain high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stacked oil drums barrow said prices are expected to remain high for some time . " much depends on what world events happen over the next six to 18 months , " he said . " our view is that the price will remain high and volatile really until some additional production come on stream , perhaps later this year or likely next year . " " once we rebuild this supply cushion , then it 's likely that prices will come back down .
until then , we expect oil prices to stay high . " barrow said hedge funds and speculative trading were acting " to exacerbate the volatility but i think that even without these you will still see high oil prices . " germany 's economics minister wolfgang clement described the high price of oil as a danger for the global economy . " they definitely pose a risk , " clement said late monday in berlin .
he added that governments must find a way to prevent oil prices from spiralling even higher due to speculation . the current oil crisis is expected to feature in tuesday 's meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder , and norwegian prime minister kjell magne bondevik .

experts say the new high was pushed by political instability in nigeria . crude oil futures remained above $ 50 dollars a barrel in asian trade on tuesday after breaking through the key psychological barrier as concerns over supply continued to dominate the market , dealers said .
at 2:30 pm -lrb- 0630 utc -rrb- , new york 's reference contract , light sweet crude for november delivery was at $ 50.42 a barrel , up from the record closing high of 49.64 in new york on monday .
it hit $ 50.47 in an intra-day high . analysts said factors driving prices up include unrest in nigeria and saudi arabia , hurricanes in the united states , continued violence in iraq and the legal and supply woes of russian energy giant yukos . nigerian rebels threaten war nigeria is the world 's seventh largest oil exporter , pumping out 2.3 million barrels per day .
nigerian rebels have warned oil companies to shut down production in the niger delta , or face " all-out war " starting on oct.1.
they said anyone assisting the state would be considered an enemy . the rebels are seeking to force political reforms and independence for the oil-rich , yet impoverished niger delta .
kurt barrow , a singapore-based principal at us energy consultancy purvin and gertz , said the high oil prices could also be blamed on tight supply amid strong demand from the united states , china and india which had caught the market by surprise . he said surplus production has fallen to only one million barrels of oil a day from three to five million over the past few years . threats of disruption to these already tight supplies are conspiring to keep the volatile situation boiling . " fundamentaly , there is a very tight supply-demand balance in the petroleum market , " barrow told afp , adding that any disturbances in major producers such as iraq , nigeria , russia and venezuela are bound to affect prices . prices to remain high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stacked oil drums barrow said prices are expected to remain high for some time . " much depends on what world events happen over the next six to 18 months , " he said . " our view is that the price will remain high and volatile really until some additional production come on stream , perhaps later this year or likely next year . " " once we rebuild this supply cushion , then it 's likely that prices will come back down .
until then , we expect oil prices to stay high . " barrow said hedge funds and speculative trading were acting " to exacerbate the volatility but i think that even without these you will still see high oil prices . " germany 's economics minister wolfgang clement described the high price of oil as a danger for the global economy . " they definitely pose a risk , " clement said late monday in berlin .
he added that governments must find a way to prevent oil prices from spiralling even higher due to speculation . the current oil crisis is expected to feature in tuesday 's meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder , and norwegian prime minister kjell magne bondevik .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.09.2004 -pipe- 12:00 utc us court rejects suit against deutsche bank a us court has thrown out a suit by former german media mogul leo kirch against us cable operator liberty media and german bank deutsche bank for allegedly conspiring to bring about the downfall of kirch 's media empire in 2002 , deutsche bank said on tuesday .
kirch had filed a 39-page complaint with a court in new york in january , accusing deutsche bank and liberty media and their chairmen of plotting the destruction of the kirch group in a bid to rid liberty media of an unwelcome rival in the german cable television market and secure fat commissions for deutsche bank .
the court found that kirch had failed to prove his case and " dimissed -lrb- the suit -rrb- for failure to state a claim , " according to a copy of the ruling made available by deutsche bank on tuesday .
the new york lawsuit was part of a long and bitter legal battle between kirch and deutsche bank since the kirch media empire collapsed in april 2002 .
the conflict dates back to comments by deutsche bank 's then chairman breuer made on television in 2002 , in which he publicly questioned the creditworthiness of the kirch group .
soon afterwards , banks refused to lend kirch any more money and kirchmedia , the main pillar of the kirch group , filed for insolvency in april 2002 .
in december , a munich court ruled in kirch 's favour , finding that breuer had violated his duty of client confidentiality .
the munich court ordered deutsche bank to pay unspecified compensation to kirch .
-lrb- afp -rrb- dw-world.de court rules deutsche bank must pay kirch an appeals court in munich ruled on wednesday that banking giant deutsche bank must pay damages to fallen media mogul leo kirch that could reach € 100 million -lrb- $ 122 million -rrb- .

kirch had filed a 39-page complaint with a court in new york in january , accusing deutsche bank and liberty media and their chairmen of plotting the destruction of the kirch group in a bid to rid liberty media of an unwelcome rival in the german cable television market and secure fat commissions for deutsche bank .
the court found that kirch had failed to prove his case and " dimissed -lrb- the suit -rrb- for failure to state a claim , " according to a copy of the ruling made available by deutsche bank on tuesday .
the new york lawsuit was part of a long and bitter legal battle between kirch and deutsche bank since the kirch media empire collapsed in april 2002 .
the conflict dates back to comments by deutsche bank 's then chairman breuer made on television in 2002 , in which he publicly questioned the creditworthiness of the kirch group .
soon afterwards , banks refused to lend kirch any more money and kirchmedia , the main pillar of the kirch group , filed for insolvency in april 2002 .
in december , a munich court ruled in kirch 's favour , finding that breuer had violated his duty of client confidentiality .
the munich court ordered deutsche bank to pay unspecified compensation to kirch .

the hearings will determine whether the 24-member team will be accepted . tough but fair is how eu parliamentarians say they want to be , as they began grilling the first of 24 designated eu commissioners appointed by eu commission president-designate jose manuel barroso on monday . each of the members of the european union executive will face three hours of questioning by parliamentary committees on issues ranging from turkey 's membership bid , immigration , fiscal discipline and taxation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel durao barroso barroso won strong endorsement in july from the 732-member parliament , but his team still needs parliamentary approval to take office on november 1 for a five-year term .
the eu parliament can reject barroso 's entire team but not individual commissioners . most of the questioning over the next two weeks will focus on potential conflicts of interest in barroso 's team , which is considered more market friendly than the last one and includes some wealthy and influential members . all 24 commissioner-designates have to file statements of financial interests , declare their assets and fill out a questionnaire before they submit themselves to the grilling . a controversial candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes one of the most controversial members of barroso 's team to take the stand on tuesday is dutch politician and businesswoman neelie kroes , who is to succeed mario monti as the european union 's antitrust chief , arguably one of the eu 's most powerful offices . kroes , who is a member of the dutch free-market liberal party and has served two terms as minister for transport , public works and telecommunications during the 1980s , also has considerable links to big business .
she has sat on the boards of a dozen top european companies and is reported to be fabulously wealthy , owning a house in an upscale neighborhood of the hague as well as two office buildings . eu parliamentary members have already cast doubts on whether kroes can take on a job that so obviously clashes with her vested interests in the world of politics and business .
" neelie kroes was on the supervisory board of numerous companies which are directly or indirectly affected by the activities of the commission 's competition authority , " said pervenche beres , chairwoman of the parliamentary committee on economic and monetary affairs . " that 's why it 's a justified ethical issue to scrutinize her . " for her part , kroes has said she has already sold all stocks and options and resigned from company boards as well as pledged to distance herself from cases concerning firms she may have been involved in .
she also promised that if decisions are to be made by the eu antitrust authority which involve former employers , she will restrain from voting on it . but , it remains to be seen whether kroes will sufficiently convince all parliamentary members of her neutrality . conflict of interest not only sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione other incoming eu commissioners , who , like kroes , may be in for a rough ride during the interrogation include mariann fischer boel , nominee for the eu 's agriculture portfolio , and italian rocco buttiglione , assigned by barroso to be in charge of asylum and immigration policy . boel attracted the attention of eu parliamentarians because she owns land that includes a farm receiving eu subsidies and buttiglione has stirred controversy by his support for plans to set up asylum camps outside eu borders .
boel , however , has since been cleared after she sold her shares in danish sugar producer danisco . expertise of candidates also checked but it 's not just potential conflict of interest that the eu questioners are interested in .
other nagging conflict points include the political past of some commissioners from the new eastern european members as well as the expertise and experience of some incoming commissioners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen for instance , there is little doubt that german eu commissioner günter verheugen , who has been responsible for eastern european expansion so far , has gathered valuable experience when it comes to eu diplomacy and working methods .
but it remains questionable whether he has the necessary skills for his new portfolio of " industries and companies , " which verheugen has agreed to take on following pressure from the german government . the chairman of the parliamentary committee on industry , research and energy , giles chichester , has said verheugen will be examined thoroughly .
verheugen is expected to be grilled on his intentions and whether he will pursue a liberal market course as well as ideas for growth and innovation within the framework of the so-called lisbon agenda , which refers to a march 2000 eu summit when eu leaders and governments agreed to make the eu " the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy by 2010 . " " i want to hear from mr verheugen , how he plans to enforce the lisbon agenda , which so far has only been talked of , but not implemented , " chichester said . the eu parliament is expected to vote on the new team by the end of october .

the hearings will determine whether the 24-member team will be accepted . tough but fair is how eu parliamentarians say they want to be , as they began grilling the first of 24 designated eu commissioners appointed by eu commission president-designate jose manuel barroso on monday . each of the members of the european union executive will face three hours of questioning by parliamentary committees on issues ranging from turkey 's membership bid , immigration , fiscal discipline and taxation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel durao barroso barroso won strong endorsement in july from the 732-member parliament , but his team still needs parliamentary approval to take office on november 1 for a five-year term .
the eu parliament can reject barroso 's entire team but not individual commissioners . most of the questioning over the next two weeks will focus on potential conflicts of interest in barroso 's team , which is considered more market friendly than the last one and includes some wealthy and influential members . all 24 commissioner-designates have to file statements of financial interests , declare their assets and fill out a questionnaire before they submit themselves to the grilling . a controversial candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes one of the most controversial members of barroso 's team to take the stand on tuesday is dutch politician and businesswoman neelie kroes , who is to succeed mario monti as the european union 's antitrust chief , arguably one of the eu 's most powerful offices . kroes , who is a member of the dutch free-market liberal party and has served two terms as minister for transport , public works and telecommunications during the 1980s , also has considerable links to big business .
she has sat on the boards of a dozen top european companies and is reported to be fabulously wealthy , owning a house in an upscale neighborhood of the hague as well as two office buildings . eu parliamentary members have already cast doubts on whether kroes can take on a job that so obviously clashes with her vested interests in the world of politics and business .
" neelie kroes was on the supervisory board of numerous companies which are directly or indirectly affected by the activities of the commission 's competition authority , " said pervenche beres , chairwoman of the parliamentary committee on economic and monetary affairs . " that 's why it 's a justified ethical issue to scrutinize her . " for her part , kroes has said she has already sold all stocks and options and resigned from company boards as well as pledged to distance herself from cases concerning firms she may have been involved in .
she also promised that if decisions are to be made by the eu antitrust authority which involve former employers , she will restrain from voting on it . but , it remains to be seen whether kroes will sufficiently convince all parliamentary members of her neutrality . conflict of interest not only sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione other incoming eu commissioners , who , like kroes , may be in for a rough ride during the interrogation include mariann fischer boel , nominee for the eu 's agriculture portfolio , and italian rocco buttiglione , assigned by barroso to be in charge of asylum and immigration policy . boel attracted the attention of eu parliamentarians because she owns land that includes a farm receiving eu subsidies and buttiglione has stirred controversy by his support for plans to set up asylum camps outside eu borders .

experts say the new high was pushed by political instability in nigeria . crude oil futures remained above $ 50 dollars a barrel in asian trade on tuesday after breaking through the key psychological barrier as concerns over supply continued to dominate the market , dealers said .
at 2:30 pm -lrb- 0630 utc -rrb- , new york 's reference contract , light sweet crude for november delivery was at $ 50.42 a barrel , up from the record closing high of 49.64 in new york on monday .
it hit $ 50.47 in an intra-day high . analysts said factors driving prices up include unrest in nigeria and saudi arabia , hurricanes in the united states , continued violence in iraq and the legal and supply woes of russian energy giant yukos . nigerian rebels threaten war nigeria is the world 's seventh largest oil exporter , pumping out 2.3 million barrels per day .
nigerian rebels have warned oil companies to shut down production in the niger delta , or face " all-out war " starting on oct.1.
they said anyone assisting the state would be considered an enemy . the rebels are seeking to force political reforms and independence for the oil-rich , yet impoverished niger delta .
kurt barrow , a singapore-based principal at us energy consultancy purvin and gertz , said the high oil prices could also be blamed on tight supply amid strong demand from the united states , china and india which had caught the market by surprise . he said surplus production has fallen to only one million barrels of oil a day from three to five million over the past few years . threats of disruption to these already tight supplies are conspiring to keep the volatile situation boiling . " fundamentaly , there is a very tight supply-demand balance in the petroleum market , " barrow told afp , adding that any disturbances in major producers such as iraq , nigeria , russia and venezuela are bound to affect prices . prices to remain high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stacked oil drums barrow said prices are expected to remain high for some time . " much depends on what world events happen over the next six to 18 months , " he said . " our view is that the price will remain high and volatile really until some additional production come on stream , perhaps later this year or likely next year . " " once we rebuild this supply cushion , then it 's likely that prices will come back down .
until then , we expect oil prices to stay high . " barrow said hedge funds and speculative trading were acting " to exacerbate the volatility but i think that even without these you will still see high oil prices . " germany 's economics minister wolfgang clement described the high price of oil as a danger for the global economy . " they definitely pose a risk , " clement said late monday in berlin .
he added that governments must find a way to prevent oil prices from spiralling even higher due to speculation . the current oil crisis is expected to feature in tuesday 's meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder , and norwegian prime minister kjell magne bondevik .

experts say the new high was pushed by political instability in nigeria . crude oil futures remained above $ 50 dollars a barrel in asian trade on tuesday after breaking through the key psychological barrier as concerns over supply continued to dominate the market , dealers said .
at 2:30 pm -lrb- 0630 utc -rrb- , new york 's reference contract , light sweet crude for november delivery was at $ 50.42 a barrel , up from the record closing high of 49.64 in new york on monday .
it hit $ 50.47 in an intra-day high . analysts said factors driving prices up include unrest in nigeria and saudi arabia , hurricanes in the united states , continued violence in iraq and the legal and supply woes of russian energy giant yukos . nigerian rebels threaten war nigeria is the world 's seventh largest oil exporter , pumping out 2.3 million barrels per day .
nigerian rebels have warned oil companies to shut down production in the niger delta , or face " all-out war " starting on oct.1.
they said anyone assisting the state would be considered an enemy . the rebels are seeking to force political reforms and independence for the oil-rich , yet impoverished niger delta .
kurt barrow , a singapore-based principal at us energy consultancy purvin and gertz , said the high oil prices could also be blamed on tight supply amid strong demand from the united states , china and india which had caught the market by surprise . he said surplus production has fallen to only one million barrels of oil a day from three to five million over the past few years . threats of disruption to these already tight supplies are conspiring to keep the volatile situation boiling . " fundamentaly , there is a very tight supply-demand balance in the petroleum market , " barrow told afp , adding that any disturbances in major producers such as iraq , nigeria , russia and venezuela are bound to affect prices . prices to remain high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stacked oil drums barrow said prices are expected to remain high for some time . " much depends on what world events happen over the next six to 18 months , " he said . " our view is that the price will remain high and volatile really until some additional production come on stream , perhaps later this year or likely next year . " " once we rebuild this supply cushion , then it 's likely that prices will come back down .
until then , we expect oil prices to stay high . " barrow said hedge funds and speculative trading were acting " to exacerbate the volatility but i think that even without these you will still see high oil prices . " germany 's economics minister wolfgang clement described the high price of oil as a danger for the global economy . " they definitely pose a risk , " clement said late monday in berlin .
he added that governments must find a way to prevent oil prices from spiralling even higher due to speculation . the current oil crisis is expected to feature in tuesday 's meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder , and norwegian prime minister kjell magne bondevik .

the hearings will determine whether the 24-member team will be accepted . tough but fair is how eu parliamentarians say they want to be , as they began grilling the first of 24 designated eu commissioners appointed by eu commission president-designate jose manuel barroso on monday . each of the members of the european union executive will face three hours of questioning by parliamentary committees on issues ranging from turkey 's membership bid , immigration , fiscal discipline and taxation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel durao barroso barroso won strong endorsement in july from the 732-member parliament , but his team still needs parliamentary approval to take office on november 1 for a five-year term .
the eu parliament can reject barroso 's entire team but not individual commissioners . most of the questioning over the next two weeks will focus on potential conflicts of interest in barroso 's team , which is considered more market friendly than the last one and includes some wealthy and influential members . all 24 commissioner-designates have to file statements of financial interests , declare their assets and fill out a questionnaire before they submit themselves to the grilling . a controversial candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes one of the most controversial members of barroso 's team to take the stand on tuesday is dutch politician and businesswoman neelie kroes , who is to succeed mario monti as the european union 's antitrust chief , arguably one of the eu 's most powerful offices . kroes , who is a member of the dutch free-market liberal party and has served two terms as minister for transport , public works and telecommunications during the 1980s , also has considerable links to big business .
she has sat on the boards of a dozen top european companies and is reported to be fabulously wealthy , owning a house in an upscale neighborhood of the hague as well as two office buildings . eu parliamentary members have already cast doubts on whether kroes can take on a job that so obviously clashes with her vested interests in the world of politics and business .
" neelie kroes was on the supervisory board of numerous companies which are directly or indirectly affected by the activities of the commission 's competition authority , " said pervenche beres , chairwoman of the parliamentary committee on economic and monetary affairs . " that 's why it 's a justified ethical issue to scrutinize her . " for her part , kroes has said she has already sold all stocks and options and resigned from company boards as well as pledged to distance herself from cases concerning firms she may have been involved in .

boel , however , has since been cleared after she sold her shares in danish sugar producer danisco . expertise of candidates also checked but it 's not just potential conflict of interest that the eu questioners are interested in .
other nagging conflict points include the political past of some commissioners from the new eastern european members as well as the expertise and experience of some incoming commissioners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen for instance , there is little doubt that german eu commissioner günter verheugen , who has been responsible for eastern european expansion so far , has gathered valuable experience when it comes to eu diplomacy and working methods .
but it remains questionable whether he has the necessary skills for his new portfolio of " industries and companies , " which verheugen has agreed to take on following pressure from the german government . the chairman of the parliamentary committee on industry , research and energy , giles chichester , has said verheugen will be examined thoroughly .
verheugen is expected to be grilled on his intentions and whether he will pursue a liberal market course as well as ideas for growth and innovation within the framework of the so-called lisbon agenda , which refers to a march 2000 eu summit when eu leaders and governments agreed to make the eu " the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy by 2010 .

maybe you 'll like cher as well bought the latest coldplay album and wonder what else you might like ?
four german companies are competing to offer the best online music-recommendation software .
in the mix : the inventor of the mp3 . some time in the near future , karlheinz brandenburg would like to have a conversation with his stereo .
he 'd like to tell it to play the kind of music he likes to typically hear at that time of day and what music direction it could consider .
" that ’ s a vision i ’ ve had for four or five years , " he said .
for the inventor of mp3 technology -lrb- photo -rrb- , the preferences would lean towards bach and beethoven .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlheinz brandenburg , one of the inventors of the mp3 but new software brandenburg and his colleague markus cremer have developed at germany ’ s renowned semi-public think tank , the fraunhofer institute , will enable his stereo to guide him to a 19th century string quartet he ’ s never heard of - or maybe even some björk .
in the cut-throat world of music downloading sites , the survivors will be those that offer the best service , said brandenburg .
one option aimed at adding value to a music download site : music-recommendation systems that link users to songs that fit their taste , but that they might otherwise never have come across .
like marilyn manson ?
you 'll love cher !
" the task of a piece of software to help you on one hand to make it easier to find things , on the other hand to find the unexpected , " said brandenburg in an interview with dw-world .
" to find things you like even if they weren ’ t in the same catalogue or next to each other . "
at present , four german companies are competing for the chance to help consumers match music to their tastes .
brandenburg and cremer think the answer lies in computer software that analyses the music itself .
their program , called soundslike , measures song ingredients such as rhythm , melody and instrumentalization , then recommends songs that have similar patterns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cher performing that leads to tips like billy idol ’ s “ cradle of love ” for users buying the rolling stones ’ “ sympathy for the devil . ”
but it can also lead to a recommendation of cher ’ s -lrb- left -rrb- “ alive again ” to buyers of marilyn manson ’ s version of “ tainted love . ”
“ i wouldn ’ t rule out that there are some kinks to work out , ” said brandenburg , chuckling .
brandenburg knows all about working out the kinks .
after all , years passed between the first time brandenburg compressed a digital music file of susanne vega ’ s “ uncle tom ’ s diner , ” in the mid-1980s , to the point in the mid-1990s when his mp3 technology began to take off .
he thinks soundslike technology could be ready for a company to implement in a few months .
the human touch but his competitors say the program has fundamental flaws .
it 's not the music that should be measured , but rather the consumer 's taste .
“ it ’ s not possible for a machine to differentiate between a piece of grunge music or heavy metal from the 1980s , because it looks very similar acoustically , ” daniel müllensiefen , project manager at musicline.de told dw-world .
his system , soundprofiler , features a database compiled through a mix of human suggestions and software .
after rating a list of 40 songs , ten at a time , users are given a final list that is supposed to match their tastes perfectly .
beginning at the popkomm music trade fair in berlin on sept .
29 , internet users worldwide will be allowed to test the two programs .
they can then decide which of them - or one of two others designed by hamburg-based hifind and software developer ddd systems - works the best .
the winner gets an exclusive partnership with phonoline , which provides the software to germany ’ s music download portals .
along with the internet voting , a jury of music and technology journalists will help decide who gets the contract. itunes cool to the idea but whether big names like apple or microsoft will bite is still unclear .
alex luke , director of music programming and label relations at itunes , said that apple continues to recommend songs based on what buyers have bought and what they suggest .
“ how users buy and build their collections is valuable , but it 's only one of the ways we recommend music on itunes , ” he wrote in an e-mail .
but buyer statistics and suggestions don ’ t go far enough , argues brandenburg .
" there you have the problem that ... you always get to the same mainstream music , " he said .
" we clearly didn ’ t want that to happen .
you need to have something unexpected in there . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links musicline sound profiler one of the four sites competing hi find their recommendation system is fueled by the suggestions of music composers and journalists ddd system their recommendation system , musiclens , is a mix between human suggestions and software the competition beginning sept .

but after a controversial campaign marred by openly anti-foreigner propaganda , voters said " no " to any change .
switzerland has one of the largest per capita foreign populations in europe - over 20 percent .
most were born and brought up in switzerland , but they can not vote , and they are barred from certain jobs , such as working as police .
the government proposed making citizenship automatic for third generation immigrants , and easier for the second generation .
but swiss voters said " no " on sunday to both proposals , in a move which green party parliamentarian cecile buhlmann said would send the wrong signal to many young people .
the campaign against the measures was characterized by controversial publicity from the right-wing swiss people ’ s party , which produced posters showing black and brown hands snatching at swiss passports and mock newspaper articles suggesting moslems would soon outnumber christians in switzerland .
but the party 's secretary general , aliki panayides , defended the campaign , saying candidates for naturalization must show they are truly integrated .
recently , however , swiss communities have shown they believe some people can never be integrated - candidates with balkan or african roots are often rejected , even if they fulfill all the legal requirements for naturalization .
after this vote , that system remains intact .
swiss citizenship will continue to be a long and complicated process , in which local communities have the final say . dw staff -lrb- wo -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de right-wing populist wins seat in swiss cabinet when the swiss parliament voted to build a new government cabinet on wednesday , it may well have ushered in an era of political change .

four german companies are competing to offer the best online music-recommendation software .
in the mix : the inventor of the mp3 . some time in the near future , karlheinz brandenburg would like to have a conversation with his stereo .
he 'd like to tell it to play the kind of music he likes to typically hear at that time of day and what music direction it could consider .
" that ’ s a vision i ’ ve had for four or five years , " he said .

" to find things you like even if they weren ’ t in the same catalogue or next to each other . "
at present , four german companies are competing for the chance to help consumers match music to their tastes .
brandenburg and cremer think the answer lies in computer software that analyses the music itself .

“ i wouldn ’ t rule out that there are some kinks to work out , ” said brandenburg , chuckling .
brandenburg knows all about working out the kinks .
after all , years passed between the first time brandenburg compressed a digital music file of susanne vega ’ s “ uncle tom ’ s diner , ” in the mid-1980s , to the point in the mid-1990s when his mp3 technology began to take off .
he thinks soundslike technology could be ready for a company to implement in a few months .

it 's not the music that should be measured , but rather the consumer 's taste .
“ it ’ s not possible for a machine to differentiate between a piece of grunge music or heavy metal from the 1980s , because it looks very similar acoustically , ” daniel müllensiefen , project manager at musicline.de told dw-world .

“ how users buy and build their collections is valuable , but it 's only one of the ways we recommend music on itunes , ” he wrote in an e-mail .

" bilateral relations and above all , economic interests , will be at the forefront .
the chancellor will be accompanied by representatives of large german energy companies , " a german government spokesman told dw-world .
" but norway 's relationship to the eu and oslo 's possible rapprochement with brussels will also be on the agenda , " he added . professor heiko uecker , a norway expert at the university of bonn said economics was at the heart of bilateral relations .
" gas and oil interests in particular largely define ties between norway and germany , " he told dw-world . oil and gas the focus germany currently relies on norway for 20 percent of its oil and gas needs .
following recent deals signed between oslo and berlin , that share is expected to rise to over 30 percent by 2010 , when the nordic country will replace russia as germany 's largest oil supplier .
germany remains norway 's most important export market for oil and gas . though individual german companies , among them several medium-sized industries , have set up shop in norway , german oil and energy firms have hardly made a dent in norway 's massive offshore sector : natural oil and gas company rwe / dea is the only german company to be involved in oil production and exploration in norway , though it accounts for less than one percent of total overall production . in june this year during a visit to norway , german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said it would be " exciting and sensible in the long-term " if german companies such as rwe or ruhrgas , one of the biggest customers for norwegian oil producers , were to get more oil production rights in norway . that issue is expected to be taken up by chancellor schröder on tuesday . special attention to berlin experts say that in addition to burgeoning economic ties , political relations between the two countries have never been better . stephan michael schröder , a lecturer on scandinavian studies at berlin 's humboldt university , said the second world war did strain relations .
germany invaded norway in 1940 and occupied it until the end of the war .
" it was a painful period , but both norway and postwar germany joined the nato fairly early against a common enemy and the historic rift has been forgotten .
traditionally good relations have been smooth since the 1960s . " oslo , in particular , has been at pains to cultivate close relations with germany .
in 1999 , the then social democratic norwegian government unveiled a so-called " strategy for germany , " an exhaustive report detailing areas of potential cooperation which touches upon developing intensive political , economic , cultural and scientific ties and includes measures such as encouraging norwegians to learn german , setting up an online portal on norway in german , and executing a labor exchange . " there is enormous interest in germany from the norwegian side , " said stephan michael schröder .
" there 's a lot of money flowing for academics and cultural exchange and scientific research . " wary of the eu but there remains little doubt that one of the reasons for oslo 's wooing of berlin is the country 's difficult relationship to brussels and its deep-seated reluctance to join the 25-member bloc . " the very word ' european union ' is like a bad odor in norway , " said uecker .
" it 's a young country , it does n't want to lose its independence so soon . " but it 's not just its political sovereignty that norway , which voted against eu membership in referendums in 1972 and 1994 , is scared of losing . the country , with its 4.5 million inhabitants is the world 's third-largest exporter of oil after saudi arabia and russia and one of the richest in the world .
norway is expected to pump north sea oil for another 50 years and gas for a century . the country has also been cannily funneling 80 percent of its oil revenues into a petroleum fund that is invested overseas so the benefits can be used to finance its lavish social systems for generations to come . " the prospect of eu membership , particularly after the bloc 's eastward expansion , worries many norwegians that illegal workers might come into their country and pick off their generous welfare system and that their country might become poorer , " said uecker .
neighboring eu member sweden 's thumbs-down to joining the common euro currency in a referendum last year did n't help to bolster pro-eu feelings in norway either . can norway afford to stay out ? however , near-daily eu barometer polls published in the country 's media show that norwegians may be gradually reconciling themselves to the fact that remaining on the fringes of the european union may not be a viable option in the long run . norway - along with liechtenstein , iceland and switzerland - is a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- , which provides for free movement of goods , services , capital and labor between the union and european countries that have remained outside .
but , as norway is discovering , non-membership of the eu is still costing it money in other ways . from 2004 , norway -lrb- along with iceland , another non-eu nordic country -rrb- will pay five times their present membership fee of the efta .
in addition , norway will also channel existing bilateral aid for eastern europe through the eu , so its total transfer to the union will top nkr1.7 billion -lrb- € 203 million -rrb- a year , a tenfold rise . in addition to the money , experts say norway also has to adopt directives from brussels such as export duties on fish products as its own law .

dw-world readers comment on whether the country should join the union . i can only hope that turkey is never allowed into the eu .
it would be a disaster .
it would not only open the doors to more terrorists , it would bring racial and cultural differences to a boiling point across europe that would spell and end to eu .
a mass exodus of countries from the eu would soon ensue , thus all the hard work put towards bringing europe together would be for naught .
the very thought of turkey joining the eu is preposterous .

i thought turkey was a democracy and the eu defended and insisted on freedom of speech .
i was mistaken , as neither -lrb- turkish premier -rrb- erdogan nor the eu commissioner find this frightening law problematic . - m.g. ikossi a turkey operating within the european political parameters would be a great step towards reconciling west with the islamic world but it would signal the end to efforts to create a european state that could defend and promote our interests on the international arena .
the eu would then need to go back to the drawing table and re-define its purpose of existence as with turkey in the eu very few would feel comfortable integrating any further .

" bilateral relations and above all , economic interests , will be at the forefront .
the chancellor will be accompanied by representatives of large german energy companies , " a german government spokesman told dw-world .
" but norway 's relationship to the eu and oslo 's possible rapprochement with brussels will also be on the agenda , " he added . professor heiko uecker , a norway expert at the university of bonn said economics was at the heart of bilateral relations .
" gas and oil interests in particular largely define ties between norway and germany , " he told dw-world . oil and gas the focus germany currently relies on norway for 20 percent of its oil and gas needs .
following recent deals signed between oslo and berlin , that share is expected to rise to over 30 percent by 2010 , when the nordic country will replace russia as germany 's largest oil supplier .
germany remains norway 's most important export market for oil and gas . though individual german companies , among them several medium-sized industries , have set up shop in norway , german oil and energy firms have hardly made a dent in norway 's massive offshore sector : natural oil and gas company rwe / dea is the only german company to be involved in oil production and exploration in norway , though it accounts for less than one percent of total overall production . in june this year during a visit to norway , german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said it would be " exciting and sensible in the long-term " if german companies such as rwe or ruhrgas , one of the biggest customers for norwegian oil producers , were to get more oil production rights in norway . that issue is expected to be taken up by chancellor schröder on tuesday . special attention to berlin experts say that in addition to burgeoning economic ties , political relations between the two countries have never been better . stephan michael schröder , a lecturer on scandinavian studies at berlin 's humboldt university , said the second world war did strain relations .
germany invaded norway in 1940 and occupied it until the end of the war .
" it was a painful period , but both norway and postwar germany joined the nato fairly early against a common enemy and the historic rift has been forgotten .
traditionally good relations have been smooth since the 1960s . " oslo , in particular , has been at pains to cultivate close relations with germany .
in 1999 , the then social democratic norwegian government unveiled a so-called " strategy for germany , " an exhaustive report detailing areas of potential cooperation which touches upon developing intensive political , economic , cultural and scientific ties and includes measures such as encouraging norwegians to learn german , setting up an online portal on norway in german , and executing a labor exchange . " there is enormous interest in germany from the norwegian side , " said stephan michael schröder .
" there 's a lot of money flowing for academics and cultural exchange and scientific research . " wary of the eu but there remains little doubt that one of the reasons for oslo 's wooing of berlin is the country 's difficult relationship to brussels and its deep-seated reluctance to join the 25-member bloc . " the very word ' european union ' is like a bad odor in norway , " said uecker .
" it 's a young country , it does n't want to lose its independence so soon . " but it 's not just its political sovereignty that norway , which voted against eu membership in referendums in 1972 and 1994 , is scared of losing . the country , with its 4.5 million inhabitants is the world 's third-largest exporter of oil after saudi arabia and russia and one of the richest in the world .
norway is expected to pump north sea oil for another 50 years and gas for a century . the country has also been cannily funneling 80 percent of its oil revenues into a petroleum fund that is invested overseas so the benefits can be used to finance its lavish social systems for generations to come . " the prospect of eu membership , particularly after the bloc 's eastward expansion , worries many norwegians that illegal workers might come into their country and pick off their generous welfare system and that their country might become poorer , " said uecker .
neighboring eu member sweden 's thumbs-down to joining the common euro currency in a referendum last year did n't help to bolster pro-eu feelings in norway either . can norway afford to stay out ? however , near-daily eu barometer polls published in the country 's media show that norwegians may be gradually reconciling themselves to the fact that remaining on the fringes of the european union may not be a viable option in the long run . norway - along with liechtenstein , iceland and switzerland - is a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- , which provides for free movement of goods , services , capital and labor between the union and european countries that have remained outside .
but , as norway is discovering , non-membership of the eu is still costing it money in other ways . from 2004 , norway -lrb- along with iceland , another non-eu nordic country -rrb- will pay five times their present membership fee of the efta .
in addition , norway will also channel existing bilateral aid for eastern europe through the eu , so its total transfer to the union will top nkr1.7 billion -lrb- € 203 million -rrb- a year , a tenfold rise . in addition to the money , experts say norway also has to adopt directives from brussels such as export duties on fish products as its own law .
" norway just ca n't afford to remain on the sidelines in the long run because though it has to implement decisions from brussels , it has no power to influence them , " said uecker .
" they will be in the union in ten years . " germans could represent oslo 's interests germany , in the meantime , could play a vital role in representing norway 's interests in the eu on account of its location , size and clout in the club , experts say .
" right since chancellor helmut kohl 's time , the germans have always been in favor of norway joining the eu , " said uecker . " developing a so-called " northern dimension , " which includes involving oil-rich russia in european cooperation , as a counterweight to the southern part of europe is also an idea that finds resonance both in norway and germany , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union dw-world 's special dossier on eu expansion and the run-up to the historic event .

but after a controversial campaign marred by openly anti-foreigner propaganda , voters said " no " to any change .
switzerland has one of the largest per capita foreign populations in europe - over 20 percent .
most were born and brought up in switzerland , but they can not vote , and they are barred from certain jobs , such as working as police .
the government proposed making citizenship automatic for third generation immigrants , and easier for the second generation .
but swiss voters said " no " on sunday to both proposals , in a move which green party parliamentarian cecile buhlmann said would send the wrong signal to many young people .
the campaign against the measures was characterized by controversial publicity from the right-wing swiss people ’ s party , which produced posters showing black and brown hands snatching at swiss passports and mock newspaper articles suggesting moslems would soon outnumber christians in switzerland .
but the party 's secretary general , aliki panayides , defended the campaign , saying candidates for naturalization must show they are truly integrated .
recently , however , swiss communities have shown they believe some people can never be integrated - candidates with balkan or african roots are often rejected , even if they fulfill all the legal requirements for naturalization .
after this vote , that system remains intact .
swiss citizenship will continue to be a long and complicated process , in which local communities have the final say . dw staff -lrb- wo -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de right-wing populist wins seat in swiss cabinet when the swiss parliament voted to build a new government cabinet on wednesday , it may well have ushered in an era of political change .

dw-world readers comment on whether the country should join the union . i can only hope that turkey is never allowed into the eu .
it would be a disaster .
it would not only open the doors to more terrorists , it would bring racial and cultural differences to a boiling point across europe that would spell and end to eu .
a mass exodus of countries from the eu would soon ensue , thus all the hard work put towards bringing europe together would be for naught .
the very thought of turkey joining the eu is preposterous .
turkey is not a part of europe .
they share no cultural , political or social commonality with europe .
even without all of this the simple fact is that the people of europe do not want turkey to join .
this alone should be enough to prevent it from happening . - john young the most disturbing provision of the proposed laws in turkey is not the adultery issue .
it is a law which makes any criticism of the official government position on various issues -lrb- for example the armenian genocide and the occupation army in cyprus -rrb- punishable by law .
i am rather surprised at the lack of attention to such an infringement of the freedom of speech .
i thought turkey was a democracy and the eu defended and insisted on freedom of speech .
i was mistaken , as neither -lrb- turkish premier -rrb- erdogan nor the eu commissioner find this frightening law problematic . - m.g. ikossi a turkey operating within the european political parameters would be a great step towards reconciling west with the islamic world but it would signal the end to efforts to create a european state that could defend and promote our interests on the international arena .
the eu would then need to go back to the drawing table and re-define its purpose of existence as with turkey in the eu very few would feel comfortable integrating any further .
this may sound attractive for us and the uk but not so attractive to those of us who have supported the eu in expanding and achieving the critical mass for bolstering it 's economic power .
i simply hope that our leaders find a way out of this dangerous territory without enraging turkey and the us . - pantelis koul , britain i think that neither turkey nor eu is ready for turkey 's membership to eu .
the europeans are unable to get over their historical prejudice against turks and turks are in a daydream that eu membership will make them rich overnight without having to go through hard work . - sedat akkurt even though our religions might differ , we aim for the same type of life style as you do .
at the end , we are as european as you are and have always been ...
turkey 's place must definitely be in the eu . - emre sungur , usa as an outsider looking in at the one part of the first world that pays attention to more than just economic expansion , i wish for europe that you find some middle path between inexorable globalization on the one hand and crude , vicious racism on the other .
right now , europe looks neither willing to truly assimilate demographically large numbers of muslims nor able to set a boundary and choose in a humane and moral way to remain europe .
please at least recognize that obedience to the commercial logic of globalization is propelling europe into cultural changes that few in europe really want and many resent deeply , but without intelligent voicing . - kevin rooney turkey is a country that has a dynamic and strong economy , even though is has some problems .
it will recover by 2015 with the eu 's help and then this economy will turn into a dynamo for the eu .
when its comes to society , turkish people are not only the ones you see in europe - those have left turkey at least 30 years ago . - mustafa aydogan , britain while turkey was fulfilling the requirements for admission to the eu , turkey showed it had clout and would use it to advance its own self-perceived interests as an independent sovereign nation .
turkey 's conduct continually confirms it is not a compliant tool of the west .
turkey is unique in many ways beyond its geographic location .
turkey is a muslim but democratic nation .
turkey has a strong , well-equipped , and modern military that is very capable of defending the causes and advancing the interests to which it is committed .
but , since the eu has an urgent and existing necessity to defend against the ubiquitous threat of terrorism and turkey has proven itself worthy of membership to this organization , the eu needs to accept turkey as a eu member without any further delay . - donald slazinski send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey adopts key eu reforms turkey 's parliament on sunday passed a crucial package of reforms aimed at boosting the country 's chances for starting membership talks with the european union .

but after a controversial campaign marred by openly anti-foreigner propaganda , voters said " no " to any change .
switzerland has one of the largest per capita foreign populations in europe - over 20 percent .
most were born and brought up in switzerland , but they can not vote , and they are barred from certain jobs , such as working as police .
the government proposed making citizenship automatic for third generation immigrants , and easier for the second generation .
but swiss voters said " no " on sunday to both proposals , in a move which green party parliamentarian cecile buhlmann said would send the wrong signal to many young people .
the campaign against the measures was characterized by controversial publicity from the right-wing swiss people ’ s party , which produced posters showing black and brown hands snatching at swiss passports and mock newspaper articles suggesting moslems would soon outnumber christians in switzerland .
but the party 's secretary general , aliki panayides , defended the campaign , saying candidates for naturalization must show they are truly integrated .
recently , however , swiss communities have shown they believe some people can never be integrated - candidates with balkan or african roots are often rejected , even if they fulfill all the legal requirements for naturalization .
after this vote , that system remains intact .
swiss citizenship will continue to be a long and complicated process , in which local communities have the final say . dw staff -lrb- wo -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de right-wing populist wins seat in swiss cabinet when the swiss parliament voted to build a new government cabinet on wednesday , it may well have ushered in an era of political change .

experts say the new high was pushed by political instability in nigeria . crude oil futures remained above $ 50 dollars a barrel in asian trade on tuesday after breaking through the key psychological barrier as concerns over supply continued to dominate the market , dealers said .
at 2:30 pm -lrb- 0630 utc -rrb- , new york 's reference contract , light sweet crude for november delivery was at $ 50.42 a barrel , up from the record closing high of 49.64 in new york on monday .
it hit $ 50.47 in an intra-day high . analysts said factors driving prices up include unrest in nigeria and saudi arabia , hurricanes in the united states , continued violence in iraq and the legal and supply woes of russian energy giant yukos . nigerian rebels threaten war nigeria is the world 's seventh largest oil exporter , pumping out 2.3 million barrels per day .
nigerian rebels have warned oil companies to shut down production in the niger delta , or face " all-out war " starting on oct.1.
they said anyone assisting the state would be considered an enemy . the rebels are seeking to force political reforms and independence for the oil-rich , yet impoverished niger delta .
kurt barrow , a singapore-based principal at us energy consultancy purvin and gertz , said the high oil prices could also be blamed on tight supply amid strong demand from the united states , china and india which had caught the market by surprise . he said surplus production has fallen to only one million barrels of oil a day from three to five million over the past few years . threats of disruption to these already tight supplies are conspiring to keep the volatile situation boiling . " fundamentaly , there is a very tight supply-demand balance in the petroleum market , " barrow told afp , adding that any disturbances in major producers such as iraq , nigeria , russia and venezuela are bound to affect prices . prices to remain high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stacked oil drums barrow said prices are expected to remain high for some time . " much depends on what world events happen over the next six to 18 months , " he said . " our view is that the price will remain high and volatile really until some additional production come on stream , perhaps later this year or likely next year . " " once we rebuild this supply cushion , then it 's likely that prices will come back down .
until then , we expect oil prices to stay high . " barrow said hedge funds and speculative trading were acting " to exacerbate the volatility but i think that even without these you will still see high oil prices . " germany 's economics minister wolfgang clement described the high price of oil as a danger for the global economy . " they definitely pose a risk , " clement said late monday in berlin .

experts say the new high was pushed by political instability in nigeria . crude oil futures remained above $ 50 dollars a barrel in asian trade on tuesday after breaking through the key psychological barrier as concerns over supply continued to dominate the market , dealers said .

plenty of german taxpayers ' money is senselessly spent on pet projects and there 's overspending ripe to be cut from the nation 's budget , according to a watchdog group . whether it was laser light and intergalactic roller coasters at bremen 's now bankrupt space park -lrb- € 197 million or $ 243 million -rrb- , a multicultural center turned disco temple in halle -lrb- € 4.6 million -rrb- or € 46 million companies waste jumping though bureaucratic hoops each year , the german taxpayer association brought these and other cases of squandered money - totaling € 30 billion , about 5 percent of all money the state spends - to light in a press conference tuesday .
a road that leads nowhere , a bus stop on a street with no bus lines and military jets the army does n't need are among the 111 cases of money being thrown out the window that fill the 32ned edition of the association 's " black book . "
the fact that no one in the town of hagen realized there was € 127,000 worth of marriage license fees sitting in a desk drawer instead of a bank account earning interest was n't one of the book 's major finds , but a typical example for how money is wasted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public 's money is thrown away in many different ways " there 's an incredible thoughtlessness , a hey-it 's-not-my-money mentality , " said association president karl heinz däke , who also called for creating new ways to prosecute civil servants caught wasting money .
" there is a system of collective irresponsibility , " he said .
plenty of ways to waste money another case mentioned in the book was german tv , a pay-per-view german language service shown in the united states that cost the government € 20 million .
it 's having difficulty finding subscribers and the taxpayer association believes it wo n't last much longer .
german tv is a joint project of german public broadcasters ard and zdf and deutsche welle .
then there 's the rider-information system .
after investing € 5.2 million , the system should have informed bus riders about delays and cancellations via a satellite system , but software problems kept the users from being able to use the information panels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you mean we still do n't have any blueprints ?
project overruns resulted in many expensive mistakes , the association said - such as the german labor office 's virtual job market , which cost € 33 million more than the € 65 million set aside for the project .
construction delays and design changes for a police headquaters in frankfurt cost the state € 38 million because there were no finished plans when building began in 1998 .
dieter ondracek , head of germany 's tax union , said he doubted the veracity of the book 's figures after errors were found in last year 's edition and labor unions called the book 's figures , which the association bases on official calculations as well as media reports , exaggerated . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germans abuse state system amid continuing protests over benefit cuts , chancellor schröder has sharply criticized his countrymen who he says take more than their fair share of state allowances .
the comments have raised the ire of social groups .

the eu parliament can reject barroso 's entire team but not individual commissioners . most of the questioning over the next two weeks will focus on potential conflicts of interest in barroso 's team , which is considered more market friendly than the last one and includes some wealthy and influential members . all 24 commissioner-designates have to file statements of financial interests , declare their assets and fill out a questionnaire before they submit themselves to the grilling . a controversial candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes one of the most controversial members of barroso 's team to take the stand on tuesday is dutch politician and businesswoman neelie kroes , who is to succeed mario monti as the european union 's antitrust chief , arguably one of the eu 's most powerful offices . kroes , who is a member of the dutch free-market liberal party and has served two terms as minister for transport , public works and telecommunications during the 1980s , also has considerable links to big business .
she has sat on the boards of a dozen top european companies and is reported to be fabulously wealthy , owning a house in an upscale neighborhood of the hague as well as two office buildings . eu parliamentary members have already cast doubts on whether kroes can take on a job that so obviously clashes with her vested interests in the world of politics and business .

kirch had filed a 39-page complaint with a court in new york in january , accusing deutsche bank and liberty media and their chairmen of plotting the destruction of the kirch group in a bid to rid liberty media of an unwelcome rival in the german cable television market and secure fat commissions for deutsche bank .
the court found that kirch had failed to prove his case and " dimissed -lrb- the suit -rrb- for failure to state a claim , " according to a copy of the ruling made available by deutsche bank on tuesday .
the new york lawsuit was part of a long and bitter legal battle between kirch and deutsche bank since the kirch media empire collapsed in april 2002 .
the conflict dates back to comments by deutsche bank 's then chairman breuer made on television in 2002 , in which he publicly questioned the creditworthiness of the kirch group .
soon afterwards , banks refused to lend kirch any more money and kirchmedia , the main pillar of the kirch group , filed for insolvency in april 2002 .
in december , a munich court ruled in kirch 's favour , finding that breuer had violated his duty of client confidentiality .
the munich court ordered deutsche bank to pay unspecified compensation to kirch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.09.2004 new eu commission faces intense grilling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incoming eu commissioners are under the magnifying glass the eu parliament has begun questioning incoming eu commissioners , largely to sniff out potential conflicts of interests of a few wealthy members .
the hearings will determine whether the 24-member team will be accepted . tough but fair is how eu parliamentarians say they want to be , as they began grilling the first of 24 designated eu commissioners appointed by eu commission president-designate jose manuel barroso on monday . each of the members of the european union executive will face three hours of questioning by parliamentary committees on issues ranging from turkey 's membership bid , immigration , fiscal discipline and taxation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel durao barroso barroso won strong endorsement in july from the 732-member parliament , but his team still needs parliamentary approval to take office on november 1 for a five-year term .
the eu parliament can reject barroso 's entire team but not individual commissioners . most of the questioning over the next two weeks will focus on potential conflicts of interest in barroso 's team , which is considered more market friendly than the last one and includes some wealthy and influential members . all 24 commissioner-designates have to file statements of financial interests , declare their assets and fill out a questionnaire before they submit themselves to the grilling . a controversial candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes one of the most controversial members of barroso 's team to take the stand on tuesday is dutch politician and businesswoman neelie kroes , who is to succeed mario monti as the european union 's antitrust chief , arguably one of the eu 's most powerful offices . kroes , who is a member of the dutch free-market liberal party and has served two terms as minister for transport , public works and telecommunications during the 1980s , also has considerable links to big business .
she has sat on the boards of a dozen top european companies and is reported to be fabulously wealthy , owning a house in an upscale neighborhood of the hague as well as two office buildings . eu parliamentary members have already cast doubts on whether kroes can take on a job that so obviously clashes with her vested interests in the world of politics and business .
" neelie kroes was on the supervisory board of numerous companies which are directly or indirectly affected by the activities of the commission 's competition authority , " said pervenche beres , chairwoman of the parliamentary committee on economic and monetary affairs . " that 's why it 's a justified ethical issue to scrutinize her . " for her part , kroes has said she has already sold all stocks and options and resigned from company boards as well as pledged to distance herself from cases concerning firms she may have been involved in .
she also promised that if decisions are to be made by the eu antitrust authority which involve former employers , she will restrain from voting on it . but , it remains to be seen whether kroes will sufficiently convince all parliamentary members of her neutrality . conflict of interest not only sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione other incoming eu commissioners , who , like kroes , may be in for a rough ride during the interrogation include mariann fischer boel , nominee for the eu 's agriculture portfolio , and italian rocco buttiglione , assigned by barroso to be in charge of asylum and immigration policy . boel attracted the attention of eu parliamentarians because she owns land that includes a farm receiving eu subsidies and buttiglione has stirred controversy by his support for plans to set up asylum camps outside eu borders .
boel , however , has since been cleared after she sold her shares in danish sugar producer danisco . expertise of candidates also checked but it 's not just potential conflict of interest that the eu questioners are interested in .
other nagging conflict points include the political past of some commissioners from the new eastern european members as well as the expertise and experience of some incoming commissioners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen for instance , there is little doubt that german eu commissioner günter verheugen , who has been responsible for eastern european expansion so far , has gathered valuable experience when it comes to eu diplomacy and working methods .
but it remains questionable whether he has the necessary skills for his new portfolio of " industries and companies , " which verheugen has agreed to take on following pressure from the german government . the chairman of the parliamentary committee on industry , research and energy , giles chichester , has said verheugen will be examined thoroughly .
verheugen is expected to be grilled on his intentions and whether he will pursue a liberal market course as well as ideas for growth and innovation within the framework of the so-called lisbon agenda , which refers to a march 2000 eu summit when eu leaders and governments agreed to make the eu " the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy by 2010 . " " i want to hear from mr verheugen , how he plans to enforce the lisbon agenda , which so far has only been talked of , but not implemented , " chichester said . the eu parliament is expected to vote on the new team by the end of october .
the questioning of the eu commissioner-designates is public and can be followed live on the internet under www.europarl.eu.int in 19 languages . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission to focus on economic growth in its first meeting , the next eu commission set its priorities for the five-year term starting in november .

kirch had filed a 39-page complaint with a court in new york in january , accusing deutsche bank and liberty media and their chairmen of plotting the destruction of the kirch group in a bid to rid liberty media of an unwelcome rival in the german cable television market and secure fat commissions for deutsche bank .
the court found that kirch had failed to prove his case and " dimissed -lrb- the suit -rrb- for failure to state a claim , " according to a copy of the ruling made available by deutsche bank on tuesday .
the new york lawsuit was part of a long and bitter legal battle between kirch and deutsche bank since the kirch media empire collapsed in april 2002 .
the conflict dates back to comments by deutsche bank 's then chairman breuer made on television in 2002 , in which he publicly questioned the creditworthiness of the kirch group .
soon afterwards , banks refused to lend kirch any more money and kirchmedia , the main pillar of the kirch group , filed for insolvency in april 2002 .
in december , a munich court ruled in kirch 's favour , finding that breuer had violated his duty of client confidentiality .
the munich court ordered deutsche bank to pay unspecified compensation to kirch .

dw-world readers comment on whether the country should join the union . i can only hope that turkey is never allowed into the eu .
it would be a disaster .
it would not only open the doors to more terrorists , it would bring racial and cultural differences to a boiling point across europe that would spell and end to eu .
a mass exodus of countries from the eu would soon ensue , thus all the hard work put towards bringing europe together would be for naught .
the very thought of turkey joining the eu is preposterous .
turkey is not a part of europe .

even without all of this the simple fact is that the people of europe do not want turkey to join .
this alone should be enough to prevent it from happening . - john young the most disturbing provision of the proposed laws in turkey is not the adultery issue .
it is a law which makes any criticism of the official government position on various issues -lrb- for example the armenian genocide and the occupation army in cyprus -rrb- punishable by law .
i am rather surprised at the lack of attention to such an infringement of the freedom of speech .
i thought turkey was a democracy and the eu defended and insisted on freedom of speech .
i was mistaken , as neither -lrb- turkish premier -rrb- erdogan nor the eu commissioner find this frightening law problematic . - m.g. ikossi a turkey operating within the european political parameters would be a great step towards reconciling west with the islamic world but it would signal the end to efforts to create a european state that could defend and promote our interests on the international arena .
the eu would then need to go back to the drawing table and re-define its purpose of existence as with turkey in the eu very few would feel comfortable integrating any further .
this may sound attractive for us and the uk but not so attractive to those of us who have supported the eu in expanding and achieving the critical mass for bolstering it 's economic power .
i simply hope that our leaders find a way out of this dangerous territory without enraging turkey and the us . - pantelis koul , britain i think that neither turkey nor eu is ready for turkey 's membership to eu .
the europeans are unable to get over their historical prejudice against turks and turks are in a daydream that eu membership will make them rich overnight without having to go through hard work . - sedat akkurt even though our religions might differ , we aim for the same type of life style as you do .

right now , europe looks neither willing to truly assimilate demographically large numbers of muslims nor able to set a boundary and choose in a humane and moral way to remain europe .
please at least recognize that obedience to the commercial logic of globalization is propelling europe into cultural changes that few in europe really want and many resent deeply , but without intelligent voicing . - kevin rooney turkey is a country that has a dynamic and strong economy , even though is has some problems .
it will recover by 2015 with the eu 's help and then this economy will turn into a dynamo for the eu .

" bilateral relations and above all , economic interests , will be at the forefront .
the chancellor will be accompanied by representatives of large german energy companies , " a german government spokesman told dw-world .
" but norway 's relationship to the eu and oslo 's possible rapprochement with brussels will also be on the agenda , " he added . professor heiko uecker , a norway expert at the university of bonn said economics was at the heart of bilateral relations .
" gas and oil interests in particular largely define ties between norway and germany , " he told dw-world . oil and gas the focus germany currently relies on norway for 20 percent of its oil and gas needs .
following recent deals signed between oslo and berlin , that share is expected to rise to over 30 percent by 2010 , when the nordic country will replace russia as germany 's largest oil supplier .
germany remains norway 's most important export market for oil and gas . though individual german companies , among them several medium-sized industries , have set up shop in norway , german oil and energy firms have hardly made a dent in norway 's massive offshore sector : natural oil and gas company rwe / dea is the only german company to be involved in oil production and exploration in norway , though it accounts for less than one percent of total overall production . in june this year during a visit to norway , german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said it would be " exciting and sensible in the long-term " if german companies such as rwe or ruhrgas , one of the biggest customers for norwegian oil producers , were to get more oil production rights in norway . that issue is expected to be taken up by chancellor schröder on tuesday . special attention to berlin experts say that in addition to burgeoning economic ties , political relations between the two countries have never been better . stephan michael schröder , a lecturer on scandinavian studies at berlin 's humboldt university , said the second world war did strain relations .
germany invaded norway in 1940 and occupied it until the end of the war .
" it was a painful period , but both norway and postwar germany joined the nato fairly early against a common enemy and the historic rift has been forgotten .
traditionally good relations have been smooth since the 1960s . " oslo , in particular , has been at pains to cultivate close relations with germany .
in 1999 , the then social democratic norwegian government unveiled a so-called " strategy for germany , " an exhaustive report detailing areas of potential cooperation which touches upon developing intensive political , economic , cultural and scientific ties and includes measures such as encouraging norwegians to learn german , setting up an online portal on norway in german , and executing a labor exchange . " there is enormous interest in germany from the norwegian side , " said stephan michael schröder .
" there 's a lot of money flowing for academics and cultural exchange and scientific research . " wary of the eu but there remains little doubt that one of the reasons for oslo 's wooing of berlin is the country 's difficult relationship to brussels and its deep-seated reluctance to join the 25-member bloc . " the very word ' european union ' is like a bad odor in norway , " said uecker .
" it 's a young country , it does n't want to lose its independence so soon . " but it 's not just its political sovereignty that norway , which voted against eu membership in referendums in 1972 and 1994 , is scared of losing . the country , with its 4.5 million inhabitants is the world 's third-largest exporter of oil after saudi arabia and russia and one of the richest in the world .
norway is expected to pump north sea oil for another 50 years and gas for a century . the country has also been cannily funneling 80 percent of its oil revenues into a petroleum fund that is invested overseas so the benefits can be used to finance its lavish social systems for generations to come . " the prospect of eu membership , particularly after the bloc 's eastward expansion , worries many norwegians that illegal workers might come into their country and pick off their generous welfare system and that their country might become poorer , " said uecker .
neighboring eu member sweden 's thumbs-down to joining the common euro currency in a referendum last year did n't help to bolster pro-eu feelings in norway either . can norway afford to stay out ? however , near-daily eu barometer polls published in the country 's media show that norwegians may be gradually reconciling themselves to the fact that remaining on the fringes of the european union may not be a viable option in the long run . norway - along with liechtenstein , iceland and switzerland - is a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- , which provides for free movement of goods , services , capital and labor between the union and european countries that have remained outside .
but , as norway is discovering , non-membership of the eu is still costing it money in other ways . from 2004 , norway -lrb- along with iceland , another non-eu nordic country -rrb- will pay five times their present membership fee of the efta .
in addition , norway will also channel existing bilateral aid for eastern europe through the eu , so its total transfer to the union will top nkr1.7 billion -lrb- € 203 million -rrb- a year , a tenfold rise . in addition to the money , experts say norway also has to adopt directives from brussels such as export duties on fish products as its own law .
" norway just ca n't afford to remain on the sidelines in the long run because though it has to implement decisions from brussels , it has no power to influence them , " said uecker .
" they will be in the union in ten years . " germans could represent oslo 's interests germany , in the meantime , could play a vital role in representing norway 's interests in the eu on account of its location , size and clout in the club , experts say .
" right since chancellor helmut kohl 's time , the germans have always been in favor of norway joining the eu , " said uecker . " developing a so-called " northern dimension , " which includes involving oil-rich russia in european cooperation , as a counterweight to the southern part of europe is also an idea that finds resonance both in norway and germany , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union dw-world 's special dossier on eu expansion and the run-up to the historic event .

" bilateral relations and above all , economic interests , will be at the forefront .
the chancellor will be accompanied by representatives of large german energy companies , " a german government spokesman told dw-world .
" but norway 's relationship to the eu and oslo 's possible rapprochement with brussels will also be on the agenda , " he added . professor heiko uecker , a norway expert at the university of bonn said economics was at the heart of bilateral relations .
" gas and oil interests in particular largely define ties between norway and germany , " he told dw-world . oil and gas the focus germany currently relies on norway for 20 percent of its oil and gas needs .
following recent deals signed between oslo and berlin , that share is expected to rise to over 30 percent by 2010 , when the nordic country will replace russia as germany 's largest oil supplier .
germany remains norway 's most important export market for oil and gas . though individual german companies , among them several medium-sized industries , have set up shop in norway , german oil and energy firms have hardly made a dent in norway 's massive offshore sector : natural oil and gas company rwe / dea is the only german company to be involved in oil production and exploration in norway , though it accounts for less than one percent of total overall production . in june this year during a visit to norway , german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said it would be " exciting and sensible in the long-term " if german companies such as rwe or ruhrgas , one of the biggest customers for norwegian oil producers , were to get more oil production rights in norway . that issue is expected to be taken up by chancellor schröder on tuesday . special attention to berlin experts say that in addition to burgeoning economic ties , political relations between the two countries have never been better . stephan michael schröder , a lecturer on scandinavian studies at berlin 's humboldt university , said the second world war did strain relations .
germany invaded norway in 1940 and occupied it until the end of the war .
" it was a painful period , but both norway and postwar germany joined the nato fairly early against a common enemy and the historic rift has been forgotten .
traditionally good relations have been smooth since the 1960s . " oslo , in particular , has been at pains to cultivate close relations with germany .
in 1999 , the then social democratic norwegian government unveiled a so-called " strategy for germany , " an exhaustive report detailing areas of potential cooperation which touches upon developing intensive political , economic , cultural and scientific ties and includes measures such as encouraging norwegians to learn german , setting up an online portal on norway in german , and executing a labor exchange . " there is enormous interest in germany from the norwegian side , " said stephan michael schröder .
" there 's a lot of money flowing for academics and cultural exchange and scientific research . " wary of the eu but there remains little doubt that one of the reasons for oslo 's wooing of berlin is the country 's difficult relationship to brussels and its deep-seated reluctance to join the 25-member bloc . " the very word ' european union ' is like a bad odor in norway , " said uecker .
" it 's a young country , it does n't want to lose its independence so soon . " but it 's not just its political sovereignty that norway , which voted against eu membership in referendums in 1972 and 1994 , is scared of losing . the country , with its 4.5 million inhabitants is the world 's third-largest exporter of oil after saudi arabia and russia and one of the richest in the world .
norway is expected to pump north sea oil for another 50 years and gas for a century . the country has also been cannily funneling 80 percent of its oil revenues into a petroleum fund that is invested overseas so the benefits can be used to finance its lavish social systems for generations to come . " the prospect of eu membership , particularly after the bloc 's eastward expansion , worries many norwegians that illegal workers might come into their country and pick off their generous welfare system and that their country might become poorer , " said uecker .
neighboring eu member sweden 's thumbs-down to joining the common euro currency in a referendum last year did n't help to bolster pro-eu feelings in norway either . can norway afford to stay out ? however , near-daily eu barometer polls published in the country 's media show that norwegians may be gradually reconciling themselves to the fact that remaining on the fringes of the european union may not be a viable option in the long run . norway - along with liechtenstein , iceland and switzerland - is a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- , which provides for free movement of goods , services , capital and labor between the union and european countries that have remained outside .
but , as norway is discovering , non-membership of the eu is still costing it money in other ways . from 2004 , norway -lrb- along with iceland , another non-eu nordic country -rrb- will pay five times their present membership fee of the efta .
in addition , norway will also channel existing bilateral aid for eastern europe through the eu , so its total transfer to the union will top nkr1.7 billion -lrb- € 203 million -rrb- a year , a tenfold rise . in addition to the money , experts say norway also has to adopt directives from brussels such as export duties on fish products as its own law .
" norway just ca n't afford to remain on the sidelines in the long run because though it has to implement decisions from brussels , it has no power to influence them , " said uecker .
" they will be in the union in ten years . " germans could represent oslo 's interests germany , in the meantime , could play a vital role in representing norway 's interests in the eu on account of its location , size and clout in the club , experts say .
" right since chancellor helmut kohl 's time , the germans have always been in favor of norway joining the eu , " said uecker . " developing a so-called " northern dimension , " which includes involving oil-rich russia in european cooperation , as a counterweight to the southern part of europe is also an idea that finds resonance both in norway and germany , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union dw-world 's special dossier on eu expansion and the run-up to the historic event .

dw-world readers comment on whether the country should join the union . i can only hope that turkey is never allowed into the eu .
it would be a disaster .
it would not only open the doors to more terrorists , it would bring racial and cultural differences to a boiling point across europe that would spell and end to eu .
a mass exodus of countries from the eu would soon ensue , thus all the hard work put towards bringing europe together would be for naught .
the very thought of turkey joining the eu is preposterous .
turkey is not a part of europe .
they share no cultural , political or social commonality with europe .
even without all of this the simple fact is that the people of europe do not want turkey to join .
this alone should be enough to prevent it from happening . - john young the most disturbing provision of the proposed laws in turkey is not the adultery issue .
it is a law which makes any criticism of the official government position on various issues -lrb- for example the armenian genocide and the occupation army in cyprus -rrb- punishable by law .
i am rather surprised at the lack of attention to such an infringement of the freedom of speech .
i thought turkey was a democracy and the eu defended and insisted on freedom of speech .
i was mistaken , as neither -lrb- turkish premier -rrb- erdogan nor the eu commissioner find this frightening law problematic . - m.g. ikossi a turkey operating within the european political parameters would be a great step towards reconciling west with the islamic world but it would signal the end to efforts to create a european state that could defend and promote our interests on the international arena .
the eu would then need to go back to the drawing table and re-define its purpose of existence as with turkey in the eu very few would feel comfortable integrating any further .
this may sound attractive for us and the uk but not so attractive to those of us who have supported the eu in expanding and achieving the critical mass for bolstering it 's economic power .
i simply hope that our leaders find a way out of this dangerous territory without enraging turkey and the us . - pantelis koul , britain i think that neither turkey nor eu is ready for turkey 's membership to eu .
the europeans are unable to get over their historical prejudice against turks and turks are in a daydream that eu membership will make them rich overnight without having to go through hard work . - sedat akkurt even though our religions might differ , we aim for the same type of life style as you do .
at the end , we are as european as you are and have always been ...
turkey 's place must definitely be in the eu . - emre sungur , usa as an outsider looking in at the one part of the first world that pays attention to more than just economic expansion , i wish for europe that you find some middle path between inexorable globalization on the one hand and crude , vicious racism on the other .
right now , europe looks neither willing to truly assimilate demographically large numbers of muslims nor able to set a boundary and choose in a humane and moral way to remain europe .
please at least recognize that obedience to the commercial logic of globalization is propelling europe into cultural changes that few in europe really want and many resent deeply , but without intelligent voicing . - kevin rooney turkey is a country that has a dynamic and strong economy , even though is has some problems .
it will recover by 2015 with the eu 's help and then this economy will turn into a dynamo for the eu .
when its comes to society , turkish people are not only the ones you see in europe - those have left turkey at least 30 years ago . - mustafa aydogan , britain while turkey was fulfilling the requirements for admission to the eu , turkey showed it had clout and would use it to advance its own self-perceived interests as an independent sovereign nation .

right now , europe looks neither willing to truly assimilate demographically large numbers of muslims nor able to set a boundary and choose in a humane and moral way to remain europe .

but after a controversial campaign marred by openly anti-foreigner propaganda , voters said " no " to any change .
switzerland has one of the largest per capita foreign populations in europe - over 20 percent .
most were born and brought up in switzerland , but they can not vote , and they are barred from certain jobs , such as working as police .
the government proposed making citizenship automatic for third generation immigrants , and easier for the second generation .
but swiss voters said " no " on sunday to both proposals , in a move which green party parliamentarian cecile buhlmann said would send the wrong signal to many young people .
the campaign against the measures was characterized by controversial publicity from the right-wing swiss people ’ s party , which produced posters showing black and brown hands snatching at swiss passports and mock newspaper articles suggesting moslems would soon outnumber christians in switzerland .
but the party 's secretary general , aliki panayides , defended the campaign , saying candidates for naturalization must show they are truly integrated .
recently , however , swiss communities have shown they believe some people can never be integrated - candidates with balkan or african roots are often rejected , even if they fulfill all the legal requirements for naturalization .
after this vote , that system remains intact .
swiss citizenship will continue to be a long and complicated process , in which local communities have the final say . dw staff -lrb- wo -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de right-wing populist wins seat in swiss cabinet when the swiss parliament voted to build a new government cabinet on wednesday , it may well have ushered in an era of political change .

the hearings will determine whether the 24-member team will be accepted . tough but fair is how eu parliamentarians say they want to be , as they began grilling the first of 24 designated eu commissioners appointed by eu commission president-designate jose manuel barroso on monday . each of the members of the european union executive will face three hours of questioning by parliamentary committees on issues ranging from turkey 's membership bid , immigration , fiscal discipline and taxation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel durao barroso barroso won strong endorsement in july from the 732-member parliament , but his team still needs parliamentary approval to take office on november 1 for a five-year term .
the eu parliament can reject barroso 's entire team but not individual commissioners . most of the questioning over the next two weeks will focus on potential conflicts of interest in barroso 's team , which is considered more market friendly than the last one and includes some wealthy and influential members . all 24 commissioner-designates have to file statements of financial interests , declare their assets and fill out a questionnaire before they submit themselves to the grilling . a controversial candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes one of the most controversial members of barroso 's team to take the stand on tuesday is dutch politician and businesswoman neelie kroes , who is to succeed mario monti as the european union 's antitrust chief , arguably one of the eu 's most powerful offices . kroes , who is a member of the dutch free-market liberal party and has served two terms as minister for transport , public works and telecommunications during the 1980s , also has considerable links to big business .
she has sat on the boards of a dozen top european companies and is reported to be fabulously wealthy , owning a house in an upscale neighborhood of the hague as well as two office buildings . eu parliamentary members have already cast doubts on whether kroes can take on a job that so obviously clashes with her vested interests in the world of politics and business .
" neelie kroes was on the supervisory board of numerous companies which are directly or indirectly affected by the activities of the commission 's competition authority , " said pervenche beres , chairwoman of the parliamentary committee on economic and monetary affairs . " that 's why it 's a justified ethical issue to scrutinize her . " for her part , kroes has said she has already sold all stocks and options and resigned from company boards as well as pledged to distance herself from cases concerning firms she may have been involved in .
she also promised that if decisions are to be made by the eu antitrust authority which involve former employers , she will restrain from voting on it . but , it remains to be seen whether kroes will sufficiently convince all parliamentary members of her neutrality . conflict of interest not only sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione other incoming eu commissioners , who , like kroes , may be in for a rough ride during the interrogation include mariann fischer boel , nominee for the eu 's agriculture portfolio , and italian rocco buttiglione , assigned by barroso to be in charge of asylum and immigration policy . boel attracted the attention of eu parliamentarians because she owns land that includes a farm receiving eu subsidies and buttiglione has stirred controversy by his support for plans to set up asylum camps outside eu borders .
boel , however , has since been cleared after she sold her shares in danish sugar producer danisco . expertise of candidates also checked but it 's not just potential conflict of interest that the eu questioners are interested in .
other nagging conflict points include the political past of some commissioners from the new eastern european members as well as the expertise and experience of some incoming commissioners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen for instance , there is little doubt that german eu commissioner günter verheugen , who has been responsible for eastern european expansion so far , has gathered valuable experience when it comes to eu diplomacy and working methods .
but it remains questionable whether he has the necessary skills for his new portfolio of " industries and companies , " which verheugen has agreed to take on following pressure from the german government . the chairman of the parliamentary committee on industry , research and energy , giles chichester , has said verheugen will be examined thoroughly .
verheugen is expected to be grilled on his intentions and whether he will pursue a liberal market course as well as ideas for growth and innovation within the framework of the so-called lisbon agenda , which refers to a march 2000 eu summit when eu leaders and governments agreed to make the eu " the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy by 2010 .

the hearings will determine whether the 24-member team will be accepted . tough but fair is how eu parliamentarians say they want to be , as they began grilling the first of 24 designated eu commissioners appointed by eu commission president-designate jose manuel barroso on monday . each of the members of the european union executive will face three hours of questioning by parliamentary committees on issues ranging from turkey 's membership bid , immigration , fiscal discipline and taxation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel durao barroso barroso won strong endorsement in july from the 732-member parliament , but his team still needs parliamentary approval to take office on november 1 for a five-year term .
the eu parliament can reject barroso 's entire team but not individual commissioners . most of the questioning over the next two weeks will focus on potential conflicts of interest in barroso 's team , which is considered more market friendly than the last one and includes some wealthy and influential members . all 24 commissioner-designates have to file statements of financial interests , declare their assets and fill out a questionnaire before they submit themselves to the grilling . a controversial candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes one of the most controversial members of barroso 's team to take the stand on tuesday is dutch politician and businesswoman neelie kroes , who is to succeed mario monti as the european union 's antitrust chief , arguably one of the eu 's most powerful offices . kroes , who is a member of the dutch free-market liberal party and has served two terms as minister for transport , public works and telecommunications during the 1980s , also has considerable links to big business .
she has sat on the boards of a dozen top european companies and is reported to be fabulously wealthy , owning a house in an upscale neighborhood of the hague as well as two office buildings . eu parliamentary members have already cast doubts on whether kroes can take on a job that so obviously clashes with her vested interests in the world of politics and business .
" neelie kroes was on the supervisory board of numerous companies which are directly or indirectly affected by the activities of the commission 's competition authority , " said pervenche beres , chairwoman of the parliamentary committee on economic and monetary affairs . " that 's why it 's a justified ethical issue to scrutinize her . " for her part , kroes has said she has already sold all stocks and options and resigned from company boards as well as pledged to distance herself from cases concerning firms she may have been involved in .
she also promised that if decisions are to be made by the eu antitrust authority which involve former employers , she will restrain from voting on it . but , it remains to be seen whether kroes will sufficiently convince all parliamentary members of her neutrality . conflict of interest not only sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione other incoming eu commissioners , who , like kroes , may be in for a rough ride during the interrogation include mariann fischer boel , nominee for the eu 's agriculture portfolio , and italian rocco buttiglione , assigned by barroso to be in charge of asylum and immigration policy . boel attracted the attention of eu parliamentarians because she owns land that includes a farm receiving eu subsidies and buttiglione has stirred controversy by his support for plans to set up asylum camps outside eu borders .
boel , however , has since been cleared after she sold her shares in danish sugar producer danisco . expertise of candidates also checked but it 's not just potential conflict of interest that the eu questioners are interested in .
other nagging conflict points include the political past of some commissioners from the new eastern european members as well as the expertise and experience of some incoming commissioners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen for instance , there is little doubt that german eu commissioner günter verheugen , who has been responsible for eastern european expansion so far , has gathered valuable experience when it comes to eu diplomacy and working methods .
but it remains questionable whether he has the necessary skills for his new portfolio of " industries and companies , " which verheugen has agreed to take on following pressure from the german government . the chairman of the parliamentary committee on industry , research and energy , giles chichester , has said verheugen will be examined thoroughly .
verheugen is expected to be grilled on his intentions and whether he will pursue a liberal market course as well as ideas for growth and innovation within the framework of the so-called lisbon agenda , which refers to a march 2000 eu summit when eu leaders and governments agreed to make the eu " the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy by 2010 . " " i want to hear from mr verheugen , how he plans to enforce the lisbon agenda , which so far has only been talked of , but not implemented , " chichester said . the eu parliament is expected to vote on the new team by the end of october .

norway is expected to pump north sea oil for another 50 years and gas for a century . the country has also been cannily funneling 80 percent of its oil revenues into a petroleum fund that is invested overseas so the benefits can be used to finance its lavish social systems for generations to come . " the prospect of eu membership , particularly after the bloc 's eastward expansion , worries many norwegians that illegal workers might come into their country and pick off their generous welfare system and that their country might become poorer , " said uecker .
neighboring eu member sweden 's thumbs-down to joining the common euro currency in a referendum last year did n't help to bolster pro-eu feelings in norway either . can norway afford to stay out ? however , near-daily eu barometer polls published in the country 's media show that norwegians may be gradually reconciling themselves to the fact that remaining on the fringes of the european union may not be a viable option in the long run . norway - along with liechtenstein , iceland and switzerland - is a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- , which provides for free movement of goods , services , capital and labor between the union and european countries that have remained outside .
but , as norway is discovering , non-membership of the eu is still costing it money in other ways . from 2004 , norway -lrb- along with iceland , another non-eu nordic country -rrb- will pay five times their present membership fee of the efta .
in addition , norway will also channel existing bilateral aid for eastern europe through the eu , so its total transfer to the union will top nkr1.7 billion -lrb- € 203 million -rrb- a year , a tenfold rise . in addition to the money , experts say norway also has to adopt directives from brussels such as export duties on fish products as its own law .
" norway just ca n't afford to remain on the sidelines in the long run because though it has to implement decisions from brussels , it has no power to influence them , " said uecker .
" they will be in the union in ten years . " germans could represent oslo 's interests germany , in the meantime , could play a vital role in representing norway 's interests in the eu on account of its location , size and clout in the club , experts say .
" right since chancellor helmut kohl 's time , the germans have always been in favor of norway joining the eu , " said uecker . " developing a so-called " northern dimension , " which includes involving oil-rich russia in european cooperation , as a counterweight to the southern part of europe is also an idea that finds resonance both in norway and germany , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union dw-world 's special dossier on eu expansion and the run-up to the historic event .

dw-world readers comment on whether the country should join the union . i can only hope that turkey is never allowed into the eu .
it would be a disaster .
it would not only open the doors to more terrorists , it would bring racial and cultural differences to a boiling point across europe that would spell and end to eu .
a mass exodus of countries from the eu would soon ensue , thus all the hard work put towards bringing europe together would be for naught .
the very thought of turkey joining the eu is preposterous .
turkey is not a part of europe .
they share no cultural , political or social commonality with europe .
even without all of this the simple fact is that the people of europe do not want turkey to join .
this alone should be enough to prevent it from happening . - john young the most disturbing provision of the proposed laws in turkey is not the adultery issue .
it is a law which makes any criticism of the official government position on various issues -lrb- for example the armenian genocide and the occupation army in cyprus -rrb- punishable by law .
i am rather surprised at the lack of attention to such an infringement of the freedom of speech .
i thought turkey was a democracy and the eu defended and insisted on freedom of speech .
i was mistaken , as neither -lrb- turkish premier -rrb- erdogan nor the eu commissioner find this frightening law problematic . - m.g. ikossi a turkey operating within the european political parameters would be a great step towards reconciling west with the islamic world but it would signal the end to efforts to create a european state that could defend and promote our interests on the international arena .
the eu would then need to go back to the drawing table and re-define its purpose of existence as with turkey in the eu very few would feel comfortable integrating any further .
this may sound attractive for us and the uk but not so attractive to those of us who have supported the eu in expanding and achieving the critical mass for bolstering it 's economic power .
i simply hope that our leaders find a way out of this dangerous territory without enraging turkey and the us . - pantelis koul , britain i think that neither turkey nor eu is ready for turkey 's membership to eu .
the europeans are unable to get over their historical prejudice against turks and turks are in a daydream that eu membership will make them rich overnight without having to go through hard work . - sedat akkurt even though our religions might differ , we aim for the same type of life style as you do .
at the end , we are as european as you are and have always been ...
turkey 's place must definitely be in the eu . - emre sungur , usa as an outsider looking in at the one part of the first world that pays attention to more than just economic expansion , i wish for europe that you find some middle path between inexorable globalization on the one hand and crude , vicious racism on the other .
right now , europe looks neither willing to truly assimilate demographically large numbers of muslims nor able to set a boundary and choose in a humane and moral way to remain europe .
please at least recognize that obedience to the commercial logic of globalization is propelling europe into cultural changes that few in europe really want and many resent deeply , but without intelligent voicing . - kevin rooney turkey is a country that has a dynamic and strong economy , even though is has some problems .
it will recover by 2015 with the eu 's help and then this economy will turn into a dynamo for the eu .
when its comes to society , turkish people are not only the ones you see in europe - those have left turkey at least 30 years ago . - mustafa aydogan , britain while turkey was fulfilling the requirements for admission to the eu , turkey showed it had clout and would use it to advance its own self-perceived interests as an independent sovereign nation .
turkey 's conduct continually confirms it is not a compliant tool of the west .
turkey is unique in many ways beyond its geographic location .
turkey is a muslim but democratic nation .
turkey has a strong , well-equipped , and modern military that is very capable of defending the causes and advancing the interests to which it is committed .
but , since the eu has an urgent and existing necessity to defend against the ubiquitous threat of terrorism and turkey has proven itself worthy of membership to this organization , the eu needs to accept turkey as a eu member without any further delay . - donald slazinski send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey adopts key eu reforms turkey 's parliament on sunday passed a crucial package of reforms aimed at boosting the country 's chances for starting membership talks with the european union .

please at least recognize that obedience to the commercial logic of globalization is propelling europe into cultural changes that few in europe really want and many resent deeply , but without intelligent voicing . - kevin rooney turkey is a country that has a dynamic and strong economy , even though is has some problems .
it will recover by 2015 with the eu 's help and then this economy will turn into a dynamo for the eu .
when its comes to society , turkish people are not only the ones you see in europe - those have left turkey at least 30 years ago . - mustafa aydogan , britain while turkey was fulfilling the requirements for admission to the eu , turkey showed it had clout and would use it to advance its own self-perceived interests as an independent sovereign nation .
turkey 's conduct continually confirms it is not a compliant tool of the west .
turkey is unique in many ways beyond its geographic location .
turkey is a muslim but democratic nation .
turkey has a strong , well-equipped , and modern military that is very capable of defending the causes and advancing the interests to which it is committed .
but , since the eu has an urgent and existing necessity to defend against the ubiquitous threat of terrorism and turkey has proven itself worthy of membership to this organization , the eu needs to accept turkey as a eu member without any further delay . - donald slazinski send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey adopts key eu reforms turkey 's parliament on sunday passed a crucial package of reforms aimed at boosting the country 's chances for starting membership talks with the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 28.09.2004 eu member turkey ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's tayyip erdogan and the eu 's günter verheugen after passing a set of law reforms , turkey has moved one step closer to eu admission talks .
dw-world readers comment on whether the country should join the union . i can only hope that turkey is never allowed into the eu .
it would be a disaster .
it would not only open the doors to more terrorists , it would bring racial and cultural differences to a boiling point across europe that would spell and end to eu .
a mass exodus of countries from the eu would soon ensue , thus all the hard work put towards bringing europe together would be for naught .
the very thought of turkey joining the eu is preposterous .
turkey is not a part of europe .
they share no cultural , political or social commonality with europe .
even without all of this the simple fact is that the people of europe do not want turkey to join .
this alone should be enough to prevent it from happening . - john young the most disturbing provision of the proposed laws in turkey is not the adultery issue .
it is a law which makes any criticism of the official government position on various issues -lrb- for example the armenian genocide and the occupation army in cyprus -rrb- punishable by law .
i am rather surprised at the lack of attention to such an infringement of the freedom of speech .
i thought turkey was a democracy and the eu defended and insisted on freedom of speech .
i was mistaken , as neither -lrb- turkish premier -rrb- erdogan nor the eu commissioner find this frightening law problematic . - m.g. ikossi a turkey operating within the european political parameters would be a great step towards reconciling west with the islamic world but it would signal the end to efforts to create a european state that could defend and promote our interests on the international arena .

dw-world readers comment on whether the country should join the union . i can only hope that turkey is never allowed into the eu .

dw-world readers comment on whether the country should join the union . i can only hope that turkey is never allowed into the eu .
it would be a disaster .
it would not only open the doors to more terrorists , it would bring racial and cultural differences to a boiling point across europe that would spell and end to eu .
a mass exodus of countries from the eu would soon ensue , thus all the hard work put towards bringing europe together would be for naught .
the very thought of turkey joining the eu is preposterous .
turkey is not a part of europe .
they share no cultural , political or social commonality with europe .
even without all of this the simple fact is that the people of europe do not want turkey to join .
this alone should be enough to prevent it from happening . - john young the most disturbing provision of the proposed laws in turkey is not the adultery issue .
it is a law which makes any criticism of the official government position on various issues -lrb- for example the armenian genocide and the occupation army in cyprus -rrb- punishable by law .
i am rather surprised at the lack of attention to such an infringement of the freedom of speech .
i thought turkey was a democracy and the eu defended and insisted on freedom of speech .
i was mistaken , as neither -lrb- turkish premier -rrb- erdogan nor the eu commissioner find this frightening law problematic . - m.g. ikossi a turkey operating within the european political parameters would be a great step towards reconciling west with the islamic world but it would signal the end to efforts to create a european state that could defend and promote our interests on the international arena .

maybe you 'll like cher as well bought the latest coldplay album and wonder what else you might like ?
four german companies are competing to offer the best online music-recommendation software .
in the mix : the inventor of the mp3 . some time in the near future , karlheinz brandenburg would like to have a conversation with his stereo .
he 'd like to tell it to play the kind of music he likes to typically hear at that time of day and what music direction it could consider .
" that ’ s a vision i ’ ve had for four or five years , " he said .
for the inventor of mp3 technology -lrb- photo -rrb- , the preferences would lean towards bach and beethoven .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlheinz brandenburg , one of the inventors of the mp3 but new software brandenburg and his colleague markus cremer have developed at germany ’ s renowned semi-public think tank , the fraunhofer institute , will enable his stereo to guide him to a 19th century string quartet he ’ s never heard of - or maybe even some björk .
in the cut-throat world of music downloading sites , the survivors will be those that offer the best service , said brandenburg .

" the task of a piece of software to help you on one hand to make it easier to find things , on the other hand to find the unexpected , " said brandenburg in an interview with dw-world .
" to find things you like even if they weren ’ t in the same catalogue or next to each other . "
at present , four german companies are competing for the chance to help consumers match music to their tastes .
brandenburg and cremer think the answer lies in computer software that analyses the music itself .
their program , called soundslike , measures song ingredients such as rhythm , melody and instrumentalization , then recommends songs that have similar patterns .

“ i wouldn ’ t rule out that there are some kinks to work out , ” said brandenburg , chuckling .
brandenburg knows all about working out the kinks .
after all , years passed between the first time brandenburg compressed a digital music file of susanne vega ’ s “ uncle tom ’ s diner , ” in the mid-1980s , to the point in the mid-1990s when his mp3 technology began to take off .
he thinks soundslike technology could be ready for a company to implement in a few months .
the human touch but his competitors say the program has fundamental flaws .
it 's not the music that should be measured , but rather the consumer 's taste .
“ it ’ s not possible for a machine to differentiate between a piece of grunge music or heavy metal from the 1980s , because it looks very similar acoustically , ” daniel müllensiefen , project manager at musicline.de told dw-world .
his system , soundprofiler , features a database compiled through a mix of human suggestions and software .

they can then decide which of them - or one of two others designed by hamburg-based hifind and software developer ddd systems - works the best .

along with the internet voting , a jury of music and technology journalists will help decide who gets the contract. itunes cool to the idea but whether big names like apple or microsoft will bite is still unclear .
alex luke , director of music programming and label relations at itunes , said that apple continues to recommend songs based on what buyers have bought and what they suggest .
“ how users buy and build their collections is valuable , but it 's only one of the ways we recommend music on itunes , ” he wrote in an e-mail .

four german companies are competing to offer the best online music-recommendation software .
in the mix : the inventor of the mp3 . some time in the near future , karlheinz brandenburg would like to have a conversation with his stereo .
he 'd like to tell it to play the kind of music he likes to typically hear at that time of day and what music direction it could consider .
" that ’ s a vision i ’ ve had for four or five years , " he said .
for the inventor of mp3 technology -lrb- photo -rrb- , the preferences would lean towards bach and beethoven .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlheinz brandenburg , one of the inventors of the mp3 but new software brandenburg and his colleague markus cremer have developed at germany ’ s renowned semi-public think tank , the fraunhofer institute , will enable his stereo to guide him to a 19th century string quartet he ’ s never heard of - or maybe even some björk .
in the cut-throat world of music downloading sites , the survivors will be those that offer the best service , said brandenburg .

you 'll love cher !
" the task of a piece of software to help you on one hand to make it easier to find things , on the other hand to find the unexpected , " said brandenburg in an interview with dw-world .
" to find things you like even if they weren ’ t in the same catalogue or next to each other . "
at present , four german companies are competing for the chance to help consumers match music to their tastes .

“ i wouldn ’ t rule out that there are some kinks to work out , ” said brandenburg , chuckling .
brandenburg knows all about working out the kinks .
after all , years passed between the first time brandenburg compressed a digital music file of susanne vega ’ s “ uncle tom ’ s diner , ” in the mid-1980s , to the point in the mid-1990s when his mp3 technology began to take off .
he thinks soundslike technology could be ready for a company to implement in a few months .
the human touch but his competitors say the program has fundamental flaws .
it 's not the music that should be measured , but rather the consumer 's taste .
“ it ’ s not possible for a machine to differentiate between a piece of grunge music or heavy metal from the 1980s , because it looks very similar acoustically , ” daniel müllensiefen , project manager at musicline.de told dw-world .
his system , soundprofiler , features a database compiled through a mix of human suggestions and software .

alex luke , director of music programming and label relations at itunes , said that apple continues to recommend songs based on what buyers have bought and what they suggest .
“ how users buy and build their collections is valuable , but it 's only one of the ways we recommend music on itunes , ” he wrote in an e-mail .
but buyer statistics and suggestions don ’ t go far enough , argues brandenburg .

poland twice declared itself willing to drop all of its demands for reparations from the germans , in 1954 and in 1970.both mr schröder and mr belka , appeared determined to calm the discussion in order to preserve good relations between the two neighbours .
the leader of poland ’ s conservative law and justice party , jaroslaw kaczynski , has made the issue of reparation payments a priority should his party be voted into power during the upcoming elections in october.the polish rzeczpospolita newspaper published a poll last week saying 64 percent of poles are in favour of seeking compensation from germany for damages during world war ii . -lrb- euobserver.com -rrb- dw-world.de poland , germany vow to squash reparations claims german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister marek belka appealed to the common sense of those germans and poles currently trying to revive a debate about world war ii reparation claims . -lrb- september 27 , 2004 -rrb- www-links eu observer the latest eu-related news more briefs 28.09.2004 -pipe- eu imposes sanctions on belarus 28.09.2004 -pipe- emissions trading breaks new records 28.09.2004 -pipe- investment bank slams euro rules 27.09.2004 -pipe- italy pushes for eu seat at un 27.09.2004 -pipe- no agreement on list of ' safe countries ' 27.09.2004 -pipe- french call for referendum on turkey 24.09.2004 -pipe- romania gets ambitious over eu entry 24.09.2004 -pipe- prodi : ' no ' to constitution would be ' tragedy ' radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

one bishop said it was like unleashing a virus .
other european countries already allow some form of gay unions . when spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero took office in april he promised to remove the catholic church 's influence on spanish society by easing divorce rules , softening abortion laws and legalizing gay marriage .
it was the last measure that has raised the most resentment with the church .
the legislation would be like " imposing a virus on society , something false that will have negative consequences for social life , " juan antonio martinez camino , spokesman for the spanish bishops conference , told spain 's national television .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church said allowing homosexuals to marry would be like unleashing a virus on society if the bill passes the cabinet , it will also need to be approved by spain 's parliament before becoming law .
the country 's previous , conservative government rebuffed several calls to legalize gay marriage during its administration .
some nations allow gay marriage although surveys show nearly half of spain 's population no longer goes to mass , enactment would still mean a social change in the largely catholic country , and bring it into the ranks of the mostly northern european countries that permit gay marriage or another legally recognized form of gay union .
in germany , gay couples have been able to register their relationships since 2001 .
over the summer , gay marriage became a nationally debated issue when the leader of the business-friendly free democratic party , guido westerwelle , acknowledged his homosexuality in july and called for more equality for gay couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- and his partner michael mronz homosexual partners should have the right to adopt any child , not only the legal child of a partner , and receive the same tax status as married couples , westerwelle said at the time .
a bill extending homosexuals ' rights , including the legalization of gay marriage , drafted in june by germany 's ruling social democratic-green party coalition government received sharp criticism from the conservative opposition , and the nation 's parliament has not yet taken action on the measure . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de being turkish and gay in germany germany may be considered a tolerant place for homosexuals .

experts say the new high was pushed by political instability in nigeria . crude oil futures remained above $ 50 dollars a barrel in asian trade on tuesday after breaking through the key psychological barrier as concerns over supply continued to dominate the market , dealers said .

nigerian rebels have warned oil companies to shut down production in the niger delta , or face " all-out war " starting on oct.1.
they said anyone assisting the state would be considered an enemy . the rebels are seeking to force political reforms and independence for the oil-rich , yet impoverished niger delta .
kurt barrow , a singapore-based principal at us energy consultancy purvin and gertz , said the high oil prices could also be blamed on tight supply amid strong demand from the united states , china and india which had caught the market by surprise . he said surplus production has fallen to only one million barrels of oil a day from three to five million over the past few years . threats of disruption to these already tight supplies are conspiring to keep the volatile situation boiling .

" germany 's economics minister wolfgang clement described the high price of oil as a danger for the global economy . " they definitely pose a risk , " clement said late monday in berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.09.2004 new eu commission faces intense grilling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incoming eu commissioners are under the magnifying glass the eu parliament has begun questioning incoming eu commissioners , largely to sniff out potential conflicts of interests of a few wealthy members .
the hearings will determine whether the 24-member team will be accepted . tough but fair is how eu parliamentarians say they want to be , as they began grilling the first of 24 designated eu commissioners appointed by eu commission president-designate jose manuel barroso on monday . each of the members of the european union executive will face three hours of questioning by parliamentary committees on issues ranging from turkey 's membership bid , immigration , fiscal discipline and taxation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel durao barroso barroso won strong endorsement in july from the 732-member parliament , but his team still needs parliamentary approval to take office on november 1 for a five-year term .
the eu parliament can reject barroso 's entire team but not individual commissioners . most of the questioning over the next two weeks will focus on potential conflicts of interest in barroso 's team , which is considered more market friendly than the last one and includes some wealthy and influential members . all 24 commissioner-designates have to file statements of financial interests , declare their assets and fill out a questionnaire before they submit themselves to the grilling . a controversial candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes one of the most controversial members of barroso 's team to take the stand on tuesday is dutch politician and businesswoman neelie kroes , who is to succeed mario monti as the european union 's antitrust chief , arguably one of the eu 's most powerful offices . kroes , who is a member of the dutch free-market liberal party and has served two terms as minister for transport , public works and telecommunications during the 1980s , also has considerable links to big business .

" for her part , kroes has said she has already sold all stocks and options and resigned from company boards as well as pledged to distance herself from cases concerning firms she may have been involved in .
she also promised that if decisions are to be made by the eu antitrust authority which involve former employers , she will restrain from voting on it . but , it remains to be seen whether kroes will sufficiently convince all parliamentary members of her neutrality . conflict of interest not only sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione other incoming eu commissioners , who , like kroes , may be in for a rough ride during the interrogation include mariann fischer boel , nominee for the eu 's agriculture portfolio , and italian rocco buttiglione , assigned by barroso to be in charge of asylum and immigration policy . boel attracted the attention of eu parliamentarians because she owns land that includes a farm receiving eu subsidies and buttiglione has stirred controversy by his support for plans to set up asylum camps outside eu borders .
boel , however , has since been cleared after she sold her shares in danish sugar producer danisco . expertise of candidates also checked but it 's not just potential conflict of interest that the eu questioners are interested in .
other nagging conflict points include the political past of some commissioners from the new eastern european members as well as the expertise and experience of some incoming commissioners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen for instance , there is little doubt that german eu commissioner günter verheugen , who has been responsible for eastern european expansion so far , has gathered valuable experience when it comes to eu diplomacy and working methods .
but it remains questionable whether he has the necessary skills for his new portfolio of " industries and companies , " which verheugen has agreed to take on following pressure from the german government . the chairman of the parliamentary committee on industry , research and energy , giles chichester , has said verheugen will be examined thoroughly .
verheugen is expected to be grilled on his intentions and whether he will pursue a liberal market course as well as ideas for growth and innovation within the framework of the so-called lisbon agenda , which refers to a march 2000 eu summit when eu leaders and governments agreed to make the eu " the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy by 2010 . " " i want to hear from mr verheugen , how he plans to enforce the lisbon agenda , which so far has only been talked of , but not implemented , " chichester said . the eu parliament is expected to vote on the new team by the end of october .

but after a controversial campaign marred by openly anti-foreigner propaganda , voters said " no " to any change .
switzerland has one of the largest per capita foreign populations in europe - over 20 percent .
most were born and brought up in switzerland , but they can not vote , and they are barred from certain jobs , such as working as police .
the government proposed making citizenship automatic for third generation immigrants , and easier for the second generation .
but swiss voters said " no " on sunday to both proposals , in a move which green party parliamentarian cecile buhlmann said would send the wrong signal to many young people .
the campaign against the measures was characterized by controversial publicity from the right-wing swiss people ’ s party , which produced posters showing black and brown hands snatching at swiss passports and mock newspaper articles suggesting moslems would soon outnumber christians in switzerland .
but the party 's secretary general , aliki panayides , defended the campaign , saying candidates for naturalization must show they are truly integrated .
recently , however , swiss communities have shown they believe some people can never be integrated - candidates with balkan or african roots are often rejected , even if they fulfill all the legal requirements for naturalization .
after this vote , that system remains intact .
swiss citizenship will continue to be a long and complicated process , in which local communities have the final say . dw staff -lrb- wo -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de right-wing populist wins seat in swiss cabinet when the swiss parliament voted to build a new government cabinet on wednesday , it may well have ushered in an era of political change .

the digital station is currently free to air on the hotbird 6 satellite system in germany and hopes to broadcast to other countries in europe and the middle east and eventually iran itself .
the spokesman said the station , in which a 50 percent stake is held by iranian businessman hassan arpanahi , would like initially to reach the estimated 6,000 people from the islamic republic living in europe .
" we have pro-western , family-oriented programming and we should retain that , " the spokesman said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.09.2004 -pipe- 12:00 utc us court rejects suit against deutsche bank a us court has thrown out a suit by former german media mogul leo kirch against us cable operator liberty media and german bank deutsche bank for allegedly conspiring to bring about the downfall of kirch 's media empire in 2002 , deutsche bank said on tuesday .
kirch had filed a 39-page complaint with a court in new york in january , accusing deutsche bank and liberty media and their chairmen of plotting the destruction of the kirch group in a bid to rid liberty media of an unwelcome rival in the german cable television market and secure fat commissions for deutsche bank .
the court found that kirch had failed to prove his case and " dimissed -lrb- the suit -rrb- for failure to state a claim , " according to a copy of the ruling made available by deutsche bank on tuesday .
the new york lawsuit was part of a long and bitter legal battle between kirch and deutsche bank since the kirch media empire collapsed in april 2002 .
the conflict dates back to comments by deutsche bank 's then chairman breuer made on television in 2002 , in which he publicly questioned the creditworthiness of the kirch group .
soon afterwards , banks refused to lend kirch any more money and kirchmedia , the main pillar of the kirch group , filed for insolvency in april 2002 .
in december , a munich court ruled in kirch 's favour , finding that breuer had violated his duty of client confidentiality .
the munich court ordered deutsche bank to pay unspecified compensation to kirch .

kirch had filed a 39-page complaint with a court in new york in january , accusing deutsche bank and liberty media and their chairmen of plotting the destruction of the kirch group in a bid to rid liberty media of an unwelcome rival in the german cable television market and secure fat commissions for deutsche bank .
the court found that kirch had failed to prove his case and " dimissed -lrb- the suit -rrb- for failure to state a claim , " according to a copy of the ruling made available by deutsche bank on tuesday .
the new york lawsuit was part of a long and bitter legal battle between kirch and deutsche bank since the kirch media empire collapsed in april 2002 .
the conflict dates back to comments by deutsche bank 's then chairman breuer made on television in 2002 , in which he publicly questioned the creditworthiness of the kirch group .
soon afterwards , banks refused to lend kirch any more money and kirchmedia , the main pillar of the kirch group , filed for insolvency in april 2002 .
in december , a munich court ruled in kirch 's favour , finding that breuer had violated his duty of client confidentiality .
the munich court ordered deutsche bank to pay unspecified compensation to kirch .

kirch had filed a 39-page complaint with a court in new york in january , accusing deutsche bank and liberty media and their chairmen of plotting the destruction of the kirch group in a bid to rid liberty media of an unwelcome rival in the german cable television market and secure fat commissions for deutsche bank .
the court found that kirch had failed to prove his case and " dimissed -lrb- the suit -rrb- for failure to state a claim , " according to a copy of the ruling made available by deutsche bank on tuesday .
the new york lawsuit was part of a long and bitter legal battle between kirch and deutsche bank since the kirch media empire collapsed in april 2002 .
the conflict dates back to comments by deutsche bank 's then chairman breuer made on television in 2002 , in which he publicly questioned the creditworthiness of the kirch group .
soon afterwards , banks refused to lend kirch any more money and kirchmedia , the main pillar of the kirch group , filed for insolvency in april 2002 .
in december , a munich court ruled in kirch 's favour , finding that breuer had violated his duty of client confidentiality .
the munich court ordered deutsche bank to pay unspecified compensation to kirch .
-lrb- afp -rrb- dw-world.de court rules deutsche bank must pay kirch an appeals court in munich ruled on wednesday that banking giant deutsche bank must pay damages to fallen media mogul leo kirch that could reach € 100 million -lrb- $ 122 million -rrb- .

surveyors have been pegging out land in the first stage of building three wind turbines at forest moor near bradworthy in north devon .
the nearest turbine , 75m -lrb- 246ft -rrb- tall to the tip of its blades , will be 530m from mrs hutchings ' front door .
former cattle and sheep breeder mrs hutchings , 75 , is now considering quitting the home she bought 18 years ago for its " marvellous " views .
mrs hutchings points to the view from her front door - a typical devon landscape of rolling hills , hedges , and cows grazing in the fields .
photomontage of the three bradworthy turbines enlarge image she said : " there is no way i am going to be able to miss the turbines , apart from growing a 20ft high hedge .
" i have been hoping against hope that it will not happen .
" it was probably a silly thought , but i thought something might happen to stop them . "
mrs hutchings moved with her husband joe to the 20-acre smallholding 18 years ago .
she has bred pedigree sheep and cattle , and since joe died five years ago she has moved into spaniel breeding .
" this place was a wreck when we bought it , " she said .
" but when i saw the view over bodmin and dartmoor i thought it was marvellous .
" we bought this place because of its peace and quiet , but i may be forced to move because of the noise . "
appeal won she added : " the only consolation is that everyone in devon will see them and there will be even more pressure against them . "
it is better than having nuclear power stations brian mayhead have your say on devon windfarms some locals are more conciliatory towards the windfarm .
nearby farmer brain mayhead , said : " it is better than having nuclear power stations although i think that turbines would be better out at sea . "
pressure against wind turbines in devon has been considerable and has prevented any until now .
while neighbouring cornwall has seven windfarms , bradworthy will be the first in devon .
both bradworthy and the only other turbines with planning permission - at higher darracott near torrington - went through on appeal after being rejected by torridge district council .
twenty-two turbines are also being proposed at fullabrook down , south east of ilfracombe .
however , that application has gone directly to the department for trade and industry , which will consult north devon district council , because its output exceeds 50 megawatts .
the move towards windfarms has been fuelled by the government 's target of providing 10 % of energy from renewable sources by 2010 .
if the fullabrook down scheme goes ahead , the 22 turbines , each of 3mw capacity , would produce almost 60 % of devon 's recommended onshore wind energy capacity target of 103mw by 2010 .
guy wilson , director of energie kontor uk , the firm behind the bradworthy scheme , predicted more turbines in devon amid government enthusiasm and targets for renewable energy .
local authority planners were told by the government in october last year to include the environmental benefits of windfarms in assessing applications .
mr wilson said : " the government is keen and all the incentives for windfarm developers are there , including easing planning permissions .
" there are a lot of good sites in devon which has been regarded as a difficult area in the past .
" a number of projects failed because planning policies did not support wind energy so it was always easy to reject projects . "

by gordon corera bbc security correspondent what has happened to osama bin laden ?
is he dead ?
on the run ?
or readying for new attacks on the us ?
mystery surrounds the fate and whereabouts of osama bin laden these are questions that have been asked almost constantly for the past three years , but have a particular resonance now .
on the two previous anniversaries of the 11 september attacks , bin laden made some kind of appearance .
in 2003 , it was video footage of him walking in the mountains , although it was unclear when it was filmed .
in 2002 , his voice was heard on a video praising those who had carried out the attacks on new york and washington .
but so far this september , we have yet to hear from him .
jihadist insurgency the last statement which is believed to have come from bin laden himself was the audio message of 15 april .
in it , he gave europe three months to consider an offer of a truce if it committed to not attacking muslims or interfering in their affairs .
there have been no major attacks in europe since the end of that deadline .
bin laden is a cult figure in many parts of the world profile : osama bin laden a video did appear from ayman al-zawahri , al-qaeda 's deputy leader , on 9 september which was designed to boost the morale of jihadis by playing up america 's problems in iraq and afghanistan .
of course , bin laden 's non-appearance can not be read in itself as a sign that he has died or is no longer hard at work - he could well be biding his time waiting to appear to gloat after a major attack on the us , an attack that american officials say could come in the next few months around election time .
however , his non-appearance still raises important questions about what exactly his role is in al-qaeda and the broader global jihadist insurgency .
pulling the strings ?
since 2001 , there has been a tendency from both the media and some politicians to personalise the conflict , setting up osama bin laden as an all-powerful puppet master , pulling the strings of a global network that reports to him , and is responsible for every attack .
before september 2001 , there was some evidence to back up that view .
in the case of the 11 september plot itself , the recently released us independent report makes clear that bin laden was involved in the plot to a greater level than thought before , actually making changes to details of the plans and intervening over when the attacks should take place .
iraq has become the new battleground for anti-us militants but things have changed over the past few years .
the us has been saying that three-quarters of al-qaeda 's known leadership has been captured or killed .
the core of its leadership is undoubtedly under pressure and having to take extreme care over movements and communications , limiting its ability to direct plans - video messages can provide many clues on location which may be one reason they do not appear so often .
but the problem is that bin laden 's jihadist ideology has spread like a virus around the world .
mystique of invincibility many of the attacks , like those in madrid and jakarta this year , almost certainly were not centrally directed by al-qaeda but launched by groups and individuals who follow bin laden 's ideological agenda .
bin laden is unlikely to have directed the madrid train attacks in some cases , individuals and networks have been inspired by bin laden but may never have trained at his camps in afghanistan .
in other cases , existing regional groups have adopted al-qaeda 's narrative of needing to target the " far enemy " of the us and western interests rather than just the local state which they have always been fighting .
new leaders are emerging on the local level , sometimes with limited links to bin laden , who can build their own networks and stage their own attacks .
the best example of this is abu musab al-zarqawi in iraq who has never been formally part of al-qaeda itself , and has built his own parallel network .
there has , of course , been speculation that there will be particularly strenuous efforts to find bin laden in the run-up to the us presidential election in november .
personification of the threat on one level , this would be a huge morale boost for the us and a blow to al-qaeda 's supporters , undermining bin laden 's mystique as some invincible leader .
the us assault on afghanistan has forced al-qaeda into hiding but some analysts believe bin laden 's departure from the scene would have only a limited impact on the overall level of violence .
" in reality it 's going to make no difference whatsoever , because his ideology has now infected individuals and groups right across the globe , " says mj gohel of the asia-pacific foundation .
" from the very beginning , there has been a mistake in understanding the terrorist threat we face .
we 're not dealing here with a single organisation , a single command and control structure .
we 're dealing with an ideology and an ideology is very difficult to defeat . "
getting rid of bin laden might simply reveal the complex reality of local conflicts , with their roots in specific ethnic , regional issues , and the ideology will live on after its propagator has passed from the scene .
with the personification of the threat gone , it may also make it harder for american politicians to generate the kind of domestic support needed to continue the fight .
' strategic guidance ' others disagree , arguing that even though he is unlikely to have been involved in planning and executing most of the attacks since 11 september , 2001 , bin laden still plays a central role in communicating broad strategic objectives which others will then carry out in their own time and manner .
" there 's a conventional wisdom that it does n't matter if osama bin laden is captured or killed , which i think is erroneous , " argues peter bergen - one of the few western journalists to have interviewed the al-qaeda leader .
" both osama bin laden and ayman al-zawahri continue to influence the broader al-qaeda movement , giving them broad strategic guidance via the medium of these audio tapes .
" for instance bin laden called for attacks on members of the coalition in iraq , there were then attacks on italian police barracks in southern iraq ; there were attacks on the british bank and consulate in turkey , there was the attack in madrid . "
capturing or killing bin laden remains a key goal for the united states .
doing so would undoubtedly be a major morale booster and would also have some impact on the direction of the struggle - but it almost certainly would not end it .

by gordon corera bbc security correspondent what has happened to osama bin laden ?
is he dead ?
on the run ?
or readying for new attacks on the us ?
mystery surrounds the fate and whereabouts of osama bin laden these are questions that have been asked almost constantly for the past three years , but have a particular resonance now .
on the two previous anniversaries of the 11 september attacks , bin laden made some kind of appearance .
in 2003 , it was video footage of him walking in the mountains , although it was unclear when it was filmed .
in 2002 , his voice was heard on a video praising those who had carried out the attacks on new york and washington .
but so far this september , we have yet to hear from him .
jihadist insurgency the last statement which is believed to have come from bin laden himself was the audio message of 15 april .
in it , he gave europe three months to consider an offer of a truce if it committed to not attacking muslims or interfering in their affairs .
there have been no major attacks in europe since the end of that deadline .
bin laden is a cult figure in many parts of the world profile : osama bin laden a video did appear from ayman al-zawahri , al-qaeda 's deputy leader , on 9 september which was designed to boost the morale of jihadis by playing up america 's problems in iraq and afghanistan .
of course , bin laden 's non-appearance can not be read in itself as a sign that he has died or is no longer hard at work - he could well be biding his time waiting to appear to gloat after a major attack on the us , an attack that american officials say could come in the next few months around election time .
however , his non-appearance still raises important questions about what exactly his role is in al-qaeda and the broader global jihadist insurgency .
pulling the strings ?
since 2001 , there has been a tendency from both the media and some politicians to personalise the conflict , setting up osama bin laden as an all-powerful puppet master , pulling the strings of a global network that reports to him , and is responsible for every attack .
before september 2001 , there was some evidence to back up that view .
in the case of the 11 september plot itself , the recently released us independent report makes clear that bin laden was involved in the plot to a greater level than thought before , actually making changes to details of the plans and intervening over when the attacks should take place .
iraq has become the new battleground for anti-us militants but things have changed over the past few years .
the us has been saying that three-quarters of al-qaeda 's known leadership has been captured or killed .
the core of its leadership is undoubtedly under pressure and having to take extreme care over movements and communications , limiting its ability to direct plans - video messages can provide many clues on location which may be one reason they do not appear so often .
but the problem is that bin laden 's jihadist ideology has spread like a virus around the world .
mystique of invincibility many of the attacks , like those in madrid and jakarta this year , almost certainly were not centrally directed by al-qaeda but launched by groups and individuals who follow bin laden 's ideological agenda .
bin laden is unlikely to have directed the madrid train attacks in some cases , individuals and networks have been inspired by bin laden but may never have trained at his camps in afghanistan .
in other cases , existing regional groups have adopted al-qaeda 's narrative of needing to target the " far enemy " of the us and western interests rather than just the local state which they have always been fighting .
new leaders are emerging on the local level , sometimes with limited links to bin laden , who can build their own networks and stage their own attacks .
the best example of this is abu musab al-zarqawi in iraq who has never been formally part of al-qaeda itself , and has built his own parallel network .
there has , of course , been speculation that there will be particularly strenuous efforts to find bin laden in the run-up to the us presidential election in november .
personification of the threat on one level , this would be a huge morale boost for the us and a blow to al-qaeda 's supporters , undermining bin laden 's mystique as some invincible leader .
the us assault on afghanistan has forced al-qaeda into hiding but some analysts believe bin laden 's departure from the scene would have only a limited impact on the overall level of violence .
" in reality it 's going to make no difference whatsoever , because his ideology has now infected individuals and groups right across the globe , " says mj gohel of the asia-pacific foundation .
" from the very beginning , there has been a mistake in understanding the terrorist threat we face .
we 're not dealing here with a single organisation , a single command and control structure .
we 're dealing with an ideology and an ideology is very difficult to defeat . "
getting rid of bin laden might simply reveal the complex reality of local conflicts , with their roots in specific ethnic , regional issues , and the ideology will live on after its propagator has passed from the scene .
with the personification of the threat gone , it may also make it harder for american politicians to generate the kind of domestic support needed to continue the fight .
' strategic guidance ' others disagree , arguing that even though he is unlikely to have been involved in planning and executing most of the attacks since 11 september , 2001 , bin laden still plays a central role in communicating broad strategic objectives which others will then carry out in their own time and manner .
" there 's a conventional wisdom that it does n't matter if osama bin laden is captured or killed , which i think is erroneous , " argues peter bergen - one of the few western journalists to have interviewed the al-qaeda leader .
" both osama bin laden and ayman al-zawahri continue to influence the broader al-qaeda movement , giving them broad strategic guidance via the medium of these audio tapes .
" for instance bin laden called for attacks on members of the coalition in iraq , there were then attacks on italian police barracks in southern iraq ; there were attacks on the british bank and consulate in turkey , there was the attack in madrid . "
capturing or killing bin laden remains a key goal for the united states .
doing so would undoubtedly be a major morale booster and would also have some impact on the direction of the struggle - but it almost certainly would not end it .

bin laden is unlikely to have directed the madrid train attacks in some cases , individuals and networks have been inspired by bin laden but may never have trained at his camps in afghanistan .
in other cases , existing regional groups have adopted al-qaeda 's narrative of needing to target the " far enemy " of the us and western interests rather than just the local state which they have always been fighting .
new leaders are emerging on the local level , sometimes with limited links to bin laden , who can build their own networks and stage their own attacks .
the best example of this is abu musab al-zarqawi in iraq who has never been formally part of al-qaeda itself , and has built his own parallel network .
there has , of course , been speculation that there will be particularly strenuous efforts to find bin laden in the run-up to the us presidential election in november .
personification of the threat on one level , this would be a huge morale boost for the us and a blow to al-qaeda 's supporters , undermining bin laden 's mystique as some invincible leader .
the us assault on afghanistan has forced al-qaeda into hiding but some analysts believe bin laden 's departure from the scene would have only a limited impact on the overall level of violence .
" in reality it 's going to make no difference whatsoever , because his ideology has now infected individuals and groups right across the globe , " says mj gohel of the asia-pacific foundation .
" from the very beginning , there has been a mistake in understanding the terrorist threat we face .
we 're not dealing here with a single organisation , a single command and control structure .
we 're dealing with an ideology and an ideology is very difficult to defeat . "
getting rid of bin laden might simply reveal the complex reality of local conflicts , with their roots in specific ethnic , regional issues , and the ideology will live on after its propagator has passed from the scene .
with the personification of the threat gone , it may also make it harder for american politicians to generate the kind of domestic support needed to continue the fight .
' strategic guidance ' others disagree , arguing that even though he is unlikely to have been involved in planning and executing most of the attacks since 11 september , 2001 , bin laden still plays a central role in communicating broad strategic objectives which others will then carry out in their own time and manner .
" there 's a conventional wisdom that it does n't matter if osama bin laden is captured or killed , which i think is erroneous , " argues peter bergen - one of the few western journalists to have interviewed the al-qaeda leader .
" both osama bin laden and ayman al-zawahri continue to influence the broader al-qaeda movement , giving them broad strategic guidance via the medium of these audio tapes .
" for instance bin laden called for attacks on members of the coalition in iraq , there were then attacks on italian police barracks in southern iraq ; there were attacks on the british bank and consulate in turkey , there was the attack in madrid . "
capturing or killing bin laden remains a key goal for the united states .
doing so would undoubtedly be a major morale booster and would also have some impact on the direction of the struggle - but it almost certainly would not end it .

bbc news -pipe- in depth -pipe- analysis : does bin laden still count ?

by gordon corera bbc security correspondent what has happened to osama bin laden ?
is he dead ?
on the run ?
or readying for new attacks on the us ?
these are questions that have been asked almost constantly for the past three years , but have a particular resonance now .
on the two previous anniversaries of the 11 september attacks , bin laden made some kind of appearance .
in 2003 , it was video footage of him walking in the mountains , although it was unclear when it was filmed .
in 2002 , his voice was heard on a video praising those who had carried out the attacks on new york and washington .
but so far this september , we have yet to hear from him .
jihadist insurgency the last statement which is believed to have come from bin laden himself was the audio message of 15 april .
in it , he gave europe three months to consider an offer of a truce if it committed to not attacking muslims or interfering in their affairs .
there have been no major attacks in europe since the end of that deadline .
bin laden is a cult figure in many parts of the world a video did appear from ayman al-zawahri , al-qaeda 's deputy leader , on 9 september which was designed to boost the morale of jihadis by playing up america 's problems in iraq and afghanistan .
of course , bin laden 's non-appearance can not be read in itself as a sign that he has died or is no longer hard at work - he could well be biding his time waiting to appear to gloat after a major attack on the us , an attack that american officials say could come in the next few months around election time .
however , his non-appearance still raises important questions about what exactly his role is in al-qaeda and the broader global jihadist insurgency .
pulling the strings ?
since 2001 , there has been a tendency from both the media and some politicians to personalise the conflict , setting up osama bin laden as an all-powerful puppet master , pulling the strings of a global network that reports to him , and is responsible for every attack .
before september 2001 , there was some evidence to back up that view .
in the case of the 11 september plot itself , the recently released us independent report makes clear that bin laden was involved in the plot to a greater level than thought before , actually making changes to details of the plans and intervening over when the attacks should take place .
but things have changed over the past few years .
the us has been saying that three-quarters of al-qaeda 's known leadership has been captured or killed .
the core of its leadership is undoubtedly under pressure and having to take extreme care over movements and communications , limiting its ability to direct plans - video messages can provide many clues on location which may be one reason they do not appear so often .
but the problem is that bin laden 's jihadist ideology has spread like a virus around the world .
mystique of invincibility many of the attacks , like those in madrid and jakarta this year , almost certainly were not centrally directed by al-qaeda but launched by groups and individuals who follow bin laden 's ideological agenda .

the drc conducted surveys on eleven high streets which show that the majority of shops , restaurants , cinemas and pubs are still not disabled friendly .
on 1 october part iii of the disability discrimination act - which requires anyone offering a service to remove physical barriers that prevent disabled people from accessing it - comes into effect .
although other parts of the act have been on the statute books for some time , friday 's change will mean that businesses will have to consider ' physical features ' like steps , heavy doors , insufficient lighting , lack of signs and poor colour contrast .
" shops and services have had nine years to improve things for disabled people , " said drc assistant communications director , agnes fletcher .
" from 1 october disabled people will be able to take court cases against persistent offenders - so the picture should change and people will no longer have to put up with a second class service . "
the survey - conducted by nop - found that : four out of five city centres posed significant problems for disabled shoppers almost a quarter of the 88 high street businesses surveyed were rated as ' poor ' or ' very poor ' a fifth of the disabled shoppers who took part in the research said they would not go back to the high street that they had visited problems getting around added an extra two hours to disabled people 's shopping trips a third of public toilets were difficult or impossible to access business organisations say that they are supportive of the legislation and blame the lack of preparedness on its complexity .
" new legislation always throws up problems , " the cbi 's neil bentley told bbc news online .
" i think it will take a couple of years before we see a real sea change in making services fully accessible , but when the demand is clearly there , and businesses see that demand from disabled customers , they will jump to make those changes . "

small businesses are only expected to make ' reasonable adjustments ' , so they wo n't bankrupt themselves to improve access .

" we 'll do all we can to help people but we ca n't really make many changes , " she said .
small businesses the cbi - together with the federation of small businesses - unsuccessfully lobbied the government a year ago for further tax breaks to help small businesses to improve their accessibility .

sometimes i just think ' why did i leave the house this morning ? '
i come home with absolutely nothing , i could n't get into any shops lisa egan the organisation says that disabled people are getting a second class service and encountering major problems when they go out shopping .
the drc conducted surveys on eleven high streets which show that the majority of shops , restaurants , cinemas and pubs are still not disabled friendly .
on 1 october part iii of the disability discrimination act - which requires anyone offering a service to remove physical barriers that prevent disabled people from accessing it - comes into effect .
although other parts of the act have been on the statute books for some time , friday 's change will mean that businesses will have to consider ' physical features ' like steps , heavy doors , insufficient lighting , lack of signs and poor colour contrast .
" shops and services have had nine years to improve things for disabled people , " said drc assistant communications director , agnes fletcher .
" from 1 october disabled people will be able to take court cases against persistent offenders - so the picture should change and people will no longer have to put up with a second class service . "
the survey - conducted by nop - found that : four out of five city centres posed significant problems for disabled shoppers almost a quarter of the 88 high street businesses surveyed were rated as ' poor ' or ' very poor ' a fifth of the disabled shoppers who took part in the research said they would not go back to the high street that they had visited problems getting around added an extra two hours to disabled people 's shopping trips a third of public toilets were difficult or impossible to access business organisations say that they are supportive of the legislation and blame the lack of preparedness on its complexity .
" new legislation always throws up problems , " the cbi 's neil bentley told bbc news online .
" i think it will take a couple of years before we see a real sea change in making services fully accessible , but when the demand is clearly there , and businesses see that demand from disabled customers , they will jump to make those changes . "
stores nervous if the bbc 's experience is anything to go by , there is a good deal of nervousness among large high street chains about whether or not they are complying with the law .
steps , heavy doors and poor layout can often be problematic when filming for the six o 'clock news in oxford , the majority of stores approached refused permission to film - including those who have already taken substantial steps towards meeting their legal obligations .
small businesses are only expected to make ' reasonable adjustments ' , so they wo n't bankrupt themselves to improve access .
but for oxford newsagent , jane taylor , making access improvements in a listed building would mean having to remove a centre aisle which might then make the business unviable .
" we 'll do all we can to help people but we ca n't really make many changes , " she said .
small businesses the cbi - together with the federation of small businesses - unsuccessfully lobbied the government a year ago for further tax breaks to help small businesses to improve their accessibility .
stephen alambritis says tax breaks would have been helpful " it would have got the accountancy profession talking to their clients so that they could take advantage of it , " said the federation 's stephen alambritis .
" this would have instigated an earlier preparedness of the legislation , but we did n't get it and now we have to look at other ways of getting businesses on board . "
making the high street a barrier-free environment ca n't come soon enough for people like lisa egan - a 25 year-old wheelchair user who accompanied us as we filmed in oxford .

"
sometimes i just think ' why did i leave the house this morning ? '
i come home with absolutely nothing , i could n't get into any shops " lisa egan the organisation says that disabled people are getting a second class service and encountering major problems when they go out shopping .
the drc conducted surveys on eleven high streets which show that the majority of shops , restaurants , cinemas and pubs are still not disabled friendly .
on 1 october part iii of the disability discrimination act - which requires anyone offering a service to remove physical barriers that prevent disabled people from accessing it - comes into effect .
although other parts of the act have been on the statute books for some time , friday 's change will mean that businesses will have to consider ' physical features ' like steps , heavy doors , insufficient lighting , lack of signs and poor colour contrast .
" shops and services have had nine years to improve things for disabled people , " said drc assistant communications director , agnes fletcher .
" from 1 october disabled people will be able to take court cases against persistent offenders - so the picture should change and people will no longer have to put up with a second class service . "
the survey - conducted by nop - found that : four out of five city centres posed significant problems for disabled shoppers almost a quarter of the 88 high street businesses surveyed were rated as ' poor ' or ' very poor ' a fifth of the disabled shoppers who took part in the research said they would not go back to the high street that they had visited problems getting around added an extra two hours to disabled people 's shopping trips a third of public toilets were difficult or impossible to access business organisations say that they are supportive of the legislation and blame the lack of preparedness on its complexity .
" new legislation always throws up problems , " the cbi 's neil bentley told bbc news online .
" i think it will take a couple of years before we see a real sea change in making services fully accessible , but when the demand is clearly there , and businesses see that demand from disabled customers , they will jump to make those changes . "
stores nervous if the bbc 's experience is anything to go by , there is a good deal of nervousness among large high street chains about whether or not they are complying with the law .

it follows research into family eating habits by the health charity developing patient partnerships -lrb- dpp -rrb- .
dpp found that 72 % of children said they would eat a healthier diet if their parents did .
about one-third of children in scotland are overweight .
the survey covered the attitudes of more than 100 school-age children and their parents .
nearly three-quarters of parents admitted struggling to motivate their children to eat a healthy diet .
many blamed advertising and marketing of unhealthy snacks and fizzy drinks .
simple changes can often make the biggest difference dr mary church bma scotland the dpp and the national obesity forum -lrb- nof -rrb- have launched the get sussed , get healthy family challenge initiative .
dr mary church , joint chairman of the bma 's scottish general practitioners committee , said : " one in three scots youngsters is overweight , therefore campaigns like this are vital to reinforce the message that it is important to improve the health of our children .
" while the survey identifies the role of schools in educating children on how to be healthy , it clearly illustrates that we , as parents , play a huge role in influencing our children 's behaviour .
an early start helps healthy living , says health experts " teaching children at an early age about the advantages of a healthy lifestyle often means that they continue this into adulthood .
simple changes can often make the biggest difference . "
the survey also revealed that other influential adults can play a role in encouraging children to eat more healthily .
just under half of those surveyed said they would be more likely to eat healthily and take part in sports or exercise if celebrities such as david beckham or beyoncé knowles encouraged them to do it .
dr ian campbell , of the nof , said the new campaign was " an important step in the right direction " .
he added : " this kind of support is crucial for parents if we are to see a reduction in the escalating rates of obesity .
" parents , schools , health professionals , the media , food manufacturers and the government , all have an important role to play in reducing the risk to children 's lives from obesity . "
advertising ban the scottish national party called for a ban on the advertising of unhealthy drinks and foods in light of the report 's findings .
the party 's health spokeswoman , shona robison , said : " children are constantly bombarded with adverts for fizzy drinks and unhealthy snacks which then creates one of the main problems for parents - pester power .
" that is why the snp is proposing a ban on advertising of unhealthy food and drink to children and the removal of fizzy drinks machines from schools .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- why are oil prices so high ?
bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies tuesday , 28 september 2004 , 08:03 gmt 09:03 uk why are oil prices so high ?
crude oil prices have risen by about 30 % this year to levels not seen since the early 1980s .
the latest rises are causing worries in importing countries about the economic cost of higher energy prices .
higher fuel prices can cause unwelcome rises in inflation , restrict economic growth and are unpopular with voters .
major oil exporters are divided between those such as saudi arabia and kuwait that favour lifting output in an attempt to ease prices , and those such as venezuela that argue against conciliatory moves towards big consumers , principally the us .
the price of us-traded light , sweet crude rose in september to more than $ 50 a barrel while uk-traded brent crude from the north sea rose to $ 46 a barrel .
bbc news online explains why prices are so high .
rising demand global economic expansion is driving what the international energy agency says is the biggest increase in oil demand for 24 years .
there is higher than expected demand in industrialised countries and china 's rapidly expanding economy has created a huge demand boost .
us demand has risen because of strengthening economic recovery and greater need for higher grade crude oil suitable for processing into petrol -lrb- gasoline -rrb- for the fuel-hungry sport utility vehicles -lrb- suvs -rrb- popular with us drivers .
chinese demand is up 20 % over the past year .
traders are betting this rapid growth will continue for several years although there is some chance that the economy will " overheat " and oil demand growth will slacken .
among suppliers only saudi arabia has significant spare capacity that it can make available to the market .
low stocks oil companies have tried to become more efficient in recent years and operate with lower stocks of crude oil .
this means there is less of a cushion in the market against supply interruptions .
events such as violence in the middle east , ethnic tension in nigeria and strikes in venezuela have had a greater effect on prices in the past year than might have been the case if stock levels were higher .
opec strategy the producers ' cartel opec accounts for about half of the world 's crude oil exports and attempts to keep prices roughly where it wants them by trimming or lifting supplies to the market .
in the past , opec ministers tended to wait for prices to dip before agreeing to cut output .
but opec is now acting more aggressively , announcing production cuts to pre-empt any weakening in prices .
international oil companies traditionally used times of seasonally weaker demand , when prices were lower , to rebuild stocks .
these windows now appear to have been closed .
data error is an additional factor , some analysts say .
consumption forecasts by market experts turned out to be too low .
the result was that producers kept supplies even tighter than was needed to prevent rebuilding of stocks .
action of speculators the combination of low stocks and opec action to keep them low leaves the market exposed to the prospect of sudden price rises if supplies are threatened .
this has not gone unnoticed by professional market speculators .
hedge funds and other speculators betting on the possibility of higher prices have themselves exacerbated price pressure in the market .
opec officials tend to blame speculators for 2004 's run-up in prices , ignoring the organisation 's earlier role in preventing stock rebuilding .
opec argues that its members are now pumping flat-out - which is largely true - and that it is powerless in a situation where factors other than mere supply and demand are at work .
violence in the middle east the world 's major oil consumers remain dependent on the middle east for their oil .
recent violence in iraq and saudi arabia has again raised fears about an interruption to supplies .
iraqi exports have been cut by sabotage attacks on oil facilities .
the reduction in supplies has been relatively modest but it has caused some doubts about iraq 's longer term prospects of becoming a large and stable oil exporter .
attacks on foreign workers in saudi arabia by al-qaeda-inspired militants have also increased tensions .
any substantial attack on saudi oil facilities would be a major event for world oil markets .
the country is the world 's biggest oil producer and , by far , the biggest exporter .
other political tension analysts also view political tension in non-middle east states nigeria and venezuela as having the potential to disrupt exports and drive up world prices .
and there have been worries that a dispute between russia 's government and the country 's biggest oil company , yukos , will lead to the shutdown of a good deal of russia 's production .
yukos pumps a fifth of russia 's approximate 8.5 million barrel a day output but faces bankruptcy and / or dismantling over huge government demands for back-taxes .
insufficient us refinery capacity low us gasoline stocks and pressure on us refiners to increase production of new gasoline blends have also helped drive world crude oil prices .
environmental regulations demand new grades of gasoline , which can vary from state to state .
but building processing facilities to serve so many different markets is expensive and environmental concerns can make planning permission difficult to obtain .
this means refiners are struggling to meet demand and are competing with each other , and with china , to secure supplies of the high quality , light , sweet crude needed for new gasoline blends .
saudi arabia 's previously spare capacity , now being pushed into the market , is mostly of a heavier grade than is suitable for processing into gasoline .
it will not alter the supply-demand situation for high grade crude oil .
at best , it will have a limited psychological impact , sending a message that the world 's largest oil exporter will do what it can to cool prices .

no sign yet of oil prices dropping back to earth crude oil prices have risen by about 30 % this year to levels not seen since the early 1980s .
the latest rises are causing worries in importing countries about the economic cost of higher energy prices .
higher fuel prices can cause unwelcome rises in inflation , restrict economic growth and are unpopular with voters .
major oil exporters are divided between those such as saudi arabia and kuwait that favour lifting output in an attempt to ease prices , and those such as venezuela that argue against conciliatory moves towards big consumers , principally the us .
the price of us-traded light , sweet crude rose in september to more than $ 50 a barrel while uk-traded brent crude from the north sea rose to $ 46 a barrel .
bbc news online explains why prices are so high .
rising demand global economic expansion is driving what the international energy agency says is the biggest increase in oil demand for 24 years .
there is higher than expected demand in industrialised countries and china 's rapidly expanding economy has created a huge demand boost .
us demand has risen because of strengthening economic recovery and greater need for higher grade crude oil suitable for processing into petrol -lrb- gasoline -rrb- for the fuel-hungry sport utility vehicles -lrb- suvs -rrb- popular with us drivers .
chinese demand is up 20 % over the past year .
traders are betting this rapid growth will continue for several years although there is some chance that the economy will " overheat " and oil demand growth will slacken .
among suppliers only saudi arabia has significant spare capacity that it can make available to the market .
low stocks oil companies have tried to become more efficient in recent years and operate with lower stocks of crude oil .
this means there is less of a cushion in the market against supply interruptions .
events such as violence in the middle east , ethnic tension in nigeria and strikes in venezuela have had a greater effect on prices in the past year than might have been the case if stock levels were higher .
opec strategy the producers ' cartel opec accounts for about half of the world 's crude oil exports and attempts to keep prices roughly where it wants them by trimming or lifting supplies to the market .
in the past , opec ministers tended to wait for prices to dip before agreeing to cut output .
china 's booming economy is sucking in a huge amount of oil but opec is now acting more aggressively , announcing production cuts to pre-empt any weakening in prices .

china 's booming economy is sucking in a huge amount of oil but opec is now acting more aggressively , announcing production cuts to pre-empt any weakening in prices .
international oil companies traditionally used times of seasonally weaker demand , when prices were lower , to rebuild stocks .
these windows now appear to have been closed .
data error is an additional factor , some analysts say .
consumption forecasts by market experts turned out to be too low .
the result was that producers kept supplies even tighter than was needed to prevent rebuilding of stocks .
action of speculators the combination of low stocks and opec action to keep them low leaves the market exposed to the prospect of sudden price rises if supplies are threatened .
this has not gone unnoticed by professional market speculators .
hedge funds and other speculators betting on the possibility of higher prices have themselves exacerbated price pressure in the market .
opec officials tend to blame speculators for 2004 's run-up in prices , ignoring the organisation 's earlier role in preventing stock rebuilding .
opec argues that its members are now pumping flat-out - which is largely true - and that it is powerless in a situation where factors other than mere supply and demand are at work .
violence in the middle east the world 's major oil consumers remain dependent on the middle east for their oil .
recent violence in iraq and saudi arabia has again raised fears about an interruption to supplies .
iraqi exports have been cut by sabotage attacks on oil facilities .
the reduction in supplies has been relatively modest but it has caused some doubts about iraq 's longer term prospects of becoming a large and stable oil exporter .
attacks on foreign workers in saudi arabia by al-qaeda-inspired militants have also increased tensions .
any substantial attack on saudi oil facilities would be a major event for world oil markets .
the country is the world 's biggest oil producer and , by far , the biggest exporter .
other political tension analysts also view political tension in non-middle east states nigeria and venezuela as having the potential to disrupt exports and drive up world prices .
and there have been worries that a dispute between russia 's government and the country 's biggest oil company , yukos , will lead to the shutdown of a good deal of russia 's production .
yukos pumps a fifth of russia 's approximate 8.5 million barrel a day output but faces bankruptcy and / or dismantling over huge government demands for back-taxes .
insufficient us refinery capacity low us gasoline stocks and pressure on us refiners to increase production of new gasoline blends have also helped drive world crude oil prices .
environmental regulations demand new grades of gasoline , which can vary from state to state .
but building processing facilities to serve so many different markets is expensive and environmental concerns can make planning permission difficult to obtain .
this means refiners are struggling to meet demand and are competing with each other , and with china , to secure supplies of the high quality , light , sweet crude needed for new gasoline blends .
saudi arabia 's previously spare capacity , now being pushed into the market , is mostly of a heavier grade than is suitable for processing into gasoline .
it will not alter the supply-demand situation for high grade crude oil .
at best , it will have a limited psychological impact , sending a message that the world 's largest oil exporter will do what it can to cool prices .

already , political billboards are sprouting up along the highways , while posters and party banners multiply and flutter on poles against the dusty winds .
on the surface of it , this ought to be a thriller .
this is the fourth election since ghana became a multi-party democracy in 1992 .
although there are five presidential candidates , only two have any realistic chance - john kufuor , the 65-year-old incumbent of the governing new patriotic party -lrb- npp -rrb- , and 60-year-old john atta mills , of the main opposition national democratic congress -lrb- ndc -rrb- .
there have been two previous face-offs , with a win for each .
in 1996 , mills , contesting on ex-president jerry rawlings ' ticket as running-mate , beat kufuor .
four years later , kufuor reversed the score in a christmas-time run-off , closing the door on eight years of ndc rule .
now , it 's the tie-break .
there 's a grudge to resolve .
the loser retires - not an appealing prospect for either man .
economic clash since august , kufuor has revved up into campaign mode after spending much of the election year nation-hopping in high-stakes international diplomacy .
" our president 's contribution is sought and respected in africa and among world leaders , and that 's why he was invited to the g8 summit , for example , " his spokesman , kwabena agyepong , said , defending mr kufour 's growing air-miles .
" as chairman of the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- , he 's the lead mediator for ivory coast , and it 's our duty to help put out the fire in our neighbour 's beard so that our own hairs do n't catch fire , " adds foreign minister nana addo akufo-addo .
in any case , the president 's strategists reckon that his diplomatic stature , including his hosting of a dozen african leaders in july as part of the search for peace in ivory coast , could have the side-effect of dwarfing his domestic rivals .
meanwhile his opponent worked the countryside .
and at gyankama , a village on the ridge overlooking the accra plains - where the people make a living retailing fruits by the roadside - the impressions that count tend to be closer to home and very basic .
mills is thought to be more popular in ghana 's rural areas " times are hard .
so me , i 'll vote for the person who 'll get me out of this torn cloth , " says the mother of one , abena nyankwabea , holding a basket of green avocados .
" we 'll listen to what they have to say about improving my life and then we 'll decide , " she adds .
as in most elections , the economy is also likely to play a huge part in campaigning .
" the npp has enjoyed higher international prices for cocoa and gold , and more manageable petroleum prices , and yet the price of petrol has doubled , " rojo mettle-nunoo , a mills campaign aide , points out .
" in contrast , we had to battle with stormy international trade conditions and service our debts .
" if kufuor 's government had better social policies and technical competence , it should have performed much better with all the donor support that has poured into this country . "
however , kufour 's side insists that ghanaians will enjoy better conditions when largely positive macro-economic indicators trickle down to them .
" i think that our people have to be more real and creative - if government builds a new feeder road to a village , it makes it possible for a farmer to transport more of his produce to the big town to sell on market day , " argues anthony osei , deputy minister of finance .
" if we provide electricity , it means the tyre-repairer or the carpenter can be more efficient .
" he can invest time in something else , like growing his own vegetables .
that 's money in his pocket . "
party events meanwhile , officials in kufuor 's administration say the ndc 's manifesto is more a catalogue of promises than a potential vote-swinger .
" they say they 're going to build hostels in the cities for street children , " argues steven asamoa-boateng , deputy information minister .
" they do n't tell us how they 'll finance it and who 'll pay the utility bills . "
nor is mills ' campaign helped by outbursts from rawlings , who is , officially , the leader of the ndc .
at a recent party event in the countryside , the 57-year-old ex-president , in a typically froth-filled fit of inexplicable rage , asked the military and the police to arrest president kufuor .
such rabble-rousing contrasts sharply with mills ' kinder , gentler persona , and could be a turn-off for the middle class and undecided voters - who , above all , want non-violent elections .
" rawlings ' presence is definitely a crowd-puller ; mills could use his symbolic endorsement , " says professor e gyimah-boadi , executive director at the centre for democratic development , an accra-based think tank .
" but i 'm not sure his pronouncements help his candidacy . "

" our president 's contribution is sought and respected in africa and among world leaders , and that 's why he was invited to the g8 summit , for example , " his spokesman , kwabena agyepong , said , defending mr kufour 's growing air-miles .
" as chairman of the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- , he 's the lead mediator for ivory coast , and it 's our duty to help put out the fire in our neighbour 's beard so that our own hairs do n't catch fire , " adds foreign minister nana addo akufo-addo .
in any case , the president 's strategists reckon that his diplomatic stature , including his hosting of a dozen african leaders in july as part of the search for peace in ivory coast , could have the side-effect of dwarfing his domestic rivals .
meanwhile his opponent worked the countryside .
and at gyankama , a village on the ridge overlooking the accra plains - where the people make a living retailing fruits by the roadside - the impressions that count tend to be closer to home and very basic .
" times are hard .
so me , i 'll vote for the person who 'll get me out of this torn cloth , " says the mother of one , abena nyankwabea , holding a basket of green avocados .
" we 'll listen to what they have to say about improving my life and then we 'll decide , " she adds .
as in most elections , the economy is also likely to play a huge part in campaigning .
" the npp has enjoyed higher international prices for cocoa and gold , and more manageable petroleum prices , and yet the price of petrol has doubled , " rojo mettle-nunoo , a mills campaign aide , points out .
" in contrast , we had to battle with stormy international trade conditions and service our debts .
" if kufuor 's government had better social policies and technical competence , it should have performed much better with all the donor support that has poured into this country . "
however , kufour 's side insists that ghanaians will enjoy better conditions when largely positive macro-economic indicators trickle down to them .
" i think that our people have to be more real and creative - if government builds a new feeder road to a village , it makes it possible for a farmer to transport more of his produce to the big town to sell on market day , " argues anthony osei , deputy minister of finance .
" if we provide electricity , it means the tyre-repairer or the carpenter can be more efficient .
" he can invest time in something else , like growing his own vegetables .
that 's money in his pocket . "
party events meanwhile , officials in kufuor 's administration say the ndc 's manifesto is more a catalogue of promises than a potential vote-swinger .
" they say they 're going to build hostels in the cities for street children , " argues steven asamoa-boateng , deputy information minister .
" they do n't tell us how they 'll finance it and who 'll pay the utility bills . "
nor is mills ' campaign helped by outbursts from rawlings , who is , officially , the leader of the ndc .
at a recent party event in the countryside , the 57-year-old ex-president , in a typically froth-filled fit of inexplicable rage , asked the military and the police to arrest president kufuor .
such rabble-rousing contrasts sharply with mills ' kinder , gentler persona , and could be a turn-off for the middle class and undecided voters - who , above all , want non-violent elections .
" rawlings ' presence is definitely a crowd-puller ; mills could use his symbolic endorsement , " says professor e gyimah-boadi , executive director at the centre for democratic development , an accra-based think tank .
" but i 'm not sure his pronouncements help his candidacy . "

in the past year , graphics card giants ati and nvidia have been working on new handset chips , the imageon and goforce respectively .
at the moment the graphical capabilities of mobile phones is relatively poor compared to desktop pcs .
this is down to a number of factors .
principally , it is a question of space and the amount of functionality that can be crammed into handset-sized hardware .
but new ways to bypass this problem have been found with the design of new chips which increase efficiency to such a degree that current resolutions can be doubled .
whilst ati 's imageon 2300 has had 3d graphics capability since january , nvidia recently demonstrated technology that can run full 3d graphics and streaming video at three megapixels .
handset scale the goforce 3d 4500 chip represents an improvement in clarity on the smaller screen , which can now show movie clips with subtitles that are legible , increasing resolutions from 1.3 megapixels to three megapixels .
the 3d graphics themselves have been upgraded to produce a smooth , fluid and complex set of visuals .
" when we looked at building a 3d product for the handset market , we looked at the system , " said manish singh , director for marketing of handheld products at nvidia .
" instead of taking a traditional pc architecture and finding ways to shoehorn it into a handheld we looked at the resources available on the system , " he told bbc radio five live 's up all night .
" we went back and partitioned the 3d pipe in a way that made sense . "
" all of these features are focused at reducing the amount of data that is moved around the system and optimising the amount of work that the pipeline has to do , " said mr singh .
" you do n't have to run this thing at 300mhz to get great performance . "
waiting times this new technology has found its way into phones already and ati 's second generation of imageon chips should be available by the middle of next year .
however the highest resolutions recently demonstrated will not be available for some time .
conservative estimates suggest by 2006 at the earliest .
exactly how and when the new chips are released will depend upon the carriers themselves .
if the various mobile phone networks are not convinced there is a market , they simply will not invest in it .
learning lessons from the painfully slow take up of 3g products might make the networks cautious .
but once people see the potential of these massively improved visuals it seems unlikely they will let it pass by .
