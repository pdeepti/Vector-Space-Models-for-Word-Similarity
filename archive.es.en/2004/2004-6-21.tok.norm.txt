find out what made the cut and what wound up on the editing floor . what does it do ?
the core of the constitution contains 50 articles describing the duties and responsibilities of the european union .
it also describes the european institutions , including new ones , and defines their authority .
it details how budgets and decision-making in the european union should be done , also setting into stone the new double majority principle for most major legislation .
voting the number of eu policy areas requiring the double majority vote is vastly expanded in the constitution .
however , it does not include a number of issues relating to internal security , foreign policy , budget , tax or economic policy - powers that many european member states wanted to retain in their national capitals .
in many areas that can be determined by double majority votes , the constitution builds in so-called " emergency breaks " that allow countries to impose a one-month veto in order to delay legislation .
in many areas , long grace or transition periods have been built in so countries can adjust from the current requirement of unanimous votes to the new double majority system .
rights the constitution also incorporates the european union 's charter of rights , which describes the rights and freedoms of every citizen of europe .
constitutional court it stipulates that lawsuits based on questions of the constitution must be taken up with the european court of justice in luxembourg .
president , foreign minister significantly , the constitution replaces the current presidency of the european council , which is held on a six-month rotating basis by each member state , with a president who serves a two-and-a-half year term at the helm of the council , stewarding its work and managing its agenda .
the constitution also establishes the office of an eu foreign minister , a position intended to increase the eu 's status abroad as well as to coordinate foreign policy among the eu member states .
streamlined democracy in an effort to streamline brussels bureaucracy , the constitution also reduces the number of commissioners on the european commission from 25 to 18 starting in 2014 .
the constitution also increases the powers of the democratically elected european parliament - giving it equal power as the european council to vote on budgets .
parliament will also have greater influence on the appointment of top eu offices , including the european commission president .
it will also have voting power in almost all policy areas .
secession the constitution also , for the first time , provides regulation for the voluntary secession of a member state .
what is different from earlier drafts or did n't make it into the constitution ?
in the future , decisions in the council of ministers will be made using the double majority principle : a qualified majority has been reached when 55 percent of the european union member states agree on legislation representing 65 percent of the entire eu population .
in order to stop legislation , a blocking minority of at least four countries is required .
until 2014 , each eu member country will be allowed to send a commissioner to the european commission .
after that , two-thirds of member states will be entitled to a commission seat on a rotating basis .
the number of members of the european parliament will be limited to 750 , though smaller member states will have a minimum of six seats and larger members no more than 99 seats in the european parliament .
the ministers reached an agreement on the stability and growth pact , the accord that guarantees the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro .
currently , the european commission has the direct power to take legal action against member states who violate the 3 percent deficit spending cap set in the pact .
in the future , the commission can recommend that action be taken , but such action requires the approval of a qualified majority of eu countries representing three-fifths of the eu 's population in the council of ministers .
there will be no direct reference to god in the constitution .
instead , the countries have agreed to a general reference to europe 's religious and cultural traditions .

until 2014 , each eu member country will be allowed to send a commissioner to the european commission .

the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are caught between implementing reforms that economists say are necessary if the country wants to compete in the global marketplace and staying true to its fundamental values of protecting the welfare state and looking out for the interests of working people . the strategy session of the spd 's executive committee seeks to draw a course out of the wilderness the party has been stumbling through for the past 18 months .
it is also trying to quell a revolt in the party 's left wing , which is demanding a radical policy course correction . " we must keep to the current course , " rhineland-palatinate 's premier kurt beck told reporters before going into the closed-door meeting .
he called on the party to close ranks and not let the election defeats split the party in two . in last week 's european elections , the spd lost around 2.8 million voters that supported the party five years earlier and its numbers slumped to 21.5 percent .
that defeat was but a continuation of a disastrous series of electoral defeats the party has suffered over the past year and a half , as voters turn away from the traditional party of the working class .
they are angered and alienated by schröder 's unpopular reforms that are meant to provide a kick-start to the german economy , which has been stagnant for three years . analysts say those reforms , which include new fees for doctors visits , cuts to some social benefits and a loosening of labor market rules that protect workers ' jobs , have unnerved the spd base , who see the party embarking on a course of social darwinism . but abandoning schröder 's reforms , which go under the name agenda 2010 , does not appear to be on the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering spd party head franz müntefering , heading a chorus of party leaders , said after consultations with other party leaders on monday there will be no " u-turn " on the reforms . " we have to get our country 's affairs in order with reforms , " said the spd 's deputy parliamentary group leader ludwig stiegler .
berlin 's spd mayor klaus wowereit told reporters before the meeting there was no alternative to agenda 2010 . they are largely echoing the words of chancellor gerhard schröder , who has repeatedly said he will not fundamentally change the course he has set the country on .
over the weekend , he told spd leaders he would rather resign than water down his reform program . new pr offensive ? while many party leaders are lining up behind schröder 's stay-the-course stance , calls have been going out to the executive to put a new spin on the reforms , putting the focus on social justice instead of on the dismantling of the welfare state . they appear to have been heard .
müntefering said on monday there would be new " accentuations " that would make it clear to the public that the reforms are being put in place " for everyone . " " we have to stop this idea that the reform course means doom , " björn böhning , head of the spd 's youth group , told german public television zdf .
he said the government 's zig-zag course and implementation did not make it easier for the electorate to understand what the goals were . " it must be clear to voters what these reforms are for , " michael müller , head of the berlin spd , told zdf on monday .
he said the party should make it clear , for example , that money saved by the reforms would be reinvested in education , a fact that would be received positively by voters . left-wing demands but according to trade unions and other members of the party 's left wing , the spd has already forgotten its roots .
they are repeating demands for a radical course change and a return to traditional social democratic positions . according to heiko maas , spd head in the state of saarland , the only way the current spd government has a chance to win elections again is to recover the " socially just label .

it is also trying to quell a revolt in the party 's left wing , which is demanding a radical policy course correction . " we must keep to the current course , " rhineland-palatinate 's premier kurt beck told reporters before going into the closed-door meeting .
he called on the party to close ranks and not let the election defeats split the party in two . in last week 's european elections , the spd lost around 2.8 million voters that supported the party five years earlier and its numbers slumped to 21.5 percent .

berlin 's spd mayor klaus wowereit told reporters before the meeting there was no alternative to agenda 2010 . they are largely echoing the words of chancellor gerhard schröder , who has repeatedly said he will not fundamentally change the course he has set the country on .

the capital has long been known as a center for germany 's homosexual community , as documented in the city 's gay museum . berlin 's gay museum is tucked away in the multicultural district of kreuzberg .
established in 1985 , the museum is a private institution dedicated to preserving , exhibiting , and discovering gay and lesbian history , art , and culture . although many organizations around the world collect historical material relevant to gay men and lesbians , the berlin museum is the only institution of its kind which is open full time and has a dedicated building with changing exhibitions open to the public . " we 're planning to open a permanent exhibit on gay history from 1800 - 1970 this december , " said gerrit horbacher , the musem 's spokesman .
" people are often confused when they come here and only see art exhibits .
they ask us where the history is , so that 's something we 'll have on show by the end of the year . " pioneer hirschfeld the museum 's extensive library includes a newspaper and magazine archive , which includes editions of the first gay magazine , " der eigene , " published in germany in 1896 .
" back then , the magazine was not really sold very openly .
instead there was a list of where to send them , and of places where people could buy them , " he said .
" in the 1920 's , it was a lot easier .
then you could find gay and lesbian magazines in kiosks alongside newspapers and mainstream magazines . " in 1897 in berlin , the publishers of " der eigene , " dr. magnus hirschfeld and adolf brand , went on to form the world ’ s first gay liberation movement .
the scientific humanitarian committee was a political group that lobbied the german parliament to abolish the law forbidding homosexuality known as " paragraph 175 , " which had been on the books since 1871 .
modified in 1969 and again in 1973 , the law was eventually abolished in 1994 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1907 german political cartoon depicting sex researcher magnus hirschfeld , " hero of the day , " drumming up support for the abolition of paragraph 175 of the german penal code that criminalized homosexuality .
hirschfeld was a social democrat , a jew and a medical doctor .
he gathered support for the gay cause from german intellectuals and liberal politicians of the time .
the gay museum includes many of his pioneering works . " in 1919 , hirschfeld founded the institute for sexual science , with which he aimed to make people conscious of their sexuality and allow people to live their sexual lives as they wanted , not just according to rules that were dictated by society , " horbacher said .
" he also conducted many surveys on homosexuality , and developed his theory of ‘ the third sex , ' as he called homosexuals . " the golden 1920 's the founding of hirschfeld 's institute coincided with the suffragette movement , shorter skirts , cropped hair for women and the so-called flapper look .
differences between the sexes were being bridged , and gay culture in berlin flourished .
much of the gay nightlife was centered around nollendorfplatz in the schöneberg district of berlin , and still is today .
one of the most famous nightclubs in the 1920 's was the eldorado , which featured a number of transvestite performers . " we 've got coins from the eldorado , which customers used to buy there .
on one side , they show either a gay or lesbian couple dancing together .
the customers would give the coins to one of the transvestites working there , to get a dance .
and at the end of the evening , the transvestites gathered all their coins , and were paid according to how many they 'd managed to collect , " horbacher explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich in " the blue angel " the eldorado also regularly featured then up-and-coming star marlene dietrich -lrb- photo -rrb- , who went on to achieve international fame .
dietrich had left germany by the 1930 's when the nazis came to power . after hitler 's regime took control , all gay and lesbian bars and meeting places in germany were closed .
magnus hirschfeld ’ s institute for sexual science was looted in 1933 by the nazis and his books were burned . " every gay person knew that the nazis did n't like homosexuals , and that they wanted to get rid of them , " horbacher said .
" they started to enforce paragraph 175 , so from 1935 on , it was punishable just to glance at someone of the same sex too intensively .
gay people lived in fear of being denounced by other people , and the police conducted raids , arrested gays , and sent them to concentration camps . " contemporary history while the museum contains much research material documenting the lives of homosexuals in past eras , it also concentrates resources on collecting material on important modern-day developments for gays in germany , such as the country 's new " registered partnership " law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male couple , just married " really , it 's just a kind of gay marriage , " horbacher said , " because there are n't equal rights like in a heterosexual marriage .
there are quite a few couples who are doing it .
in berlin , there are lots of gay marriages , and also the first divorces .
it 's quite normal here . " horbacher said that while the museum attracts many gays and lesbians from berlin and abroad , heterosexuals are also among the patrons .
" they see that there 's a gay museum , and think , ' let 's see what they 've got on display . "

modified in 1969 and again in 1973 , the law was eventually abolished in 1994 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1907 german political cartoon depicting sex researcher magnus hirschfeld , " hero of the day , " drumming up support for the abolition of paragraph 175 of the german penal code that criminalized homosexuality .
hirschfeld was a social democrat , a jew and a medical doctor .
he gathered support for the gay cause from german intellectuals and liberal politicians of the time .
the gay museum includes many of his pioneering works . " in 1919 , hirschfeld founded the institute for sexual science , with which he aimed to make people conscious of their sexuality and allow people to live their sexual lives as they wanted , not just according to rules that were dictated by society , " horbacher said .
" he also conducted many surveys on homosexuality , and developed his theory of ‘ the third sex , ' as he called homosexuals . " the golden 1920 's the founding of hirschfeld 's institute coincided with the suffragette movement , shorter skirts , cropped hair for women and the so-called flapper look .
differences between the sexes were being bridged , and gay culture in berlin flourished .
much of the gay nightlife was centered around nollendorfplatz in the schöneberg district of berlin , and still is today .
one of the most famous nightclubs in the 1920 's was the eldorado , which featured a number of transvestite performers . " we 've got coins from the eldorado , which customers used to buy there .
on one side , they show either a gay or lesbian couple dancing together .
the customers would give the coins to one of the transvestites working there , to get a dance .
and at the end of the evening , the transvestites gathered all their coins , and were paid according to how many they 'd managed to collect , " horbacher explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich in " the blue angel " the eldorado also regularly featured then up-and-coming star marlene dietrich -lrb- photo -rrb- , who went on to achieve international fame .
dietrich had left germany by the 1930 's when the nazis came to power . after hitler 's regime took control , all gay and lesbian bars and meeting places in germany were closed .
magnus hirschfeld ’ s institute for sexual science was looted in 1933 by the nazis and his books were burned . " every gay person knew that the nazis did n't like homosexuals , and that they wanted to get rid of them , " horbacher said .
" they started to enforce paragraph 175 , so from 1935 on , it was punishable just to glance at someone of the same sex too intensively .
gay people lived in fear of being denounced by other people , and the police conducted raids , arrested gays , and sent them to concentration camps . " contemporary history while the museum contains much research material documenting the lives of homosexuals in past eras , it also concentrates resources on collecting material on important modern-day developments for gays in germany , such as the country 's new " registered partnership " law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male couple , just married " really , it 's just a kind of gay marriage , " horbacher said , " because there are n't equal rights like in a heterosexual marriage .
there are quite a few couples who are doing it .
in berlin , there are lots of gay marriages , and also the first divorces .
it 's quite normal here . " horbacher said that while the museum attracts many gays and lesbians from berlin and abroad , heterosexuals are also among the patrons .
" they see that there 's a gay museum , and think , ' let 's see what they 've got on display . "
it 's a fun thing for them .

the capital has long been known as a center for germany 's homosexual community , as documented in the city 's gay museum . berlin 's gay museum is tucked away in the multicultural district of kreuzberg .
established in 1985 , the museum is a private institution dedicated to preserving , exhibiting , and discovering gay and lesbian history , art , and culture . although many organizations around the world collect historical material relevant to gay men and lesbians , the berlin museum is the only institution of its kind which is open full time and has a dedicated building with changing exhibitions open to the public . " we 're planning to open a permanent exhibit on gay history from 1800 - 1970 this december , " said gerrit horbacher , the musem 's spokesman .
" people are often confused when they come here and only see art exhibits .
they ask us where the history is , so that 's something we 'll have on show by the end of the year . " pioneer hirschfeld the museum 's extensive library includes a newspaper and magazine archive , which includes editions of the first gay magazine , " der eigene , " published in germany in 1896 .
" back then , the magazine was not really sold very openly .
instead there was a list of where to send them , and of places where people could buy them , " he said .
" in the 1920 's , it was a lot easier .
then you could find gay and lesbian magazines in kiosks alongside newspapers and mainstream magazines . " in 1897 in berlin , the publishers of " der eigene , " dr. magnus hirschfeld and adolf brand , went on to form the world ’ s first gay liberation movement .

it foresees a new debt of € 22 billion and focuses on privatization to bolster state coffers . eichel 's draft budget for 2005 , which will be submitted to cabinet for approval on wednesday , falls short of € 22 billion -lrb- $ 26.5 billion -rrb- - a deficit that 's down by around a half on the current year . eichel plans to further slash the deficit to € 19.5 billion by 2008 . according to the draft , germany 's budgetary spending for next year will total € 258.3 billion , an increase of 0.4 percent despite a general belt-tightening . eichel also hopes the draft budget will keep spending within the budget deficit cap of 3 percent of gdp set down in the eu 's growth and stability pact which underpins the euro . germany risks having to pay a huge fine to the european commission under the terms of the pact if it exceeds the 3 percent ceiling for the third straight year in 2005 . sale of government assets one of the most controversial provisions of the draft budget includes selling off a large chunk of government assets in order to bring the budget in line with the constitution . the german constitution lays down that new deficits can not exceed the amount of investments , which are expected to amount to € 22.8 billion in 2005 . to fulfill constitutional requirements , eichel is banking on privatizations to bring in a record € 15.45 billion that would help to plug a budgetary gap of € 18 billion . the € 15.4 billion corresponds to about three-fourths of the current stock market price of the german government 's shares in deutsche post and deutsche telekom . the finance minister has defended the controversial measure by pointing to the government 's refusal to raise taxes or implement new saving measures in the face of sluggish economic recovery .
it still remains unclear whether the planned privatizations include government stakes that will be sold in the current year . " budget plan of a gambler " but germany 's conservative opposition has criticized the draft budget for 2005 , in particular the sale of government assets at prices , they say , the market wo n't pay . " this budgetary nonsense has nothing to do with solid planning , " said dietrich austermann , budgetary expert of the opposition christian democrats .
austermann pointed out that it was speculative to talk of such high privatization proceeds in the face of low share prices . " this is the budget plan of a gambler .
spending is to be increased , no savings are being made .
the planned income is based mainly on speculative figures .
state investment is at a record low , and that will make itself felt in the labor market and the number of jobs , " he said . " selling the family silver " the draft budget also foresees reducing funds for almost all government ministries in 2005 . the transport ministry , for example , will have fewer funds to maintain and extend roads and to modernize germany 's railway system . similarly , the defense ministry will face substantial cuts - probably to the tune of some € 300 million , thus dampening defense minister peter struck 's plans to restructure and modernize the armed forces . criticism of the draft budget has also come from the greens , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .
franziska eichstätt-bohlig , the party 's financial expert , called the draft budget " very problematic . " referring to the planned high privatization proceeds , eichstätt-bohlig said , " that 's not a permanent stablization of the budget situation .
one can sell off the family silver only once .

until recently , the work of charlotte salomon was little known in germany .
after her death at auschwitz in 1943 , her work quietly disappeared into obscurity .
in two short years , the jewish artist , born in berlin in 1917 , created an astonishing 1,325 paintings documenting her dramatic life during a stay in southern france before her capture , deportation and murder by the nazis .
sixty years later , the painter 's work , which is roughly analogous to the art-world version of the diary of anne frank , is being shown in a major retrospective in frankfurt .
the museum is seeking not only to tell salomon 's story , but also to build the reputation of someone it considers to be one of the last century 's important artists .
the exhibition includes salomon 's paintings , gouaches , writings and music .

in the show , works by contemporary artists are sorted and organized around themes from the 10 commandments .
the show is courageous for a city well known for baroque beauty but less so for modern art .
curated by klaus biesenbach , artistic director of kunst-werke berlin and leading curator of the new york museum of modern art 's p.s. 1 gallery , the exhibition is divided into 10 different rooms representing each commandment .
within them , more than 100 works from 69 artists are on display .
rather than relying on historical material and paintings , the museum has chosen contemporary artists whose work captures the social and ethical tensions in our modern world .
" the 10 commandments " runs through dec .
5 .
it is open tuesdays through saturdays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
a painterly anne frank städel museum , frankfurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte salomon , leben ?
oder theater ?
until recently , the work of charlotte salomon was little known in germany .
after her death at auschwitz in 1943 , her work quietly disappeared into obscurity .
in two short years , the jewish artist , born in berlin in 1917 , created an astonishing 1,325 paintings documenting her dramatic life during a stay in southern france before her capture , deportation and murder by the nazis .
sixty years later , the painter 's work , which is roughly analogous to the art-world version of the diary of anne frank , is being shown in a major retrospective in frankfurt .
the museum is seeking not only to tell salomon 's story , but also to build the reputation of someone it considers to be one of the last century 's important artists .
the exhibition includes salomon 's paintings , gouaches , writings and music .
" charlotte salomon : life ?
or theater ? " runs through august 22 .
it is open tuesday and friday through sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
on wednesday and thursdays , the museum is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links zacheta gallery , warsaw fondation cartier , paris unterlinden museum -lrb- in french -rrb- german hygiene museum , dresden -lrb- in german -rrb- städel museum , frankfurt 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

it foresees a new debt of € 22 billion and focuses on privatization to bolster state coffers . eichel 's draft budget for 2005 , which will be submitted to cabinet for approval on wednesday , falls short of € 22 billion -lrb- $ 26.5 billion -rrb- - a deficit that 's down by around a half on the current year . eichel plans to further slash the deficit to € 19.5 billion by 2008 . according to the draft , germany 's budgetary spending for next year will total € 258.3 billion , an increase of 0.4 percent despite a general belt-tightening . eichel also hopes the draft budget will keep spending within the budget deficit cap of 3 percent of gdp set down in the eu 's growth and stability pact which underpins the euro . germany risks having to pay a huge fine to the european commission under the terms of the pact if it exceeds the 3 percent ceiling for the third straight year in 2005 . sale of government assets one of the most controversial provisions of the draft budget includes selling off a large chunk of government assets in order to bring the budget in line with the constitution . the german constitution lays down that new deficits can not exceed the amount of investments , which are expected to amount to € 22.8 billion in 2005 . to fulfill constitutional requirements , eichel is banking on privatizations to bring in a record € 15.45 billion that would help to plug a budgetary gap of € 18 billion . the € 15.4 billion corresponds to about three-fourths of the current stock market price of the german government 's shares in deutsche post and deutsche telekom . the finance minister has defended the controversial measure by pointing to the government 's refusal to raise taxes or implement new saving measures in the face of sluggish economic recovery .
it still remains unclear whether the planned privatizations include government stakes that will be sold in the current year . " budget plan of a gambler " but germany 's conservative opposition has criticized the draft budget for 2005 , in particular the sale of government assets at prices , they say , the market wo n't pay . " this budgetary nonsense has nothing to do with solid planning , " said dietrich austermann , budgetary expert of the opposition christian democrats .
austermann pointed out that it was speculative to talk of such high privatization proceeds in the face of low share prices . " this is the budget plan of a gambler .
spending is to be increased , no savings are being made .
the planned income is based mainly on speculative figures .
state investment is at a record low , and that will make itself felt in the labor market and the number of jobs , " he said . " selling the family silver " the draft budget also foresees reducing funds for almost all government ministries in 2005 . the transport ministry , for example , will have fewer funds to maintain and extend roads and to modernize germany 's railway system . similarly , the defense ministry will face substantial cuts - probably to the tune of some € 300 million , thus dampening defense minister peter struck 's plans to restructure and modernize the armed forces . criticism of the draft budget has also come from the greens , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .
franziska eichstätt-bohlig , the party 's financial expert , called the draft budget " very problematic . " referring to the planned high privatization proceeds , eichstätt-bohlig said , " that 's not a permanent stablization of the budget situation .

it foresees a new debt of € 22 billion and focuses on privatization to bolster state coffers . eichel 's draft budget for 2005 , which will be submitted to cabinet for approval on wednesday , falls short of € 22 billion -lrb- $ 26.5 billion -rrb- - a deficit that 's down by around a half on the current year . eichel plans to further slash the deficit to € 19.5 billion by 2008 . according to the draft , germany 's budgetary spending for next year will total € 258.3 billion , an increase of 0.4 percent despite a general belt-tightening . eichel also hopes the draft budget will keep spending within the budget deficit cap of 3 percent of gdp set down in the eu 's growth and stability pact which underpins the euro . germany risks having to pay a huge fine to the european commission under the terms of the pact if it exceeds the 3 percent ceiling for the third straight year in 2005 . sale of government assets one of the most controversial provisions of the draft budget includes selling off a large chunk of government assets in order to bring the budget in line with the constitution . the german constitution lays down that new deficits can not exceed the amount of investments , which are expected to amount to € 22.8 billion in 2005 . to fulfill constitutional requirements , eichel is banking on privatizations to bring in a record € 15.45 billion that would help to plug a budgetary gap of € 18 billion . the € 15.4 billion corresponds to about three-fourths of the current stock market price of the german government 's shares in deutsche post and deutsche telekom . the finance minister has defended the controversial measure by pointing to the government 's refusal to raise taxes or implement new saving measures in the face of sluggish economic recovery .
it still remains unclear whether the planned privatizations include government stakes that will be sold in the current year . " budget plan of a gambler " but germany 's conservative opposition has criticized the draft budget for 2005 , in particular the sale of government assets at prices , they say , the market wo n't pay . " this budgetary nonsense has nothing to do with solid planning , " said dietrich austermann , budgetary expert of the opposition christian democrats .
austermann pointed out that it was speculative to talk of such high privatization proceeds in the face of low share prices . " this is the budget plan of a gambler .
spending is to be increased , no savings are being made .
the planned income is based mainly on speculative figures .
state investment is at a record low , and that will make itself felt in the labor market and the number of jobs , " he said . " selling the family silver " the draft budget also foresees reducing funds for almost all government ministries in 2005 . the transport ministry , for example , will have fewer funds to maintain and extend roads and to modernize germany 's railway system . similarly , the defense ministry will face substantial cuts - probably to the tune of some € 300 million , thus dampening defense minister peter struck 's plans to restructure and modernize the armed forces . criticism of the draft budget has also come from the greens , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .
franziska eichstätt-bohlig , the party 's financial expert , called the draft budget " very problematic . " referring to the planned high privatization proceeds , eichstätt-bohlig said , " that 's not a permanent stablization of the budget situation .

will british and danish voters reject it ? in order to become legally binding , europe 's new constitution has to be ratified by the parliaments in each of its 25 member states .
a handful of countries , including those with the most euroskeptical politicians , are planning national referendums that will put the final decision in the hands of voters .
and that could prove to be an even tougher fight than the arm-wrestling and compromises that finally resulted in a final draft in brussels on friday .
facing a difficult re-election campaign that could come as soon as next year , british prime minister tony blair is n't expected to hold a referendum anytime soon .
in fact , he could delay the referendum vote until as late as 2006 , but even that far off , it will still be a tough sell .
" there is no need to rush it , " blair said sunday , kicking off what he conceded would be a " tough battle " for the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair at an eu summit in brussels " this treaty gives us the chance to play a vital part in decision-making at the heart of the european union whilst it protects completely our right to set our taxes , run our foreign policy and defense and do the things that people want us to do , " blair said .
the prime minister said the battle would be between " reality " and " myth . "
the fact is , he said , " we have kept control of taxes , of our policy on immigration , of defense , of foreign policy . "
most brits against constitution but a quick review of the polls show that the majority of british citizens do not agree with 10 downing street .
a survey released over the weekend by pollster yougov for the sunday times newspaper found 49 percent of brits were against ratifying the constitution and only 23 percent supported it .
similar polls found greater dissatisfaction , with as many as 69 percent feeling the constitution would transfer too much power from london to brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk is about to enter european parliament as head of the uk independence party .
british euroskepticism , or the idea that brussels is transforming into a super state with little transparency , also pervaded this month 's european elections .
the anti-eu united kingdom independence party carried 16-percent of the vote , and it 's leader pledged to wreak havoc with the european parliament .
on sunday , the party 's leader , former talk show host robert kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- , compared blair to neville chamberlain , the former british prime minister who famously claimed to have secured " peace in our time " with nazi germany in 1938 , offering a preview of the nasty wrangling in store for the coming months .
" it 's appeasement , " he said .
" there 's tony , he 's waving a piece of paper saying , ' it 's okay , i 've only given a little bit of our sovereignty away . "
the fallout from the european election has been a public relations nightmare for blair , who has said withdrawing from the eu would be disastrous .
" at this moment in time , when europe is actually changing , when there 's growing support for britain 's position in europe , to get out of the european union or marginalize ourselves in decision-making would just be an extraordinary act of foolishness , " the prime minister said .
britain 's opposition conservative party , which fears the establishment of a european federal state in brussels , has called for an immediate referendum .
blair also faces eu skeptics within his own labor party ranks .
a splinter group of labor politicians has established an action group called " labor against a super state . "
other countries follow suit but britain is n't alone in calling for a referendum .
denmark and ireland have said they will hold referendums , and luxembourg , the netherlands , spain and italy are likely to follow suit .
passage in those countries is anything but certain : denmark rejected the maastricht treaty , paving the way for the euro , in 1992 and ireland vetoed the nice treaty , which forged the path to enlargement , in 2001 .
the treaties passed on second votes in both countries , but only after denmark was given " opt outs " from maastricht euro provisions and the eu pledged to ireland its military neutrality would be respected .
for its part , germany does not plan to hold a referendum .
though members of the opposition free democratic party as well as the green party have called for a popular vote , chancellor gerhard schröder has rejected the idea , saying that it , like all other treaties , should be ratified by germany 's parliament , the bundestag .
after the constitution is signed , a move that will likely happen later this year , it must be ratified by the parliaments of all 25 member states within two years .
experts say that if one country rejects the constitution , it may be modified , but if two or more reject it , its ratification would be highly unlikely .
in order to appease the more euroskeptical voices within the european union , like britain and denmark , the final constitution text preserves sensitive national veto rights on issues pertaining to defense , taxation and foreign policy .
the question now is whether those changes will go far enough to unite a european union that is divided by countries promoting more federalist policies in brussels - like germany and france - from those who want to preserve more sovereignty , like britain and denmark . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de constitution faces easy ratification in germany though the new european union constitution faces a bloodbath battle in a handful of european countries , here in germany , it is expected to easily sail through parliament , where it will be given its final blessing .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk is about to enter european parliament as head of the uk independence party .
british euroskepticism , or the idea that brussels is transforming into a super state with little transparency , also pervaded this month 's european elections .
the anti-eu united kingdom independence party carried 16-percent of the vote , and it 's leader pledged to wreak havoc with the european parliament .
on sunday , the party 's leader , former talk show host robert kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- , compared blair to neville chamberlain , the former british prime minister who famously claimed to have secured " peace in our time " with nazi germany in 1938 , offering a preview of the nasty wrangling in store for the coming months .
" it 's appeasement , " he said .
" there 's tony , he 's waving a piece of paper saying , ' it 's okay , i 've only given a little bit of our sovereignty away . "
the fallout from the european election has been a public relations nightmare for blair , who has said withdrawing from the eu would be disastrous .
" at this moment in time , when europe is actually changing , when there 's growing support for britain 's position in europe , to get out of the european union or marginalize ourselves in decision-making would just be an extraordinary act of foolishness , " the prime minister said .
britain 's opposition conservative party , which fears the establishment of a european federal state in brussels , has called for an immediate referendum .
blair also faces eu skeptics within his own labor party ranks .
a splinter group of labor politicians has established an action group called " labor against a super state . "
other countries follow suit but britain is n't alone in calling for a referendum .
denmark and ireland have said they will hold referendums , and luxembourg , the netherlands , spain and italy are likely to follow suit .
passage in those countries is anything but certain : denmark rejected the maastricht treaty , paving the way for the euro , in 1992 and ireland vetoed the nice treaty , which forged the path to enlargement , in 2001 .
the treaties passed on second votes in both countries , but only after denmark was given " opt outs " from maastricht euro provisions and the eu pledged to ireland its military neutrality would be respected .
for its part , germany does not plan to hold a referendum .
though members of the opposition free democratic party as well as the green party have called for a popular vote , chancellor gerhard schröder has rejected the idea , saying that it , like all other treaties , should be ratified by germany 's parliament , the bundestag .
after the constitution is signed , a move that will likely happen later this year , it must be ratified by the parliaments of all 25 member states within two years .
experts say that if one country rejects the constitution , it may be modified , but if two or more reject it , its ratification would be highly unlikely .
in order to appease the more euroskeptical voices within the european union , like britain and denmark , the final constitution text preserves sensitive national veto rights on issues pertaining to defense , taxation and foreign policy .
the question now is whether those changes will go far enough to unite a european union that is divided by countries promoting more federalist policies in brussels - like germany and france - from those who want to preserve more sovereignty , like britain and denmark . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de constitution faces easy ratification in germany though the new european union constitution faces a bloodbath battle in a handful of european countries , here in germany , it is expected to easily sail through parliament , where it will be given its final blessing .

her pattern sample is within view .
relying on visual judgement and light brushstrokes , the porcelain painter fashions delicate butterflies and berries on a ceramic bowl .
the paints she uses have been mixed according to a secret recipe .
only an expert could immediately tell whether the pattern was painted in the 21st or the 18th century .
europe 's first and oldest porcelain manufacturer in the eastern german city of meissen cultivates the tried and true craft of handmade ceramics , without compromise .
meissen porcelain is the stuff of legend .
the factory was founded in 1710 , and by the mid 1700s , meissen porcelain adorned royal palaces and aristocratic homes across the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of a collection of fürstenberg porcellain owned by duchess anna amalia of weimar though meissen dominated the industry , seven major german factories were also established during the 1700s , all of which enjoyed princely patronage .
one of these was the fürstenberg porcelain manufactory , founded in 1747 .
today , though , the company is at an all-time low .
" our porcelain is a luxury product , and there 's just not much demand for luxury products in germany now , given the current economic situation , " said fürstenberg 's business administration manager , stephanie saalfeld . tough economic times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturing porcelain at kpm in berlin over the past several years , fürstenberg has had to continually let staff go .
in 1996 , the business still had over 200 employees .
now , the number is down to 150 , with another 40 positions to be cut .
" the whole porcelain industry has problems , " saalfeld said .
meissen is no different .
in 2003 , the company was just barely turning a profit .
it cut 100 jobs , and an additional 60 are also threatened .
in august of last year , all departments implemented reduced working hours . searching for a way to stop the decline , some porcelain manufacturers have turned to more streamlined , mechanized production techniques , which make products more affordable .
" fürstenberg is operating to a larger extent with mass-production , " wrote the cologne-based consulting firm bbe in its 2003 report for the glass , porcelain and ceramics industry .
" the larger porcelain manufacturers have integrated much of what was done by hand into their machine-operated processes . " but mass-production is something the 900 porcelain artists working at meissen would n't even dream of doing .
that would see their unique selling point go down the drain . " individual craftsmanship is still synonymous with top quality , " read the bbe report .
that 's good news for meissen , which does n't try to compete with the more affordable mass-produced brands . it 's a strategy that market experts say another prominent , troubled factory - berlin 's königliche porzellan manufaktur -lrb- kpm -rrb- - would be well advised to follow .
kpm is facing insolvency , and a decision is expected to be made soon about possible salvation in the form of privatization . luxury the way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 240-year old terrine from the house of meissen , part of the first china collection at potsdam 's sanssouci castle .
" the best thing for kpm would be a clear decision in favor of luxury , " said thomas kastl , head of the consumer goods trade fair " ambiente " in frankfurt . he points to the fact that , next year , the last trade barriers on the porcelain market are set to fall .
" then there 'll be a flood of high-quality , cheap porcelain from china on the market .
without a strong brand-name strategy , german products will be pushed out of the market , " kastl said . " the middle price segment is destined to disappear .
there 'll be only cheap products , and really expensive products , " predicted professor gert gutjahr from the institute for market psychology in mannheim .
experts say that right now , kpm would n't stand a chance against chinese manufacturers , whereas meissen would .
" who cares about the price when they 're buying a hand-painted , exclusive product ? " confirmed bbe . " it 's only going to become more difficult to determine differences in the quality of the products , " gutjahr explained .
whether a coffee service set is produced by fürstenberg or kpm , or in a no-name factory in china is irrelevant .
" the know-how is so evenly spread now , " gutjahr said , adding that every factories in both germany and china have the same machines needed to manufacture porcelain . branding is everything what separates the cheap products from the more expensive , is the value of the brand .
" in the german patent office , there are around 700,000 protected trademarks listed .
of those , 60,000 are still active on the market , " gutjahr said .
" only 200 are what we 'd call strong brands , and of those , only about 20 are truly sought after . "
these desired brands typically have a long history , as their reputation develops slowly , over several generations .
" on average , you 're talking 80 years , " said gutjahr . # b # meissen has existed for almost 300 years .
royalty , nobility , statesmen and popstars have eaten from the plates marked with the famous blue swords .
the company has 200,000 items in its repertoire and an extensive archive of molds stemming from various epochs .
prices are high , with small painted figurines starting at around € 1,000 each , and five-piece dinnerware settings ranging from € 450 to € 4,500 , depending on the complexity of the pattern .

the capital has long been known as a center for germany 's homosexual community , as documented in the city 's gay museum . berlin 's gay museum is tucked away in the multicultural district of kreuzberg .
established in 1985 , the museum is a private institution dedicated to preserving , exhibiting , and discovering gay and lesbian history , art , and culture . although many organizations around the world collect historical material relevant to gay men and lesbians , the berlin museum is the only institution of its kind which is open full time and has a dedicated building with changing exhibitions open to the public . " we 're planning to open a permanent exhibit on gay history from 1800 - 1970 this december , " said gerrit horbacher , the musem 's spokesman .
" people are often confused when they come here and only see art exhibits .
they ask us where the history is , so that 's something we 'll have on show by the end of the year . " pioneer hirschfeld the museum 's extensive library includes a newspaper and magazine archive , which includes editions of the first gay magazine , " der eigene , " published in germany in 1896 .
" back then , the magazine was not really sold very openly .
instead there was a list of where to send them , and of places where people could buy them , " he said .
" in the 1920 's , it was a lot easier .
then you could find gay and lesbian magazines in kiosks alongside newspapers and mainstream magazines . " in 1897 in berlin , the publishers of " der eigene , " dr. magnus hirschfeld and adolf brand , went on to form the world ’ s first gay liberation movement .
the scientific humanitarian committee was a political group that lobbied the german parliament to abolish the law forbidding homosexuality known as " paragraph 175 , " which had been on the books since 1871 .
modified in 1969 and again in 1973 , the law was eventually abolished in 1994 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1907 german political cartoon depicting sex researcher magnus hirschfeld , " hero of the day , " drumming up support for the abolition of paragraph 175 of the german penal code that criminalized homosexuality .
hirschfeld was a social democrat , a jew and a medical doctor .
he gathered support for the gay cause from german intellectuals and liberal politicians of the time .
the gay museum includes many of his pioneering works . " in 1919 , hirschfeld founded the institute for sexual science , with which he aimed to make people conscious of their sexuality and allow people to live their sexual lives as they wanted , not just according to rules that were dictated by society , " horbacher said .
" he also conducted many surveys on homosexuality , and developed his theory of ‘ the third sex , ' as he called homosexuals . " the golden 1920 's the founding of hirschfeld 's institute coincided with the suffragette movement , shorter skirts , cropped hair for women and the so-called flapper look .
differences between the sexes were being bridged , and gay culture in berlin flourished .
much of the gay nightlife was centered around nollendorfplatz in the schöneberg district of berlin , and still is today .
one of the most famous nightclubs in the 1920 's was the eldorado , which featured a number of transvestite performers . " we 've got coins from the eldorado , which customers used to buy there .
on one side , they show either a gay or lesbian couple dancing together .
the customers would give the coins to one of the transvestites working there , to get a dance .
and at the end of the evening , the transvestites gathered all their coins , and were paid according to how many they 'd managed to collect , " horbacher explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich in " the blue angel " the eldorado also regularly featured then up-and-coming star marlene dietrich -lrb- photo -rrb- , who went on to achieve international fame .
dietrich had left germany by the 1930 's when the nazis came to power . after hitler 's regime took control , all gay and lesbian bars and meeting places in germany were closed .
magnus hirschfeld ’ s institute for sexual science was looted in 1933 by the nazis and his books were burned . " every gay person knew that the nazis did n't like homosexuals , and that they wanted to get rid of them , " horbacher said .
" they started to enforce paragraph 175 , so from 1935 on , it was punishable just to glance at someone of the same sex too intensively .
gay people lived in fear of being denounced by other people , and the police conducted raids , arrested gays , and sent them to concentration camps . " contemporary history while the museum contains much research material documenting the lives of homosexuals in past eras , it also concentrates resources on collecting material on important modern-day developments for gays in germany , such as the country 's new " registered partnership " law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male couple , just married " really , it 's just a kind of gay marriage , " horbacher said , " because there are n't equal rights like in a heterosexual marriage .
there are quite a few couples who are doing it .
in berlin , there are lots of gay marriages , and also the first divorces .
it 's quite normal here . " horbacher said that while the museum attracts many gays and lesbians from berlin and abroad , heterosexuals are also among the patrons .
" they see that there 's a gay museum , and think , ' let 's see what they 've got on display . "
it 's a fun thing for them .
at least they 're open to coming in , and that 's our aim - not only to have gay and lesbian visitors , but also to be of interest to heterosexuals .

the capital has long been known as a center for germany 's homosexual community , as documented in the city 's gay museum . berlin 's gay museum is tucked away in the multicultural district of kreuzberg .
established in 1985 , the museum is a private institution dedicated to preserving , exhibiting , and discovering gay and lesbian history , art , and culture . although many organizations around the world collect historical material relevant to gay men and lesbians , the berlin museum is the only institution of its kind which is open full time and has a dedicated building with changing exhibitions open to the public . " we 're planning to open a permanent exhibit on gay history from 1800 - 1970 this december , " said gerrit horbacher , the musem 's spokesman .
" people are often confused when they come here and only see art exhibits .
they ask us where the history is , so that 's something we 'll have on show by the end of the year . " pioneer hirschfeld the museum 's extensive library includes a newspaper and magazine archive , which includes editions of the first gay magazine , " der eigene , " published in germany in 1896 .
" back then , the magazine was not really sold very openly .
instead there was a list of where to send them , and of places where people could buy them , " he said .
" in the 1920 's , it was a lot easier .
then you could find gay and lesbian magazines in kiosks alongside newspapers and mainstream magazines . " in 1897 in berlin , the publishers of " der eigene , " dr. magnus hirschfeld and adolf brand , went on to form the world ’ s first gay liberation movement .
the scientific humanitarian committee was a political group that lobbied the german parliament to abolish the law forbidding homosexuality known as " paragraph 175 , " which had been on the books since 1871 .
modified in 1969 and again in 1973 , the law was eventually abolished in 1994 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1907 german political cartoon depicting sex researcher magnus hirschfeld , " hero of the day , " drumming up support for the abolition of paragraph 175 of the german penal code that criminalized homosexuality .
hirschfeld was a social democrat , a jew and a medical doctor .
he gathered support for the gay cause from german intellectuals and liberal politicians of the time .
the gay museum includes many of his pioneering works . " in 1919 , hirschfeld founded the institute for sexual science , with which he aimed to make people conscious of their sexuality and allow people to live their sexual lives as they wanted , not just according to rules that were dictated by society , " horbacher said .
" he also conducted many surveys on homosexuality , and developed his theory of ‘ the third sex , ' as he called homosexuals . " the golden 1920 's the founding of hirschfeld 's institute coincided with the suffragette movement , shorter skirts , cropped hair for women and the so-called flapper look .
differences between the sexes were being bridged , and gay culture in berlin flourished .
much of the gay nightlife was centered around nollendorfplatz in the schöneberg district of berlin , and still is today .
one of the most famous nightclubs in the 1920 's was the eldorado , which featured a number of transvestite performers . " we 've got coins from the eldorado , which customers used to buy there .
on one side , they show either a gay or lesbian couple dancing together .
the customers would give the coins to one of the transvestites working there , to get a dance .
and at the end of the evening , the transvestites gathered all their coins , and were paid according to how many they 'd managed to collect , " horbacher explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich in " the blue angel " the eldorado also regularly featured then up-and-coming star marlene dietrich -lrb- photo -rrb- , who went on to achieve international fame .
dietrich had left germany by the 1930 's when the nazis came to power . after hitler 's regime took control , all gay and lesbian bars and meeting places in germany were closed .
magnus hirschfeld ’ s institute for sexual science was looted in 1933 by the nazis and his books were burned . " every gay person knew that the nazis did n't like homosexuals , and that they wanted to get rid of them , " horbacher said .
" they started to enforce paragraph 175 , so from 1935 on , it was punishable just to glance at someone of the same sex too intensively .
gay people lived in fear of being denounced by other people , and the police conducted raids , arrested gays , and sent them to concentration camps . " contemporary history while the museum contains much research material documenting the lives of homosexuals in past eras , it also concentrates resources on collecting material on important modern-day developments for gays in germany , such as the country 's new " registered partnership " law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male couple , just married " really , it 's just a kind of gay marriage , " horbacher said , " because there are n't equal rights like in a heterosexual marriage .
there are quite a few couples who are doing it .
in berlin , there are lots of gay marriages , and also the first divorces .
it 's quite normal here . " horbacher said that while the museum attracts many gays and lesbians from berlin and abroad , heterosexuals are also among the patrons .
" they see that there 's a gay museum , and think , ' let 's see what they 've got on display . "
it 's a fun thing for them .

dietrich had left germany by the 1930 's when the nazis came to power . after hitler 's regime took control , all gay and lesbian bars and meeting places in germany were closed .
magnus hirschfeld ’ s institute for sexual science was looted in 1933 by the nazis and his books were burned . " every gay person knew that the nazis did n't like homosexuals , and that they wanted to get rid of them , " horbacher said .
" they started to enforce paragraph 175 , so from 1935 on , it was punishable just to glance at someone of the same sex too intensively .
gay people lived in fear of being denounced by other people , and the police conducted raids , arrested gays , and sent them to concentration camps . " contemporary history while the museum contains much research material documenting the lives of homosexuals in past eras , it also concentrates resources on collecting material on important modern-day developments for gays in germany , such as the country 's new " registered partnership " law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male couple , just married " really , it 's just a kind of gay marriage , " horbacher said , " because there are n't equal rights like in a heterosexual marriage .
there are quite a few couples who are doing it .
in berlin , there are lots of gay marriages , and also the first divorces .
it 's quite normal here . " horbacher said that while the museum attracts many gays and lesbians from berlin and abroad , heterosexuals are also among the patrons .
" they see that there 's a gay museum , and think , ' let 's see what they 've got on display . "
it 's a fun thing for them .
at least they 're open to coming in , and that 's our aim - not only to have gay and lesbian visitors , but also to be of interest to heterosexuals .

the capital has long been known as a center for germany 's homosexual community , as documented in the city 's gay museum . berlin 's gay museum is tucked away in the multicultural district of kreuzberg .
established in 1985 , the museum is a private institution dedicated to preserving , exhibiting , and discovering gay and lesbian history , art , and culture . although many organizations around the world collect historical material relevant to gay men and lesbians , the berlin museum is the only institution of its kind which is open full time and has a dedicated building with changing exhibitions open to the public . " we 're planning to open a permanent exhibit on gay history from 1800 - 1970 this december , " said gerrit horbacher , the musem 's spokesman .
" people are often confused when they come here and only see art exhibits .
they ask us where the history is , so that 's something we 'll have on show by the end of the year . " pioneer hirschfeld the museum 's extensive library includes a newspaper and magazine archive , which includes editions of the first gay magazine , " der eigene , " published in germany in 1896 .
" back then , the magazine was not really sold very openly .
instead there was a list of where to send them , and of places where people could buy them , " he said .
" in the 1920 's , it was a lot easier .
then you could find gay and lesbian magazines in kiosks alongside newspapers and mainstream magazines . " in 1897 in berlin , the publishers of " der eigene , " dr. magnus hirschfeld and adolf brand , went on to form the world ’ s first gay liberation movement .
the scientific humanitarian committee was a political group that lobbied the german parliament to abolish the law forbidding homosexuality known as " paragraph 175 , " which had been on the books since 1871 .
modified in 1969 and again in 1973 , the law was eventually abolished in 1994 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1907 german political cartoon depicting sex researcher magnus hirschfeld , " hero of the day , " drumming up support for the abolition of paragraph 175 of the german penal code that criminalized homosexuality .
hirschfeld was a social democrat , a jew and a medical doctor .
he gathered support for the gay cause from german intellectuals and liberal politicians of the time .
the gay museum includes many of his pioneering works . " in 1919 , hirschfeld founded the institute for sexual science , with which he aimed to make people conscious of their sexuality and allow people to live their sexual lives as they wanted , not just according to rules that were dictated by society , " horbacher said .
" he also conducted many surveys on homosexuality , and developed his theory of ‘ the third sex , ' as he called homosexuals . " the golden 1920 's the founding of hirschfeld 's institute coincided with the suffragette movement , shorter skirts , cropped hair for women and the so-called flapper look .
differences between the sexes were being bridged , and gay culture in berlin flourished .
much of the gay nightlife was centered around nollendorfplatz in the schöneberg district of berlin , and still is today .
one of the most famous nightclubs in the 1920 's was the eldorado , which featured a number of transvestite performers . " we 've got coins from the eldorado , which customers used to buy there .
on one side , they show either a gay or lesbian couple dancing together .
the customers would give the coins to one of the transvestites working there , to get a dance .
and at the end of the evening , the transvestites gathered all their coins , and were paid according to how many they 'd managed to collect , " horbacher explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich in " the blue angel " the eldorado also regularly featured then up-and-coming star marlene dietrich -lrb- photo -rrb- , who went on to achieve international fame .
dietrich had left germany by the 1930 's when the nazis came to power . after hitler 's regime took control , all gay and lesbian bars and meeting places in germany were closed .
magnus hirschfeld ’ s institute for sexual science was looted in 1933 by the nazis and his books were burned . " every gay person knew that the nazis did n't like homosexuals , and that they wanted to get rid of them , " horbacher said .
" they started to enforce paragraph 175 , so from 1935 on , it was punishable just to glance at someone of the same sex too intensively .
gay people lived in fear of being denounced by other people , and the police conducted raids , arrested gays , and sent them to concentration camps . " contemporary history while the museum contains much research material documenting the lives of homosexuals in past eras , it also concentrates resources on collecting material on important modern-day developments for gays in germany , such as the country 's new " registered partnership " law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male couple , just married " really , it 's just a kind of gay marriage , " horbacher said , " because there are n't equal rights like in a heterosexual marriage .
there are quite a few couples who are doing it .
in berlin , there are lots of gay marriages , and also the first divorces .
it 's quite normal here . " horbacher said that while the museum attracts many gays and lesbians from berlin and abroad , heterosexuals are also among the patrons .
" they see that there 's a gay museum , and think , ' let 's see what they 've got on display . "
it 's a fun thing for them .
at least they 're open to coming in , and that 's our aim - not only to have gay and lesbian visitors , but also to be of interest to heterosexuals .

will british and danish voters reject it ? in order to become legally binding , europe 's new constitution has to be ratified by the parliaments in each of its 25 member states .
a handful of countries , including those with the most euroskeptical politicians , are planning national referendums that will put the final decision in the hands of voters .
and that could prove to be an even tougher fight than the arm-wrestling and compromises that finally resulted in a final draft in brussels on friday .
facing a difficult re-election campaign that could come as soon as next year , british prime minister tony blair is n't expected to hold a referendum anytime soon .
in fact , he could delay the referendum vote until as late as 2006 , but even that far off , it will still be a tough sell .
" there is no need to rush it , " blair said sunday , kicking off what he conceded would be a " tough battle " for the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair at an eu summit in brussels " this treaty gives us the chance to play a vital part in decision-making at the heart of the european union whilst it protects completely our right to set our taxes , run our foreign policy and defense and do the things that people want us to do , " blair said .
the prime minister said the battle would be between " reality " and " myth . "
the fact is , he said , " we have kept control of taxes , of our policy on immigration , of defense , of foreign policy . "
most brits against constitution but a quick review of the polls show that the majority of british citizens do not agree with 10 downing street .
a survey released over the weekend by pollster yougov for the sunday times newspaper found 49 percent of brits were against ratifying the constitution and only 23 percent supported it .
similar polls found greater dissatisfaction , with as many as 69 percent feeling the constitution would transfer too much power from london to brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk is about to enter european parliament as head of the uk independence party .
british euroskepticism , or the idea that brussels is transforming into a super state with little transparency , also pervaded this month 's european elections .
the anti-eu united kingdom independence party carried 16-percent of the vote , and it 's leader pledged to wreak havoc with the european parliament .
on sunday , the party 's leader , former talk show host robert kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- , compared blair to neville chamberlain , the former british prime minister who famously claimed to have secured " peace in our time " with nazi germany in 1938 , offering a preview of the nasty wrangling in store for the coming months .
" it 's appeasement , " he said .
" there 's tony , he 's waving a piece of paper saying , ' it 's okay , i 've only given a little bit of our sovereignty away . "
the fallout from the european election has been a public relations nightmare for blair , who has said withdrawing from the eu would be disastrous .
" at this moment in time , when europe is actually changing , when there 's growing support for britain 's position in europe , to get out of the european union or marginalize ourselves in decision-making would just be an extraordinary act of foolishness , " the prime minister said .
britain 's opposition conservative party , which fears the establishment of a european federal state in brussels , has called for an immediate referendum .
blair also faces eu skeptics within his own labor party ranks .

will british and danish voters reject it ? in order to become legally binding , europe 's new constitution has to be ratified by the parliaments in each of its 25 member states .
a handful of countries , including those with the most euroskeptical politicians , are planning national referendums that will put the final decision in the hands of voters .
and that could prove to be an even tougher fight than the arm-wrestling and compromises that finally resulted in a final draft in brussels on friday .
facing a difficult re-election campaign that could come as soon as next year , british prime minister tony blair is n't expected to hold a referendum anytime soon .
in fact , he could delay the referendum vote until as late as 2006 , but even that far off , it will still be a tough sell .
" there is no need to rush it , " blair said sunday , kicking off what he conceded would be a " tough battle " for the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair at an eu summit in brussels " this treaty gives us the chance to play a vital part in decision-making at the heart of the european union whilst it protects completely our right to set our taxes , run our foreign policy and defense and do the things that people want us to do , " blair said .
the prime minister said the battle would be between " reality " and " myth . "
the fact is , he said , " we have kept control of taxes , of our policy on immigration , of defense , of foreign policy . "
most brits against constitution but a quick review of the polls show that the majority of british citizens do not agree with 10 downing street .
a survey released over the weekend by pollster yougov for the sunday times newspaper found 49 percent of brits were against ratifying the constitution and only 23 percent supported it .
similar polls found greater dissatisfaction , with as many as 69 percent feeling the constitution would transfer too much power from london to brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk is about to enter european parliament as head of the uk independence party .
british euroskepticism , or the idea that brussels is transforming into a super state with little transparency , also pervaded this month 's european elections .
the anti-eu united kingdom independence party carried 16-percent of the vote , and it 's leader pledged to wreak havoc with the european parliament .
on sunday , the party 's leader , former talk show host robert kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- , compared blair to neville chamberlain , the former british prime minister who famously claimed to have secured " peace in our time " with nazi germany in 1938 , offering a preview of the nasty wrangling in store for the coming months .
" it 's appeasement , " he said .
" there 's tony , he 's waving a piece of paper saying , ' it 's okay , i 've only given a little bit of our sovereignty away . "
the fallout from the european election has been a public relations nightmare for blair , who has said withdrawing from the eu would be disastrous .
" at this moment in time , when europe is actually changing , when there 's growing support for britain 's position in europe , to get out of the european union or marginalize ourselves in decision-making would just be an extraordinary act of foolishness , " the prime minister said .
britain 's opposition conservative party , which fears the establishment of a european federal state in brussels , has called for an immediate referendum .

the anti-eu united kingdom independence party carried 16-percent of the vote , and it 's leader pledged to wreak havoc with the european parliament .
on sunday , the party 's leader , former talk show host robert kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- , compared blair to neville chamberlain , the former british prime minister who famously claimed to have secured " peace in our time " with nazi germany in 1938 , offering a preview of the nasty wrangling in store for the coming months .
" it 's appeasement , " he said .
" there 's tony , he 's waving a piece of paper saying , ' it 's okay , i 've only given a little bit of our sovereignty away . "
the fallout from the european election has been a public relations nightmare for blair , who has said withdrawing from the eu would be disastrous .
" at this moment in time , when europe is actually changing , when there 's growing support for britain 's position in europe , to get out of the european union or marginalize ourselves in decision-making would just be an extraordinary act of foolishness , " the prime minister said .
britain 's opposition conservative party , which fears the establishment of a european federal state in brussels , has called for an immediate referendum .
blair also faces eu skeptics within his own labor party ranks .
a splinter group of labor politicians has established an action group called " labor against a super state . "
other countries follow suit but britain is n't alone in calling for a referendum .
denmark and ireland have said they will hold referendums , and luxembourg , the netherlands , spain and italy are likely to follow suit .
passage in those countries is anything but certain : denmark rejected the maastricht treaty , paving the way for the euro , in 1992 and ireland vetoed the nice treaty , which forged the path to enlargement , in 2001 .
the treaties passed on second votes in both countries , but only after denmark was given " opt outs " from maastricht euro provisions and the eu pledged to ireland its military neutrality would be respected .
for its part , germany does not plan to hold a referendum .
though members of the opposition free democratic party as well as the green party have called for a popular vote , chancellor gerhard schröder has rejected the idea , saying that it , like all other treaties , should be ratified by germany 's parliament , the bundestag .
after the constitution is signed , a move that will likely happen later this year , it must be ratified by the parliaments of all 25 member states within two years .
experts say that if one country rejects the constitution , it may be modified , but if two or more reject it , its ratification would be highly unlikely .
in order to appease the more euroskeptical voices within the european union , like britain and denmark , the final constitution text preserves sensitive national veto rights on issues pertaining to defense , taxation and foreign policy .
the question now is whether those changes will go far enough to unite a european union that is divided by countries promoting more federalist policies in brussels - like germany and france - from those who want to preserve more sovereignty , like britain and denmark . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de constitution faces easy ratification in germany though the new european union constitution faces a bloodbath battle in a handful of european countries , here in germany , it is expected to easily sail through parliament , where it will be given its final blessing .

it foresees a new debt of € 22 billion and focuses on privatization to bolster state coffers . eichel 's draft budget for 2005 , which will be submitted to cabinet for approval on wednesday , falls short of € 22 billion -lrb- $ 26.5 billion -rrb- - a deficit that 's down by around a half on the current year . eichel plans to further slash the deficit to € 19.5 billion by 2008 . according to the draft , germany 's budgetary spending for next year will total € 258.3 billion , an increase of 0.4 percent despite a general belt-tightening . eichel also hopes the draft budget will keep spending within the budget deficit cap of 3 percent of gdp set down in the eu 's growth and stability pact which underpins the euro . germany risks having to pay a huge fine to the european commission under the terms of the pact if it exceeds the 3 percent ceiling for the third straight year in 2005 . sale of government assets one of the most controversial provisions of the draft budget includes selling off a large chunk of government assets in order to bring the budget in line with the constitution . the german constitution lays down that new deficits can not exceed the amount of investments , which are expected to amount to € 22.8 billion in 2005 . to fulfill constitutional requirements , eichel is banking on privatizations to bring in a record € 15.45 billion that would help to plug a budgetary gap of € 18 billion . the € 15.4 billion corresponds to about three-fourths of the current stock market price of the german government 's shares in deutsche post and deutsche telekom . the finance minister has defended the controversial measure by pointing to the government 's refusal to raise taxes or implement new saving measures in the face of sluggish economic recovery .
it still remains unclear whether the planned privatizations include government stakes that will be sold in the current year . " budget plan of a gambler " but germany 's conservative opposition has criticized the draft budget for 2005 , in particular the sale of government assets at prices , they say , the market wo n't pay . " this budgetary nonsense has nothing to do with solid planning , " said dietrich austermann , budgetary expert of the opposition christian democrats .
austermann pointed out that it was speculative to talk of such high privatization proceeds in the face of low share prices . " this is the budget plan of a gambler .
spending is to be increased , no savings are being made .
the planned income is based mainly on speculative figures .
state investment is at a record low , and that will make itself felt in the labor market and the number of jobs , " he said . " selling the family silver " the draft budget also foresees reducing funds for almost all government ministries in 2005 . the transport ministry , for example , will have fewer funds to maintain and extend roads and to modernize germany 's railway system . similarly , the defense ministry will face substantial cuts - probably to the tune of some € 300 million , thus dampening defense minister peter struck 's plans to restructure and modernize the armed forces . criticism of the draft budget has also come from the greens , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .
franziska eichstätt-bohlig , the party 's financial expert , called the draft budget " very problematic . " referring to the planned high privatization proceeds , eichstätt-bohlig said , " that 's not a permanent stablization of the budget situation .

it foresees a new debt of € 22 billion and focuses on privatization to bolster state coffers . eichel 's draft budget for 2005 , which will be submitted to cabinet for approval on wednesday , falls short of € 22 billion -lrb- $ 26.5 billion -rrb- - a deficit that 's down by around a half on the current year . eichel plans to further slash the deficit to € 19.5 billion by 2008 . according to the draft , germany 's budgetary spending for next year will total € 258.3 billion , an increase of 0.4 percent despite a general belt-tightening . eichel also hopes the draft budget will keep spending within the budget deficit cap of 3 percent of gdp set down in the eu 's growth and stability pact which underpins the euro . germany risks having to pay a huge fine to the european commission under the terms of the pact if it exceeds the 3 percent ceiling for the third straight year in 2005 . sale of government assets one of the most controversial provisions of the draft budget includes selling off a large chunk of government assets in order to bring the budget in line with the constitution . the german constitution lays down that new deficits can not exceed the amount of investments , which are expected to amount to € 22.8 billion in 2005 . to fulfill constitutional requirements , eichel is banking on privatizations to bring in a record € 15.45 billion that would help to plug a budgetary gap of € 18 billion . the € 15.4 billion corresponds to about three-fourths of the current stock market price of the german government 's shares in deutsche post and deutsche telekom . the finance minister has defended the controversial measure by pointing to the government 's refusal to raise taxes or implement new saving measures in the face of sluggish economic recovery .
it still remains unclear whether the planned privatizations include government stakes that will be sold in the current year . " budget plan of a gambler " but germany 's conservative opposition has criticized the draft budget for 2005 , in particular the sale of government assets at prices , they say , the market wo n't pay . " this budgetary nonsense has nothing to do with solid planning , " said dietrich austermann , budgetary expert of the opposition christian democrats .
austermann pointed out that it was speculative to talk of such high privatization proceeds in the face of low share prices . " this is the budget plan of a gambler .
spending is to be increased , no savings are being made .
the planned income is based mainly on speculative figures .
state investment is at a record low , and that will make itself felt in the labor market and the number of jobs , " he said . " selling the family silver " the draft budget also foresees reducing funds for almost all government ministries in 2005 . the transport ministry , for example , will have fewer funds to maintain and extend roads and to modernize germany 's railway system . similarly , the defense ministry will face substantial cuts - probably to the tune of some € 300 million , thus dampening defense minister peter struck 's plans to restructure and modernize the armed forces . criticism of the draft budget has also come from the greens , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .
franziska eichstätt-bohlig , the party 's financial expert , called the draft budget " very problematic . " referring to the planned high privatization proceeds , eichstätt-bohlig said , " that 's not a permanent stablization of the budget situation .
one can sell off the family silver only once .

they doubt that the document will find all-out support among the populations in other eu countries .
but senior politicians across the board have welcomed the agreement .
german chancellor gerhard schröder described the new constitution as a tough bargain to sell , but only as far as convincing his fellow eu leaders was concerned .
" this is a historic decision , " schröder said , " which wasn ’ t easy to reach .
we have overcome a major obstacle on the path of a truly united europe by making the european union more viable . "
' a good day for europe ' schröder ’ s view has been echoed by virtually all german politicians , not only from the ruling social democrats , but also the opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats .
even schröder ’ s fiercest domestic rival , christian democratic union leader angela merkel , praised the compromise reached in brussels as an important step for the 25-nation bloc .

" now the european union has completed its founding charter as a basis on which a fully united union can develop . "
merkel and the conservative party she leads had previously criticized the chancellor for allegedly seeking to split the european union by pushing his strategy of a core europe together with the french president jacques chirac .
the leaders of germany ’ s christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , also accused schröder of " selling out " germany 's interests to brussels .
but this weekend , the party 's leader said he was content with the final draft .
" the deal is much better than what we have at the moment , said edmund stoiber , premier of the state of bavaria .
" most importantly , it prevents attempts by brussels to dominate national politics . "
no god , no good the biggest criticism over the weekend came from german catholic clerics and politicians with strong religious affiliations .
they complained that the new constitution does not mention the bloc ’ s christian heritage as an underlying principle for the union .
" like many others in germany , i very much regret that , " said erwin teufel , the conservative premier in the state of baden-württemberg .
" it ’ s a shame that the german chancellor prevented an initiative by more than a dozen eu member states who also wanted to see christianity mentioned in the text . "
the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- also welcomed the new constitution .
however , the party 's leaders criticized the fact that , unlike the people of britain or denmark , the german population won ’ t have the chance to approve the document in a referendum .

the paints she uses have been mixed according to a secret recipe .
only an expert could immediately tell whether the pattern was painted in the 21st or the 18th century .
europe 's first and oldest porcelain manufacturer in the eastern german city of meissen cultivates the tried and true craft of handmade ceramics , without compromise .
meissen porcelain is the stuff of legend .
the factory was founded in 1710 , and by the mid 1700s , meissen porcelain adorned royal palaces and aristocratic homes across the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of a collection of fürstenberg porcellain owned by duchess anna amalia of weimar though meissen dominated the industry , seven major german factories were also established during the 1700s , all of which enjoyed princely patronage .
one of these was the fürstenberg porcelain manufactory , founded in 1747 .
today , though , the company is at an all-time low .
" our porcelain is a luxury product , and there 's just not much demand for luxury products in germany now , given the current economic situation , " said fürstenberg 's business administration manager , stephanie saalfeld . tough economic times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturing porcelain at kpm in berlin over the past several years , fürstenberg has had to continually let staff go .
in 1996 , the business still had over 200 employees .
now , the number is down to 150 , with another 40 positions to be cut .
" the whole porcelain industry has problems , " saalfeld said .
meissen is no different .
in 2003 , the company was just barely turning a profit .
it cut 100 jobs , and an additional 60 are also threatened .
in august of last year , all departments implemented reduced working hours . searching for a way to stop the decline , some porcelain manufacturers have turned to more streamlined , mechanized production techniques , which make products more affordable .
" fürstenberg is operating to a larger extent with mass-production , " wrote the cologne-based consulting firm bbe in its 2003 report for the glass , porcelain and ceramics industry .
" the larger porcelain manufacturers have integrated much of what was done by hand into their machine-operated processes . " but mass-production is something the 900 porcelain artists working at meissen would n't even dream of doing .
that would see their unique selling point go down the drain . " individual craftsmanship is still synonymous with top quality , " read the bbe report .
that 's good news for meissen , which does n't try to compete with the more affordable mass-produced brands . it 's a strategy that market experts say another prominent , troubled factory - berlin 's königliche porzellan manufaktur -lrb- kpm -rrb- - would be well advised to follow .
kpm is facing insolvency , and a decision is expected to be made soon about possible salvation in the form of privatization . luxury the way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 240-year old terrine from the house of meissen , part of the first china collection at potsdam 's sanssouci castle .
" the best thing for kpm would be a clear decision in favor of luxury , " said thomas kastl , head of the consumer goods trade fair " ambiente " in frankfurt . he points to the fact that , next year , the last trade barriers on the porcelain market are set to fall .
" then there 'll be a flood of high-quality , cheap porcelain from china on the market .
without a strong brand-name strategy , german products will be pushed out of the market , " kastl said . " the middle price segment is destined to disappear .
there 'll be only cheap products , and really expensive products , " predicted professor gert gutjahr from the institute for market psychology in mannheim .
experts say that right now , kpm would n't stand a chance against chinese manufacturers , whereas meissen would .
" who cares about the price when they 're buying a hand-painted , exclusive product ? " confirmed bbe . " it 's only going to become more difficult to determine differences in the quality of the products , " gutjahr explained .
whether a coffee service set is produced by fürstenberg or kpm , or in a no-name factory in china is irrelevant .
" the know-how is so evenly spread now , " gutjahr said , adding that every factories in both germany and china have the same machines needed to manufacture porcelain . branding is everything what separates the cheap products from the more expensive , is the value of the brand .
" in the german patent office , there are around 700,000 protected trademarks listed .
of those , 60,000 are still active on the market , " gutjahr said .
" only 200 are what we 'd call strong brands , and of those , only about 20 are truly sought after . "

there 'll be only cheap products , and really expensive products , " predicted professor gert gutjahr from the institute for market psychology in mannheim .
experts say that right now , kpm would n't stand a chance against chinese manufacturers , whereas meissen would .
" who cares about the price when they 're buying a hand-painted , exclusive product ? " confirmed bbe . " it 's only going to become more difficult to determine differences in the quality of the products , " gutjahr explained .
whether a coffee service set is produced by fürstenberg or kpm , or in a no-name factory in china is irrelevant .
" the know-how is so evenly spread now , " gutjahr said , adding that every factories in both germany and china have the same machines needed to manufacture porcelain . branding is everything what separates the cheap products from the more expensive , is the value of the brand .
" in the german patent office , there are around 700,000 protected trademarks listed .
of those , 60,000 are still active on the market , " gutjahr said .
" only 200 are what we 'd call strong brands , and of those , only about 20 are truly sought after . "
these desired brands typically have a long history , as their reputation develops slowly , over several generations .
" on average , you 're talking 80 years , " said gutjahr . # b # meissen has existed for almost 300 years .
royalty , nobility , statesmen and popstars have eaten from the plates marked with the famous blue swords .
the company has 200,000 items in its repertoire and an extensive archive of molds stemming from various epochs .
prices are high , with small painted figurines starting at around € 1,000 each , and five-piece dinnerware settings ranging from € 450 to € 4,500 , depending on the complexity of the pattern .

find out what made the cut and what wound up on the editing floor . what does it do ?
the core of the constitution contains 50 articles describing the duties and responsibilities of the european union .
it also describes the european institutions , including new ones , and defines their authority .
it details how budgets and decision-making in the european union should be done , also setting into stone the new double majority principle for most major legislation .
voting the number of eu policy areas requiring the double majority vote is vastly expanded in the constitution .
however , it does not include a number of issues relating to internal security , foreign policy , budget , tax or economic policy - powers that many european member states wanted to retain in their national capitals .
in many areas that can be determined by double majority votes , the constitution builds in so-called " emergency breaks " that allow countries to impose a one-month veto in order to delay legislation .
in many areas , long grace or transition periods have been built in so countries can adjust from the current requirement of unanimous votes to the new double majority system .
rights the constitution also incorporates the european union 's charter of rights , which describes the rights and freedoms of every citizen of europe .
constitutional court it stipulates that lawsuits based on questions of the constitution must be taken up with the european court of justice in luxembourg .
president , foreign minister significantly , the constitution replaces the current presidency of the european council , which is held on a six-month rotating basis by each member state , with a president who serves a two-and-a-half year term at the helm of the council , stewarding its work and managing its agenda .
the constitution also establishes the office of an eu foreign minister , a position intended to increase the eu 's status abroad as well as to coordinate foreign policy among the eu member states .
streamlined democracy in an effort to streamline brussels bureaucracy , the constitution also reduces the number of commissioners on the european commission from 25 to 18 starting in 2014 .
the constitution also increases the powers of the democratically elected european parliament - giving it equal power as the european council to vote on budgets .
parliament will also have greater influence on the appointment of top eu offices , including the european commission president .
it will also have voting power in almost all policy areas .
secession the constitution also , for the first time , provides regulation for the voluntary secession of a member state .
what is different from earlier drafts or did n't make it into the constitution ?
in the future , decisions in the council of ministers will be made using the double majority principle : a qualified majority has been reached when 55 percent of the european union member states agree on legislation representing 65 percent of the entire eu population .
in order to stop legislation , a blocking minority of at least four countries is required .
until 2014 , each eu member country will be allowed to send a commissioner to the european commission .
after that , two-thirds of member states will be entitled to a commission seat on a rotating basis .
the number of members of the european parliament will be limited to 750 , though smaller member states will have a minimum of six seats and larger members no more than 99 seats in the european parliament .
the ministers reached an agreement on the stability and growth pact , the accord that guarantees the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro .
currently , the european commission has the direct power to take legal action against member states who violate the 3 percent deficit spending cap set in the pact .
in the future , the commission can recommend that action be taken , but such action requires the approval of a qualified majority of eu countries representing three-fifths of the eu 's population in the council of ministers .
there will be no direct reference to god in the constitution .
instead , the countries have agreed to a general reference to europe 's religious and cultural traditions .

find out what made the cut and what wound up on the editing floor . what does it do ?
the core of the constitution contains 50 articles describing the duties and responsibilities of the european union .
it also describes the european institutions , including new ones , and defines their authority .
it details how budgets and decision-making in the european union should be done , also setting into stone the new double majority principle for most major legislation .
voting the number of eu policy areas requiring the double majority vote is vastly expanded in the constitution .
however , it does not include a number of issues relating to internal security , foreign policy , budget , tax or economic policy - powers that many european member states wanted to retain in their national capitals .
in many areas that can be determined by double majority votes , the constitution builds in so-called " emergency breaks " that allow countries to impose a one-month veto in order to delay legislation .
in many areas , long grace or transition periods have been built in so countries can adjust from the current requirement of unanimous votes to the new double majority system .
rights the constitution also incorporates the european union 's charter of rights , which describes the rights and freedoms of every citizen of europe .
constitutional court it stipulates that lawsuits based on questions of the constitution must be taken up with the european court of justice in luxembourg .
president , foreign minister significantly , the constitution replaces the current presidency of the european council , which is held on a six-month rotating basis by each member state , with a president who serves a two-and-a-half year term at the helm of the council , stewarding its work and managing its agenda .
the constitution also establishes the office of an eu foreign minister , a position intended to increase the eu 's status abroad as well as to coordinate foreign policy among the eu member states .
streamlined democracy in an effort to streamline brussels bureaucracy , the constitution also reduces the number of commissioners on the european commission from 25 to 18 starting in 2014 .
the constitution also increases the powers of the democratically elected european parliament - giving it equal power as the european council to vote on budgets .
parliament will also have greater influence on the appointment of top eu offices , including the european commission president .
it will also have voting power in almost all policy areas .
secession the constitution also , for the first time , provides regulation for the voluntary secession of a member state .
what is different from earlier drafts or did n't make it into the constitution ?
in the future , decisions in the council of ministers will be made using the double majority principle : a qualified majority has been reached when 55 percent of the european union member states agree on legislation representing 65 percent of the entire eu population .
in order to stop legislation , a blocking minority of at least four countries is required .
until 2014 , each eu member country will be allowed to send a commissioner to the european commission .
after that , two-thirds of member states will be entitled to a commission seat on a rotating basis .
the number of members of the european parliament will be limited to 750 , though smaller member states will have a minimum of six seats and larger members no more than 99 seats in the european parliament .
the ministers reached an agreement on the stability and growth pact , the accord that guarantees the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro .
currently , the european commission has the direct power to take legal action against member states who violate the 3 percent deficit spending cap set in the pact .
in the future , the commission can recommend that action be taken , but such action requires the approval of a qualified majority of eu countries representing three-fifths of the eu 's population in the council of ministers .
there will be no direct reference to god in the constitution .
instead , the countries have agreed to a general reference to europe 's religious and cultural traditions .

the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are caught between implementing reforms that economists say are necessary if the country wants to compete in the global marketplace and staying true to its fundamental values of protecting the welfare state and looking out for the interests of working people . the strategy session of the spd 's executive committee seeks to draw a course out of the wilderness the party has been stumbling through for the past 18 months .
it is also trying to quell a revolt in the party 's left wing , which is demanding a radical policy course correction . " we must keep to the current course , " rhineland-palatinate 's premier kurt beck told reporters before going into the closed-door meeting .
he called on the party to close ranks and not let the election defeats split the party in two . in last week 's european elections , the spd lost around 2.8 million voters that supported the party five years earlier and its numbers slumped to 21.5 percent .
that defeat was but a continuation of a disastrous series of electoral defeats the party has suffered over the past year and a half , as voters turn away from the traditional party of the working class .
they are angered and alienated by schröder 's unpopular reforms that are meant to provide a kick-start to the german economy , which has been stagnant for three years . analysts say those reforms , which include new fees for doctors visits , cuts to some social benefits and a loosening of labor market rules that protect workers ' jobs , have unnerved the spd base , who see the party embarking on a course of social darwinism . but abandoning schröder 's reforms , which go under the name agenda 2010 , does not appear to be on the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering spd party head franz müntefering , heading a chorus of party leaders , said after consultations with other party leaders on monday there will be no " u-turn " on the reforms . " we have to get our country 's affairs in order with reforms , " said the spd 's deputy parliamentary group leader ludwig stiegler .
berlin 's spd mayor klaus wowereit told reporters before the meeting there was no alternative to agenda 2010 . they are largely echoing the words of chancellor gerhard schröder , who has repeatedly said he will not fundamentally change the course he has set the country on .
over the weekend , he told spd leaders he would rather resign than water down his reform program . new pr offensive ? while many party leaders are lining up behind schröder 's stay-the-course stance , calls have been going out to the executive to put a new spin on the reforms , putting the focus on social justice instead of on the dismantling of the welfare state . they appear to have been heard .
müntefering said on monday there would be new " accentuations " that would make it clear to the public that the reforms are being put in place " for everyone . " " we have to stop this idea that the reform course means doom , " björn böhning , head of the spd 's youth group , told german public television zdf .
he said the government 's zig-zag course and implementation did not make it easier for the electorate to understand what the goals were . " it must be clear to voters what these reforms are for , " michael müller , head of the berlin spd , told zdf on monday .
he said the party should make it clear , for example , that money saved by the reforms would be reinvested in education , a fact that would be received positively by voters . left-wing demands but according to trade unions and other members of the party 's left wing , the spd has already forgotten its roots .

the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are caught between implementing reforms that economists say are necessary if the country wants to compete in the global marketplace and staying true to its fundamental values of protecting the welfare state and looking out for the interests of working people . the strategy session of the spd 's executive committee seeks to draw a course out of the wilderness the party has been stumbling through for the past 18 months .
it is also trying to quell a revolt in the party 's left wing , which is demanding a radical policy course correction . " we must keep to the current course , " rhineland-palatinate 's premier kurt beck told reporters before going into the closed-door meeting .
he called on the party to close ranks and not let the election defeats split the party in two . in last week 's european elections , the spd lost around 2.8 million voters that supported the party five years earlier and its numbers slumped to 21.5 percent .
that defeat was but a continuation of a disastrous series of electoral defeats the party has suffered over the past year and a half , as voters turn away from the traditional party of the working class .
they are angered and alienated by schröder 's unpopular reforms that are meant to provide a kick-start to the german economy , which has been stagnant for three years . analysts say those reforms , which include new fees for doctors visits , cuts to some social benefits and a loosening of labor market rules that protect workers ' jobs , have unnerved the spd base , who see the party embarking on a course of social darwinism . but abandoning schröder 's reforms , which go under the name agenda 2010 , does not appear to be on the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering spd party head franz müntefering , heading a chorus of party leaders , said after consultations with other party leaders on monday there will be no " u-turn " on the reforms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the rocky road to an eu constitution putting the constitution to the test eu parliament approves constitution all eu hopes on spain a referendum for germany after all ? europe -pipe- 21.06.2004 ratifying eu constitution will be a ' tough battle ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british euroskeptics do n't want blair to sign the eu constitution european union leaders agreed on friday to the final text of europe 's first ever constitution , but now comes the hard part : selling it to the people .
will british and danish voters reject it ? in order to become legally binding , europe 's new constitution has to be ratified by the parliaments in each of its 25 member states .
a handful of countries , including those with the most euroskeptical politicians , are planning national referendums that will put the final decision in the hands of voters .
and that could prove to be an even tougher fight than the arm-wrestling and compromises that finally resulted in a final draft in brussels on friday .
facing a difficult re-election campaign that could come as soon as next year , british prime minister tony blair is n't expected to hold a referendum anytime soon .
in fact , he could delay the referendum vote until as late as 2006 , but even that far off , it will still be a tough sell .
" there is no need to rush it , " blair said sunday , kicking off what he conceded would be a " tough battle " for the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair at an eu summit in brussels " this treaty gives us the chance to play a vital part in decision-making at the heart of the european union whilst it protects completely our right to set our taxes , run our foreign policy and defense and do the things that people want us to do , " blair said .
the prime minister said the battle would be between " reality " and " myth . "
the fact is , he said , " we have kept control of taxes , of our policy on immigration , of defense , of foreign policy . "
most brits against constitution but a quick review of the polls show that the majority of british citizens do not agree with 10 downing street .
a survey released over the weekend by pollster yougov for the sunday times newspaper found 49 percent of brits were against ratifying the constitution and only 23 percent supported it .
similar polls found greater dissatisfaction , with as many as 69 percent feeling the constitution would transfer too much power from london to brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk is about to enter european parliament as head of the uk independence party .
british euroskepticism , or the idea that brussels is transforming into a super state with little transparency , also pervaded this month 's european elections .
the anti-eu united kingdom independence party carried 16-percent of the vote , and it 's leader pledged to wreak havoc with the european parliament .
on sunday , the party 's leader , former talk show host robert kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- , compared blair to neville chamberlain , the former british prime minister who famously claimed to have secured " peace in our time " with nazi germany in 1938 , offering a preview of the nasty wrangling in store for the coming months .
" it 's appeasement , " he said .
" there 's tony , he 's waving a piece of paper saying , ' it 's okay , i 've only given a little bit of our sovereignty away . "
the fallout from the european election has been a public relations nightmare for blair , who has said withdrawing from the eu would be disastrous .
" at this moment in time , when europe is actually changing , when there 's growing support for britain 's position in europe , to get out of the european union or marginalize ourselves in decision-making would just be an extraordinary act of foolishness , " the prime minister said .
britain 's opposition conservative party , which fears the establishment of a european federal state in brussels , has called for an immediate referendum .
blair also faces eu skeptics within his own labor party ranks .
a splinter group of labor politicians has established an action group called " labor against a super state . "
other countries follow suit but britain is n't alone in calling for a referendum .
denmark and ireland have said they will hold referendums , and luxembourg , the netherlands , spain and italy are likely to follow suit .
passage in those countries is anything but certain : denmark rejected the maastricht treaty , paving the way for the euro , in 1992 and ireland vetoed the nice treaty , which forged the path to enlargement , in 2001 .
the treaties passed on second votes in both countries , but only after denmark was given " opt outs " from maastricht euro provisions and the eu pledged to ireland its military neutrality would be respected .
for its part , germany does not plan to hold a referendum .
though members of the opposition free democratic party as well as the green party have called for a popular vote , chancellor gerhard schröder has rejected the idea , saying that it , like all other treaties , should be ratified by germany 's parliament , the bundestag .
after the constitution is signed , a move that will likely happen later this year , it must be ratified by the parliaments of all 25 member states within two years .
experts say that if one country rejects the constitution , it may be modified , but if two or more reject it , its ratification would be highly unlikely .
in order to appease the more euroskeptical voices within the european union , like britain and denmark , the final constitution text preserves sensitive national veto rights on issues pertaining to defense , taxation and foreign policy .
the question now is whether those changes will go far enough to unite a european union that is divided by countries promoting more federalist policies in brussels - like germany and france - from those who want to preserve more sovereignty , like britain and denmark . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de constitution faces easy ratification in germany though the new european union constitution faces a bloodbath battle in a handful of european countries , here in germany , it is expected to easily sail through parliament , where it will be given its final blessing .

it foresees a new debt of € 22 billion and focuses on privatization to bolster state coffers . eichel 's draft budget for 2005 , which will be submitted to cabinet for approval on wednesday , falls short of € 22 billion -lrb- $ 26.5 billion -rrb- - a deficit that 's down by around a half on the current year . eichel plans to further slash the deficit to € 19.5 billion by 2008 . according to the draft , germany 's budgetary spending for next year will total € 258.3 billion , an increase of 0.4 percent despite a general belt-tightening . eichel also hopes the draft budget will keep spending within the budget deficit cap of 3 percent of gdp set down in the eu 's growth and stability pact which underpins the euro . germany risks having to pay a huge fine to the european commission under the terms of the pact if it exceeds the 3 percent ceiling for the third straight year in 2005 . sale of government assets one of the most controversial provisions of the draft budget includes selling off a large chunk of government assets in order to bring the budget in line with the constitution . the german constitution lays down that new deficits can not exceed the amount of investments , which are expected to amount to € 22.8 billion in 2005 . to fulfill constitutional requirements , eichel is banking on privatizations to bring in a record € 15.45 billion that would help to plug a budgetary gap of € 18 billion . the € 15.4 billion corresponds to about three-fourths of the current stock market price of the german government 's shares in deutsche post and deutsche telekom . the finance minister has defended the controversial measure by pointing to the government 's refusal to raise taxes or implement new saving measures in the face of sluggish economic recovery .
it still remains unclear whether the planned privatizations include government stakes that will be sold in the current year . " budget plan of a gambler " but germany 's conservative opposition has criticized the draft budget for 2005 , in particular the sale of government assets at prices , they say , the market wo n't pay . " this budgetary nonsense has nothing to do with solid planning , " said dietrich austermann , budgetary expert of the opposition christian democrats .
austermann pointed out that it was speculative to talk of such high privatization proceeds in the face of low share prices . " this is the budget plan of a gambler .
spending is to be increased , no savings are being made .
the planned income is based mainly on speculative figures .
state investment is at a record low , and that will make itself felt in the labor market and the number of jobs , " he said . " selling the family silver " the draft budget also foresees reducing funds for almost all government ministries in 2005 . the transport ministry , for example , will have fewer funds to maintain and extend roads and to modernize germany 's railway system . similarly , the defense ministry will face substantial cuts - probably to the tune of some € 300 million , thus dampening defense minister peter struck 's plans to restructure and modernize the armed forces . criticism of the draft budget has also come from the greens , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .
franziska eichstätt-bohlig , the party 's financial expert , called the draft budget " very problematic . " referring to the planned high privatization proceeds , eichstätt-bohlig said , " that 's not a permanent stablization of the budget situation .
one can sell off the family silver only once .

it foresees a new debt of € 22 billion and focuses on privatization to bolster state coffers . eichel 's draft budget for 2005 , which will be submitted to cabinet for approval on wednesday , falls short of € 22 billion -lrb- $ 26.5 billion -rrb- - a deficit that 's down by around a half on the current year . eichel plans to further slash the deficit to € 19.5 billion by 2008 . according to the draft , germany 's budgetary spending for next year will total € 258.3 billion , an increase of 0.4 percent despite a general belt-tightening . eichel also hopes the draft budget will keep spending within the budget deficit cap of 3 percent of gdp set down in the eu 's growth and stability pact which underpins the euro . germany risks having to pay a huge fine to the european commission under the terms of the pact if it exceeds the 3 percent ceiling for the third straight year in 2005 . sale of government assets one of the most controversial provisions of the draft budget includes selling off a large chunk of government assets in order to bring the budget in line with the constitution . the german constitution lays down that new deficits can not exceed the amount of investments , which are expected to amount to € 22.8 billion in 2005 . to fulfill constitutional requirements , eichel is banking on privatizations to bring in a record € 15.45 billion that would help to plug a budgetary gap of € 18 billion . the € 15.4 billion corresponds to about three-fourths of the current stock market price of the german government 's shares in deutsche post and deutsche telekom . the finance minister has defended the controversial measure by pointing to the government 's refusal to raise taxes or implement new saving measures in the face of sluggish economic recovery .
it still remains unclear whether the planned privatizations include government stakes that will be sold in the current year . " budget plan of a gambler " but germany 's conservative opposition has criticized the draft budget for 2005 , in particular the sale of government assets at prices , they say , the market wo n't pay . " this budgetary nonsense has nothing to do with solid planning , " said dietrich austermann , budgetary expert of the opposition christian democrats .
austermann pointed out that it was speculative to talk of such high privatization proceeds in the face of low share prices . " this is the budget plan of a gambler .
spending is to be increased , no savings are being made .
the planned income is based mainly on speculative figures .
state investment is at a record low , and that will make itself felt in the labor market and the number of jobs , " he said . " selling the family silver " the draft budget also foresees reducing funds for almost all government ministries in 2005 . the transport ministry , for example , will have fewer funds to maintain and extend roads and to modernize germany 's railway system . similarly , the defense ministry will face substantial cuts - probably to the tune of some € 300 million , thus dampening defense minister peter struck 's plans to restructure and modernize the armed forces . criticism of the draft budget has also come from the greens , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .
franziska eichstätt-bohlig , the party 's financial expert , called the draft budget " very problematic . " referring to the planned high privatization proceeds , eichstätt-bohlig said , " that 's not a permanent stablization of the budget situation .
one can sell off the family silver only once .

relying on visual judgement and light brushstrokes , the porcelain painter fashions delicate butterflies and berries on a ceramic bowl .
the paints she uses have been mixed according to a secret recipe .
only an expert could immediately tell whether the pattern was painted in the 21st or the 18th century .
europe 's first and oldest porcelain manufacturer in the eastern german city of meissen cultivates the tried and true craft of handmade ceramics , without compromise .
meissen porcelain is the stuff of legend .
the factory was founded in 1710 , and by the mid 1700s , meissen porcelain adorned royal palaces and aristocratic homes across the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of a collection of fürstenberg porcellain owned by duchess anna amalia of weimar though meissen dominated the industry , seven major german factories were also established during the 1700s , all of which enjoyed princely patronage .
one of these was the fürstenberg porcelain manufactory , founded in 1747 .
today , though , the company is at an all-time low .
" our porcelain is a luxury product , and there 's just not much demand for luxury products in germany now , given the current economic situation , " said fürstenberg 's business administration manager , stephanie saalfeld . tough economic times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturing porcelain at kpm in berlin over the past several years , fürstenberg has had to continually let staff go .
in 1996 , the business still had over 200 employees .
now , the number is down to 150 , with another 40 positions to be cut .
" the whole porcelain industry has problems , " saalfeld said .
meissen is no different .
in 2003 , the company was just barely turning a profit .
it cut 100 jobs , and an additional 60 are also threatened .
in august of last year , all departments implemented reduced working hours . searching for a way to stop the decline , some porcelain manufacturers have turned to more streamlined , mechanized production techniques , which make products more affordable .
" fürstenberg is operating to a larger extent with mass-production , " wrote the cologne-based consulting firm bbe in its 2003 report for the glass , porcelain and ceramics industry .
" the larger porcelain manufacturers have integrated much of what was done by hand into their machine-operated processes . " but mass-production is something the 900 porcelain artists working at meissen would n't even dream of doing .
that would see their unique selling point go down the drain . " individual craftsmanship is still synonymous with top quality , " read the bbe report .
that 's good news for meissen , which does n't try to compete with the more affordable mass-produced brands . it 's a strategy that market experts say another prominent , troubled factory - berlin 's königliche porzellan manufaktur -lrb- kpm -rrb- - would be well advised to follow .
kpm is facing insolvency , and a decision is expected to be made soon about possible salvation in the form of privatization . luxury the way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 240-year old terrine from the house of meissen , part of the first china collection at potsdam 's sanssouci castle .
" the best thing for kpm would be a clear decision in favor of luxury , " said thomas kastl , head of the consumer goods trade fair " ambiente " in frankfurt . he points to the fact that , next year , the last trade barriers on the porcelain market are set to fall .
" then there 'll be a flood of high-quality , cheap porcelain from china on the market .
without a strong brand-name strategy , german products will be pushed out of the market , " kastl said . " the middle price segment is destined to disappear .
there 'll be only cheap products , and really expensive products , " predicted professor gert gutjahr from the institute for market psychology in mannheim .
experts say that right now , kpm would n't stand a chance against chinese manufacturers , whereas meissen would .
" who cares about the price when they 're buying a hand-painted , exclusive product ? " confirmed bbe . " it 's only going to become more difficult to determine differences in the quality of the products , " gutjahr explained .
whether a coffee service set is produced by fürstenberg or kpm , or in a no-name factory in china is irrelevant .
" the know-how is so evenly spread now , " gutjahr said , adding that every factories in both germany and china have the same machines needed to manufacture porcelain . branding is everything what separates the cheap products from the more expensive , is the value of the brand .
" in the german patent office , there are around 700,000 protected trademarks listed .
of those , 60,000 are still active on the market , " gutjahr said .
" only 200 are what we 'd call strong brands , and of those , only about 20 are truly sought after . "
these desired brands typically have a long history , as their reputation develops slowly , over several generations .
" on average , you 're talking 80 years , " said gutjahr . # b # meissen has existed for almost 300 years .

prices are high , with small painted figurines starting at around € 1,000 each , and five-piece dinnerware settings ranging from € 450 to € 4,500 , depending on the complexity of the pattern .

europe 's first and oldest porcelain manufacturer in the eastern german city of meissen cultivates the tried and true craft of handmade ceramics , without compromise .

in 2003 , the company was just barely turning a profit .
it cut 100 jobs , and an additional 60 are also threatened .
in august of last year , all departments implemented reduced working hours . searching for a way to stop the decline , some porcelain manufacturers have turned to more streamlined , mechanized production techniques , which make products more affordable .
" fürstenberg is operating to a larger extent with mass-production , " wrote the cologne-based consulting firm bbe in its 2003 report for the glass , porcelain and ceramics industry .
" the larger porcelain manufacturers have integrated much of what was done by hand into their machine-operated processes . " but mass-production is something the 900 porcelain artists working at meissen would n't even dream of doing .

find out what made the cut and what wound up on the editing floor . what does it do ?
the core of the constitution contains 50 articles describing the duties and responsibilities of the european union .
it also describes the european institutions , including new ones , and defines their authority .
it details how budgets and decision-making in the european union should be done , also setting into stone the new double majority principle for most major legislation .
voting the number of eu policy areas requiring the double majority vote is vastly expanded in the constitution .
however , it does not include a number of issues relating to internal security , foreign policy , budget , tax or economic policy - powers that many european member states wanted to retain in their national capitals .
in many areas that can be determined by double majority votes , the constitution builds in so-called " emergency breaks " that allow countries to impose a one-month veto in order to delay legislation .
in many areas , long grace or transition periods have been built in so countries can adjust from the current requirement of unanimous votes to the new double majority system .
rights the constitution also incorporates the european union 's charter of rights , which describes the rights and freedoms of every citizen of europe .
constitutional court it stipulates that lawsuits based on questions of the constitution must be taken up with the european court of justice in luxembourg .
president , foreign minister significantly , the constitution replaces the current presidency of the european council , which is held on a six-month rotating basis by each member state , with a president who serves a two-and-a-half year term at the helm of the council , stewarding its work and managing its agenda .
the constitution also establishes the office of an eu foreign minister , a position intended to increase the eu 's status abroad as well as to coordinate foreign policy among the eu member states .
streamlined democracy in an effort to streamline brussels bureaucracy , the constitution also reduces the number of commissioners on the european commission from 25 to 18 starting in 2014 .
the constitution also increases the powers of the democratically elected european parliament - giving it equal power as the european council to vote on budgets .
parliament will also have greater influence on the appointment of top eu offices , including the european commission president .
it will also have voting power in almost all policy areas .
secession the constitution also , for the first time , provides regulation for the voluntary secession of a member state .
what is different from earlier drafts or did n't make it into the constitution ?
in the future , decisions in the council of ministers will be made using the double majority principle : a qualified majority has been reached when 55 percent of the european union member states agree on legislation representing 65 percent of the entire eu population .
in order to stop legislation , a blocking minority of at least four countries is required .
until 2014 , each eu member country will be allowed to send a commissioner to the european commission .
after that , two-thirds of member states will be entitled to a commission seat on a rotating basis .
the number of members of the european parliament will be limited to 750 , though smaller member states will have a minimum of six seats and larger members no more than 99 seats in the european parliament .
the ministers reached an agreement on the stability and growth pact , the accord that guarantees the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro .
currently , the european commission has the direct power to take legal action against member states who violate the 3 percent deficit spending cap set in the pact .
in the future , the commission can recommend that action be taken , but such action requires the approval of a qualified majority of eu countries representing three-fifths of the eu 's population in the council of ministers .
there will be no direct reference to god in the constitution .
instead , the countries have agreed to a general reference to europe 's religious and cultural traditions .

until 2014 , each eu member country will be allowed to send a commissioner to the european commission .
after that , two-thirds of member states will be entitled to a commission seat on a rotating basis .

the ministers reached an agreement on the stability and growth pact , the accord that guarantees the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro .
currently , the european commission has the direct power to take legal action against member states who violate the 3 percent deficit spending cap set in the pact .

find out what made the cut and what wound up on the editing floor . what does it do ?
the core of the constitution contains 50 articles describing the duties and responsibilities of the european union .
it also describes the european institutions , including new ones , and defines their authority .
it details how budgets and decision-making in the european union should be done , also setting into stone the new double majority principle for most major legislation .
voting the number of eu policy areas requiring the double majority vote is vastly expanded in the constitution .
however , it does not include a number of issues relating to internal security , foreign policy , budget , tax or economic policy - powers that many european member states wanted to retain in their national capitals .
in many areas that can be determined by double majority votes , the constitution builds in so-called " emergency breaks " that allow countries to impose a one-month veto in order to delay legislation .
in many areas , long grace or transition periods have been built in so countries can adjust from the current requirement of unanimous votes to the new double majority system .
rights the constitution also incorporates the european union 's charter of rights , which describes the rights and freedoms of every citizen of europe .
constitutional court it stipulates that lawsuits based on questions of the constitution must be taken up with the european court of justice in luxembourg .
president , foreign minister significantly , the constitution replaces the current presidency of the european council , which is held on a six-month rotating basis by each member state , with a president who serves a two-and-a-half year term at the helm of the council , stewarding its work and managing its agenda .
the constitution also establishes the office of an eu foreign minister , a position intended to increase the eu 's status abroad as well as to coordinate foreign policy among the eu member states .
streamlined democracy in an effort to streamline brussels bureaucracy , the constitution also reduces the number of commissioners on the european commission from 25 to 18 starting in 2014 .
the constitution also increases the powers of the democratically elected european parliament - giving it equal power as the european council to vote on budgets .
parliament will also have greater influence on the appointment of top eu offices , including the european commission president .
it will also have voting power in almost all policy areas .
secession the constitution also , for the first time , provides regulation for the voluntary secession of a member state .

in many areas that can be determined by double majority votes , the constitution builds in so-called " emergency breaks " that allow countries to impose a one-month veto in order to delay legislation .
in many areas , long grace or transition periods have been built in so countries can adjust from the current requirement of unanimous votes to the new double majority system .
rights the constitution also incorporates the european union 's charter of rights , which describes the rights and freedoms of every citizen of europe .
constitutional court it stipulates that lawsuits based on questions of the constitution must be taken up with the european court of justice in luxembourg .
president , foreign minister significantly , the constitution replaces the current presidency of the european council , which is held on a six-month rotating basis by each member state , with a president who serves a two-and-a-half year term at the helm of the council , stewarding its work and managing its agenda .
the constitution also establishes the office of an eu foreign minister , a position intended to increase the eu 's status abroad as well as to coordinate foreign policy among the eu member states .
streamlined democracy in an effort to streamline brussels bureaucracy , the constitution also reduces the number of commissioners on the european commission from 25 to 18 starting in 2014 .
the constitution also increases the powers of the democratically elected european parliament - giving it equal power as the european council to vote on budgets .
parliament will also have greater influence on the appointment of top eu offices , including the european commission president .
it will also have voting power in almost all policy areas .
secession the constitution also , for the first time , provides regulation for the voluntary secession of a member state .
what is different from earlier drafts or did n't make it into the constitution ?
in the future , decisions in the council of ministers will be made using the double majority principle : a qualified majority has been reached when 55 percent of the european union member states agree on legislation representing 65 percent of the entire eu population .
in order to stop legislation , a blocking minority of at least four countries is required .
until 2014 , each eu member country will be allowed to send a commissioner to the european commission .
after that , two-thirds of member states will be entitled to a commission seat on a rotating basis .
the number of members of the european parliament will be limited to 750 , though smaller member states will have a minimum of six seats and larger members no more than 99 seats in the european parliament .
the ministers reached an agreement on the stability and growth pact , the accord that guarantees the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro .
currently , the european commission has the direct power to take legal action against member states who violate the 3 percent deficit spending cap set in the pact .
in the future , the commission can recommend that action be taken , but such action requires the approval of a qualified majority of eu countries representing three-fifths of the eu 's population in the council of ministers .
there will be no direct reference to god in the constitution .
instead , the countries have agreed to a general reference to europe 's religious and cultural traditions .

the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are caught between implementing reforms that economists say are necessary if the country wants to compete in the global marketplace and staying true to its fundamental values of protecting the welfare state and looking out for the interests of working people . the strategy session of the spd 's executive committee seeks to draw a course out of the wilderness the party has been stumbling through for the past 18 months .
it is also trying to quell a revolt in the party 's left wing , which is demanding a radical policy course correction . " we must keep to the current course , " rhineland-palatinate 's premier kurt beck told reporters before going into the closed-door meeting .
he called on the party to close ranks and not let the election defeats split the party in two . in last week 's european elections , the spd lost around 2.8 million voters that supported the party five years earlier and its numbers slumped to 21.5 percent .
that defeat was but a continuation of a disastrous series of electoral defeats the party has suffered over the past year and a half , as voters turn away from the traditional party of the working class .
they are angered and alienated by schröder 's unpopular reforms that are meant to provide a kick-start to the german economy , which has been stagnant for three years . analysts say those reforms , which include new fees for doctors visits , cuts to some social benefits and a loosening of labor market rules that protect workers ' jobs , have unnerved the spd base , who see the party embarking on a course of social darwinism . but abandoning schröder 's reforms , which go under the name agenda 2010 , does not appear to be on the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering spd party head franz müntefering , heading a chorus of party leaders , said after consultations with other party leaders on monday there will be no " u-turn " on the reforms .

berlin 's spd mayor klaus wowereit told reporters before the meeting there was no alternative to agenda 2010 . they are largely echoing the words of chancellor gerhard schröder , who has repeatedly said he will not fundamentally change the course he has set the country on .
over the weekend , he told spd leaders he would rather resign than water down his reform program . new pr offensive ? while many party leaders are lining up behind schröder 's stay-the-course stance , calls have been going out to the executive to put a new spin on the reforms , putting the focus on social justice instead of on the dismantling of the welfare state . they appear to have been heard .

" " we have to stop this idea that the reform course means doom , " björn böhning , head of the spd 's youth group , told german public television zdf .
he said the government 's zig-zag course and implementation did not make it easier for the electorate to understand what the goals were . " it must be clear to voters what these reforms are for , " michael müller , head of the berlin spd , told zdf on monday .
he said the party should make it clear , for example , that money saved by the reforms would be reinvested in education , a fact that would be received positively by voters . left-wing demands but according to trade unions and other members of the party 's left wing , the spd has already forgotten its roots .

the capital has long been known as a center for germany 's homosexual community , as documented in the city 's gay museum . berlin 's gay museum is tucked away in the multicultural district of kreuzberg .
established in 1985 , the museum is a private institution dedicated to preserving , exhibiting , and discovering gay and lesbian history , art , and culture . although many organizations around the world collect historical material relevant to gay men and lesbians , the berlin museum is the only institution of its kind which is open full time and has a dedicated building with changing exhibitions open to the public . " we 're planning to open a permanent exhibit on gay history from 1800 - 1970 this december , " said gerrit horbacher , the musem 's spokesman .
" people are often confused when they come here and only see art exhibits .
they ask us where the history is , so that 's something we 'll have on show by the end of the year . " pioneer hirschfeld the museum 's extensive library includes a newspaper and magazine archive , which includes editions of the first gay magazine , " der eigene , " published in germany in 1896 .
" back then , the magazine was not really sold very openly .
instead there was a list of where to send them , and of places where people could buy them , " he said .
" in the 1920 's , it was a lot easier .
then you could find gay and lesbian magazines in kiosks alongside newspapers and mainstream magazines . " in 1897 in berlin , the publishers of " der eigene , " dr. magnus hirschfeld and adolf brand , went on to form the world ’ s first gay liberation movement .
the scientific humanitarian committee was a political group that lobbied the german parliament to abolish the law forbidding homosexuality known as " paragraph 175 , " which had been on the books since 1871 .
modified in 1969 and again in 1973 , the law was eventually abolished in 1994 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1907 german political cartoon depicting sex researcher magnus hirschfeld , " hero of the day , " drumming up support for the abolition of paragraph 175 of the german penal code that criminalized homosexuality .
hirschfeld was a social democrat , a jew and a medical doctor .
he gathered support for the gay cause from german intellectuals and liberal politicians of the time .
the gay museum includes many of his pioneering works . " in 1919 , hirschfeld founded the institute for sexual science , with which he aimed to make people conscious of their sexuality and allow people to live their sexual lives as they wanted , not just according to rules that were dictated by society , " horbacher said .
" he also conducted many surveys on homosexuality , and developed his theory of ‘ the third sex , ' as he called homosexuals . " the golden 1920 's the founding of hirschfeld 's institute coincided with the suffragette movement , shorter skirts , cropped hair for women and the so-called flapper look .
differences between the sexes were being bridged , and gay culture in berlin flourished .
much of the gay nightlife was centered around nollendorfplatz in the schöneberg district of berlin , and still is today .
one of the most famous nightclubs in the 1920 's was the eldorado , which featured a number of transvestite performers . " we 've got coins from the eldorado , which customers used to buy there .
on one side , they show either a gay or lesbian couple dancing together .
the customers would give the coins to one of the transvestites working there , to get a dance .
and at the end of the evening , the transvestites gathered all their coins , and were paid according to how many they 'd managed to collect , " horbacher explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich in " the blue angel " the eldorado also regularly featured then up-and-coming star marlene dietrich -lrb- photo -rrb- , who went on to achieve international fame .
dietrich had left germany by the 1930 's when the nazis came to power . after hitler 's regime took control , all gay and lesbian bars and meeting places in germany were closed .
magnus hirschfeld ’ s institute for sexual science was looted in 1933 by the nazis and his books were burned . " every gay person knew that the nazis did n't like homosexuals , and that they wanted to get rid of them , " horbacher said .
" they started to enforce paragraph 175 , so from 1935 on , it was punishable just to glance at someone of the same sex too intensively .
gay people lived in fear of being denounced by other people , and the police conducted raids , arrested gays , and sent them to concentration camps . " contemporary history while the museum contains much research material documenting the lives of homosexuals in past eras , it also concentrates resources on collecting material on important modern-day developments for gays in germany , such as the country 's new " registered partnership " law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male couple , just married " really , it 's just a kind of gay marriage , " horbacher said , " because there are n't equal rights like in a heterosexual marriage .
there are quite a few couples who are doing it .
in berlin , there are lots of gay marriages , and also the first divorces .
it 's quite normal here . " horbacher said that while the museum attracts many gays and lesbians from berlin and abroad , heterosexuals are also among the patrons .
" they see that there 's a gay museum , and think , ' let 's see what they 've got on display . "
it 's a fun thing for them .
at least they 're open to coming in , and that 's our aim - not only to have gay and lesbian visitors , but also to be of interest to heterosexuals .

the capital has long been known as a center for germany 's homosexual community , as documented in the city 's gay museum . berlin 's gay museum is tucked away in the multicultural district of kreuzberg .
established in 1985 , the museum is a private institution dedicated to preserving , exhibiting , and discovering gay and lesbian history , art , and culture . although many organizations around the world collect historical material relevant to gay men and lesbians , the berlin museum is the only institution of its kind which is open full time and has a dedicated building with changing exhibitions open to the public . " we 're planning to open a permanent exhibit on gay history from 1800 - 1970 this december , " said gerrit horbacher , the musem 's spokesman .
" people are often confused when they come here and only see art exhibits .
they ask us where the history is , so that 's something we 'll have on show by the end of the year . " pioneer hirschfeld the museum 's extensive library includes a newspaper and magazine archive , which includes editions of the first gay magazine , " der eigene , " published in germany in 1896 .
" back then , the magazine was not really sold very openly .
instead there was a list of where to send them , and of places where people could buy them , " he said .
" in the 1920 's , it was a lot easier .
then you could find gay and lesbian magazines in kiosks alongside newspapers and mainstream magazines . " in 1897 in berlin , the publishers of " der eigene , " dr. magnus hirschfeld and adolf brand , went on to form the world ’ s first gay liberation movement .
the scientific humanitarian committee was a political group that lobbied the german parliament to abolish the law forbidding homosexuality known as " paragraph 175 , " which had been on the books since 1871 .
modified in 1969 and again in 1973 , the law was eventually abolished in 1994 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1907 german political cartoon depicting sex researcher magnus hirschfeld , " hero of the day , " drumming up support for the abolition of paragraph 175 of the german penal code that criminalized homosexuality .
hirschfeld was a social democrat , a jew and a medical doctor .
he gathered support for the gay cause from german intellectuals and liberal politicians of the time .
the gay museum includes many of his pioneering works . " in 1919 , hirschfeld founded the institute for sexual science , with which he aimed to make people conscious of their sexuality and allow people to live their sexual lives as they wanted , not just according to rules that were dictated by society , " horbacher said .
" he also conducted many surveys on homosexuality , and developed his theory of ‘ the third sex , ' as he called homosexuals . " the golden 1920 's the founding of hirschfeld 's institute coincided with the suffragette movement , shorter skirts , cropped hair for women and the so-called flapper look .
differences between the sexes were being bridged , and gay culture in berlin flourished .
much of the gay nightlife was centered around nollendorfplatz in the schöneberg district of berlin , and still is today .
one of the most famous nightclubs in the 1920 's was the eldorado , which featured a number of transvestite performers . " we 've got coins from the eldorado , which customers used to buy there .
on one side , they show either a gay or lesbian couple dancing together .
the customers would give the coins to one of the transvestites working there , to get a dance .
and at the end of the evening , the transvestites gathered all their coins , and were paid according to how many they 'd managed to collect , " horbacher explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich in " the blue angel " the eldorado also regularly featured then up-and-coming star marlene dietrich -lrb- photo -rrb- , who went on to achieve international fame .
dietrich had left germany by the 1930 's when the nazis came to power . after hitler 's regime took control , all gay and lesbian bars and meeting places in germany were closed .
magnus hirschfeld ’ s institute for sexual science was looted in 1933 by the nazis and his books were burned . " every gay person knew that the nazis did n't like homosexuals , and that they wanted to get rid of them , " horbacher said .
" they started to enforce paragraph 175 , so from 1935 on , it was punishable just to glance at someone of the same sex too intensively .
gay people lived in fear of being denounced by other people , and the police conducted raids , arrested gays , and sent them to concentration camps . " contemporary history while the museum contains much research material documenting the lives of homosexuals in past eras , it also concentrates resources on collecting material on important modern-day developments for gays in germany , such as the country 's new " registered partnership " law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male couple , just married " really , it 's just a kind of gay marriage , " horbacher said , " because there are n't equal rights like in a heterosexual marriage .
there are quite a few couples who are doing it .
in berlin , there are lots of gay marriages , and also the first divorces .
it 's quite normal here . " horbacher said that while the museum attracts many gays and lesbians from berlin and abroad , heterosexuals are also among the patrons .
" they see that there 's a gay museum , and think , ' let 's see what they 've got on display . "
it 's a fun thing for them .

curated by klaus biesenbach , artistic director of kunst-werke berlin and leading curator of the new york museum of modern art 's p.s. 1 gallery , the exhibition is divided into 10 different rooms representing each commandment .
within them , more than 100 works from 69 artists are on display .
rather than relying on historical material and paintings , the museum has chosen contemporary artists whose work captures the social and ethical tensions in our modern world .
" the 10 commandments " runs through dec .
5 .
it is open tuesdays through saturdays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
a painterly anne frank städel museum , frankfurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte salomon , leben ?
oder theater ?
until recently , the work of charlotte salomon was little known in germany .
after her death at auschwitz in 1943 , her work quietly disappeared into obscurity .
in two short years , the jewish artist , born in berlin in 1917 , created an astonishing 1,325 paintings documenting her dramatic life during a stay in southern france before her capture , deportation and murder by the nazis .
sixty years later , the painter 's work , which is roughly analogous to the art-world version of the diary of anne frank , is being shown in a major retrospective in frankfurt .
the museum is seeking not only to tell salomon 's story , but also to build the reputation of someone it considers to be one of the last century 's important artists .
the exhibition includes salomon 's paintings , gouaches , writings and music .
" charlotte salomon : life ?
or theater ? " runs through august 22 .
it is open tuesday and friday through sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
on wednesday and thursdays , the museum is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links zacheta gallery , warsaw fondation cartier , paris unterlinden museum -lrb- in french -rrb- german hygiene museum , dresden -lrb- in german -rrb- städel museum , frankfurt 9799 dw-tv europe live made in germany we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

will british and danish voters reject it ? in order to become legally binding , europe 's new constitution has to be ratified by the parliaments in each of its 25 member states .
a handful of countries , including those with the most euroskeptical politicians , are planning national referendums that will put the final decision in the hands of voters .
and that could prove to be an even tougher fight than the arm-wrestling and compromises that finally resulted in a final draft in brussels on friday .
facing a difficult re-election campaign that could come as soon as next year , british prime minister tony blair is n't expected to hold a referendum anytime soon .
in fact , he could delay the referendum vote until as late as 2006 , but even that far off , it will still be a tough sell .
" there is no need to rush it , " blair said sunday , kicking off what he conceded would be a " tough battle " for the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair at an eu summit in brussels " this treaty gives us the chance to play a vital part in decision-making at the heart of the european union whilst it protects completely our right to set our taxes , run our foreign policy and defense and do the things that people want us to do , " blair said .
the prime minister said the battle would be between " reality " and " myth . "
the fact is , he said , " we have kept control of taxes , of our policy on immigration , of defense , of foreign policy . "
most brits against constitution but a quick review of the polls show that the majority of british citizens do not agree with 10 downing street .
a survey released over the weekend by pollster yougov for the sunday times newspaper found 49 percent of brits were against ratifying the constitution and only 23 percent supported it .
similar polls found greater dissatisfaction , with as many as 69 percent feeling the constitution would transfer too much power from london to brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk is about to enter european parliament as head of the uk independence party .
british euroskepticism , or the idea that brussels is transforming into a super state with little transparency , also pervaded this month 's european elections .
the anti-eu united kingdom independence party carried 16-percent of the vote , and it 's leader pledged to wreak havoc with the european parliament .
on sunday , the party 's leader , former talk show host robert kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- , compared blair to neville chamberlain , the former british prime minister who famously claimed to have secured " peace in our time " with nazi germany in 1938 , offering a preview of the nasty wrangling in store for the coming months .
" it 's appeasement , " he said .
" there 's tony , he 's waving a piece of paper saying , ' it 's okay , i 've only given a little bit of our sovereignty away . "
the fallout from the european election has been a public relations nightmare for blair , who has said withdrawing from the eu would be disastrous .
" at this moment in time , when europe is actually changing , when there 's growing support for britain 's position in europe , to get out of the european union or marginalize ourselves in decision-making would just be an extraordinary act of foolishness , " the prime minister said .
britain 's opposition conservative party , which fears the establishment of a european federal state in brussels , has called for an immediate referendum .
blair also faces eu skeptics within his own labor party ranks .
a splinter group of labor politicians has established an action group called " labor against a super state . "
other countries follow suit but britain is n't alone in calling for a referendum .
denmark and ireland have said they will hold referendums , and luxembourg , the netherlands , spain and italy are likely to follow suit .
passage in those countries is anything but certain : denmark rejected the maastricht treaty , paving the way for the euro , in 1992 and ireland vetoed the nice treaty , which forged the path to enlargement , in 2001 .
the treaties passed on second votes in both countries , but only after denmark was given " opt outs " from maastricht euro provisions and the eu pledged to ireland its military neutrality would be respected .
for its part , germany does not plan to hold a referendum .
though members of the opposition free democratic party as well as the green party have called for a popular vote , chancellor gerhard schröder has rejected the idea , saying that it , like all other treaties , should be ratified by germany 's parliament , the bundestag .
after the constitution is signed , a move that will likely happen later this year , it must be ratified by the parliaments of all 25 member states within two years .
experts say that if one country rejects the constitution , it may be modified , but if two or more reject it , its ratification would be highly unlikely .
in order to appease the more euroskeptical voices within the european union , like britain and denmark , the final constitution text preserves sensitive national veto rights on issues pertaining to defense , taxation and foreign policy .
the question now is whether those changes will go far enough to unite a european union that is divided by countries promoting more federalist policies in brussels - like germany and france - from those who want to preserve more sovereignty , like britain and denmark . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de constitution faces easy ratification in germany though the new european union constitution faces a bloodbath battle in a handful of european countries , here in germany , it is expected to easily sail through parliament , where it will be given its final blessing .

on sunday , the party 's leader , former talk show host robert kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- , compared blair to neville chamberlain , the former british prime minister who famously claimed to have secured " peace in our time " with nazi germany in 1938 , offering a preview of the nasty wrangling in store for the coming months .
" it 's appeasement , " he said .
" there 's tony , he 's waving a piece of paper saying , ' it 's okay , i 've only given a little bit of our sovereignty away . "
the fallout from the european election has been a public relations nightmare for blair , who has said withdrawing from the eu would be disastrous .
" at this moment in time , when europe is actually changing , when there 's growing support for britain 's position in europe , to get out of the european union or marginalize ourselves in decision-making would just be an extraordinary act of foolishness , " the prime minister said .

will british and danish voters reject it ? in order to become legally binding , europe 's new constitution has to be ratified by the parliaments in each of its 25 member states .
a handful of countries , including those with the most euroskeptical politicians , are planning national referendums that will put the final decision in the hands of voters .
and that could prove to be an even tougher fight than the arm-wrestling and compromises that finally resulted in a final draft in brussels on friday .
facing a difficult re-election campaign that could come as soon as next year , british prime minister tony blair is n't expected to hold a referendum anytime soon .
in fact , he could delay the referendum vote until as late as 2006 , but even that far off , it will still be a tough sell .
" there is no need to rush it , " blair said sunday , kicking off what he conceded would be a " tough battle " for the constitution .

a survey released over the weekend by pollster yougov for the sunday times newspaper found 49 percent of brits were against ratifying the constitution and only 23 percent supported it .

until recently , the work of charlotte salomon was little known in germany .
after her death at auschwitz in 1943 , her work quietly disappeared into obscurity .
in two short years , the jewish artist , born in berlin in 1917 , created an astonishing 1,325 paintings documenting her dramatic life during a stay in southern france before her capture , deportation and murder by the nazis .
sixty years later , the painter 's work , which is roughly analogous to the art-world version of the diary of anne frank , is being shown in a major retrospective in frankfurt .
the museum is seeking not only to tell salomon 's story , but also to build the reputation of someone it considers to be one of the last century 's important artists .

a painterly anne frank städel museum , frankfurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte salomon , leben ?
oder theater ?
until recently , the work of charlotte salomon was little known in germany .
after her death at auschwitz in 1943 , her work quietly disappeared into obscurity .
in two short years , the jewish artist , born in berlin in 1917 , created an astonishing 1,325 paintings documenting her dramatic life during a stay in southern france before her capture , deportation and murder by the nazis .
sixty years later , the painter 's work , which is roughly analogous to the art-world version of the diary of anne frank , is being shown in a major retrospective in frankfurt .
the museum is seeking not only to tell salomon 's story , but also to build the reputation of someone it considers to be one of the last century 's important artists .
the exhibition includes salomon 's paintings , gouaches , writings and music .
" charlotte salomon : life ?
or theater ? " runs through august 22 .
it is open tuesday and friday through sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

until recently , the work of charlotte salomon was little known in germany .
after her death at auschwitz in 1943 , her work quietly disappeared into obscurity .
in two short years , the jewish artist , born in berlin in 1917 , created an astonishing 1,325 paintings documenting her dramatic life during a stay in southern france before her capture , deportation and murder by the nazis .
sixty years later , the painter 's work , which is roughly analogous to the art-world version of the diary of anne frank , is being shown in a major retrospective in frankfurt .
the museum is seeking not only to tell salomon 's story , but also to build the reputation of someone it considers to be one of the last century 's important artists .

the capital has long been known as a center for germany 's homosexual community , as documented in the city 's gay museum . berlin 's gay museum is tucked away in the multicultural district of kreuzberg .
established in 1985 , the museum is a private institution dedicated to preserving , exhibiting , and discovering gay and lesbian history , art , and culture . although many organizations around the world collect historical material relevant to gay men and lesbians , the berlin museum is the only institution of its kind which is open full time and has a dedicated building with changing exhibitions open to the public . " we 're planning to open a permanent exhibit on gay history from 1800 - 1970 this december , " said gerrit horbacher , the musem 's spokesman .
" people are often confused when they come here and only see art exhibits .
they ask us where the history is , so that 's something we 'll have on show by the end of the year . " pioneer hirschfeld the museum 's extensive library includes a newspaper and magazine archive , which includes editions of the first gay magazine , " der eigene , " published in germany in 1896 .
" back then , the magazine was not really sold very openly .
instead there was a list of where to send them , and of places where people could buy them , " he said .
" in the 1920 's , it was a lot easier .
then you could find gay and lesbian magazines in kiosks alongside newspapers and mainstream magazines . " in 1897 in berlin , the publishers of " der eigene , " dr. magnus hirschfeld and adolf brand , went on to form the world ’ s first gay liberation movement .
the scientific humanitarian committee was a political group that lobbied the german parliament to abolish the law forbidding homosexuality known as " paragraph 175 , " which had been on the books since 1871 .
modified in 1969 and again in 1973 , the law was eventually abolished in 1994 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1907 german political cartoon depicting sex researcher magnus hirschfeld , " hero of the day , " drumming up support for the abolition of paragraph 175 of the german penal code that criminalized homosexuality .
hirschfeld was a social democrat , a jew and a medical doctor .
he gathered support for the gay cause from german intellectuals and liberal politicians of the time .
the gay museum includes many of his pioneering works . " in 1919 , hirschfeld founded the institute for sexual science , with which he aimed to make people conscious of their sexuality and allow people to live their sexual lives as they wanted , not just according to rules that were dictated by society , " horbacher said .
" he also conducted many surveys on homosexuality , and developed his theory of ‘ the third sex , ' as he called homosexuals . " the golden 1920 's the founding of hirschfeld 's institute coincided with the suffragette movement , shorter skirts , cropped hair for women and the so-called flapper look .
differences between the sexes were being bridged , and gay culture in berlin flourished .
much of the gay nightlife was centered around nollendorfplatz in the schöneberg district of berlin , and still is today .
one of the most famous nightclubs in the 1920 's was the eldorado , which featured a number of transvestite performers . " we 've got coins from the eldorado , which customers used to buy there .
on one side , they show either a gay or lesbian couple dancing together .
the customers would give the coins to one of the transvestites working there , to get a dance .
and at the end of the evening , the transvestites gathered all their coins , and were paid according to how many they 'd managed to collect , " horbacher explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich in " the blue angel " the eldorado also regularly featured then up-and-coming star marlene dietrich -lrb- photo -rrb- , who went on to achieve international fame .
dietrich had left germany by the 1930 's when the nazis came to power . after hitler 's regime took control , all gay and lesbian bars and meeting places in germany were closed .
magnus hirschfeld ’ s institute for sexual science was looted in 1933 by the nazis and his books were burned . " every gay person knew that the nazis did n't like homosexuals , and that they wanted to get rid of them , " horbacher said .
" they started to enforce paragraph 175 , so from 1935 on , it was punishable just to glance at someone of the same sex too intensively .
gay people lived in fear of being denounced by other people , and the police conducted raids , arrested gays , and sent them to concentration camps . " contemporary history while the museum contains much research material documenting the lives of homosexuals in past eras , it also concentrates resources on collecting material on important modern-day developments for gays in germany , such as the country 's new " registered partnership " law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male couple , just married " really , it 's just a kind of gay marriage , " horbacher said , " because there are n't equal rights like in a heterosexual marriage .
there are quite a few couples who are doing it .
in berlin , there are lots of gay marriages , and also the first divorces .
it 's quite normal here . " horbacher said that while the museum attracts many gays and lesbians from berlin and abroad , heterosexuals are also among the patrons .
" they see that there 's a gay museum , and think , ' let 's see what they 've got on display . "
it 's a fun thing for them .

the capital has long been known as a center for germany 's homosexual community , as documented in the city 's gay museum . berlin 's gay museum is tucked away in the multicultural district of kreuzberg .
established in 1985 , the museum is a private institution dedicated to preserving , exhibiting , and discovering gay and lesbian history , art , and culture . although many organizations around the world collect historical material relevant to gay men and lesbians , the berlin museum is the only institution of its kind which is open full time and has a dedicated building with changing exhibitions open to the public . " we 're planning to open a permanent exhibit on gay history from 1800 - 1970 this december , " said gerrit horbacher , the musem 's spokesman .
" people are often confused when they come here and only see art exhibits .
they ask us where the history is , so that 's something we 'll have on show by the end of the year . " pioneer hirschfeld the museum 's extensive library includes a newspaper and magazine archive , which includes editions of the first gay magazine , " der eigene , " published in germany in 1896 .
" back then , the magazine was not really sold very openly .
instead there was a list of where to send them , and of places where people could buy them , " he said .
" in the 1920 's , it was a lot easier .
then you could find gay and lesbian magazines in kiosks alongside newspapers and mainstream magazines . " in 1897 in berlin , the publishers of " der eigene , " dr. magnus hirschfeld and adolf brand , went on to form the world ’ s first gay liberation movement .
the scientific humanitarian committee was a political group that lobbied the german parliament to abolish the law forbidding homosexuality known as " paragraph 175 , " which had been on the books since 1871 .
modified in 1969 and again in 1973 , the law was eventually abolished in 1994 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1907 german political cartoon depicting sex researcher magnus hirschfeld , " hero of the day , " drumming up support for the abolition of paragraph 175 of the german penal code that criminalized homosexuality .
hirschfeld was a social democrat , a jew and a medical doctor .
he gathered support for the gay cause from german intellectuals and liberal politicians of the time .
the gay museum includes many of his pioneering works . " in 1919 , hirschfeld founded the institute for sexual science , with which he aimed to make people conscious of their sexuality and allow people to live their sexual lives as they wanted , not just according to rules that were dictated by society , " horbacher said .
" he also conducted many surveys on homosexuality , and developed his theory of ‘ the third sex , ' as he called homosexuals . " the golden 1920 's the founding of hirschfeld 's institute coincided with the suffragette movement , shorter skirts , cropped hair for women and the so-called flapper look .
differences between the sexes were being bridged , and gay culture in berlin flourished .
much of the gay nightlife was centered around nollendorfplatz in the schöneberg district of berlin , and still is today .
one of the most famous nightclubs in the 1920 's was the eldorado , which featured a number of transvestite performers . " we 've got coins from the eldorado , which customers used to buy there .
on one side , they show either a gay or lesbian couple dancing together .
the customers would give the coins to one of the transvestites working there , to get a dance .
and at the end of the evening , the transvestites gathered all their coins , and were paid according to how many they 'd managed to collect , " horbacher explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich in " the blue angel " the eldorado also regularly featured then up-and-coming star marlene dietrich -lrb- photo -rrb- , who went on to achieve international fame .
dietrich had left germany by the 1930 's when the nazis came to power . after hitler 's regime took control , all gay and lesbian bars and meeting places in germany were closed .
magnus hirschfeld ’ s institute for sexual science was looted in 1933 by the nazis and his books were burned . " every gay person knew that the nazis did n't like homosexuals , and that they wanted to get rid of them , " horbacher said .
" they started to enforce paragraph 175 , so from 1935 on , it was punishable just to glance at someone of the same sex too intensively .
gay people lived in fear of being denounced by other people , and the police conducted raids , arrested gays , and sent them to concentration camps . " contemporary history while the museum contains much research material documenting the lives of homosexuals in past eras , it also concentrates resources on collecting material on important modern-day developments for gays in germany , such as the country 's new " registered partnership " law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male couple , just married " really , it 's just a kind of gay marriage , " horbacher said , " because there are n't equal rights like in a heterosexual marriage .

the capital has long been known as a center for germany 's homosexual community , as documented in the city 's gay museum . berlin 's gay museum is tucked away in the multicultural district of kreuzberg .
established in 1985 , the museum is a private institution dedicated to preserving , exhibiting , and discovering gay and lesbian history , art , and culture . although many organizations around the world collect historical material relevant to gay men and lesbians , the berlin museum is the only institution of its kind which is open full time and has a dedicated building with changing exhibitions open to the public . " we 're planning to open a permanent exhibit on gay history from 1800 - 1970 this december , " said gerrit horbacher , the musem 's spokesman .
" people are often confused when they come here and only see art exhibits .
they ask us where the history is , so that 's something we 'll have on show by the end of the year . " pioneer hirschfeld the museum 's extensive library includes a newspaper and magazine archive , which includes editions of the first gay magazine , " der eigene , " published in germany in 1896 .
" back then , the magazine was not really sold very openly .
instead there was a list of where to send them , and of places where people could buy them , " he said .
" in the 1920 's , it was a lot easier .
then you could find gay and lesbian magazines in kiosks alongside newspapers and mainstream magazines . " in 1897 in berlin , the publishers of " der eigene , " dr. magnus hirschfeld and adolf brand , went on to form the world ’ s first gay liberation movement .
the scientific humanitarian committee was a political group that lobbied the german parliament to abolish the law forbidding homosexuality known as " paragraph 175 , " which had been on the books since 1871 .
modified in 1969 and again in 1973 , the law was eventually abolished in 1994 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1907 german political cartoon depicting sex researcher magnus hirschfeld , " hero of the day , " drumming up support for the abolition of paragraph 175 of the german penal code that criminalized homosexuality .
hirschfeld was a social democrat , a jew and a medical doctor .
he gathered support for the gay cause from german intellectuals and liberal politicians of the time .
the gay museum includes many of his pioneering works . " in 1919 , hirschfeld founded the institute for sexual science , with which he aimed to make people conscious of their sexuality and allow people to live their sexual lives as they wanted , not just according to rules that were dictated by society , " horbacher said .
" he also conducted many surveys on homosexuality , and developed his theory of ‘ the third sex , ' as he called homosexuals . " the golden 1920 's the founding of hirschfeld 's institute coincided with the suffragette movement , shorter skirts , cropped hair for women and the so-called flapper look .
differences between the sexes were being bridged , and gay culture in berlin flourished .
much of the gay nightlife was centered around nollendorfplatz in the schöneberg district of berlin , and still is today .
one of the most famous nightclubs in the 1920 's was the eldorado , which featured a number of transvestite performers . " we 've got coins from the eldorado , which customers used to buy there .
on one side , they show either a gay or lesbian couple dancing together .
the customers would give the coins to one of the transvestites working there , to get a dance .
and at the end of the evening , the transvestites gathered all their coins , and were paid according to how many they 'd managed to collect , " horbacher explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich in " the blue angel " the eldorado also regularly featured then up-and-coming star marlene dietrich -lrb- photo -rrb- , who went on to achieve international fame .
dietrich had left germany by the 1930 's when the nazis came to power . after hitler 's regime took control , all gay and lesbian bars and meeting places in germany were closed .
magnus hirschfeld ’ s institute for sexual science was looted in 1933 by the nazis and his books were burned . " every gay person knew that the nazis did n't like homosexuals , and that they wanted to get rid of them , " horbacher said .
" they started to enforce paragraph 175 , so from 1935 on , it was punishable just to glance at someone of the same sex too intensively .
gay people lived in fear of being denounced by other people , and the police conducted raids , arrested gays , and sent them to concentration camps . " contemporary history while the museum contains much research material documenting the lives of homosexuals in past eras , it also concentrates resources on collecting material on important modern-day developments for gays in germany , such as the country 's new " registered partnership " law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male couple , just married " really , it 's just a kind of gay marriage , " horbacher said , " because there are n't equal rights like in a heterosexual marriage .
there are quite a few couples who are doing it .
in berlin , there are lots of gay marriages , and also the first divorces .
it 's quite normal here . " horbacher said that while the museum attracts many gays and lesbians from berlin and abroad , heterosexuals are also among the patrons .
" they see that there 's a gay museum , and think , ' let 's see what they 've got on display . "
it 's a fun thing for them .
at least they 're open to coming in , and that 's our aim - not only to have gay and lesbian visitors , but also to be of interest to heterosexuals .

the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are caught between implementing reforms that economists say are necessary if the country wants to compete in the global marketplace and staying true to its fundamental values of protecting the welfare state and looking out for the interests of working people . the strategy session of the spd 's executive committee seeks to draw a course out of the wilderness the party has been stumbling through for the past 18 months .
it is also trying to quell a revolt in the party 's left wing , which is demanding a radical policy course correction . " we must keep to the current course , " rhineland-palatinate 's premier kurt beck told reporters before going into the closed-door meeting .
he called on the party to close ranks and not let the election defeats split the party in two . in last week 's european elections , the spd lost around 2.8 million voters that supported the party five years earlier and its numbers slumped to 21.5 percent .
that defeat was but a continuation of a disastrous series of electoral defeats the party has suffered over the past year and a half , as voters turn away from the traditional party of the working class .
they are angered and alienated by schröder 's unpopular reforms that are meant to provide a kick-start to the german economy , which has been stagnant for three years . analysts say those reforms , which include new fees for doctors visits , cuts to some social benefits and a loosening of labor market rules that protect workers ' jobs , have unnerved the spd base , who see the party embarking on a course of social darwinism . but abandoning schröder 's reforms , which go under the name agenda 2010 , does not appear to be on the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering spd party head franz müntefering , heading a chorus of party leaders , said after consultations with other party leaders on monday there will be no " u-turn " on the reforms . " we have to get our country 's affairs in order with reforms , " said the spd 's deputy parliamentary group leader ludwig stiegler .
berlin 's spd mayor klaus wowereit told reporters before the meeting there was no alternative to agenda 2010 . they are largely echoing the words of chancellor gerhard schröder , who has repeatedly said he will not fundamentally change the course he has set the country on .
over the weekend , he told spd leaders he would rather resign than water down his reform program . new pr offensive ? while many party leaders are lining up behind schröder 's stay-the-course stance , calls have been going out to the executive to put a new spin on the reforms , putting the focus on social justice instead of on the dismantling of the welfare state . they appear to have been heard .
müntefering said on monday there would be new " accentuations " that would make it clear to the public that the reforms are being put in place " for everyone . " " we have to stop this idea that the reform course means doom , " björn böhning , head of the spd 's youth group , told german public television zdf .
he said the government 's zig-zag course and implementation did not make it easier for the electorate to understand what the goals were . " it must be clear to voters what these reforms are for , " michael müller , head of the berlin spd , told zdf on monday .
he said the party should make it clear , for example , that money saved by the reforms would be reinvested in education , a fact that would be received positively by voters . left-wing demands but according to trade unions and other members of the party 's left wing , the spd has already forgotten its roots .
they are repeating demands for a radical course change and a return to traditional social democratic positions . according to heiko maas , spd head in the state of saarland , the only way the current spd government has a chance to win elections again is to recover the " socially just label . " germany 's trade unions warned of a " vehement disagreements " about the party 's future course , saying they and the government need to come to agreement about the reforms and present it to the public .
ursula engelen-kefer , deputy head of the german trade union federation said that while the unions can live with some parts of the current reform plan , other aspects were unacceptable .

the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are caught between implementing reforms that economists say are necessary if the country wants to compete in the global marketplace and staying true to its fundamental values of protecting the welfare state and looking out for the interests of working people . the strategy session of the spd 's executive committee seeks to draw a course out of the wilderness the party has been stumbling through for the past 18 months .
it is also trying to quell a revolt in the party 's left wing , which is demanding a radical policy course correction . " we must keep to the current course , " rhineland-palatinate 's premier kurt beck told reporters before going into the closed-door meeting .
he called on the party to close ranks and not let the election defeats split the party in two . in last week 's european elections , the spd lost around 2.8 million voters that supported the party five years earlier and its numbers slumped to 21.5 percent .

berlin 's spd mayor klaus wowereit told reporters before the meeting there was no alternative to agenda 2010 . they are largely echoing the words of chancellor gerhard schröder , who has repeatedly said he will not fundamentally change the course he has set the country on .

the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are caught between implementing reforms that economists say are necessary if the country wants to compete in the global marketplace and staying true to its fundamental values of protecting the welfare state and looking out for the interests of working people . the strategy session of the spd 's executive committee seeks to draw a course out of the wilderness the party has been stumbling through for the past 18 months .
it is also trying to quell a revolt in the party 's left wing , which is demanding a radical policy course correction . " we must keep to the current course , " rhineland-palatinate 's premier kurt beck told reporters before going into the closed-door meeting .
he called on the party to close ranks and not let the election defeats split the party in two . in last week 's european elections , the spd lost around 2.8 million voters that supported the party five years earlier and its numbers slumped to 21.5 percent .
that defeat was but a continuation of a disastrous series of electoral defeats the party has suffered over the past year and a half , as voters turn away from the traditional party of the working class .
they are angered and alienated by schröder 's unpopular reforms that are meant to provide a kick-start to the german economy , which has been stagnant for three years . analysts say those reforms , which include new fees for doctors visits , cuts to some social benefits and a loosening of labor market rules that protect workers ' jobs , have unnerved the spd base , who see the party embarking on a course of social darwinism . but abandoning schröder 's reforms , which go under the name agenda 2010 , does not appear to be on the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering spd party head franz müntefering , heading a chorus of party leaders , said after consultations with other party leaders on monday there will be no " u-turn " on the reforms . " we have to get our country 's affairs in order with reforms , " said the spd 's deputy parliamentary group leader ludwig stiegler .
berlin 's spd mayor klaus wowereit told reporters before the meeting there was no alternative to agenda 2010 . they are largely echoing the words of chancellor gerhard schröder , who has repeatedly said he will not fundamentally change the course he has set the country on .
over the weekend , he told spd leaders he would rather resign than water down his reform program . new pr offensive ? while many party leaders are lining up behind schröder 's stay-the-course stance , calls have been going out to the executive to put a new spin on the reforms , putting the focus on social justice instead of on the dismantling of the welfare state . they appear to have been heard .
müntefering said on monday there would be new " accentuations " that would make it clear to the public that the reforms are being put in place " for everyone . " " we have to stop this idea that the reform course means doom , " björn böhning , head of the spd 's youth group , told german public television zdf .
he said the government 's zig-zag course and implementation did not make it easier for the electorate to understand what the goals were . " it must be clear to voters what these reforms are for , " michael müller , head of the berlin spd , told zdf on monday .
he said the party should make it clear , for example , that money saved by the reforms would be reinvested in education , a fact that would be received positively by voters . left-wing demands but according to trade unions and other members of the party 's left wing , the spd has already forgotten its roots .
they are repeating demands for a radical course change and a return to traditional social democratic positions . according to heiko maas , spd head in the state of saarland , the only way the current spd government has a chance to win elections again is to recover the " socially just label . " germany 's trade unions warned of a " vehement disagreements " about the party 's future course , saying they and the government need to come to agreement about the reforms and present it to the public .
ursula engelen-kefer , deputy head of the german trade union federation said that while the unions can live with some parts of the current reform plan , other aspects were unacceptable .

find out what made the cut and what wound up on the editing floor . what does it do ?
the core of the constitution contains 50 articles describing the duties and responsibilities of the european union .
it also describes the european institutions , including new ones , and defines their authority .
it details how budgets and decision-making in the european union should be done , also setting into stone the new double majority principle for most major legislation .
voting the number of eu policy areas requiring the double majority vote is vastly expanded in the constitution .
however , it does not include a number of issues relating to internal security , foreign policy , budget , tax or economic policy - powers that many european member states wanted to retain in their national capitals .
in many areas that can be determined by double majority votes , the constitution builds in so-called " emergency breaks " that allow countries to impose a one-month veto in order to delay legislation .
in many areas , long grace or transition periods have been built in so countries can adjust from the current requirement of unanimous votes to the new double majority system .
rights the constitution also incorporates the european union 's charter of rights , which describes the rights and freedoms of every citizen of europe .
constitutional court it stipulates that lawsuits based on questions of the constitution must be taken up with the european court of justice in luxembourg .
president , foreign minister significantly , the constitution replaces the current presidency of the european council , which is held on a six-month rotating basis by each member state , with a president who serves a two-and-a-half year term at the helm of the council , stewarding its work and managing its agenda .
the constitution also establishes the office of an eu foreign minister , a position intended to increase the eu 's status abroad as well as to coordinate foreign policy among the eu member states .
streamlined democracy in an effort to streamline brussels bureaucracy , the constitution also reduces the number of commissioners on the european commission from 25 to 18 starting in 2014 .
the constitution also increases the powers of the democratically elected european parliament - giving it equal power as the european council to vote on budgets .
parliament will also have greater influence on the appointment of top eu offices , including the european commission president .
it will also have voting power in almost all policy areas .
secession the constitution also , for the first time , provides regulation for the voluntary secession of a member state .
what is different from earlier drafts or did n't make it into the constitution ?
in the future , decisions in the council of ministers will be made using the double majority principle : a qualified majority has been reached when 55 percent of the european union member states agree on legislation representing 65 percent of the entire eu population .
in order to stop legislation , a blocking minority of at least four countries is required .
until 2014 , each eu member country will be allowed to send a commissioner to the european commission .
after that , two-thirds of member states will be entitled to a commission seat on a rotating basis .
the number of members of the european parliament will be limited to 750 , though smaller member states will have a minimum of six seats and larger members no more than 99 seats in the european parliament .
the ministers reached an agreement on the stability and growth pact , the accord that guarantees the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro .
currently , the european commission has the direct power to take legal action against member states who violate the 3 percent deficit spending cap set in the pact .
in the future , the commission can recommend that action be taken , but such action requires the approval of a qualified majority of eu countries representing three-fifths of the eu 's population in the council of ministers .
there will be no direct reference to god in the constitution .
instead , the countries have agreed to a general reference to europe 's religious and cultural traditions .

in order to stop legislation , a blocking minority of at least four countries is required .
until 2014 , each eu member country will be allowed to send a commissioner to the european commission .

find out what made the cut and what wound up on the editing floor . what does it do ?
the core of the constitution contains 50 articles describing the duties and responsibilities of the european union .
it also describes the european institutions , including new ones , and defines their authority .
it details how budgets and decision-making in the european union should be done , also setting into stone the new double majority principle for most major legislation .
voting the number of eu policy areas requiring the double majority vote is vastly expanded in the constitution .
however , it does not include a number of issues relating to internal security , foreign policy , budget , tax or economic policy - powers that many european member states wanted to retain in their national capitals .
in many areas that can be determined by double majority votes , the constitution builds in so-called " emergency breaks " that allow countries to impose a one-month veto in order to delay legislation .
in many areas , long grace or transition periods have been built in so countries can adjust from the current requirement of unanimous votes to the new double majority system .
rights the constitution also incorporates the european union 's charter of rights , which describes the rights and freedoms of every citizen of europe .
constitutional court it stipulates that lawsuits based on questions of the constitution must be taken up with the european court of justice in luxembourg .
president , foreign minister significantly , the constitution replaces the current presidency of the european council , which is held on a six-month rotating basis by each member state , with a president who serves a two-and-a-half year term at the helm of the council , stewarding its work and managing its agenda .
the constitution also establishes the office of an eu foreign minister , a position intended to increase the eu 's status abroad as well as to coordinate foreign policy among the eu member states .
streamlined democracy in an effort to streamline brussels bureaucracy , the constitution also reduces the number of commissioners on the european commission from 25 to 18 starting in 2014 .
the constitution also increases the powers of the democratically elected european parliament - giving it equal power as the european council to vote on budgets .
parliament will also have greater influence on the appointment of top eu offices , including the european commission president .
it will also have voting power in almost all policy areas .
secession the constitution also , for the first time , provides regulation for the voluntary secession of a member state .
what is different from earlier drafts or did n't make it into the constitution ?
in the future , decisions in the council of ministers will be made using the double majority principle : a qualified majority has been reached when 55 percent of the european union member states agree on legislation representing 65 percent of the entire eu population .
in order to stop legislation , a blocking minority of at least four countries is required .
until 2014 , each eu member country will be allowed to send a commissioner to the european commission .
after that , two-thirds of member states will be entitled to a commission seat on a rotating basis .
the number of members of the european parliament will be limited to 750 , though smaller member states will have a minimum of six seats and larger members no more than 99 seats in the european parliament .
the ministers reached an agreement on the stability and growth pact , the accord that guarantees the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro .
currently , the european commission has the direct power to take legal action against member states who violate the 3 percent deficit spending cap set in the pact .
in the future , the commission can recommend that action be taken , but such action requires the approval of a qualified majority of eu countries representing three-fifths of the eu 's population in the council of ministers .
there will be no direct reference to god in the constitution .
instead , the countries have agreed to a general reference to europe 's religious and cultural traditions .

europe 's first and oldest porcelain manufacturer in the eastern german city of meissen cultivates the tried and true craft of handmade ceramics , without compromise .
meissen porcelain is the stuff of legend .
the factory was founded in 1710 , and by the mid 1700s , meissen porcelain adorned royal palaces and aristocratic homes across the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of a collection of fürstenberg porcellain owned by duchess anna amalia of weimar though meissen dominated the industry , seven major german factories were also established during the 1700s , all of which enjoyed princely patronage .
one of these was the fürstenberg porcelain manufactory , founded in 1747 .
today , though , the company is at an all-time low .
" our porcelain is a luxury product , and there 's just not much demand for luxury products in germany now , given the current economic situation , " said fürstenberg 's business administration manager , stephanie saalfeld . tough economic times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturing porcelain at kpm in berlin over the past several years , fürstenberg has had to continually let staff go .

in 2003 , the company was just barely turning a profit .
it cut 100 jobs , and an additional 60 are also threatened .
in august of last year , all departments implemented reduced working hours . searching for a way to stop the decline , some porcelain manufacturers have turned to more streamlined , mechanized production techniques , which make products more affordable .
" fürstenberg is operating to a larger extent with mass-production , " wrote the cologne-based consulting firm bbe in its 2003 report for the glass , porcelain and ceramics industry .
" the larger porcelain manufacturers have integrated much of what was done by hand into their machine-operated processes . " but mass-production is something the 900 porcelain artists working at meissen would n't even dream of doing .

" then there 'll be a flood of high-quality , cheap porcelain from china on the market .
without a strong brand-name strategy , german products will be pushed out of the market , " kastl said . " the middle price segment is destined to disappear .
there 'll be only cheap products , and really expensive products , " predicted professor gert gutjahr from the institute for market psychology in mannheim .

one of these was the fürstenberg porcelain manufactory , founded in 1747 .

in 2003 , the company was just barely turning a profit .
it cut 100 jobs , and an additional 60 are also threatened .
in august of last year , all departments implemented reduced working hours . searching for a way to stop the decline , some porcelain manufacturers have turned to more streamlined , mechanized production techniques , which make products more affordable .
" fürstenberg is operating to a larger extent with mass-production , " wrote the cologne-based consulting firm bbe in its 2003 report for the glass , porcelain and ceramics industry .
" the larger porcelain manufacturers have integrated much of what was done by hand into their machine-operated processes . " but mass-production is something the 900 porcelain artists working at meissen would n't even dream of doing .

" all neighbors are called on to do this , become no one can be interested in an arab civil war , " he said .
this is the first visit of a german foreign minister to the united arab emirates .
in the capital abu dhabi , fischer called for a gradual and sweeping modernization of the arab world , although he said that had to be driven internally .
if outside forces were seen as forcing change , it would fail , he said .
fischer also held talks with emirati crown prince sheikh khalifa bin zayed al-nahyan about boosting economic ties , according to the official wam news agency .
fischer , who was also scheduled to visit neighbouring dubai , was to hold talks in oman on tuesday before flying back to berlin . more briefs 21.06.2004 -pipe- crippling bureaucracy but great beer 21.06.2004 -pipe- schily to ban demonstrations by right-wing extremists 21.06.2004 -pipe- german greens give nod to immigration compromise 18.06.2004 -pipe- poll : schröder should stay in office 18.06.2004 -pipe- conservatives call for referendum on god , eu constitution 18.06.2004 -pipe- new law allows air force to down hijacked jets 18.06.2004 -pipe- political donations scandal engulfs third victim 18.06.2004 -pipe- bundestag passes stringent law on genetically modified crops radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.06.2004 constitution faces easy ratification in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder can safely assume parliament will approve the charter though the new european union constitution faces a bloodbath battle in a handful of european countries , here in germany , it is expected to easily sail through parliament , where it will be given its final blessing . media commentators in germany have been looking askance at the new eu charter .
they doubt that the document will find all-out support among the populations in other eu countries .
but senior politicians across the board have welcomed the agreement .
german chancellor gerhard schröder described the new constitution as a tough bargain to sell , but only as far as convincing his fellow eu leaders was concerned .
" this is a historic decision , " schröder said , " which wasn ’ t easy to reach .
we have overcome a major obstacle on the path of a truly united europe by making the european union more viable . "
' a good day for europe ' schröder ’ s view has been echoed by virtually all german politicians , not only from the ruling social democrats , but also the opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats .
even schröder ’ s fiercest domestic rival , christian democratic union leader angela merkel , praised the compromise reached in brussels as an important step for the 25-nation bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel " this was a good day for europe , " merkel said .
" now the european union has completed its founding charter as a basis on which a fully united union can develop . "
merkel and the conservative party she leads had previously criticized the chancellor for allegedly seeking to split the european union by pushing his strategy of a core europe together with the french president jacques chirac .
the leaders of germany ’ s christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , also accused schröder of " selling out " germany 's interests to brussels .
but this weekend , the party 's leader said he was content with the final draft .
" the deal is much better than what we have at the moment , said edmund stoiber , premier of the state of bavaria .
" most importantly , it prevents attempts by brussels to dominate national politics . "
no god , no good the biggest criticism over the weekend came from german catholic clerics and politicians with strong religious affiliations .
they complained that the new constitution does not mention the bloc ’ s christian heritage as an underlying principle for the union .
" like many others in germany , i very much regret that , " said erwin teufel , the conservative premier in the state of baden-württemberg .
" it ’ s a shame that the german chancellor prevented an initiative by more than a dozen eu member states who also wanted to see christianity mentioned in the text . "
the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- also welcomed the new constitution .
however , the party 's leaders criticized the fact that , unlike the people of britain or denmark , the german population won ’ t have the chance to approve the document in a referendum .
last week , an overwhelming majority of lawmakers in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , voted down a resolution by the fdp for a plebiscite .
most expect the new eu charter to sail through parliament without any major disputes . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ratifying eu constitution will be a ' tough battle ' european union leaders agreed on friday to the final text of europe 's first ever constitution , but now comes the hard part : selling it to the people .

they doubt that the document will find all-out support among the populations in other eu countries .
but senior politicians across the board have welcomed the agreement .
german chancellor gerhard schröder described the new constitution as a tough bargain to sell , but only as far as convincing his fellow eu leaders was concerned .
" this is a historic decision , " schröder said , " which wasn ’ t easy to reach .
we have overcome a major obstacle on the path of a truly united europe by making the european union more viable . "
' a good day for europe ' schröder ’ s view has been echoed by virtually all german politicians , not only from the ruling social democrats , but also the opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats .
even schröder ’ s fiercest domestic rival , christian democratic union leader angela merkel , praised the compromise reached in brussels as an important step for the 25-nation bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel " this was a good day for europe , " merkel said .
" now the european union has completed its founding charter as a basis on which a fully united union can develop . "
merkel and the conservative party she leads had previously criticized the chancellor for allegedly seeking to split the european union by pushing his strategy of a core europe together with the french president jacques chirac .
the leaders of germany ’ s christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , also accused schröder of " selling out " germany 's interests to brussels .
but this weekend , the party 's leader said he was content with the final draft .
" the deal is much better than what we have at the moment , said edmund stoiber , premier of the state of bavaria .
" most importantly , it prevents attempts by brussels to dominate national politics . "
no god , no good the biggest criticism over the weekend came from german catholic clerics and politicians with strong religious affiliations .
they complained that the new constitution does not mention the bloc ’ s christian heritage as an underlying principle for the union .
" like many others in germany , i very much regret that , " said erwin teufel , the conservative premier in the state of baden-württemberg .
" it ’ s a shame that the german chancellor prevented an initiative by more than a dozen eu member states who also wanted to see christianity mentioned in the text . "
the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- also welcomed the new constitution .
however , the party 's leaders criticized the fact that , unlike the people of britain or denmark , the german population won ’ t have the chance to approve the document in a referendum .
last week , an overwhelming majority of lawmakers in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , voted down a resolution by the fdp for a plebiscite .
most expect the new eu charter to sail through parliament without any major disputes . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ratifying eu constitution will be a ' tough battle ' european union leaders agreed on friday to the final text of europe 's first ever constitution , but now comes the hard part : selling it to the people .

it foresees a new debt of € 22 billion and focuses on privatization to bolster state coffers . eichel 's draft budget for 2005 , which will be submitted to cabinet for approval on wednesday , falls short of € 22 billion -lrb- $ 26.5 billion -rrb- - a deficit that 's down by around a half on the current year . eichel plans to further slash the deficit to € 19.5 billion by 2008 . according to the draft , germany 's budgetary spending for next year will total € 258.3 billion , an increase of 0.4 percent despite a general belt-tightening . eichel also hopes the draft budget will keep spending within the budget deficit cap of 3 percent of gdp set down in the eu 's growth and stability pact which underpins the euro . germany risks having to pay a huge fine to the european commission under the terms of the pact if it exceeds the 3 percent ceiling for the third straight year in 2005 . sale of government assets one of the most controversial provisions of the draft budget includes selling off a large chunk of government assets in order to bring the budget in line with the constitution . the german constitution lays down that new deficits can not exceed the amount of investments , which are expected to amount to € 22.8 billion in 2005 . to fulfill constitutional requirements , eichel is banking on privatizations to bring in a record € 15.45 billion that would help to plug a budgetary gap of € 18 billion . the € 15.4 billion corresponds to about three-fourths of the current stock market price of the german government 's shares in deutsche post and deutsche telekom . the finance minister has defended the controversial measure by pointing to the government 's refusal to raise taxes or implement new saving measures in the face of sluggish economic recovery .
it still remains unclear whether the planned privatizations include government stakes that will be sold in the current year . " budget plan of a gambler " but germany 's conservative opposition has criticized the draft budget for 2005 , in particular the sale of government assets at prices , they say , the market wo n't pay . " this budgetary nonsense has nothing to do with solid planning , " said dietrich austermann , budgetary expert of the opposition christian democrats .
austermann pointed out that it was speculative to talk of such high privatization proceeds in the face of low share prices . " this is the budget plan of a gambler .
spending is to be increased , no savings are being made .
the planned income is based mainly on speculative figures .
state investment is at a record low , and that will make itself felt in the labor market and the number of jobs , " he said . " selling the family silver " the draft budget also foresees reducing funds for almost all government ministries in 2005 . the transport ministry , for example , will have fewer funds to maintain and extend roads and to modernize germany 's railway system . similarly , the defense ministry will face substantial cuts - probably to the tune of some € 300 million , thus dampening defense minister peter struck 's plans to restructure and modernize the armed forces . criticism of the draft budget has also come from the greens , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .
franziska eichstätt-bohlig , the party 's financial expert , called the draft budget " very problematic . " referring to the planned high privatization proceeds , eichstätt-bohlig said , " that 's not a permanent stablization of the budget situation .
one can sell off the family silver only once .

it foresees a new debt of € 22 billion and focuses on privatization to bolster state coffers . eichel 's draft budget for 2005 , which will be submitted to cabinet for approval on wednesday , falls short of € 22 billion -lrb- $ 26.5 billion -rrb- - a deficit that 's down by around a half on the current year . eichel plans to further slash the deficit to € 19.5 billion by 2008 . according to the draft , germany 's budgetary spending for next year will total € 258.3 billion , an increase of 0.4 percent despite a general belt-tightening . eichel also hopes the draft budget will keep spending within the budget deficit cap of 3 percent of gdp set down in the eu 's growth and stability pact which underpins the euro . germany risks having to pay a huge fine to the european commission under the terms of the pact if it exceeds the 3 percent ceiling for the third straight year in 2005 . sale of government assets one of the most controversial provisions of the draft budget includes selling off a large chunk of government assets in order to bring the budget in line with the constitution . the german constitution lays down that new deficits can not exceed the amount of investments , which are expected to amount to € 22.8 billion in 2005 . to fulfill constitutional requirements , eichel is banking on privatizations to bring in a record € 15.45 billion that would help to plug a budgetary gap of € 18 billion . the € 15.4 billion corresponds to about three-fourths of the current stock market price of the german government 's shares in deutsche post and deutsche telekom . the finance minister has defended the controversial measure by pointing to the government 's refusal to raise taxes or implement new saving measures in the face of sluggish economic recovery .
it still remains unclear whether the planned privatizations include government stakes that will be sold in the current year . " budget plan of a gambler " but germany 's conservative opposition has criticized the draft budget for 2005 , in particular the sale of government assets at prices , they say , the market wo n't pay . " this budgetary nonsense has nothing to do with solid planning , " said dietrich austermann , budgetary expert of the opposition christian democrats .
austermann pointed out that it was speculative to talk of such high privatization proceeds in the face of low share prices . " this is the budget plan of a gambler .
spending is to be increased , no savings are being made .
the planned income is based mainly on speculative figures .
state investment is at a record low , and that will make itself felt in the labor market and the number of jobs , " he said . " selling the family silver " the draft budget also foresees reducing funds for almost all government ministries in 2005 . the transport ministry , for example , will have fewer funds to maintain and extend roads and to modernize germany 's railway system . similarly , the defense ministry will face substantial cuts - probably to the tune of some € 300 million , thus dampening defense minister peter struck 's plans to restructure and modernize the armed forces . criticism of the draft budget has also come from the greens , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .
franziska eichstätt-bohlig , the party 's financial expert , called the draft budget " very problematic . " referring to the planned high privatization proceeds , eichstätt-bohlig said , " that 's not a permanent stablization of the budget situation .

it foresees a new debt of € 22 billion and focuses on privatization to bolster state coffers . eichel 's draft budget for 2005 , which will be submitted to cabinet for approval on wednesday , falls short of € 22 billion -lrb- $ 26.5 billion -rrb- - a deficit that 's down by around a half on the current year . eichel plans to further slash the deficit to € 19.5 billion by 2008 . according to the draft , germany 's budgetary spending for next year will total € 258.3 billion , an increase of 0.4 percent despite a general belt-tightening . eichel also hopes the draft budget will keep spending within the budget deficit cap of 3 percent of gdp set down in the eu 's growth and stability pact which underpins the euro . germany risks having to pay a huge fine to the european commission under the terms of the pact if it exceeds the 3 percent ceiling for the third straight year in 2005 . sale of government assets one of the most controversial provisions of the draft budget includes selling off a large chunk of government assets in order to bring the budget in line with the constitution . the german constitution lays down that new deficits can not exceed the amount of investments , which are expected to amount to € 22.8 billion in 2005 . to fulfill constitutional requirements , eichel is banking on privatizations to bring in a record € 15.45 billion that would help to plug a budgetary gap of € 18 billion . the € 15.4 billion corresponds to about three-fourths of the current stock market price of the german government 's shares in deutsche post and deutsche telekom . the finance minister has defended the controversial measure by pointing to the government 's refusal to raise taxes or implement new saving measures in the face of sluggish economic recovery .
it still remains unclear whether the planned privatizations include government stakes that will be sold in the current year . " budget plan of a gambler " but germany 's conservative opposition has criticized the draft budget for 2005 , in particular the sale of government assets at prices , they say , the market wo n't pay . " this budgetary nonsense has nothing to do with solid planning , " said dietrich austermann , budgetary expert of the opposition christian democrats .
austermann pointed out that it was speculative to talk of such high privatization proceeds in the face of low share prices . " this is the budget plan of a gambler .
spending is to be increased , no savings are being made .
the planned income is based mainly on speculative figures .
state investment is at a record low , and that will make itself felt in the labor market and the number of jobs , " he said . " selling the family silver " the draft budget also foresees reducing funds for almost all government ministries in 2005 . the transport ministry , for example , will have fewer funds to maintain and extend roads and to modernize germany 's railway system . similarly , the defense ministry will face substantial cuts - probably to the tune of some € 300 million , thus dampening defense minister peter struck 's plans to restructure and modernize the armed forces . criticism of the draft budget has also come from the greens , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .
franziska eichstätt-bohlig , the party 's financial expert , called the draft budget " very problematic . " referring to the planned high privatization proceeds , eichstätt-bohlig said , " that 's not a permanent stablization of the budget situation .
one can sell off the family silver only once .

will british and danish voters reject it ? in order to become legally binding , europe 's new constitution has to be ratified by the parliaments in each of its 25 member states .
a handful of countries , including those with the most euroskeptical politicians , are planning national referendums that will put the final decision in the hands of voters .
and that could prove to be an even tougher fight than the arm-wrestling and compromises that finally resulted in a final draft in brussels on friday .
facing a difficult re-election campaign that could come as soon as next year , british prime minister tony blair is n't expected to hold a referendum anytime soon .
in fact , he could delay the referendum vote until as late as 2006 , but even that far off , it will still be a tough sell .
" there is no need to rush it , " blair said sunday , kicking off what he conceded would be a " tough battle " for the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair at an eu summit in brussels " this treaty gives us the chance to play a vital part in decision-making at the heart of the european union whilst it protects completely our right to set our taxes , run our foreign policy and defense and do the things that people want us to do , " blair said .
the prime minister said the battle would be between " reality " and " myth . "
the fact is , he said , " we have kept control of taxes , of our policy on immigration , of defense , of foreign policy . "
most brits against constitution but a quick review of the polls show that the majority of british citizens do not agree with 10 downing street .
a survey released over the weekend by pollster yougov for the sunday times newspaper found 49 percent of brits were against ratifying the constitution and only 23 percent supported it .
similar polls found greater dissatisfaction , with as many as 69 percent feeling the constitution would transfer too much power from london to brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk is about to enter european parliament as head of the uk independence party .
british euroskepticism , or the idea that brussels is transforming into a super state with little transparency , also pervaded this month 's european elections .
the anti-eu united kingdom independence party carried 16-percent of the vote , and it 's leader pledged to wreak havoc with the european parliament .
on sunday , the party 's leader , former talk show host robert kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- , compared blair to neville chamberlain , the former british prime minister who famously claimed to have secured " peace in our time " with nazi germany in 1938 , offering a preview of the nasty wrangling in store for the coming months .
" it 's appeasement , " he said .
" there 's tony , he 's waving a piece of paper saying , ' it 's okay , i 've only given a little bit of our sovereignty away . "
the fallout from the european election has been a public relations nightmare for blair , who has said withdrawing from the eu would be disastrous .
" at this moment in time , when europe is actually changing , when there 's growing support for britain 's position in europe , to get out of the european union or marginalize ourselves in decision-making would just be an extraordinary act of foolishness , " the prime minister said .
britain 's opposition conservative party , which fears the establishment of a european federal state in brussels , has called for an immediate referendum .
blair also faces eu skeptics within his own labor party ranks .
a splinter group of labor politicians has established an action group called " labor against a super state . "
other countries follow suit but britain is n't alone in calling for a referendum .
denmark and ireland have said they will hold referendums , and luxembourg , the netherlands , spain and italy are likely to follow suit .
passage in those countries is anything but certain : denmark rejected the maastricht treaty , paving the way for the euro , in 1992 and ireland vetoed the nice treaty , which forged the path to enlargement , in 2001 .
the treaties passed on second votes in both countries , but only after denmark was given " opt outs " from maastricht euro provisions and the eu pledged to ireland its military neutrality would be respected .
for its part , germany does not plan to hold a referendum .
though members of the opposition free democratic party as well as the green party have called for a popular vote , chancellor gerhard schröder has rejected the idea , saying that it , like all other treaties , should be ratified by germany 's parliament , the bundestag .
after the constitution is signed , a move that will likely happen later this year , it must be ratified by the parliaments of all 25 member states within two years .
experts say that if one country rejects the constitution , it may be modified , but if two or more reject it , its ratification would be highly unlikely .
in order to appease the more euroskeptical voices within the european union , like britain and denmark , the final constitution text preserves sensitive national veto rights on issues pertaining to defense , taxation and foreign policy .
the question now is whether those changes will go far enough to unite a european union that is divided by countries promoting more federalist policies in brussels - like germany and france - from those who want to preserve more sovereignty , like britain and denmark . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de constitution faces easy ratification in germany though the new european union constitution faces a bloodbath battle in a handful of european countries , here in germany , it is expected to easily sail through parliament , where it will be given its final blessing .

will british and danish voters reject it ? in order to become legally binding , europe 's new constitution has to be ratified by the parliaments in each of its 25 member states .
a handful of countries , including those with the most euroskeptical politicians , are planning national referendums that will put the final decision in the hands of voters .
and that could prove to be an even tougher fight than the arm-wrestling and compromises that finally resulted in a final draft in brussels on friday .
facing a difficult re-election campaign that could come as soon as next year , british prime minister tony blair is n't expected to hold a referendum anytime soon .
in fact , he could delay the referendum vote until as late as 2006 , but even that far off , it will still be a tough sell .
" there is no need to rush it , " blair said sunday , kicking off what he conceded would be a " tough battle " for the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair at an eu summit in brussels " this treaty gives us the chance to play a vital part in decision-making at the heart of the european union whilst it protects completely our right to set our taxes , run our foreign policy and defense and do the things that people want us to do , " blair said .
the prime minister said the battle would be between " reality " and " myth . "
the fact is , he said , " we have kept control of taxes , of our policy on immigration , of defense , of foreign policy . "
most brits against constitution but a quick review of the polls show that the majority of british citizens do not agree with 10 downing street .
a survey released over the weekend by pollster yougov for the sunday times newspaper found 49 percent of brits were against ratifying the constitution and only 23 percent supported it .
similar polls found greater dissatisfaction , with as many as 69 percent feeling the constitution would transfer too much power from london to brussels .

british euroskepticism , or the idea that brussels is transforming into a super state with little transparency , also pervaded this month 's european elections .
the anti-eu united kingdom independence party carried 16-percent of the vote , and it 's leader pledged to wreak havoc with the european parliament .
on sunday , the party 's leader , former talk show host robert kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- , compared blair to neville chamberlain , the former british prime minister who famously claimed to have secured " peace in our time " with nazi germany in 1938 , offering a preview of the nasty wrangling in store for the coming months .
" it 's appeasement , " he said .
" there 's tony , he 's waving a piece of paper saying , ' it 's okay , i 've only given a little bit of our sovereignty away . "
the fallout from the european election has been a public relations nightmare for blair , who has said withdrawing from the eu would be disastrous .
" at this moment in time , when europe is actually changing , when there 's growing support for britain 's position in europe , to get out of the european union or marginalize ourselves in decision-making would just be an extraordinary act of foolishness , " the prime minister said .
britain 's opposition conservative party , which fears the establishment of a european federal state in brussels , has called for an immediate referendum .
blair also faces eu skeptics within his own labor party ranks .
a splinter group of labor politicians has established an action group called " labor against a super state . "
other countries follow suit but britain is n't alone in calling for a referendum .
denmark and ireland have said they will hold referendums , and luxembourg , the netherlands , spain and italy are likely to follow suit .
passage in those countries is anything but certain : denmark rejected the maastricht treaty , paving the way for the euro , in 1992 and ireland vetoed the nice treaty , which forged the path to enlargement , in 2001 .
the treaties passed on second votes in both countries , but only after denmark was given " opt outs " from maastricht euro provisions and the eu pledged to ireland its military neutrality would be respected .
for its part , germany does not plan to hold a referendum .
though members of the opposition free democratic party as well as the green party have called for a popular vote , chancellor gerhard schröder has rejected the idea , saying that it , like all other treaties , should be ratified by germany 's parliament , the bundestag .
after the constitution is signed , a move that will likely happen later this year , it must be ratified by the parliaments of all 25 member states within two years .
experts say that if one country rejects the constitution , it may be modified , but if two or more reject it , its ratification would be highly unlikely .
in order to appease the more euroskeptical voices within the european union , like britain and denmark , the final constitution text preserves sensitive national veto rights on issues pertaining to defense , taxation and foreign policy .
the question now is whether those changes will go far enough to unite a european union that is divided by countries promoting more federalist policies in brussels - like germany and france - from those who want to preserve more sovereignty , like britain and denmark . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de constitution faces easy ratification in germany though the new european union constitution faces a bloodbath battle in a handful of european countries , here in germany , it is expected to easily sail through parliament , where it will be given its final blessing .

will british and danish voters reject it ? in order to become legally binding , europe 's new constitution has to be ratified by the parliaments in each of its 25 member states .
a handful of countries , including those with the most euroskeptical politicians , are planning national referendums that will put the final decision in the hands of voters .
and that could prove to be an even tougher fight than the arm-wrestling and compromises that finally resulted in a final draft in brussels on friday .
facing a difficult re-election campaign that could come as soon as next year , british prime minister tony blair is n't expected to hold a referendum anytime soon .
in fact , he could delay the referendum vote until as late as 2006 , but even that far off , it will still be a tough sell .
" there is no need to rush it , " blair said sunday , kicking off what he conceded would be a " tough battle " for the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair at an eu summit in brussels " this treaty gives us the chance to play a vital part in decision-making at the heart of the european union whilst it protects completely our right to set our taxes , run our foreign policy and defense and do the things that people want us to do , " blair said .
the prime minister said the battle would be between " reality " and " myth . "
the fact is , he said , " we have kept control of taxes , of our policy on immigration , of defense , of foreign policy . "
most brits against constitution but a quick review of the polls show that the majority of british citizens do not agree with 10 downing street .
a survey released over the weekend by pollster yougov for the sunday times newspaper found 49 percent of brits were against ratifying the constitution and only 23 percent supported it .
similar polls found greater dissatisfaction , with as many as 69 percent feeling the constitution would transfer too much power from london to brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk is about to enter european parliament as head of the uk independence party .
british euroskepticism , or the idea that brussels is transforming into a super state with little transparency , also pervaded this month 's european elections .
the anti-eu united kingdom independence party carried 16-percent of the vote , and it 's leader pledged to wreak havoc with the european parliament .
on sunday , the party 's leader , former talk show host robert kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- , compared blair to neville chamberlain , the former british prime minister who famously claimed to have secured " peace in our time " with nazi germany in 1938 , offering a preview of the nasty wrangling in store for the coming months .
" it 's appeasement , " he said .
" there 's tony , he 's waving a piece of paper saying , ' it 's okay , i 've only given a little bit of our sovereignty away . "
the fallout from the european election has been a public relations nightmare for blair , who has said withdrawing from the eu would be disastrous .
" at this moment in time , when europe is actually changing , when there 's growing support for britain 's position in europe , to get out of the european union or marginalize ourselves in decision-making would just be an extraordinary act of foolishness , " the prime minister said .
britain 's opposition conservative party , which fears the establishment of a european federal state in brussels , has called for an immediate referendum .
blair also faces eu skeptics within his own labor party ranks .
a splinter group of labor politicians has established an action group called " labor against a super state . "
other countries follow suit but britain is n't alone in calling for a referendum .
denmark and ireland have said they will hold referendums , and luxembourg , the netherlands , spain and italy are likely to follow suit .
passage in those countries is anything but certain : denmark rejected the maastricht treaty , paving the way for the euro , in 1992 and ireland vetoed the nice treaty , which forged the path to enlargement , in 2001 .
the treaties passed on second votes in both countries , but only after denmark was given " opt outs " from maastricht euro provisions and the eu pledged to ireland its military neutrality would be respected .
for its part , germany does not plan to hold a referendum .
though members of the opposition free democratic party as well as the green party have called for a popular vote , chancellor gerhard schröder has rejected the idea , saying that it , like all other treaties , should be ratified by germany 's parliament , the bundestag .
after the constitution is signed , a move that will likely happen later this year , it must be ratified by the parliaments of all 25 member states within two years .
experts say that if one country rejects the constitution , it may be modified , but if two or more reject it , its ratification would be highly unlikely .
in order to appease the more euroskeptical voices within the european union , like britain and denmark , the final constitution text preserves sensitive national veto rights on issues pertaining to defense , taxation and foreign policy .
the question now is whether those changes will go far enough to unite a european union that is divided by countries promoting more federalist policies in brussels - like germany and france - from those who want to preserve more sovereignty , like britain and denmark . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de constitution faces easy ratification in germany though the new european union constitution faces a bloodbath battle in a handful of european countries , here in germany , it is expected to easily sail through parliament , where it will be given its final blessing .

german news website spiegel online reported monday that schily wanted to prevent right-wing extremists from marching in front of holocaust memorials as well as hinder demonstrations of solidarity for terrorists .
in addition , the interior minister wants to outlaw right-wing protest marches at places that commemorate the persecution of the jews .

sixty years later , the painter 's work , which is roughly analogous to the art-world version of the diary of anne frank , is being shown in a major retrospective in frankfurt .

german news website spiegel online reported monday that schily wanted to prevent right-wing extremists from marching in front of holocaust memorials as well as hinder demonstrations of solidarity for terrorists .
in addition , the interior minister wants to outlaw right-wing protest marches at places that commemorate the persecution of the jews .
quoting from schily 's draft legislation , the website said that in future a gathering could be banned or limited if it " was organized at a place that clearly commemorated the victims of organized inhuman treatment and if the place was viewed as a national symbol for the persecution . "
the document further said that a further condition for a ban was " if the gathering is meant to endorse , deny or play down the inhuman treatment of the victims .

it foresees a new debt of € 22 billion and focuses on privatization to bolster state coffers . eichel 's draft budget for 2005 , which will be submitted to cabinet for approval on wednesday , falls short of € 22 billion -lrb- $ 26.5 billion -rrb- - a deficit that 's down by around a half on the current year . eichel plans to further slash the deficit to € 19.5 billion by 2008 . according to the draft , germany 's budgetary spending for next year will total € 258.3 billion , an increase of 0.4 percent despite a general belt-tightening . eichel also hopes the draft budget will keep spending within the budget deficit cap of 3 percent of gdp set down in the eu 's growth and stability pact which underpins the euro . germany risks having to pay a huge fine to the european commission under the terms of the pact if it exceeds the 3 percent ceiling for the third straight year in 2005 . sale of government assets one of the most controversial provisions of the draft budget includes selling off a large chunk of government assets in order to bring the budget in line with the constitution . the german constitution lays down that new deficits can not exceed the amount of investments , which are expected to amount to € 22.8 billion in 2005 . to fulfill constitutional requirements , eichel is banking on privatizations to bring in a record € 15.45 billion that would help to plug a budgetary gap of € 18 billion . the € 15.4 billion corresponds to about three-fourths of the current stock market price of the german government 's shares in deutsche post and deutsche telekom . the finance minister has defended the controversial measure by pointing to the government 's refusal to raise taxes or implement new saving measures in the face of sluggish economic recovery .
it still remains unclear whether the planned privatizations include government stakes that will be sold in the current year . " budget plan of a gambler " but germany 's conservative opposition has criticized the draft budget for 2005 , in particular the sale of government assets at prices , they say , the market wo n't pay . " this budgetary nonsense has nothing to do with solid planning , " said dietrich austermann , budgetary expert of the opposition christian democrats .
austermann pointed out that it was speculative to talk of such high privatization proceeds in the face of low share prices . " this is the budget plan of a gambler .
spending is to be increased , no savings are being made .
the planned income is based mainly on speculative figures .
state investment is at a record low , and that will make itself felt in the labor market and the number of jobs , " he said . " selling the family silver " the draft budget also foresees reducing funds for almost all government ministries in 2005 . the transport ministry , for example , will have fewer funds to maintain and extend roads and to modernize germany 's railway system . similarly , the defense ministry will face substantial cuts - probably to the tune of some € 300 million , thus dampening defense minister peter struck 's plans to restructure and modernize the armed forces . criticism of the draft budget has also come from the greens , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .
franziska eichstätt-bohlig , the party 's financial expert , called the draft budget " very problematic . " referring to the planned high privatization proceeds , eichstätt-bohlig said , " that 's not a permanent stablization of the budget situation .
one can sell off the family silver only once .

it foresees a new debt of € 22 billion and focuses on privatization to bolster state coffers . eichel 's draft budget for 2005 , which will be submitted to cabinet for approval on wednesday , falls short of € 22 billion -lrb- $ 26.5 billion -rrb- - a deficit that 's down by around a half on the current year . eichel plans to further slash the deficit to € 19.5 billion by 2008 . according to the draft , germany 's budgetary spending for next year will total € 258.3 billion , an increase of 0.4 percent despite a general belt-tightening . eichel also hopes the draft budget will keep spending within the budget deficit cap of 3 percent of gdp set down in the eu 's growth and stability pact which underpins the euro . germany risks having to pay a huge fine to the european commission under the terms of the pact if it exceeds the 3 percent ceiling for the third straight year in 2005 . sale of government assets one of the most controversial provisions of the draft budget includes selling off a large chunk of government assets in order to bring the budget in line with the constitution . the german constitution lays down that new deficits can not exceed the amount of investments , which are expected to amount to € 22.8 billion in 2005 . to fulfill constitutional requirements , eichel is banking on privatizations to bring in a record € 15.45 billion that would help to plug a budgetary gap of € 18 billion . the € 15.4 billion corresponds to about three-fourths of the current stock market price of the german government 's shares in deutsche post and deutsche telekom . the finance minister has defended the controversial measure by pointing to the government 's refusal to raise taxes or implement new saving measures in the face of sluggish economic recovery .

they doubt that the document will find all-out support among the populations in other eu countries .
but senior politicians across the board have welcomed the agreement .
german chancellor gerhard schröder described the new constitution as a tough bargain to sell , but only as far as convincing his fellow eu leaders was concerned .
" this is a historic decision , " schröder said , " which wasn ’ t easy to reach .
we have overcome a major obstacle on the path of a truly united europe by making the european union more viable . "
' a good day for europe ' schröder ’ s view has been echoed by virtually all german politicians , not only from the ruling social democrats , but also the opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats .
even schröder ’ s fiercest domestic rival , christian democratic union leader angela merkel , praised the compromise reached in brussels as an important step for the 25-nation bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel " this was a good day for europe , " merkel said .
" now the european union has completed its founding charter as a basis on which a fully united union can develop . "
merkel and the conservative party she leads had previously criticized the chancellor for allegedly seeking to split the european union by pushing his strategy of a core europe together with the french president jacques chirac .
the leaders of germany ’ s christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , also accused schröder of " selling out " germany 's interests to brussels .
but this weekend , the party 's leader said he was content with the final draft .
" the deal is much better than what we have at the moment , said edmund stoiber , premier of the state of bavaria .
" most importantly , it prevents attempts by brussels to dominate national politics . "
no god , no good the biggest criticism over the weekend came from german catholic clerics and politicians with strong religious affiliations .
they complained that the new constitution does not mention the bloc ’ s christian heritage as an underlying principle for the union .
" like many others in germany , i very much regret that , " said erwin teufel , the conservative premier in the state of baden-württemberg .
" it ’ s a shame that the german chancellor prevented an initiative by more than a dozen eu member states who also wanted to see christianity mentioned in the text . "
the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- also welcomed the new constitution .
however , the party 's leaders criticized the fact that , unlike the people of britain or denmark , the german population won ’ t have the chance to approve the document in a referendum .
last week , an overwhelming majority of lawmakers in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , voted down a resolution by the fdp for a plebiscite .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the rocky road to an eu constitution putting the constitution to the test eu parliament approves constitution all eu hopes on spain a referendum for germany after all ? europe -pipe- 21.06.2004 ratifying eu constitution will be a ' tough battle ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british euroskeptics do n't want blair to sign the eu constitution european union leaders agreed on friday to the final text of europe 's first ever constitution , but now comes the hard part : selling it to the people .
will british and danish voters reject it ? in order to become legally binding , europe 's new constitution has to be ratified by the parliaments in each of its 25 member states .
a handful of countries , including those with the most euroskeptical politicians , are planning national referendums that will put the final decision in the hands of voters .
and that could prove to be an even tougher fight than the arm-wrestling and compromises that finally resulted in a final draft in brussels on friday .
facing a difficult re-election campaign that could come as soon as next year , british prime minister tony blair is n't expected to hold a referendum anytime soon .
in fact , he could delay the referendum vote until as late as 2006 , but even that far off , it will still be a tough sell .
" there is no need to rush it , " blair said sunday , kicking off what he conceded would be a " tough battle " for the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair at an eu summit in brussels " this treaty gives us the chance to play a vital part in decision-making at the heart of the european union whilst it protects completely our right to set our taxes , run our foreign policy and defense and do the things that people want us to do , " blair said .
the prime minister said the battle would be between " reality " and " myth . "
the fact is , he said , " we have kept control of taxes , of our policy on immigration , of defense , of foreign policy . "
most brits against constitution but a quick review of the polls show that the majority of british citizens do not agree with 10 downing street .
a survey released over the weekend by pollster yougov for the sunday times newspaper found 49 percent of brits were against ratifying the constitution and only 23 percent supported it .
similar polls found greater dissatisfaction , with as many as 69 percent feeling the constitution would transfer too much power from london to brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk is about to enter european parliament as head of the uk independence party .
british euroskepticism , or the idea that brussels is transforming into a super state with little transparency , also pervaded this month 's european elections .
the anti-eu united kingdom independence party carried 16-percent of the vote , and it 's leader pledged to wreak havoc with the european parliament .
on sunday , the party 's leader , former talk show host robert kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- , compared blair to neville chamberlain , the former british prime minister who famously claimed to have secured " peace in our time " with nazi germany in 1938 , offering a preview of the nasty wrangling in store for the coming months .
" it 's appeasement , " he said .
" there 's tony , he 's waving a piece of paper saying , ' it 's okay , i 've only given a little bit of our sovereignty away . "
the fallout from the european election has been a public relations nightmare for blair , who has said withdrawing from the eu would be disastrous .
" at this moment in time , when europe is actually changing , when there 's growing support for britain 's position in europe , to get out of the european union or marginalize ourselves in decision-making would just be an extraordinary act of foolishness , " the prime minister said .
britain 's opposition conservative party , which fears the establishment of a european federal state in brussels , has called for an immediate referendum .
blair also faces eu skeptics within his own labor party ranks .
a splinter group of labor politicians has established an action group called " labor against a super state . "
other countries follow suit but britain is n't alone in calling for a referendum .
denmark and ireland have said they will hold referendums , and luxembourg , the netherlands , spain and italy are likely to follow suit .
passage in those countries is anything but certain : denmark rejected the maastricht treaty , paving the way for the euro , in 1992 and ireland vetoed the nice treaty , which forged the path to enlargement , in 2001 .
the treaties passed on second votes in both countries , but only after denmark was given " opt outs " from maastricht euro provisions and the eu pledged to ireland its military neutrality would be respected .
for its part , germany does not plan to hold a referendum .
though members of the opposition free democratic party as well as the green party have called for a popular vote , chancellor gerhard schröder has rejected the idea , saying that it , like all other treaties , should be ratified by germany 's parliament , the bundestag .
after the constitution is signed , a move that will likely happen later this year , it must be ratified by the parliaments of all 25 member states within two years .
experts say that if one country rejects the constitution , it may be modified , but if two or more reject it , its ratification would be highly unlikely .

will british and danish voters reject it ? in order to become legally binding , europe 's new constitution has to be ratified by the parliaments in each of its 25 member states .
a handful of countries , including those with the most euroskeptical politicians , are planning national referendums that will put the final decision in the hands of voters .
and that could prove to be an even tougher fight than the arm-wrestling and compromises that finally resulted in a final draft in brussels on friday .
facing a difficult re-election campaign that could come as soon as next year , british prime minister tony blair is n't expected to hold a referendum anytime soon .
in fact , he could delay the referendum vote until as late as 2006 , but even that far off , it will still be a tough sell .
" there is no need to rush it , " blair said sunday , kicking off what he conceded would be a " tough battle " for the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair at an eu summit in brussels " this treaty gives us the chance to play a vital part in decision-making at the heart of the european union whilst it protects completely our right to set our taxes , run our foreign policy and defense and do the things that people want us to do , " blair said .
the prime minister said the battle would be between " reality " and " myth . "
the fact is , he said , " we have kept control of taxes , of our policy on immigration , of defense , of foreign policy . "
most brits against constitution but a quick review of the polls show that the majority of british citizens do not agree with 10 downing street .
a survey released over the weekend by pollster yougov for the sunday times newspaper found 49 percent of brits were against ratifying the constitution and only 23 percent supported it .
similar polls found greater dissatisfaction , with as many as 69 percent feeling the constitution would transfer too much power from london to brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk is about to enter european parliament as head of the uk independence party .
british euroskepticism , or the idea that brussels is transforming into a super state with little transparency , also pervaded this month 's european elections .
the anti-eu united kingdom independence party carried 16-percent of the vote , and it 's leader pledged to wreak havoc with the european parliament .
on sunday , the party 's leader , former talk show host robert kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- , compared blair to neville chamberlain , the former british prime minister who famously claimed to have secured " peace in our time " with nazi germany in 1938 , offering a preview of the nasty wrangling in store for the coming months .
" it 's appeasement , " he said .
" there 's tony , he 's waving a piece of paper saying , ' it 's okay , i 've only given a little bit of our sovereignty away . "
the fallout from the european election has been a public relations nightmare for blair , who has said withdrawing from the eu would be disastrous .
" at this moment in time , when europe is actually changing , when there 's growing support for britain 's position in europe , to get out of the european union or marginalize ourselves in decision-making would just be an extraordinary act of foolishness , " the prime minister said .
britain 's opposition conservative party , which fears the establishment of a european federal state in brussels , has called for an immediate referendum .
blair also faces eu skeptics within his own labor party ranks .
a splinter group of labor politicians has established an action group called " labor against a super state . "
other countries follow suit but britain is n't alone in calling for a referendum .
denmark and ireland have said they will hold referendums , and luxembourg , the netherlands , spain and italy are likely to follow suit .
passage in those countries is anything but certain : denmark rejected the maastricht treaty , paving the way for the euro , in 1992 and ireland vetoed the nice treaty , which forged the path to enlargement , in 2001 .
the treaties passed on second votes in both countries , but only after denmark was given " opt outs " from maastricht euro provisions and the eu pledged to ireland its military neutrality would be respected .
for its part , germany does not plan to hold a referendum .
though members of the opposition free democratic party as well as the green party have called for a popular vote , chancellor gerhard schröder has rejected the idea , saying that it , like all other treaties , should be ratified by germany 's parliament , the bundestag .
after the constitution is signed , a move that will likely happen later this year , it must be ratified by the parliaments of all 25 member states within two years .
experts say that if one country rejects the constitution , it may be modified , but if two or more reject it , its ratification would be highly unlikely .
in order to appease the more euroskeptical voices within the european union , like britain and denmark , the final constitution text preserves sensitive national veto rights on issues pertaining to defense , taxation and foreign policy .

the treaties passed on second votes in both countries , but only after denmark was given " opt outs " from maastricht euro provisions and the eu pledged to ireland its military neutrality would be respected .
for its part , germany does not plan to hold a referendum .
though members of the opposition free democratic party as well as the green party have called for a popular vote , chancellor gerhard schröder has rejected the idea , saying that it , like all other treaties , should be ratified by germany 's parliament , the bundestag .
after the constitution is signed , a move that will likely happen later this year , it must be ratified by the parliaments of all 25 member states within two years .
experts say that if one country rejects the constitution , it may be modified , but if two or more reject it , its ratification would be highly unlikely .
in order to appease the more euroskeptical voices within the european union , like britain and denmark , the final constitution text preserves sensitive national veto rights on issues pertaining to defense , taxation and foreign policy .
the question now is whether those changes will go far enough to unite a european union that is divided by countries promoting more federalist policies in brussels - like germany and france - from those who want to preserve more sovereignty , like britain and denmark . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de constitution faces easy ratification in germany though the new european union constitution faces a bloodbath battle in a handful of european countries , here in germany , it is expected to easily sail through parliament , where it will be given its final blessing .

german chancellor gerhard schröder described the new constitution as a tough bargain to sell , but only as far as convincing his fellow eu leaders was concerned .
" this is a historic decision , " schröder said , " which wasn ’ t easy to reach .
we have overcome a major obstacle on the path of a truly united europe by making the european union more viable . "
' a good day for europe ' schröder ’ s view has been echoed by virtually all german politicians , not only from the ruling social democrats , but also the opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats .

the leaders of germany ’ s christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , also accused schröder of " selling out " germany 's interests to brussels .

" the deal is much better than what we have at the moment , said edmund stoiber , premier of the state of bavaria .
" most importantly , it prevents attempts by brussels to dominate national politics . "
no god , no good the biggest criticism over the weekend came from german catholic clerics and politicians with strong religious affiliations .
they complained that the new constitution does not mention the bloc ’ s christian heritage as an underlying principle for the union .

" it ’ s a shame that the german chancellor prevented an initiative by more than a dozen eu member states who also wanted to see christianity mentioned in the text . "

her pattern sample is within view .
relying on visual judgement and light brushstrokes , the porcelain painter fashions delicate butterflies and berries on a ceramic bowl .
the paints she uses have been mixed according to a secret recipe .
only an expert could immediately tell whether the pattern was painted in the 21st or the 18th century .
europe 's first and oldest porcelain manufacturer in the eastern german city of meissen cultivates the tried and true craft of handmade ceramics , without compromise .
meissen porcelain is the stuff of legend .
the factory was founded in 1710 , and by the mid 1700s , meissen porcelain adorned royal palaces and aristocratic homes across the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of a collection of fürstenberg porcellain owned by duchess anna amalia of weimar though meissen dominated the industry , seven major german factories were also established during the 1700s , all of which enjoyed princely patronage .
one of these was the fürstenberg porcelain manufactory , founded in 1747 .
today , though , the company is at an all-time low .
" our porcelain is a luxury product , and there 's just not much demand for luxury products in germany now , given the current economic situation , " said fürstenberg 's business administration manager , stephanie saalfeld . tough economic times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturing porcelain at kpm in berlin over the past several years , fürstenberg has had to continually let staff go .
in 1996 , the business still had over 200 employees .
now , the number is down to 150 , with another 40 positions to be cut .
" the whole porcelain industry has problems , " saalfeld said .
meissen is no different .
in 2003 , the company was just barely turning a profit .
it cut 100 jobs , and an additional 60 are also threatened .
in august of last year , all departments implemented reduced working hours . searching for a way to stop the decline , some porcelain manufacturers have turned to more streamlined , mechanized production techniques , which make products more affordable .
" fürstenberg is operating to a larger extent with mass-production , " wrote the cologne-based consulting firm bbe in its 2003 report for the glass , porcelain and ceramics industry .
" the larger porcelain manufacturers have integrated much of what was done by hand into their machine-operated processes . " but mass-production is something the 900 porcelain artists working at meissen would n't even dream of doing .
that would see their unique selling point go down the drain . " individual craftsmanship is still synonymous with top quality , " read the bbe report .
that 's good news for meissen , which does n't try to compete with the more affordable mass-produced brands . it 's a strategy that market experts say another prominent , troubled factory - berlin 's königliche porzellan manufaktur -lrb- kpm -rrb- - would be well advised to follow .
kpm is facing insolvency , and a decision is expected to be made soon about possible salvation in the form of privatization . luxury the way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 240-year old terrine from the house of meissen , part of the first china collection at potsdam 's sanssouci castle .
" the best thing for kpm would be a clear decision in favor of luxury , " said thomas kastl , head of the consumer goods trade fair " ambiente " in frankfurt . he points to the fact that , next year , the last trade barriers on the porcelain market are set to fall .
" then there 'll be a flood of high-quality , cheap porcelain from china on the market .
without a strong brand-name strategy , german products will be pushed out of the market , " kastl said . " the middle price segment is destined to disappear .
there 'll be only cheap products , and really expensive products , " predicted professor gert gutjahr from the institute for market psychology in mannheim .
experts say that right now , kpm would n't stand a chance against chinese manufacturers , whereas meissen would .
" who cares about the price when they 're buying a hand-painted , exclusive product ? " confirmed bbe . " it 's only going to become more difficult to determine differences in the quality of the products , " gutjahr explained .
whether a coffee service set is produced by fürstenberg or kpm , or in a no-name factory in china is irrelevant .

find out what made the cut and what wound up on the editing floor . what does it do ?
the core of the constitution contains 50 articles describing the duties and responsibilities of the european union .
it also describes the european institutions , including new ones , and defines their authority .
it details how budgets and decision-making in the european union should be done , also setting into stone the new double majority principle for most major legislation .
voting the number of eu policy areas requiring the double majority vote is vastly expanded in the constitution .
however , it does not include a number of issues relating to internal security , foreign policy , budget , tax or economic policy - powers that many european member states wanted to retain in their national capitals .
in many areas that can be determined by double majority votes , the constitution builds in so-called " emergency breaks " that allow countries to impose a one-month veto in order to delay legislation .
in many areas , long grace or transition periods have been built in so countries can adjust from the current requirement of unanimous votes to the new double majority system .
rights the constitution also incorporates the european union 's charter of rights , which describes the rights and freedoms of every citizen of europe .
constitutional court it stipulates that lawsuits based on questions of the constitution must be taken up with the european court of justice in luxembourg .
president , foreign minister significantly , the constitution replaces the current presidency of the european council , which is held on a six-month rotating basis by each member state , with a president who serves a two-and-a-half year term at the helm of the council , stewarding its work and managing its agenda .
the constitution also establishes the office of an eu foreign minister , a position intended to increase the eu 's status abroad as well as to coordinate foreign policy among the eu member states .
streamlined democracy in an effort to streamline brussels bureaucracy , the constitution also reduces the number of commissioners on the european commission from 25 to 18 starting in 2014 .
the constitution also increases the powers of the democratically elected european parliament - giving it equal power as the european council to vote on budgets .
parliament will also have greater influence on the appointment of top eu offices , including the european commission president .
it will also have voting power in almost all policy areas .
secession the constitution also , for the first time , provides regulation for the voluntary secession of a member state .
what is different from earlier drafts or did n't make it into the constitution ?
in the future , decisions in the council of ministers will be made using the double majority principle : a qualified majority has been reached when 55 percent of the european union member states agree on legislation representing 65 percent of the entire eu population .
in order to stop legislation , a blocking minority of at least four countries is required .
until 2014 , each eu member country will be allowed to send a commissioner to the european commission .
after that , two-thirds of member states will be entitled to a commission seat on a rotating basis .
the number of members of the european parliament will be limited to 750 , though smaller member states will have a minimum of six seats and larger members no more than 99 seats in the european parliament .
the ministers reached an agreement on the stability and growth pact , the accord that guarantees the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro .
currently , the european commission has the direct power to take legal action against member states who violate the 3 percent deficit spending cap set in the pact .
in the future , the commission can recommend that action be taken , but such action requires the approval of a qualified majority of eu countries representing three-fifths of the eu 's population in the council of ministers .
there will be no direct reference to god in the constitution .
instead , the countries have agreed to a general reference to europe 's religious and cultural traditions .

find out what made the cut and what wound up on the editing floor . what does it do ?
the core of the constitution contains 50 articles describing the duties and responsibilities of the european union .
it also describes the european institutions , including new ones , and defines their authority .
it details how budgets and decision-making in the european union should be done , also setting into stone the new double majority principle for most major legislation .
voting the number of eu policy areas requiring the double majority vote is vastly expanded in the constitution .
however , it does not include a number of issues relating to internal security , foreign policy , budget , tax or economic policy - powers that many european member states wanted to retain in their national capitals .
in many areas that can be determined by double majority votes , the constitution builds in so-called " emergency breaks " that allow countries to impose a one-month veto in order to delay legislation .
in many areas , long grace or transition periods have been built in so countries can adjust from the current requirement of unanimous votes to the new double majority system .
rights the constitution also incorporates the european union 's charter of rights , which describes the rights and freedoms of every citizen of europe .
constitutional court it stipulates that lawsuits based on questions of the constitution must be taken up with the european court of justice in luxembourg .
president , foreign minister significantly , the constitution replaces the current presidency of the european council , which is held on a six-month rotating basis by each member state , with a president who serves a two-and-a-half year term at the helm of the council , stewarding its work and managing its agenda .
the constitution also establishes the office of an eu foreign minister , a position intended to increase the eu 's status abroad as well as to coordinate foreign policy among the eu member states .
streamlined democracy in an effort to streamline brussels bureaucracy , the constitution also reduces the number of commissioners on the european commission from 25 to 18 starting in 2014 .
the constitution also increases the powers of the democratically elected european parliament - giving it equal power as the european council to vote on budgets .
parliament will also have greater influence on the appointment of top eu offices , including the european commission president .
it will also have voting power in almost all policy areas .
secession the constitution also , for the first time , provides regulation for the voluntary secession of a member state .
what is different from earlier drafts or did n't make it into the constitution ?
in the future , decisions in the council of ministers will be made using the double majority principle : a qualified majority has been reached when 55 percent of the european union member states agree on legislation representing 65 percent of the entire eu population .
in order to stop legislation , a blocking minority of at least four countries is required .
until 2014 , each eu member country will be allowed to send a commissioner to the european commission .
after that , two-thirds of member states will be entitled to a commission seat on a rotating basis .
the number of members of the european parliament will be limited to 750 , though smaller member states will have a minimum of six seats and larger members no more than 99 seats in the european parliament .
the ministers reached an agreement on the stability and growth pact , the accord that guarantees the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro .
currently , the european commission has the direct power to take legal action against member states who violate the 3 percent deficit spending cap set in the pact .
in the future , the commission can recommend that action be taken , but such action requires the approval of a qualified majority of eu countries representing three-fifths of the eu 's population in the council of ministers .
there will be no direct reference to god in the constitution .
instead , the countries have agreed to a general reference to europe 's religious and cultural traditions .

the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are caught between implementing reforms that economists say are necessary if the country wants to compete in the global marketplace and staying true to its fundamental values of protecting the welfare state and looking out for the interests of working people . the strategy session of the spd 's executive committee seeks to draw a course out of the wilderness the party has been stumbling through for the past 18 months .
it is also trying to quell a revolt in the party 's left wing , which is demanding a radical policy course correction . " we must keep to the current course , " rhineland-palatinate 's premier kurt beck told reporters before going into the closed-door meeting .
he called on the party to close ranks and not let the election defeats split the party in two . in last week 's european elections , the spd lost around 2.8 million voters that supported the party five years earlier and its numbers slumped to 21.5 percent .
that defeat was but a continuation of a disastrous series of electoral defeats the party has suffered over the past year and a half , as voters turn away from the traditional party of the working class .
they are angered and alienated by schröder 's unpopular reforms that are meant to provide a kick-start to the german economy , which has been stagnant for three years . analysts say those reforms , which include new fees for doctors visits , cuts to some social benefits and a loosening of labor market rules that protect workers ' jobs , have unnerved the spd base , who see the party embarking on a course of social darwinism . but abandoning schröder 's reforms , which go under the name agenda 2010 , does not appear to be on the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering spd party head franz müntefering , heading a chorus of party leaders , said after consultations with other party leaders on monday there will be no " u-turn " on the reforms .

berlin 's spd mayor klaus wowereit told reporters before the meeting there was no alternative to agenda 2010 . they are largely echoing the words of chancellor gerhard schröder , who has repeatedly said he will not fundamentally change the course he has set the country on .

müntefering said on monday there would be new " accentuations " that would make it clear to the public that the reforms are being put in place " for everyone . " " we have to stop this idea that the reform course means doom , " björn böhning , head of the spd 's youth group , told german public television zdf .
he said the government 's zig-zag course and implementation did not make it easier for the electorate to understand what the goals were . " it must be clear to voters what these reforms are for , " michael müller , head of the berlin spd , told zdf on monday .
he said the party should make it clear , for example , that money saved by the reforms would be reinvested in education , a fact that would be received positively by voters . left-wing demands but according to trade unions and other members of the party 's left wing , the spd has already forgotten its roots .

" germany 's trade unions warned of a " vehement disagreements " about the party 's future course , saying they and the government need to come to agreement about the reforms and present it to the public .

the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are caught between implementing reforms that economists say are necessary if the country wants to compete in the global marketplace and staying true to its fundamental values of protecting the welfare state and looking out for the interests of working people . the strategy session of the spd 's executive committee seeks to draw a course out of the wilderness the party has been stumbling through for the past 18 months .
it is also trying to quell a revolt in the party 's left wing , which is demanding a radical policy course correction . " we must keep to the current course , " rhineland-palatinate 's premier kurt beck told reporters before going into the closed-door meeting .
he called on the party to close ranks and not let the election defeats split the party in two . in last week 's european elections , the spd lost around 2.8 million voters that supported the party five years earlier and its numbers slumped to 21.5 percent .
that defeat was but a continuation of a disastrous series of electoral defeats the party has suffered over the past year and a half , as voters turn away from the traditional party of the working class .
they are angered and alienated by schröder 's unpopular reforms that are meant to provide a kick-start to the german economy , which has been stagnant for three years . analysts say those reforms , which include new fees for doctors visits , cuts to some social benefits and a loosening of labor market rules that protect workers ' jobs , have unnerved the spd base , who see the party embarking on a course of social darwinism . but abandoning schröder 's reforms , which go under the name agenda 2010 , does not appear to be on the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering spd party head franz müntefering , heading a chorus of party leaders , said after consultations with other party leaders on monday there will be no " u-turn " on the reforms . " we have to get our country 's affairs in order with reforms , " said the spd 's deputy parliamentary group leader ludwig stiegler .
berlin 's spd mayor klaus wowereit told reporters before the meeting there was no alternative to agenda 2010 . they are largely echoing the words of chancellor gerhard schröder , who has repeatedly said he will not fundamentally change the course he has set the country on .
over the weekend , he told spd leaders he would rather resign than water down his reform program . new pr offensive ? while many party leaders are lining up behind schröder 's stay-the-course stance , calls have been going out to the executive to put a new spin on the reforms , putting the focus on social justice instead of on the dismantling of the welfare state . they appear to have been heard .
müntefering said on monday there would be new " accentuations " that would make it clear to the public that the reforms are being put in place " for everyone . " " we have to stop this idea that the reform course means doom , " björn böhning , head of the spd 's youth group , told german public television zdf .

the capital has long been known as a center for germany 's homosexual community , as documented in the city 's gay museum . berlin 's gay museum is tucked away in the multicultural district of kreuzberg .
established in 1985 , the museum is a private institution dedicated to preserving , exhibiting , and discovering gay and lesbian history , art , and culture . although many organizations around the world collect historical material relevant to gay men and lesbians , the berlin museum is the only institution of its kind which is open full time and has a dedicated building with changing exhibitions open to the public . " we 're planning to open a permanent exhibit on gay history from 1800 - 1970 this december , " said gerrit horbacher , the musem 's spokesman .
" people are often confused when they come here and only see art exhibits .
they ask us where the history is , so that 's something we 'll have on show by the end of the year . " pioneer hirschfeld the museum 's extensive library includes a newspaper and magazine archive , which includes editions of the first gay magazine , " der eigene , " published in germany in 1896 .
" back then , the magazine was not really sold very openly .
instead there was a list of where to send them , and of places where people could buy them , " he said .
" in the 1920 's , it was a lot easier .
then you could find gay and lesbian magazines in kiosks alongside newspapers and mainstream magazines . " in 1897 in berlin , the publishers of " der eigene , " dr. magnus hirschfeld and adolf brand , went on to form the world ’ s first gay liberation movement .

the capital has long been known as a center for germany 's homosexual community , as documented in the city 's gay museum . berlin 's gay museum is tucked away in the multicultural district of kreuzberg .
established in 1985 , the museum is a private institution dedicated to preserving , exhibiting , and discovering gay and lesbian history , art , and culture . although many organizations around the world collect historical material relevant to gay men and lesbians , the berlin museum is the only institution of its kind which is open full time and has a dedicated building with changing exhibitions open to the public . " we 're planning to open a permanent exhibit on gay history from 1800 - 1970 this december , " said gerrit horbacher , the musem 's spokesman .
" people are often confused when they come here and only see art exhibits .
they ask us where the history is , so that 's something we 'll have on show by the end of the year . " pioneer hirschfeld the museum 's extensive library includes a newspaper and magazine archive , which includes editions of the first gay magazine , " der eigene , " published in germany in 1896 .
" back then , the magazine was not really sold very openly .
instead there was a list of where to send them , and of places where people could buy them , " he said .
" in the 1920 's , it was a lot easier .
then you could find gay and lesbian magazines in kiosks alongside newspapers and mainstream magazines . " in 1897 in berlin , the publishers of " der eigene , " dr. magnus hirschfeld and adolf brand , went on to form the world ’ s first gay liberation movement .
the scientific humanitarian committee was a political group that lobbied the german parliament to abolish the law forbidding homosexuality known as " paragraph 175 , " which had been on the books since 1871 .
modified in 1969 and again in 1973 , the law was eventually abolished in 1994 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1907 german political cartoon depicting sex researcher magnus hirschfeld , " hero of the day , " drumming up support for the abolition of paragraph 175 of the german penal code that criminalized homosexuality .
hirschfeld was a social democrat , a jew and a medical doctor .
he gathered support for the gay cause from german intellectuals and liberal politicians of the time .
the gay museum includes many of his pioneering works . " in 1919 , hirschfeld founded the institute for sexual science , with which he aimed to make people conscious of their sexuality and allow people to live their sexual lives as they wanted , not just according to rules that were dictated by society , " horbacher said .
" he also conducted many surveys on homosexuality , and developed his theory of ‘ the third sex , ' as he called homosexuals . " the golden 1920 's the founding of hirschfeld 's institute coincided with the suffragette movement , shorter skirts , cropped hair for women and the so-called flapper look .
differences between the sexes were being bridged , and gay culture in berlin flourished .
much of the gay nightlife was centered around nollendorfplatz in the schöneberg district of berlin , and still is today .
one of the most famous nightclubs in the 1920 's was the eldorado , which featured a number of transvestite performers . " we 've got coins from the eldorado , which customers used to buy there .
on one side , they show either a gay or lesbian couple dancing together .
the customers would give the coins to one of the transvestites working there , to get a dance .
and at the end of the evening , the transvestites gathered all their coins , and were paid according to how many they 'd managed to collect , " horbacher explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich in " the blue angel " the eldorado also regularly featured then up-and-coming star marlene dietrich -lrb- photo -rrb- , who went on to achieve international fame .
dietrich had left germany by the 1930 's when the nazis came to power . after hitler 's regime took control , all gay and lesbian bars and meeting places in germany were closed .
magnus hirschfeld ’ s institute for sexual science was looted in 1933 by the nazis and his books were burned . " every gay person knew that the nazis did n't like homosexuals , and that they wanted to get rid of them , " horbacher said .
" they started to enforce paragraph 175 , so from 1935 on , it was punishable just to glance at someone of the same sex too intensively .
gay people lived in fear of being denounced by other people , and the police conducted raids , arrested gays , and sent them to concentration camps . " contemporary history while the museum contains much research material documenting the lives of homosexuals in past eras , it also concentrates resources on collecting material on important modern-day developments for gays in germany , such as the country 's new " registered partnership " law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male couple , just married " really , it 's just a kind of gay marriage , " horbacher said , " because there are n't equal rights like in a heterosexual marriage .

until recently , the work of charlotte salomon was little known in germany .
after her death at auschwitz in 1943 , her work quietly disappeared into obscurity .
in two short years , the jewish artist , born in berlin in 1917 , created an astonishing 1,325 paintings documenting her dramatic life during a stay in southern france before her capture , deportation and murder by the nazis .
sixty years later , the painter 's work , which is roughly analogous to the art-world version of the diary of anne frank , is being shown in a major retrospective in frankfurt .

a painterly anne frank städel museum , frankfurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte salomon , leben ?
oder theater ?
until recently , the work of charlotte salomon was little known in germany .
after her death at auschwitz in 1943 , her work quietly disappeared into obscurity .
in two short years , the jewish artist , born in berlin in 1917 , created an astonishing 1,325 paintings documenting her dramatic life during a stay in southern france before her capture , deportation and murder by the nazis .
sixty years later , the painter 's work , which is roughly analogous to the art-world version of the diary of anne frank , is being shown in a major retrospective in frankfurt .
the museum is seeking not only to tell salomon 's story , but also to build the reputation of someone it considers to be one of the last century 's important artists .
the exhibition includes salomon 's paintings , gouaches , writings and music .
" charlotte salomon : life ?
or theater ? " runs through august 22 .
it is open tuesday and friday through sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

it foresees a new debt of € 22 billion and focuses on privatization to bolster state coffers . eichel 's draft budget for 2005 , which will be submitted to cabinet for approval on wednesday , falls short of € 22 billion -lrb- $ 26.5 billion -rrb- - a deficit that 's down by around a half on the current year . eichel plans to further slash the deficit to € 19.5 billion by 2008 . according to the draft , germany 's budgetary spending for next year will total € 258.3 billion , an increase of 0.4 percent despite a general belt-tightening . eichel also hopes the draft budget will keep spending within the budget deficit cap of 3 percent of gdp set down in the eu 's growth and stability pact which underpins the euro . germany risks having to pay a huge fine to the european commission under the terms of the pact if it exceeds the 3 percent ceiling for the third straight year in 2005 . sale of government assets one of the most controversial provisions of the draft budget includes selling off a large chunk of government assets in order to bring the budget in line with the constitution . the german constitution lays down that new deficits can not exceed the amount of investments , which are expected to amount to € 22.8 billion in 2005 . to fulfill constitutional requirements , eichel is banking on privatizations to bring in a record € 15.45 billion that would help to plug a budgetary gap of € 18 billion . the € 15.4 billion corresponds to about three-fourths of the current stock market price of the german government 's shares in deutsche post and deutsche telekom . the finance minister has defended the controversial measure by pointing to the government 's refusal to raise taxes or implement new saving measures in the face of sluggish economic recovery .
it still remains unclear whether the planned privatizations include government stakes that will be sold in the current year .

" this budgetary nonsense has nothing to do with solid planning , " said dietrich austermann , budgetary expert of the opposition christian democrats .
austermann pointed out that it was speculative to talk of such high privatization proceeds in the face of low share prices . " this is the budget plan of a gambler .
spending is to be increased , no savings are being made .
the planned income is based mainly on speculative figures .
state investment is at a record low , and that will make itself felt in the labor market and the number of jobs , " he said .

franziska eichstätt-bohlig , the party 's financial expert , called the draft budget " very problematic . " referring to the planned high privatization proceeds , eichstätt-bohlig said , " that 's not a permanent stablization of the budget situation .

her pattern sample is within view .
relying on visual judgement and light brushstrokes , the porcelain painter fashions delicate butterflies and berries on a ceramic bowl .
the paints she uses have been mixed according to a secret recipe .
only an expert could immediately tell whether the pattern was painted in the 21st or the 18th century .
europe 's first and oldest porcelain manufacturer in the eastern german city of meissen cultivates the tried and true craft of handmade ceramics , without compromise .
meissen porcelain is the stuff of legend .
the factory was founded in 1710 , and by the mid 1700s , meissen porcelain adorned royal palaces and aristocratic homes across the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of a collection of fürstenberg porcellain owned by duchess anna amalia of weimar though meissen dominated the industry , seven major german factories were also established during the 1700s , all of which enjoyed princely patronage .
one of these was the fürstenberg porcelain manufactory , founded in 1747 .
today , though , the company is at an all-time low .
" our porcelain is a luxury product , and there 's just not much demand for luxury products in germany now , given the current economic situation , " said fürstenberg 's business administration manager , stephanie saalfeld . tough economic times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturing porcelain at kpm in berlin over the past several years , fürstenberg has had to continually let staff go .
in 1996 , the business still had over 200 employees .
now , the number is down to 150 , with another 40 positions to be cut .
" the whole porcelain industry has problems , " saalfeld said .
meissen is no different .
in 2003 , the company was just barely turning a profit .
it cut 100 jobs , and an additional 60 are also threatened .
in august of last year , all departments implemented reduced working hours . searching for a way to stop the decline , some porcelain manufacturers have turned to more streamlined , mechanized production techniques , which make products more affordable .
" fürstenberg is operating to a larger extent with mass-production , " wrote the cologne-based consulting firm bbe in its 2003 report for the glass , porcelain and ceramics industry .
" the larger porcelain manufacturers have integrated much of what was done by hand into their machine-operated processes . " but mass-production is something the 900 porcelain artists working at meissen would n't even dream of doing .
that would see their unique selling point go down the drain . " individual craftsmanship is still synonymous with top quality , " read the bbe report .
that 's good news for meissen , which does n't try to compete with the more affordable mass-produced brands . it 's a strategy that market experts say another prominent , troubled factory - berlin 's königliche porzellan manufaktur -lrb- kpm -rrb- - would be well advised to follow .
kpm is facing insolvency , and a decision is expected to be made soon about possible salvation in the form of privatization . luxury the way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 240-year old terrine from the house of meissen , part of the first china collection at potsdam 's sanssouci castle .
" the best thing for kpm would be a clear decision in favor of luxury , " said thomas kastl , head of the consumer goods trade fair " ambiente " in frankfurt . he points to the fact that , next year , the last trade barriers on the porcelain market are set to fall .
" then there 'll be a flood of high-quality , cheap porcelain from china on the market .
without a strong brand-name strategy , german products will be pushed out of the market , " kastl said . " the middle price segment is destined to disappear .
there 'll be only cheap products , and really expensive products , " predicted professor gert gutjahr from the institute for market psychology in mannheim .
experts say that right now , kpm would n't stand a chance against chinese manufacturers , whereas meissen would .
" who cares about the price when they 're buying a hand-painted , exclusive product ? " confirmed bbe . " it 's only going to become more difficult to determine differences in the quality of the products , " gutjahr explained .
whether a coffee service set is produced by fürstenberg or kpm , or in a no-name factory in china is irrelevant .
" the know-how is so evenly spread now , " gutjahr said , adding that every factories in both germany and china have the same machines needed to manufacture porcelain . branding is everything what separates the cheap products from the more expensive , is the value of the brand .
" in the german patent office , there are around 700,000 protected trademarks listed .
of those , 60,000 are still active on the market , " gutjahr said .
" only 200 are what we 'd call strong brands , and of those , only about 20 are truly sought after . "
these desired brands typically have a long history , as their reputation develops slowly , over several generations .
" on average , you 're talking 80 years , " said gutjahr . # b # meissen has existed for almost 300 years .
royalty , nobility , statesmen and popstars have eaten from the plates marked with the famous blue swords .
the company has 200,000 items in its repertoire and an extensive archive of molds stemming from various epochs .
prices are high , with small painted figurines starting at around € 1,000 each , and five-piece dinnerware settings ranging from € 450 to € 4,500 , depending on the complexity of the pattern .
but maintaining high prices could just be the best way of securing the company 's future . ingun arnold -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nokia 's jetset mobile : it blings and rings five years ago mobile phones were the latest rage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : crisis in brussels a quick guide to the eu summit meet the eu 's deficit sinners eu 's billions to flow to familiar shores eu attempts to untie budget tangles europe -pipe- 21.06.2004 a quick guide to the eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new charter for europe dw-world offers a speed reader of the most essential aspects of the new constitution agreed to by the leaders of the 25 european union member states .
find out what made the cut and what wound up on the editing floor . what does it do ?
the core of the constitution contains 50 articles describing the duties and responsibilities of the european union .
it also describes the european institutions , including new ones , and defines their authority .
it details how budgets and decision-making in the european union should be done , also setting into stone the new double majority principle for most major legislation .
voting the number of eu policy areas requiring the double majority vote is vastly expanded in the constitution .
however , it does not include a number of issues relating to internal security , foreign policy , budget , tax or economic policy - powers that many european member states wanted to retain in their national capitals .
in many areas that can be determined by double majority votes , the constitution builds in so-called " emergency breaks " that allow countries to impose a one-month veto in order to delay legislation .
in many areas , long grace or transition periods have been built in so countries can adjust from the current requirement of unanimous votes to the new double majority system .
rights the constitution also incorporates the european union 's charter of rights , which describes the rights and freedoms of every citizen of europe .
constitutional court it stipulates that lawsuits based on questions of the constitution must be taken up with the european court of justice in luxembourg .
president , foreign minister significantly , the constitution replaces the current presidency of the european council , which is held on a six-month rotating basis by each member state , with a president who serves a two-and-a-half year term at the helm of the council , stewarding its work and managing its agenda .
the constitution also establishes the office of an eu foreign minister , a position intended to increase the eu 's status abroad as well as to coordinate foreign policy among the eu member states .
streamlined democracy in an effort to streamline brussels bureaucracy , the constitution also reduces the number of commissioners on the european commission from 25 to 18 starting in 2014 .
the constitution also increases the powers of the democratically elected european parliament - giving it equal power as the european council to vote on budgets .
parliament will also have greater influence on the appointment of top eu offices , including the european commission president .
it will also have voting power in almost all policy areas .
secession the constitution also , for the first time , provides regulation for the voluntary secession of a member state .
what is different from earlier drafts or did n't make it into the constitution ?
in the future , decisions in the council of ministers will be made using the double majority principle : a qualified majority has been reached when 55 percent of the european union member states agree on legislation representing 65 percent of the entire eu population .
in order to stop legislation , a blocking minority of at least four countries is required .
until 2014 , each eu member country will be allowed to send a commissioner to the european commission .
after that , two-thirds of member states will be entitled to a commission seat on a rotating basis .
the number of members of the european parliament will be limited to 750 , though smaller member states will have a minimum of six seats and larger members no more than 99 seats in the european parliament .
the ministers reached an agreement on the stability and growth pact , the accord that guarantees the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro .
currently , the european commission has the direct power to take legal action against member states who violate the 3 percent deficit spending cap set in the pact .
in the future , the commission can recommend that action be taken , but such action requires the approval of a qualified majority of eu countries representing three-fifths of the eu 's population in the council of ministers .
there will be no direct reference to god in the constitution .
instead , the countries have agreed to a general reference to europe 's religious and cultural traditions .

it foresees a new debt of € 22 billion and focuses on privatization to bolster state coffers . eichel 's draft budget for 2005 , which will be submitted to cabinet for approval on wednesday , falls short of € 22 billion -lrb- $ 26.5 billion -rrb- - a deficit that 's down by around a half on the current year . eichel plans to further slash the deficit to € 19.5 billion by 2008 . according to the draft , germany 's budgetary spending for next year will total € 258.3 billion , an increase of 0.4 percent despite a general belt-tightening . eichel also hopes the draft budget will keep spending within the budget deficit cap of 3 percent of gdp set down in the eu 's growth and stability pact which underpins the euro . germany risks having to pay a huge fine to the european commission under the terms of the pact if it exceeds the 3 percent ceiling for the third straight year in 2005 . sale of government assets one of the most controversial provisions of the draft budget includes selling off a large chunk of government assets in order to bring the budget in line with the constitution . the german constitution lays down that new deficits can not exceed the amount of investments , which are expected to amount to € 22.8 billion in 2005 . to fulfill constitutional requirements , eichel is banking on privatizations to bring in a record € 15.45 billion that would help to plug a budgetary gap of € 18 billion . the € 15.4 billion corresponds to about three-fourths of the current stock market price of the german government 's shares in deutsche post and deutsche telekom . the finance minister has defended the controversial measure by pointing to the government 's refusal to raise taxes or implement new saving measures in the face of sluggish economic recovery .
it still remains unclear whether the planned privatizations include government stakes that will be sold in the current year . " budget plan of a gambler " but germany 's conservative opposition has criticized the draft budget for 2005 , in particular the sale of government assets at prices , they say , the market wo n't pay . " this budgetary nonsense has nothing to do with solid planning , " said dietrich austermann , budgetary expert of the opposition christian democrats .
austermann pointed out that it was speculative to talk of such high privatization proceeds in the face of low share prices . " this is the budget plan of a gambler .
spending is to be increased , no savings are being made .
the planned income is based mainly on speculative figures .
state investment is at a record low , and that will make itself felt in the labor market and the number of jobs , " he said . " selling the family silver " the draft budget also foresees reducing funds for almost all government ministries in 2005 . the transport ministry , for example , will have fewer funds to maintain and extend roads and to modernize germany 's railway system . similarly , the defense ministry will face substantial cuts - probably to the tune of some € 300 million , thus dampening defense minister peter struck 's plans to restructure and modernize the armed forces . criticism of the draft budget has also come from the greens , the junior partner in the ruling government coalition .
franziska eichstätt-bohlig , the party 's financial expert , called the draft budget " very problematic . " referring to the planned high privatization proceeds , eichstätt-bohlig said , " that 's not a permanent stablization of the budget situation .
one can sell off the family silver only once .

they doubt that the document will find all-out support among the populations in other eu countries .
but senior politicians across the board have welcomed the agreement .
german chancellor gerhard schröder described the new constitution as a tough bargain to sell , but only as far as convincing his fellow eu leaders was concerned .
" this is a historic decision , " schröder said , " which wasn ’ t easy to reach .
we have overcome a major obstacle on the path of a truly united europe by making the european union more viable . "
' a good day for europe ' schröder ’ s view has been echoed by virtually all german politicians , not only from the ruling social democrats , but also the opposition conservatives and liberal free democrats .
even schröder ’ s fiercest domestic rival , christian democratic union leader angela merkel , praised the compromise reached in brussels as an important step for the 25-nation bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel " this was a good day for europe , " merkel said .
" now the european union has completed its founding charter as a basis on which a fully united union can develop . "
merkel and the conservative party she leads had previously criticized the chancellor for allegedly seeking to split the european union by pushing his strategy of a core europe together with the french president jacques chirac .
the leaders of germany ’ s christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , also accused schröder of " selling out " germany 's interests to brussels .
but this weekend , the party 's leader said he was content with the final draft .
" the deal is much better than what we have at the moment , said edmund stoiber , premier of the state of bavaria .
" most importantly , it prevents attempts by brussels to dominate national politics . "
no god , no good the biggest criticism over the weekend came from german catholic clerics and politicians with strong religious affiliations .
they complained that the new constitution does not mention the bloc ’ s christian heritage as an underlying principle for the union .
" like many others in germany , i very much regret that , " said erwin teufel , the conservative premier in the state of baden-württemberg .
" it ’ s a shame that the german chancellor prevented an initiative by more than a dozen eu member states who also wanted to see christianity mentioned in the text . "
the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- also welcomed the new constitution .
however , the party 's leaders criticized the fact that , unlike the people of britain or denmark , the german population won ’ t have the chance to approve the document in a referendum .
last week , an overwhelming majority of lawmakers in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , voted down a resolution by the fdp for a plebiscite .

until recently , the work of charlotte salomon was little known in germany .
after her death at auschwitz in 1943 , her work quietly disappeared into obscurity .
in two short years , the jewish artist , born in berlin in 1917 , created an astonishing 1,325 paintings documenting her dramatic life during a stay in southern france before her capture , deportation and murder by the nazis .
sixty years later , the painter 's work , which is roughly analogous to the art-world version of the diary of anne frank , is being shown in a major retrospective in frankfurt .
the museum is seeking not only to tell salomon 's story , but also to build the reputation of someone it considers to be one of the last century 's important artists .
the exhibition includes salomon 's paintings , gouaches , writings and music .
" charlotte salomon : life ?
or theater ? " runs through august 22 .

until recently , the work of charlotte salomon was little known in germany .
after her death at auschwitz in 1943 , her work quietly disappeared into obscurity .
in two short years , the jewish artist , born in berlin in 1917 , created an astonishing 1,325 paintings documenting her dramatic life during a stay in southern france before her capture , deportation and murder by the nazis .
sixty years later , the painter 's work , which is roughly analogous to the art-world version of the diary of anne frank , is being shown in a major retrospective in frankfurt .
the museum is seeking not only to tell salomon 's story , but also to build the reputation of someone it considers to be one of the last century 's important artists .
the exhibition includes salomon 's paintings , gouaches , writings and music .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of a collection of fürstenberg porcellain owned by duchess anna amalia of weimar though meissen dominated the industry , seven major german factories were also established during the 1700s , all of which enjoyed princely patronage .
one of these was the fürstenberg porcelain manufactory , founded in 1747 .
today , though , the company is at an all-time low .
" our porcelain is a luxury product , and there 's just not much demand for luxury products in germany now , given the current economic situation , " said fürstenberg 's business administration manager , stephanie saalfeld . tough economic times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturing porcelain at kpm in berlin over the past several years , fürstenberg has had to continually let staff go .
in 1996 , the business still had over 200 employees .
now , the number is down to 150 , with another 40 positions to be cut .
" the whole porcelain industry has problems , " saalfeld said .
meissen is no different .
in 2003 , the company was just barely turning a profit .
it cut 100 jobs , and an additional 60 are also threatened .
in august of last year , all departments implemented reduced working hours . searching for a way to stop the decline , some porcelain manufacturers have turned to more streamlined , mechanized production techniques , which make products more affordable .
" fürstenberg is operating to a larger extent with mass-production , " wrote the cologne-based consulting firm bbe in its 2003 report for the glass , porcelain and ceramics industry .
" the larger porcelain manufacturers have integrated much of what was done by hand into their machine-operated processes . " but mass-production is something the 900 porcelain artists working at meissen would n't even dream of doing .
that would see their unique selling point go down the drain . " individual craftsmanship is still synonymous with top quality , " read the bbe report .
that 's good news for meissen , which does n't try to compete with the more affordable mass-produced brands . it 's a strategy that market experts say another prominent , troubled factory - berlin 's königliche porzellan manufaktur -lrb- kpm -rrb- - would be well advised to follow .
kpm is facing insolvency , and a decision is expected to be made soon about possible salvation in the form of privatization . luxury the way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 240-year old terrine from the house of meissen , part of the first china collection at potsdam 's sanssouci castle .
" the best thing for kpm would be a clear decision in favor of luxury , " said thomas kastl , head of the consumer goods trade fair " ambiente " in frankfurt . he points to the fact that , next year , the last trade barriers on the porcelain market are set to fall .
" then there 'll be a flood of high-quality , cheap porcelain from china on the market .
without a strong brand-name strategy , german products will be pushed out of the market , " kastl said . " the middle price segment is destined to disappear .
there 'll be only cheap products , and really expensive products , " predicted professor gert gutjahr from the institute for market psychology in mannheim .
experts say that right now , kpm would n't stand a chance against chinese manufacturers , whereas meissen would .
" who cares about the price when they 're buying a hand-painted , exclusive product ? " confirmed bbe . " it 's only going to become more difficult to determine differences in the quality of the products , " gutjahr explained .
whether a coffee service set is produced by fürstenberg or kpm , or in a no-name factory in china is irrelevant .
" the know-how is so evenly spread now , " gutjahr said , adding that every factories in both germany and china have the same machines needed to manufacture porcelain . branding is everything what separates the cheap products from the more expensive , is the value of the brand .
" in the german patent office , there are around 700,000 protected trademarks listed .
of those , 60,000 are still active on the market , " gutjahr said .
" only 200 are what we 'd call strong brands , and of those , only about 20 are truly sought after . "
these desired brands typically have a long history , as their reputation develops slowly , over several generations .
" on average , you 're talking 80 years , " said gutjahr . # b # meissen has existed for almost 300 years .
royalty , nobility , statesmen and popstars have eaten from the plates marked with the famous blue swords .
the company has 200,000 items in its repertoire and an extensive archive of molds stemming from various epochs .
prices are high , with small painted figurines starting at around € 1,000 each , and five-piece dinnerware settings ranging from € 450 to € 4,500 , depending on the complexity of the pattern .

the capital has long been known as a center for germany 's homosexual community , as documented in the city 's gay museum . berlin 's gay museum is tucked away in the multicultural district of kreuzberg .
established in 1985 , the museum is a private institution dedicated to preserving , exhibiting , and discovering gay and lesbian history , art , and culture . although many organizations around the world collect historical material relevant to gay men and lesbians , the berlin museum is the only institution of its kind which is open full time and has a dedicated building with changing exhibitions open to the public . " we 're planning to open a permanent exhibit on gay history from 1800 - 1970 this december , " said gerrit horbacher , the musem 's spokesman .
" people are often confused when they come here and only see art exhibits .
they ask us where the history is , so that 's something we 'll have on show by the end of the year . " pioneer hirschfeld the museum 's extensive library includes a newspaper and magazine archive , which includes editions of the first gay magazine , " der eigene , " published in germany in 1896 .
" back then , the magazine was not really sold very openly .
instead there was a list of where to send them , and of places where people could buy them , " he said .
" in the 1920 's , it was a lot easier .
then you could find gay and lesbian magazines in kiosks alongside newspapers and mainstream magazines . " in 1897 in berlin , the publishers of " der eigene , " dr. magnus hirschfeld and adolf brand , went on to form the world ’ s first gay liberation movement .
the scientific humanitarian committee was a political group that lobbied the german parliament to abolish the law forbidding homosexuality known as " paragraph 175 , " which had been on the books since 1871 .
modified in 1969 and again in 1973 , the law was eventually abolished in 1994 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1907 german political cartoon depicting sex researcher magnus hirschfeld , " hero of the day , " drumming up support for the abolition of paragraph 175 of the german penal code that criminalized homosexuality .
hirschfeld was a social democrat , a jew and a medical doctor .
he gathered support for the gay cause from german intellectuals and liberal politicians of the time .
the gay museum includes many of his pioneering works . " in 1919 , hirschfeld founded the institute for sexual science , with which he aimed to make people conscious of their sexuality and allow people to live their sexual lives as they wanted , not just according to rules that were dictated by society , " horbacher said .
" he also conducted many surveys on homosexuality , and developed his theory of ‘ the third sex , ' as he called homosexuals . " the golden 1920 's the founding of hirschfeld 's institute coincided with the suffragette movement , shorter skirts , cropped hair for women and the so-called flapper look .
differences between the sexes were being bridged , and gay culture in berlin flourished .
much of the gay nightlife was centered around nollendorfplatz in the schöneberg district of berlin , and still is today .
one of the most famous nightclubs in the 1920 's was the eldorado , which featured a number of transvestite performers . " we 've got coins from the eldorado , which customers used to buy there .
on one side , they show either a gay or lesbian couple dancing together .
the customers would give the coins to one of the transvestites working there , to get a dance .
and at the end of the evening , the transvestites gathered all their coins , and were paid according to how many they 'd managed to collect , " horbacher explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich in " the blue angel " the eldorado also regularly featured then up-and-coming star marlene dietrich -lrb- photo -rrb- , who went on to achieve international fame .
dietrich had left germany by the 1930 's when the nazis came to power . after hitler 's regime took control , all gay and lesbian bars and meeting places in germany were closed .
magnus hirschfeld ’ s institute for sexual science was looted in 1933 by the nazis and his books were burned . " every gay person knew that the nazis did n't like homosexuals , and that they wanted to get rid of them , " horbacher said .
" they started to enforce paragraph 175 , so from 1935 on , it was punishable just to glance at someone of the same sex too intensively .
gay people lived in fear of being denounced by other people , and the police conducted raids , arrested gays , and sent them to concentration camps . " contemporary history while the museum contains much research material documenting the lives of homosexuals in past eras , it also concentrates resources on collecting material on important modern-day developments for gays in germany , such as the country 's new " registered partnership " law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male couple , just married " really , it 's just a kind of gay marriage , " horbacher said , " because there are n't equal rights like in a heterosexual marriage .
there are quite a few couples who are doing it .
in berlin , there are lots of gay marriages , and also the first divorces .
it 's quite normal here . " horbacher said that while the museum attracts many gays and lesbians from berlin and abroad , heterosexuals are also among the patrons .
" they see that there 's a gay museum , and think , ' let 's see what they 've got on display . "
it 's a fun thing for them .
at least they 're open to coming in , and that 's our aim - not only to have gay and lesbian visitors , but also to be of interest to heterosexuals .

it details how budgets and decision-making in the european union should be done , also setting into stone the new double majority principle for most major legislation .

however , it does not include a number of issues relating to internal security , foreign policy , budget , tax or economic policy - powers that many european member states wanted to retain in their national capitals .
in many areas that can be determined by double majority votes , the constitution builds in so-called " emergency breaks " that allow countries to impose a one-month veto in order to delay legislation .

will british and danish voters reject it ? in order to become legally binding , europe 's new constitution has to be ratified by the parliaments in each of its 25 member states .
a handful of countries , including those with the most euroskeptical politicians , are planning national referendums that will put the final decision in the hands of voters .
and that could prove to be an even tougher fight than the arm-wrestling and compromises that finally resulted in a final draft in brussels on friday .
facing a difficult re-election campaign that could come as soon as next year , british prime minister tony blair is n't expected to hold a referendum anytime soon .
in fact , he could delay the referendum vote until as late as 2006 , but even that far off , it will still be a tough sell .
" there is no need to rush it , " blair said sunday , kicking off what he conceded would be a " tough battle " for the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair at an eu summit in brussels " this treaty gives us the chance to play a vital part in decision-making at the heart of the european union whilst it protects completely our right to set our taxes , run our foreign policy and defense and do the things that people want us to do , " blair said .
the prime minister said the battle would be between " reality " and " myth . "
the fact is , he said , " we have kept control of taxes , of our policy on immigration , of defense , of foreign policy . "
most brits against constitution but a quick review of the polls show that the majority of british citizens do not agree with 10 downing street .
a survey released over the weekend by pollster yougov for the sunday times newspaper found 49 percent of brits were against ratifying the constitution and only 23 percent supported it .
similar polls found greater dissatisfaction , with as many as 69 percent feeling the constitution would transfer too much power from london to brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk is about to enter european parliament as head of the uk independence party .
british euroskepticism , or the idea that brussels is transforming into a super state with little transparency , also pervaded this month 's european elections .
the anti-eu united kingdom independence party carried 16-percent of the vote , and it 's leader pledged to wreak havoc with the european parliament .
on sunday , the party 's leader , former talk show host robert kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- , compared blair to neville chamberlain , the former british prime minister who famously claimed to have secured " peace in our time " with nazi germany in 1938 , offering a preview of the nasty wrangling in store for the coming months .
" it 's appeasement , " he said .
" there 's tony , he 's waving a piece of paper saying , ' it 's okay , i 've only given a little bit of our sovereignty away . "
the fallout from the european election has been a public relations nightmare for blair , who has said withdrawing from the eu would be disastrous .
" at this moment in time , when europe is actually changing , when there 's growing support for britain 's position in europe , to get out of the european union or marginalize ourselves in decision-making would just be an extraordinary act of foolishness , " the prime minister said .
britain 's opposition conservative party , which fears the establishment of a european federal state in brussels , has called for an immediate referendum .
blair also faces eu skeptics within his own labor party ranks .
a splinter group of labor politicians has established an action group called " labor against a super state . "
other countries follow suit but britain is n't alone in calling for a referendum .
denmark and ireland have said they will hold referendums , and luxembourg , the netherlands , spain and italy are likely to follow suit .
passage in those countries is anything but certain : denmark rejected the maastricht treaty , paving the way for the euro , in 1992 and ireland vetoed the nice treaty , which forged the path to enlargement , in 2001 .
the treaties passed on second votes in both countries , but only after denmark was given " opt outs " from maastricht euro provisions and the eu pledged to ireland its military neutrality would be respected .
for its part , germany does not plan to hold a referendum .
though members of the opposition free democratic party as well as the green party have called for a popular vote , chancellor gerhard schröder has rejected the idea , saying that it , like all other treaties , should be ratified by germany 's parliament , the bundestag .
after the constitution is signed , a move that will likely happen later this year , it must be ratified by the parliaments of all 25 member states within two years .
experts say that if one country rejects the constitution , it may be modified , but if two or more reject it , its ratification would be highly unlikely .
in order to appease the more euroskeptical voices within the european union , like britain and denmark , the final constitution text preserves sensitive national veto rights on issues pertaining to defense , taxation and foreign policy .
the question now is whether those changes will go far enough to unite a european union that is divided by countries promoting more federalist policies in brussels - like germany and france - from those who want to preserve more sovereignty , like britain and denmark . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de constitution faces easy ratification in germany though the new european union constitution faces a bloodbath battle in a handful of european countries , here in germany , it is expected to easily sail through parliament , where it will be given its final blessing .

the capital has long been known as a center for germany 's homosexual community , as documented in the city 's gay museum . berlin 's gay museum is tucked away in the multicultural district of kreuzberg .
established in 1985 , the museum is a private institution dedicated to preserving , exhibiting , and discovering gay and lesbian history , art , and culture . although many organizations around the world collect historical material relevant to gay men and lesbians , the berlin museum is the only institution of its kind which is open full time and has a dedicated building with changing exhibitions open to the public . " we 're planning to open a permanent exhibit on gay history from 1800 - 1970 this december , " said gerrit horbacher , the musem 's spokesman .
" people are often confused when they come here and only see art exhibits .
they ask us where the history is , so that 's something we 'll have on show by the end of the year . " pioneer hirschfeld the museum 's extensive library includes a newspaper and magazine archive , which includes editions of the first gay magazine , " der eigene , " published in germany in 1896 .
" back then , the magazine was not really sold very openly .
instead there was a list of where to send them , and of places where people could buy them , " he said .
" in the 1920 's , it was a lot easier .
then you could find gay and lesbian magazines in kiosks alongside newspapers and mainstream magazines . " in 1897 in berlin , the publishers of " der eigene , " dr. magnus hirschfeld and adolf brand , went on to form the world ’ s first gay liberation movement .
the scientific humanitarian committee was a political group that lobbied the german parliament to abolish the law forbidding homosexuality known as " paragraph 175 , " which had been on the books since 1871 .
modified in 1969 and again in 1973 , the law was eventually abolished in 1994 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1907 german political cartoon depicting sex researcher magnus hirschfeld , " hero of the day , " drumming up support for the abolition of paragraph 175 of the german penal code that criminalized homosexuality .
hirschfeld was a social democrat , a jew and a medical doctor .
he gathered support for the gay cause from german intellectuals and liberal politicians of the time .
the gay museum includes many of his pioneering works . " in 1919 , hirschfeld founded the institute for sexual science , with which he aimed to make people conscious of their sexuality and allow people to live their sexual lives as they wanted , not just according to rules that were dictated by society , " horbacher said .
" he also conducted many surveys on homosexuality , and developed his theory of ‘ the third sex , ' as he called homosexuals . " the golden 1920 's the founding of hirschfeld 's institute coincided with the suffragette movement , shorter skirts , cropped hair for women and the so-called flapper look .
differences between the sexes were being bridged , and gay culture in berlin flourished .
much of the gay nightlife was centered around nollendorfplatz in the schöneberg district of berlin , and still is today .
one of the most famous nightclubs in the 1920 's was the eldorado , which featured a number of transvestite performers . " we 've got coins from the eldorado , which customers used to buy there .
on one side , they show either a gay or lesbian couple dancing together .
the customers would give the coins to one of the transvestites working there , to get a dance .
and at the end of the evening , the transvestites gathered all their coins , and were paid according to how many they 'd managed to collect , " horbacher explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich in " the blue angel " the eldorado also regularly featured then up-and-coming star marlene dietrich -lrb- photo -rrb- , who went on to achieve international fame .
dietrich had left germany by the 1930 's when the nazis came to power . after hitler 's regime took control , all gay and lesbian bars and meeting places in germany were closed .
magnus hirschfeld ’ s institute for sexual science was looted in 1933 by the nazis and his books were burned . " every gay person knew that the nazis did n't like homosexuals , and that they wanted to get rid of them , " horbacher said .
" they started to enforce paragraph 175 , so from 1935 on , it was punishable just to glance at someone of the same sex too intensively .
gay people lived in fear of being denounced by other people , and the police conducted raids , arrested gays , and sent them to concentration camps . " contemporary history while the museum contains much research material documenting the lives of homosexuals in past eras , it also concentrates resources on collecting material on important modern-day developments for gays in germany , such as the country 's new " registered partnership " law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male couple , just married " really , it 's just a kind of gay marriage , " horbacher said , " because there are n't equal rights like in a heterosexual marriage .
there are quite a few couples who are doing it .
in berlin , there are lots of gay marriages , and also the first divorces .
it 's quite normal here . " horbacher said that while the museum attracts many gays and lesbians from berlin and abroad , heterosexuals are also among the patrons .
" they see that there 's a gay museum , and think , ' let 's see what they 've got on display . "
it 's a fun thing for them .
at least they 're open to coming in , and that 's our aim - not only to have gay and lesbian visitors , but also to be of interest to heterosexuals .

the capital has long been known as a center for germany 's homosexual community , as documented in the city 's gay museum . berlin 's gay museum is tucked away in the multicultural district of kreuzberg .
established in 1985 , the museum is a private institution dedicated to preserving , exhibiting , and discovering gay and lesbian history , art , and culture . although many organizations around the world collect historical material relevant to gay men and lesbians , the berlin museum is the only institution of its kind which is open full time and has a dedicated building with changing exhibitions open to the public . " we 're planning to open a permanent exhibit on gay history from 1800 - 1970 this december , " said gerrit horbacher , the musem 's spokesman .
" people are often confused when they come here and only see art exhibits .
they ask us where the history is , so that 's something we 'll have on show by the end of the year . " pioneer hirschfeld the museum 's extensive library includes a newspaper and magazine archive , which includes editions of the first gay magazine , " der eigene , " published in germany in 1896 .
" back then , the magazine was not really sold very openly .
instead there was a list of where to send them , and of places where people could buy them , " he said .
" in the 1920 's , it was a lot easier .
then you could find gay and lesbian magazines in kiosks alongside newspapers and mainstream magazines . " in 1897 in berlin , the publishers of " der eigene , " dr. magnus hirschfeld and adolf brand , went on to form the world ’ s first gay liberation movement .
the scientific humanitarian committee was a political group that lobbied the german parliament to abolish the law forbidding homosexuality known as " paragraph 175 , " which had been on the books since 1871 .
modified in 1969 and again in 1973 , the law was eventually abolished in 1994 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1907 german political cartoon depicting sex researcher magnus hirschfeld , " hero of the day , " drumming up support for the abolition of paragraph 175 of the german penal code that criminalized homosexuality .
hirschfeld was a social democrat , a jew and a medical doctor .
he gathered support for the gay cause from german intellectuals and liberal politicians of the time .
the gay museum includes many of his pioneering works . " in 1919 , hirschfeld founded the institute for sexual science , with which he aimed to make people conscious of their sexuality and allow people to live their sexual lives as they wanted , not just according to rules that were dictated by society , " horbacher said .
" he also conducted many surveys on homosexuality , and developed his theory of ‘ the third sex , ' as he called homosexuals . " the golden 1920 's the founding of hirschfeld 's institute coincided with the suffragette movement , shorter skirts , cropped hair for women and the so-called flapper look .
differences between the sexes were being bridged , and gay culture in berlin flourished .
much of the gay nightlife was centered around nollendorfplatz in the schöneberg district of berlin , and still is today .
one of the most famous nightclubs in the 1920 's was the eldorado , which featured a number of transvestite performers . " we 've got coins from the eldorado , which customers used to buy there .
on one side , they show either a gay or lesbian couple dancing together .
the customers would give the coins to one of the transvestites working there , to get a dance .
and at the end of the evening , the transvestites gathered all their coins , and were paid according to how many they 'd managed to collect , " horbacher explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich in " the blue angel " the eldorado also regularly featured then up-and-coming star marlene dietrich -lrb- photo -rrb- , who went on to achieve international fame .
dietrich had left germany by the 1930 's when the nazis came to power . after hitler 's regime took control , all gay and lesbian bars and meeting places in germany were closed .
magnus hirschfeld ’ s institute for sexual science was looted in 1933 by the nazis and his books were burned . " every gay person knew that the nazis did n't like homosexuals , and that they wanted to get rid of them , " horbacher said .
" they started to enforce paragraph 175 , so from 1935 on , it was punishable just to glance at someone of the same sex too intensively .
gay people lived in fear of being denounced by other people , and the police conducted raids , arrested gays , and sent them to concentration camps . " contemporary history while the museum contains much research material documenting the lives of homosexuals in past eras , it also concentrates resources on collecting material on important modern-day developments for gays in germany , such as the country 's new " registered partnership " law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male couple , just married " really , it 's just a kind of gay marriage , " horbacher said , " because there are n't equal rights like in a heterosexual marriage .
there are quite a few couples who are doing it .
in berlin , there are lots of gay marriages , and also the first divorces .
it 's quite normal here . " horbacher said that while the museum attracts many gays and lesbians from berlin and abroad , heterosexuals are also among the patrons .
" they see that there 's a gay museum , and think , ' let 's see what they 've got on display . "

find out what made the cut and what wound up on the editing floor . what does it do ?
the core of the constitution contains 50 articles describing the duties and responsibilities of the european union .
it also describes the european institutions , including new ones , and defines their authority .
it details how budgets and decision-making in the european union should be done , also setting into stone the new double majority principle for most major legislation .
voting the number of eu policy areas requiring the double majority vote is vastly expanded in the constitution .
however , it does not include a number of issues relating to internal security , foreign policy , budget , tax or economic policy - powers that many european member states wanted to retain in their national capitals .
in many areas that can be determined by double majority votes , the constitution builds in so-called " emergency breaks " that allow countries to impose a one-month veto in order to delay legislation .
in many areas , long grace or transition periods have been built in so countries can adjust from the current requirement of unanimous votes to the new double majority system .
rights the constitution also incorporates the european union 's charter of rights , which describes the rights and freedoms of every citizen of europe .
constitutional court it stipulates that lawsuits based on questions of the constitution must be taken up with the european court of justice in luxembourg .
president , foreign minister significantly , the constitution replaces the current presidency of the european council , which is held on a six-month rotating basis by each member state , with a president who serves a two-and-a-half year term at the helm of the council , stewarding its work and managing its agenda .
the constitution also establishes the office of an eu foreign minister , a position intended to increase the eu 's status abroad as well as to coordinate foreign policy among the eu member states .
streamlined democracy in an effort to streamline brussels bureaucracy , the constitution also reduces the number of commissioners on the european commission from 25 to 18 starting in 2014 .
the constitution also increases the powers of the democratically elected european parliament - giving it equal power as the european council to vote on budgets .
parliament will also have greater influence on the appointment of top eu offices , including the european commission president .
it will also have voting power in almost all policy areas .
secession the constitution also , for the first time , provides regulation for the voluntary secession of a member state .
what is different from earlier drafts or did n't make it into the constitution ?
in the future , decisions in the council of ministers will be made using the double majority principle : a qualified majority has been reached when 55 percent of the european union member states agree on legislation representing 65 percent of the entire eu population .
in order to stop legislation , a blocking minority of at least four countries is required .
until 2014 , each eu member country will be allowed to send a commissioner to the european commission .
after that , two-thirds of member states will be entitled to a commission seat on a rotating basis .
the number of members of the european parliament will be limited to 750 , though smaller member states will have a minimum of six seats and larger members no more than 99 seats in the european parliament .
the ministers reached an agreement on the stability and growth pact , the accord that guarantees the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro .
currently , the european commission has the direct power to take legal action against member states who violate the 3 percent deficit spending cap set in the pact .
in the future , the commission can recommend that action be taken , but such action requires the approval of a qualified majority of eu countries representing three-fifths of the eu 's population in the council of ministers .
there will be no direct reference to god in the constitution .
instead , the countries have agreed to a general reference to europe 's religious and cultural traditions .

the core of the constitution contains 50 articles describing the duties and responsibilities of the european union .
it also describes the european institutions , including new ones , and defines their authority .
it details how budgets and decision-making in the european union should be done , also setting into stone the new double majority principle for most major legislation .
voting the number of eu policy areas requiring the double majority vote is vastly expanded in the constitution .
however , it does not include a number of issues relating to internal security , foreign policy , budget , tax or economic policy - powers that many european member states wanted to retain in their national capitals .
in many areas that can be determined by double majority votes , the constitution builds in so-called " emergency breaks " that allow countries to impose a one-month veto in order to delay legislation .
in many areas , long grace or transition periods have been built in so countries can adjust from the current requirement of unanimous votes to the new double majority system .
rights the constitution also incorporates the european union 's charter of rights , which describes the rights and freedoms of every citizen of europe .

president , foreign minister significantly , the constitution replaces the current presidency of the european council , which is held on a six-month rotating basis by each member state , with a president who serves a two-and-a-half year term at the helm of the council , stewarding its work and managing its agenda .
the constitution also establishes the office of an eu foreign minister , a position intended to increase the eu 's status abroad as well as to coordinate foreign policy among the eu member states .
streamlined democracy in an effort to streamline brussels bureaucracy , the constitution also reduces the number of commissioners on the european commission from 25 to 18 starting in 2014 .
the constitution also increases the powers of the democratically elected european parliament - giving it equal power as the european council to vote on budgets .
parliament will also have greater influence on the appointment of top eu offices , including the european commission president .
it will also have voting power in almost all policy areas .
secession the constitution also , for the first time , provides regulation for the voluntary secession of a member state .
what is different from earlier drafts or did n't make it into the constitution ?
in the future , decisions in the council of ministers will be made using the double majority principle : a qualified majority has been reached when 55 percent of the european union member states agree on legislation representing 65 percent of the entire eu population .
in order to stop legislation , a blocking minority of at least four countries is required .
until 2014 , each eu member country will be allowed to send a commissioner to the european commission .
after that , two-thirds of member states will be entitled to a commission seat on a rotating basis .
the number of members of the european parliament will be limited to 750 , though smaller member states will have a minimum of six seats and larger members no more than 99 seats in the european parliament .
the ministers reached an agreement on the stability and growth pact , the accord that guarantees the stability of europe 's common currency , the euro .
currently , the european commission has the direct power to take legal action against member states who violate the 3 percent deficit spending cap set in the pact .
in the future , the commission can recommend that action be taken , but such action requires the approval of a qualified majority of eu countries representing three-fifths of the eu 's population in the council of ministers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.06.2004 after crushing defeats , social democrats try to regroup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and müntefering say they 'll stay the course the executive committee of germany 's governing social democrat party is meeting on monday to discuss strategy after landslide defeats a week ago in elections in the state of thuringia and for the european parliament . germany 's oldest party is suffering from an identity crisis that is driving its traditional voters away in droves .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are caught between implementing reforms that economists say are necessary if the country wants to compete in the global marketplace and staying true to its fundamental values of protecting the welfare state and looking out for the interests of working people . the strategy session of the spd 's executive committee seeks to draw a course out of the wilderness the party has been stumbling through for the past 18 months .
it is also trying to quell a revolt in the party 's left wing , which is demanding a radical policy course correction . " we must keep to the current course , " rhineland-palatinate 's premier kurt beck told reporters before going into the closed-door meeting .
he called on the party to close ranks and not let the election defeats split the party in two . in last week 's european elections , the spd lost around 2.8 million voters that supported the party five years earlier and its numbers slumped to 21.5 percent .
that defeat was but a continuation of a disastrous series of electoral defeats the party has suffered over the past year and a half , as voters turn away from the traditional party of the working class .
they are angered and alienated by schröder 's unpopular reforms that are meant to provide a kick-start to the german economy , which has been stagnant for three years . analysts say those reforms , which include new fees for doctors visits , cuts to some social benefits and a loosening of labor market rules that protect workers ' jobs , have unnerved the spd base , who see the party embarking on a course of social darwinism . but abandoning schröder 's reforms , which go under the name agenda 2010 , does not appear to be on the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering spd party head franz müntefering , heading a chorus of party leaders , said after consultations with other party leaders on monday there will be no " u-turn " on the reforms . " we have to get our country 's affairs in order with reforms , " said the spd 's deputy parliamentary group leader ludwig stiegler .
berlin 's spd mayor klaus wowereit told reporters before the meeting there was no alternative to agenda 2010 . they are largely echoing the words of chancellor gerhard schröder , who has repeatedly said he will not fundamentally change the course he has set the country on .
over the weekend , he told spd leaders he would rather resign than water down his reform program . new pr offensive ? while many party leaders are lining up behind schröder 's stay-the-course stance , calls have been going out to the executive to put a new spin on the reforms , putting the focus on social justice instead of on the dismantling of the welfare state . they appear to have been heard .
müntefering said on monday there would be new " accentuations " that would make it clear to the public that the reforms are being put in place " for everyone . " " we have to stop this idea that the reform course means doom , " björn böhning , head of the spd 's youth group , told german public television zdf .
he said the government 's zig-zag course and implementation did not make it easier for the electorate to understand what the goals were . " it must be clear to voters what these reforms are for , " michael müller , head of the berlin spd , told zdf on monday .
he said the party should make it clear , for example , that money saved by the reforms would be reinvested in education , a fact that would be received positively by voters . left-wing demands but according to trade unions and other members of the party 's left wing , the spd has already forgotten its roots .
they are repeating demands for a radical course change and a return to traditional social democratic positions . according to heiko maas , spd head in the state of saarland , the only way the current spd government has a chance to win elections again is to recover the " socially just label . " germany 's trade unions warned of a " vehement disagreements " about the party 's future course , saying they and the government need to come to agreement about the reforms and present it to the public .
ursula engelen-kefer , deputy head of the german trade union federation said that while the unions can live with some parts of the current reform plan , other aspects were unacceptable . " we need a correction , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de staying the course despite crushing defeats for the social democratic party in sunday 's european and regional elections , chancellor gerhard schröder pledged to press ahead with his unpopular economic reform program .

will british and danish voters reject it ? in order to become legally binding , europe 's new constitution has to be ratified by the parliaments in each of its 25 member states .
a handful of countries , including those with the most euroskeptical politicians , are planning national referendums that will put the final decision in the hands of voters .
and that could prove to be an even tougher fight than the arm-wrestling and compromises that finally resulted in a final draft in brussels on friday .
facing a difficult re-election campaign that could come as soon as next year , british prime minister tony blair is n't expected to hold a referendum anytime soon .
in fact , he could delay the referendum vote until as late as 2006 , but even that far off , it will still be a tough sell .
" there is no need to rush it , " blair said sunday , kicking off what he conceded would be a " tough battle " for the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair at an eu summit in brussels " this treaty gives us the chance to play a vital part in decision-making at the heart of the european union whilst it protects completely our right to set our taxes , run our foreign policy and defense and do the things that people want us to do , " blair said .
the prime minister said the battle would be between " reality " and " myth . "
the fact is , he said , " we have kept control of taxes , of our policy on immigration , of defense , of foreign policy . "
most brits against constitution but a quick review of the polls show that the majority of british citizens do not agree with 10 downing street .
a survey released over the weekend by pollster yougov for the sunday times newspaper found 49 percent of brits were against ratifying the constitution and only 23 percent supported it .
similar polls found greater dissatisfaction , with as many as 69 percent feeling the constitution would transfer too much power from london to brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk is about to enter european parliament as head of the uk independence party .
british euroskepticism , or the idea that brussels is transforming into a super state with little transparency , also pervaded this month 's european elections .
the anti-eu united kingdom independence party carried 16-percent of the vote , and it 's leader pledged to wreak havoc with the european parliament .
on sunday , the party 's leader , former talk show host robert kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- , compared blair to neville chamberlain , the former british prime minister who famously claimed to have secured " peace in our time " with nazi germany in 1938 , offering a preview of the nasty wrangling in store for the coming months .
" it 's appeasement , " he said .
" there 's tony , he 's waving a piece of paper saying , ' it 's okay , i 've only given a little bit of our sovereignty away . "
the fallout from the european election has been a public relations nightmare for blair , who has said withdrawing from the eu would be disastrous .
" at this moment in time , when europe is actually changing , when there 's growing support for britain 's position in europe , to get out of the european union or marginalize ourselves in decision-making would just be an extraordinary act of foolishness , " the prime minister said .
britain 's opposition conservative party , which fears the establishment of a european federal state in brussels , has called for an immediate referendum .
blair also faces eu skeptics within his own labor party ranks .
a splinter group of labor politicians has established an action group called " labor against a super state . "
other countries follow suit but britain is n't alone in calling for a referendum .
denmark and ireland have said they will hold referendums , and luxembourg , the netherlands , spain and italy are likely to follow suit .
passage in those countries is anything but certain : denmark rejected the maastricht treaty , paving the way for the euro , in 1992 and ireland vetoed the nice treaty , which forged the path to enlargement , in 2001 .
the treaties passed on second votes in both countries , but only after denmark was given " opt outs " from maastricht euro provisions and the eu pledged to ireland its military neutrality would be respected .
for its part , germany does not plan to hold a referendum .
though members of the opposition free democratic party as well as the green party have called for a popular vote , chancellor gerhard schröder has rejected the idea , saying that it , like all other treaties , should be ratified by germany 's parliament , the bundestag .
after the constitution is signed , a move that will likely happen later this year , it must be ratified by the parliaments of all 25 member states within two years .
experts say that if one country rejects the constitution , it may be modified , but if two or more reject it , its ratification would be highly unlikely .
in order to appease the more euroskeptical voices within the european union , like britain and denmark , the final constitution text preserves sensitive national veto rights on issues pertaining to defense , taxation and foreign policy .
the question now is whether those changes will go far enough to unite a european union that is divided by countries promoting more federalist policies in brussels - like germany and france - from those who want to preserve more sovereignty , like britain and denmark . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de constitution faces easy ratification in germany though the new european union constitution faces a bloodbath battle in a handful of european countries , here in germany , it is expected to easily sail through parliament , where it will be given its final blessing .

her pattern sample is within view .
relying on visual judgement and light brushstrokes , the porcelain painter fashions delicate butterflies and berries on a ceramic bowl .
the paints she uses have been mixed according to a secret recipe .
only an expert could immediately tell whether the pattern was painted in the 21st or the 18th century .
europe 's first and oldest porcelain manufacturer in the eastern german city of meissen cultivates the tried and true craft of handmade ceramics , without compromise .
meissen porcelain is the stuff of legend .
the factory was founded in 1710 , and by the mid 1700s , meissen porcelain adorned royal palaces and aristocratic homes across the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of a collection of fürstenberg porcellain owned by duchess anna amalia of weimar though meissen dominated the industry , seven major german factories were also established during the 1700s , all of which enjoyed princely patronage .
one of these was the fürstenberg porcelain manufactory , founded in 1747 .
today , though , the company is at an all-time low .
" our porcelain is a luxury product , and there 's just not much demand for luxury products in germany now , given the current economic situation , " said fürstenberg 's business administration manager , stephanie saalfeld . tough economic times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturing porcelain at kpm in berlin over the past several years , fürstenberg has had to continually let staff go .
in 1996 , the business still had over 200 employees .
now , the number is down to 150 , with another 40 positions to be cut .
" the whole porcelain industry has problems , " saalfeld said .
meissen is no different .
in 2003 , the company was just barely turning a profit .
it cut 100 jobs , and an additional 60 are also threatened .
in august of last year , all departments implemented reduced working hours . searching for a way to stop the decline , some porcelain manufacturers have turned to more streamlined , mechanized production techniques , which make products more affordable .
" fürstenberg is operating to a larger extent with mass-production , " wrote the cologne-based consulting firm bbe in its 2003 report for the glass , porcelain and ceramics industry .
" the larger porcelain manufacturers have integrated much of what was done by hand into their machine-operated processes . " but mass-production is something the 900 porcelain artists working at meissen would n't even dream of doing .
that would see their unique selling point go down the drain . " individual craftsmanship is still synonymous with top quality , " read the bbe report .
that 's good news for meissen , which does n't try to compete with the more affordable mass-produced brands . it 's a strategy that market experts say another prominent , troubled factory - berlin 's königliche porzellan manufaktur -lrb- kpm -rrb- - would be well advised to follow .
kpm is facing insolvency , and a decision is expected to be made soon about possible salvation in the form of privatization . luxury the way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 240-year old terrine from the house of meissen , part of the first china collection at potsdam 's sanssouci castle .
" the best thing for kpm would be a clear decision in favor of luxury , " said thomas kastl , head of the consumer goods trade fair " ambiente " in frankfurt . he points to the fact that , next year , the last trade barriers on the porcelain market are set to fall .
" then there 'll be a flood of high-quality , cheap porcelain from china on the market .
without a strong brand-name strategy , german products will be pushed out of the market , " kastl said . " the middle price segment is destined to disappear .
there 'll be only cheap products , and really expensive products , " predicted professor gert gutjahr from the institute for market psychology in mannheim .
experts say that right now , kpm would n't stand a chance against chinese manufacturers , whereas meissen would .
" who cares about the price when they 're buying a hand-painted , exclusive product ? " confirmed bbe . " it 's only going to become more difficult to determine differences in the quality of the products , " gutjahr explained .
whether a coffee service set is produced by fürstenberg or kpm , or in a no-name factory in china is irrelevant .
" the know-how is so evenly spread now , " gutjahr said , adding that every factories in both germany and china have the same machines needed to manufacture porcelain . branding is everything what separates the cheap products from the more expensive , is the value of the brand .
" in the german patent office , there are around 700,000 protected trademarks listed .
of those , 60,000 are still active on the market , " gutjahr said .
" only 200 are what we 'd call strong brands , and of those , only about 20 are truly sought after . "
these desired brands typically have a long history , as their reputation develops slowly , over several generations .
" on average , you 're talking 80 years , " said gutjahr . # b # meissen has existed for almost 300 years .
royalty , nobility , statesmen and popstars have eaten from the plates marked with the famous blue swords .
the company has 200,000 items in its repertoire and an extensive archive of molds stemming from various epochs .
prices are high , with small painted figurines starting at around € 1,000 each , and five-piece dinnerware settings ranging from € 450 to € 4,500 , depending on the complexity of the pattern .

will british and danish voters reject it ? in order to become legally binding , europe 's new constitution has to be ratified by the parliaments in each of its 25 member states .
a handful of countries , including those with the most euroskeptical politicians , are planning national referendums that will put the final decision in the hands of voters .
and that could prove to be an even tougher fight than the arm-wrestling and compromises that finally resulted in a final draft in brussels on friday .
facing a difficult re-election campaign that could come as soon as next year , british prime minister tony blair is n't expected to hold a referendum anytime soon .
in fact , he could delay the referendum vote until as late as 2006 , but even that far off , it will still be a tough sell .
" there is no need to rush it , " blair said sunday , kicking off what he conceded would be a " tough battle " for the constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair at an eu summit in brussels " this treaty gives us the chance to play a vital part in decision-making at the heart of the european union whilst it protects completely our right to set our taxes , run our foreign policy and defense and do the things that people want us to do , " blair said .
the prime minister said the battle would be between " reality " and " myth . "
the fact is , he said , " we have kept control of taxes , of our policy on immigration , of defense , of foreign policy . "
most brits against constitution but a quick review of the polls show that the majority of british citizens do not agree with 10 downing street .
a survey released over the weekend by pollster yougov for the sunday times newspaper found 49 percent of brits were against ratifying the constitution and only 23 percent supported it .
similar polls found greater dissatisfaction , with as many as 69 percent feeling the constitution would transfer too much power from london to brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert kilroy-silk is about to enter european parliament as head of the uk independence party .
british euroskepticism , or the idea that brussels is transforming into a super state with little transparency , also pervaded this month 's european elections .
the anti-eu united kingdom independence party carried 16-percent of the vote , and it 's leader pledged to wreak havoc with the european parliament .
on sunday , the party 's leader , former talk show host robert kilroy-silk -lrb- photo -rrb- , compared blair to neville chamberlain , the former british prime minister who famously claimed to have secured " peace in our time " with nazi germany in 1938 , offering a preview of the nasty wrangling in store for the coming months .
" it 's appeasement , " he said .
" there 's tony , he 's waving a piece of paper saying , ' it 's okay , i 've only given a little bit of our sovereignty away . "
the fallout from the european election has been a public relations nightmare for blair , who has said withdrawing from the eu would be disastrous .
" at this moment in time , when europe is actually changing , when there 's growing support for britain 's position in europe , to get out of the european union or marginalize ourselves in decision-making would just be an extraordinary act of foolishness , " the prime minister said .
britain 's opposition conservative party , which fears the establishment of a european federal state in brussels , has called for an immediate referendum .
blair also faces eu skeptics within his own labor party ranks .
a splinter group of labor politicians has established an action group called " labor against a super state . "
other countries follow suit but britain is n't alone in calling for a referendum .
denmark and ireland have said they will hold referendums , and luxembourg , the netherlands , spain and italy are likely to follow suit .
passage in those countries is anything but certain : denmark rejected the maastricht treaty , paving the way for the euro , in 1992 and ireland vetoed the nice treaty , which forged the path to enlargement , in 2001 .
the treaties passed on second votes in both countries , but only after denmark was given " opt outs " from maastricht euro provisions and the eu pledged to ireland its military neutrality would be respected .
for its part , germany does not plan to hold a referendum .
though members of the opposition free democratic party as well as the green party have called for a popular vote , chancellor gerhard schröder has rejected the idea , saying that it , like all other treaties , should be ratified by germany 's parliament , the bundestag .
after the constitution is signed , a move that will likely happen later this year , it must be ratified by the parliaments of all 25 member states within two years .
experts say that if one country rejects the constitution , it may be modified , but if two or more reject it , its ratification would be highly unlikely .
in order to appease the more euroskeptical voices within the european union , like britain and denmark , the final constitution text preserves sensitive national veto rights on issues pertaining to defense , taxation and foreign policy .
the question now is whether those changes will go far enough to unite a european union that is divided by countries promoting more federalist policies in brussels - like germany and france - from those who want to preserve more sovereignty , like britain and denmark . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de constitution faces easy ratification in germany though the new european union constitution faces a bloodbath battle in a handful of european countries , here in germany , it is expected to easily sail through parliament , where it will be given its final blessing .

the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are caught between implementing reforms that economists say are necessary if the country wants to compete in the global marketplace and staying true to its fundamental values of protecting the welfare state and looking out for the interests of working people . the strategy session of the spd 's executive committee seeks to draw a course out of the wilderness the party has been stumbling through for the past 18 months .
it is also trying to quell a revolt in the party 's left wing , which is demanding a radical policy course correction . " we must keep to the current course , " rhineland-palatinate 's premier kurt beck told reporters before going into the closed-door meeting .
he called on the party to close ranks and not let the election defeats split the party in two . in last week 's european elections , the spd lost around 2.8 million voters that supported the party five years earlier and its numbers slumped to 21.5 percent .
that defeat was but a continuation of a disastrous series of electoral defeats the party has suffered over the past year and a half , as voters turn away from the traditional party of the working class .
they are angered and alienated by schröder 's unpopular reforms that are meant to provide a kick-start to the german economy , which has been stagnant for three years . analysts say those reforms , which include new fees for doctors visits , cuts to some social benefits and a loosening of labor market rules that protect workers ' jobs , have unnerved the spd base , who see the party embarking on a course of social darwinism . but abandoning schröder 's reforms , which go under the name agenda 2010 , does not appear to be on the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering spd party head franz müntefering , heading a chorus of party leaders , said after consultations with other party leaders on monday there will be no " u-turn " on the reforms . " we have to get our country 's affairs in order with reforms , " said the spd 's deputy parliamentary group leader ludwig stiegler .
berlin 's spd mayor klaus wowereit told reporters before the meeting there was no alternative to agenda 2010 . they are largely echoing the words of chancellor gerhard schröder , who has repeatedly said he will not fundamentally change the course he has set the country on .
over the weekend , he told spd leaders he would rather resign than water down his reform program . new pr offensive ? while many party leaders are lining up behind schröder 's stay-the-course stance , calls have been going out to the executive to put a new spin on the reforms , putting the focus on social justice instead of on the dismantling of the welfare state . they appear to have been heard .
müntefering said on monday there would be new " accentuations " that would make it clear to the public that the reforms are being put in place " for everyone . " " we have to stop this idea that the reform course means doom , " björn böhning , head of the spd 's youth group , told german public television zdf .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.06.2004 luxury the path to survival for porcelain makers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tradition has its price germany 's historic porcelain manufacturers are threatened with extinction unless they capitalize on the qualities of craftsmanship that will also place them squarely in the category of luxury labels only . irina haberland 's desk lamp is tilted at a precise angle .
her pattern sample is within view .
relying on visual judgement and light brushstrokes , the porcelain painter fashions delicate butterflies and berries on a ceramic bowl .
the paints she uses have been mixed according to a secret recipe .
only an expert could immediately tell whether the pattern was painted in the 21st or the 18th century .
europe 's first and oldest porcelain manufacturer in the eastern german city of meissen cultivates the tried and true craft of handmade ceramics , without compromise .
meissen porcelain is the stuff of legend .
the factory was founded in 1710 , and by the mid 1700s , meissen porcelain adorned royal palaces and aristocratic homes across the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of a collection of fürstenberg porcellain owned by duchess anna amalia of weimar though meissen dominated the industry , seven major german factories were also established during the 1700s , all of which enjoyed princely patronage .
one of these was the fürstenberg porcelain manufactory , founded in 1747 .
today , though , the company is at an all-time low .
" our porcelain is a luxury product , and there 's just not much demand for luxury products in germany now , given the current economic situation , " said fürstenberg 's business administration manager , stephanie saalfeld . tough economic times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturing porcelain at kpm in berlin over the past several years , fürstenberg has had to continually let staff go .
in 1996 , the business still had over 200 employees .
now , the number is down to 150 , with another 40 positions to be cut .
" the whole porcelain industry has problems , " saalfeld said .
meissen is no different .
in 2003 , the company was just barely turning a profit .
it cut 100 jobs , and an additional 60 are also threatened .
in august of last year , all departments implemented reduced working hours . searching for a way to stop the decline , some porcelain manufacturers have turned to more streamlined , mechanized production techniques , which make products more affordable .
" fürstenberg is operating to a larger extent with mass-production , " wrote the cologne-based consulting firm bbe in its 2003 report for the glass , porcelain and ceramics industry .
" the larger porcelain manufacturers have integrated much of what was done by hand into their machine-operated processes . " but mass-production is something the 900 porcelain artists working at meissen would n't even dream of doing .
that would see their unique selling point go down the drain . " individual craftsmanship is still synonymous with top quality , " read the bbe report .
that 's good news for meissen , which does n't try to compete with the more affordable mass-produced brands . it 's a strategy that market experts say another prominent , troubled factory - berlin 's königliche porzellan manufaktur -lrb- kpm -rrb- - would be well advised to follow .
kpm is facing insolvency , and a decision is expected to be made soon about possible salvation in the form of privatization . luxury the way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 240-year old terrine from the house of meissen , part of the first china collection at potsdam 's sanssouci castle .
" the best thing for kpm would be a clear decision in favor of luxury , " said thomas kastl , head of the consumer goods trade fair " ambiente " in frankfurt . he points to the fact that , next year , the last trade barriers on the porcelain market are set to fall .
" then there 'll be a flood of high-quality , cheap porcelain from china on the market .
without a strong brand-name strategy , german products will be pushed out of the market , " kastl said . " the middle price segment is destined to disappear .
there 'll be only cheap products , and really expensive products , " predicted professor gert gutjahr from the institute for market psychology in mannheim .
experts say that right now , kpm would n't stand a chance against chinese manufacturers , whereas meissen would .
" who cares about the price when they 're buying a hand-painted , exclusive product ? " confirmed bbe . " it 's only going to become more difficult to determine differences in the quality of the products , " gutjahr explained .
whether a coffee service set is produced by fürstenberg or kpm , or in a no-name factory in china is irrelevant .
" the know-how is so evenly spread now , " gutjahr said , adding that every factories in both germany and china have the same machines needed to manufacture porcelain . branding is everything what separates the cheap products from the more expensive , is the value of the brand .
" in the german patent office , there are around 700,000 protected trademarks listed .
of those , 60,000 are still active on the market , " gutjahr said .
" only 200 are what we 'd call strong brands , and of those , only about 20 are truly sought after . "
these desired brands typically have a long history , as their reputation develops slowly , over several generations .
" on average , you 're talking 80 years , " said gutjahr . # b # meissen has existed for almost 300 years .
royalty , nobility , statesmen and popstars have eaten from the plates marked with the famous blue swords .
the company has 200,000 items in its repertoire and an extensive archive of molds stemming from various epochs .
prices are high , with small painted figurines starting at around € 1,000 each , and five-piece dinnerware settings ranging from € 450 to € 4,500 , depending on the complexity of the pattern .
but maintaining high prices could just be the best way of securing the company 's future . ingun arnold -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nokia 's jetset mobile : it blings and rings five years ago mobile phones were the latest rage .

the capital has long been known as a center for germany 's homosexual community , as documented in the city 's gay museum . berlin 's gay museum is tucked away in the multicultural district of kreuzberg .
established in 1985 , the museum is a private institution dedicated to preserving , exhibiting , and discovering gay and lesbian history , art , and culture . although many organizations around the world collect historical material relevant to gay men and lesbians , the berlin museum is the only institution of its kind which is open full time and has a dedicated building with changing exhibitions open to the public . " we 're planning to open a permanent exhibit on gay history from 1800 - 1970 this december , " said gerrit horbacher , the musem 's spokesman .
" people are often confused when they come here and only see art exhibits .
they ask us where the history is , so that 's something we 'll have on show by the end of the year . " pioneer hirschfeld the museum 's extensive library includes a newspaper and magazine archive , which includes editions of the first gay magazine , " der eigene , " published in germany in 1896 .
" back then , the magazine was not really sold very openly .
instead there was a list of where to send them , and of places where people could buy them , " he said .
" in the 1920 's , it was a lot easier .
then you could find gay and lesbian magazines in kiosks alongside newspapers and mainstream magazines . " in 1897 in berlin , the publishers of " der eigene , " dr. magnus hirschfeld and adolf brand , went on to form the world ’ s first gay liberation movement .
the scientific humanitarian committee was a political group that lobbied the german parliament to abolish the law forbidding homosexuality known as " paragraph 175 , " which had been on the books since 1871 .
modified in 1969 and again in 1973 , the law was eventually abolished in 1994 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1907 german political cartoon depicting sex researcher magnus hirschfeld , " hero of the day , " drumming up support for the abolition of paragraph 175 of the german penal code that criminalized homosexuality .
hirschfeld was a social democrat , a jew and a medical doctor .
he gathered support for the gay cause from german intellectuals and liberal politicians of the time .
the gay museum includes many of his pioneering works . " in 1919 , hirschfeld founded the institute for sexual science , with which he aimed to make people conscious of their sexuality and allow people to live their sexual lives as they wanted , not just according to rules that were dictated by society , " horbacher said .
" he also conducted many surveys on homosexuality , and developed his theory of ‘ the third sex , ' as he called homosexuals . " the golden 1920 's the founding of hirschfeld 's institute coincided with the suffragette movement , shorter skirts , cropped hair for women and the so-called flapper look .
differences between the sexes were being bridged , and gay culture in berlin flourished .
much of the gay nightlife was centered around nollendorfplatz in the schöneberg district of berlin , and still is today .
one of the most famous nightclubs in the 1920 's was the eldorado , which featured a number of transvestite performers . " we 've got coins from the eldorado , which customers used to buy there .
on one side , they show either a gay or lesbian couple dancing together .
the customers would give the coins to one of the transvestites working there , to get a dance .
and at the end of the evening , the transvestites gathered all their coins , and were paid according to how many they 'd managed to collect , " horbacher explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich in " the blue angel " the eldorado also regularly featured then up-and-coming star marlene dietrich -lrb- photo -rrb- , who went on to achieve international fame .
dietrich had left germany by the 1930 's when the nazis came to power . after hitler 's regime took control , all gay and lesbian bars and meeting places in germany were closed .
magnus hirschfeld ’ s institute for sexual science was looted in 1933 by the nazis and his books were burned . " every gay person knew that the nazis did n't like homosexuals , and that they wanted to get rid of them , " horbacher said .
" they started to enforce paragraph 175 , so from 1935 on , it was punishable just to glance at someone of the same sex too intensively .
gay people lived in fear of being denounced by other people , and the police conducted raids , arrested gays , and sent them to concentration camps . " contemporary history while the museum contains much research material documenting the lives of homosexuals in past eras , it also concentrates resources on collecting material on important modern-day developments for gays in germany , such as the country 's new " registered partnership " law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male couple , just married " really , it 's just a kind of gay marriage , " horbacher said , " because there are n't equal rights like in a heterosexual marriage .
there are quite a few couples who are doing it .
in berlin , there are lots of gay marriages , and also the first divorces .
it 's quite normal here . " horbacher said that while the museum attracts many gays and lesbians from berlin and abroad , heterosexuals are also among the patrons .
" they see that there 's a gay museum , and think , ' let 's see what they 've got on display . "
it 's a fun thing for them .
at least they 're open to coming in , and that 's our aim - not only to have gay and lesbian visitors , but also to be of interest to heterosexuals .

sixty years later , the painter 's work , which is roughly analogous to the art-world version of the diary of anne frank , is being shown in a major retrospective in frankfurt .
the museum is seeking not only to tell salomon 's story , but also to build the reputation of someone it considers to be one of the last century 's important artists .
the exhibition includes salomon 's paintings , gouaches , writings and music .
" charlotte salomon : life ?
or theater ? " runs through august 22 .
it is open tuesday and friday through sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
on wednesday and thursdays , the museum is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links zacheta gallery , warsaw fondation cartier , paris unterlinden museum -lrb- in french -rrb- german hygiene museum , dresden -lrb- in german -rrb- städel museum , frankfurt 9798 dw-tv europe live in focus we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

europe 's first and oldest porcelain manufacturer in the eastern german city of meissen cultivates the tried and true craft of handmade ceramics , without compromise .
meissen porcelain is the stuff of legend .
the factory was founded in 1710 , and by the mid 1700s , meissen porcelain adorned royal palaces and aristocratic homes across the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of a collection of fürstenberg porcellain owned by duchess anna amalia of weimar though meissen dominated the industry , seven major german factories were also established during the 1700s , all of which enjoyed princely patronage .
one of these was the fürstenberg porcelain manufactory , founded in 1747 .
today , though , the company is at an all-time low .
" our porcelain is a luxury product , and there 's just not much demand for luxury products in germany now , given the current economic situation , " said fürstenberg 's business administration manager , stephanie saalfeld . tough economic times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturing porcelain at kpm in berlin over the past several years , fürstenberg has had to continually let staff go .
in 1996 , the business still had over 200 employees .
now , the number is down to 150 , with another 40 positions to be cut .
" the whole porcelain industry has problems , " saalfeld said .
meissen is no different .
in 2003 , the company was just barely turning a profit .
it cut 100 jobs , and an additional 60 are also threatened .
in august of last year , all departments implemented reduced working hours . searching for a way to stop the decline , some porcelain manufacturers have turned to more streamlined , mechanized production techniques , which make products more affordable .
" fürstenberg is operating to a larger extent with mass-production , " wrote the cologne-based consulting firm bbe in its 2003 report for the glass , porcelain and ceramics industry .
" the larger porcelain manufacturers have integrated much of what was done by hand into their machine-operated processes . " but mass-production is something the 900 porcelain artists working at meissen would n't even dream of doing .
that would see their unique selling point go down the drain . " individual craftsmanship is still synonymous with top quality , " read the bbe report .
that 's good news for meissen , which does n't try to compete with the more affordable mass-produced brands . it 's a strategy that market experts say another prominent , troubled factory - berlin 's königliche porzellan manufaktur -lrb- kpm -rrb- - would be well advised to follow .
kpm is facing insolvency , and a decision is expected to be made soon about possible salvation in the form of privatization . luxury the way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 240-year old terrine from the house of meissen , part of the first china collection at potsdam 's sanssouci castle .
" the best thing for kpm would be a clear decision in favor of luxury , " said thomas kastl , head of the consumer goods trade fair " ambiente " in frankfurt . he points to the fact that , next year , the last trade barriers on the porcelain market are set to fall .
" then there 'll be a flood of high-quality , cheap porcelain from china on the market .
without a strong brand-name strategy , german products will be pushed out of the market , " kastl said . " the middle price segment is destined to disappear .
there 'll be only cheap products , and really expensive products , " predicted professor gert gutjahr from the institute for market psychology in mannheim .
experts say that right now , kpm would n't stand a chance against chinese manufacturers , whereas meissen would .
" who cares about the price when they 're buying a hand-painted , exclusive product ? " confirmed bbe . " it 's only going to become more difficult to determine differences in the quality of the products , " gutjahr explained .
whether a coffee service set is produced by fürstenberg or kpm , or in a no-name factory in china is irrelevant .
" the know-how is so evenly spread now , " gutjahr said , adding that every factories in both germany and china have the same machines needed to manufacture porcelain . branding is everything what separates the cheap products from the more expensive , is the value of the brand .
" in the german patent office , there are around 700,000 protected trademarks listed .
of those , 60,000 are still active on the market , " gutjahr said .
" only 200 are what we 'd call strong brands , and of those , only about 20 are truly sought after . "

the 5,000-year-old world heritage site was open to the public , following earlier years in which it was closed amid fears of damage to the stones .
some 150 police were on site this year , and a number of people were arrested for climbing on the stones and other offences , a bbc correspondent said .
misty skies had obscured the 0458 bst sunrise for about 30 minutes , she said .
other years have seen battles between police and revellers , including the infamous 1985 encounter , dubbed the battle of beanfield .
a violent confrontation between 300 people who wanted to reach the stones and the police saw 12 people hospitalised . "
the fire symbolically welcomes the sun for the longest day of the year , part of the seasonal wheel which we as druids and pagans celebrate " king arthur pendragon this year police issued several warnings and said anybody going to the site was liable to be searched .
the constabulary added that traffic on the a303 and a360 next to the site was expected to be very busy during monday morning .
english heritage , which looks after the site , also issued strict rules .
those attending were only allowed a small amount of alcohol for personal use .
and only acoustic instruments were allowed .
inside the ring , thousands packed around groups of drummers and other musicians while some took the opportunity to sprawl on the ancient stones normally beyond public reach .
' celebration ' but the focus of the activity was on an impromptu open-air dance next to the famous heal stone , the marker for sunrise on summer solstice .
druid leader " king arthur pendragon " presided over the festivities standing amid a ring of flaming torches overshadowed by a pair of giant horns , lit by burning branches .
" king arthur " , who adopted the name in 1986 to denote his position as " battle chieftain of the council of british druids " , said the festivities marked the imminent arrival of dawn .
