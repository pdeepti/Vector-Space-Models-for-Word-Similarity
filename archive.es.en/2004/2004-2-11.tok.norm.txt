several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .
experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed . many germans were shocked last week when they saw video footage of a group of students who physically abused one of their class mates .
up to 10 students at a vocational school in hildesheim in northern germany were allegedly involved in beating and humiliating a 17-year-old , kicking him , forcing him to brush his teeth with a wire brush and smearing motor oil on his genitalia .
the abuse apparently continued for months and took place during school hours in a storage room while the teacher remained in the classroom next door . five of the alleged abusers have been jailed so far and prosecutors are investigating the teacher 's apparent failure to supervise his class . on monday , a second case of abuse at another vocational school in nearby hannover made the news .
two 16-year-old students , a boy and a girl , were allegedly abused by five classmates .
the boy was repeatedly beaten with a rubber hammer in a changing room ; the girl was reportedly sexually abused . in the last week , several more cases have come into the open .
in bavaria , a 13-year-old boy was allegedly beaten unconscious by several students at a bus stop in the town of coburg .
in a town near munich , three students allegedly filmed themselves beating a 14-year-old over several weeks .
in the southwestern german state of rhineland-palatinate , a 16-year-old student was jailed for allegedly beating a schoolmate . early intervention needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-hermann sölter , center , in front of his school in hildesheim .
the case in hildesheim has created the most uproar , causing officials to call for the installation of video cameras to prevent further incidents .
" it 's one of the options we 're looking at , " hans-herrman sölter -lrb- photo -rrb- , the school 's principal , told reporters . but experts said video cameras wo n't help to prevent similar incidents in the future .
" cameras can be destroyed or covered up , " angela ittel , who researches teenage behavior at berlin 's free university , told dw-world .
schools instead need to create a sense of community and involve students in the decision-making process . " you have to reach out to the students and that 's not really happening right now , " ittel said , adding that in general , school violence is not on the rise in germany . teachers also have to make sure they deal with problems early on , said mechthild schäfer , an expert on teenage bullying at ludwig-maximilians-university in munich .
she added that teachers should also enforce " basic rules of democracy " in their classrooms and prevent a culture in which swearing and abuse is accepted . in order to prepare teachers better for their jobs , they should also receive pedagogic training during their university education , schäfer said .
so far , prospective secondary school teachers are almost exclusively trained in the subject areas they plan to teach , but don ’ t get much guidance on how to interact with students . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de student killed in school shooting spree a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine .

the german government is set to contribute to small eu military units proposed by france and britain to stabilize crisis zones .
should eu members approve , they could be operating by 2007 . french and british officials announced the plan on tuesday , saying they each intend to set up one unit , which would be made up of 1,500 soldiers .
they emphasized that the proposal would not conflict with nato 's planned response force of 21,000 troops or an earlier eu plan to create a military unit comprised of 60,000 soldiers . " the objective is to have a new tool for europeans which will not compete with others , " a french foreign ministry spokesman told reuters news agency .
" it allows the europeans to be present -lrb- in a crisis -rrb- . "
reuters also quoted a senior diplomat , who said germany would fund an additional unit , with hopes that italy , spain and poland would join in as well .
groups of smaller member states could form multinational units . in and out within 45 days the soldiers would serve as a stabilizing force in crisis regions until u.n. peacekeepers can be sent there .
groups should be ready for deployment within 15 days and serve a maximum of 30 days .
the teams would be similar to a french-led military unit that was sent to the democratic republic of congo last year .
operation " artemis " focused on keeping things under control and securing infrastructure until un troops arrived .
germany participated in this operation , albeit only with logistical support . should the eu approve the proposal , seven or eight units could be up and running by 2007 . france , britain and germany hope to get the green light from other member states by june .
the three countries ' leaders , french president jacques chirac , britain 's premier tony blair and german chancellor gerhard schröder , are expected to discuss the issue at a meeting in berlin on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.02.2004 schröder 's reluctant cabinet to allow gmo foods großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nature or bt-176 ?
german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday approved a bill regulating the cultivation of genetically modified organisms .
the bill would make it legal for german farmers and supermarkets to sell gmo goods . the bill passed by germany 's ministers aims to codify european union legislation and guidelines for the cultivation and export of genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- into national law . several days ago , eu consumer protection commissioner david byrne criticized the german government for dragging its feet on regulating the export and import of gm foodstuffs out of fears that the products could swamp the market .
but with a new set of regulations in place , eu member states no longer have the right to exclude gmos from their territory , neither from cultivation nor from supermarket shelves . on wednesday , german agriculture minister renate künast conceded that her ministry could no longer prevent the cultivation of gm crops in germany .
but she pledged that her office would closely monitor crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast bei der eröffnung der fruit logistica " should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighboring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits , " künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" such lawsuits may be initiated if , for instance , a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . ” critics : gmos dangerous but opponents of the use of gmos are not convinced .
they claim that not enough scientific evidence is available to gauge the impact of what they call gm-contaminated foodstuffs on humans .
" genetically modified crops in general are dangerous for human health and also for the environment because what the g.e. -lrb- genetic engineering -rrb- industry is doing is putting new genes into new organisms , like taking a growth gene from a fish and putting it in a tomato , " said ulrike brendel of greenpeace germany .
" and of course nobody can predict what effects such a crude effort is having on human food and the environment . "
industry leaders claim that if the eu does not jump onto the gmo cultivation bandwagon , the continent may be left behind , then the continent will be left behind and put at a technological disadvantage over other countries who have deployed the cutting-edge agricultural methods .
but that may be a little off the mark , since few countries have adopted gmo foodstuffs despite a decade of attempts by american companies to promote genetically engineered agricultural technologies .
around 70 percent of land devoted to genetically engineered crops is in the united states , with almost all of the rest in argentina and canada . most other countries have been put off by the potential risks .
safeguards for conventional farmers the new german bill doesn ’ t specify what steps gmo farmers here will have to do to protect neighboring areas from being effected by their crops .
but in the event of contamination , the bill would allow for lawsuits to be filed and heard swiftly .
" should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighbouring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , " künast said , " the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits .
such lawsuits may be initiated , if for instance a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . "
künast also pointed out that it will be largely up to consumers to decide whether gmo foodstuffs become a major success in germany .
mandatory labeling within the european union informs consumers whether a product contains gmos and thus gives them the freedom to decide what they want to place on their dinner tables .
the bill must still be approved in a vote by germany 's parliament , the bundestag . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain : the promised land for gm corn spain is home to the greatest amount of genetically modified food production in europe .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday approved a bill regulating the cultivation of genetically modified organisms .
the bill would make it legal for german farmers and supermarkets to sell gmo goods . the bill passed by germany 's ministers aims to codify european union legislation and guidelines for the cultivation and export of genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- into national law . several days ago , eu consumer protection commissioner david byrne criticized the german government for dragging its feet on regulating the export and import of gm foodstuffs out of fears that the products could swamp the market .
but with a new set of regulations in place , eu member states no longer have the right to exclude gmos from their territory , neither from cultivation nor from supermarket shelves . on wednesday , german agriculture minister renate künast conceded that her ministry could no longer prevent the cultivation of gm crops in germany .
but she pledged that her office would closely monitor crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast bei der eröffnung der fruit logistica " should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighboring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits , " künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" such lawsuits may be initiated if , for instance , a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . ” critics : gmos dangerous but opponents of the use of gmos are not convinced .
they claim that not enough scientific evidence is available to gauge the impact of what they call gm-contaminated foodstuffs on humans .
" genetically modified crops in general are dangerous for human health and also for the environment because what the g.e. -lrb- genetic engineering -rrb- industry is doing is putting new genes into new organisms , like taking a growth gene from a fish and putting it in a tomato , " said ulrike brendel of greenpeace germany .
" and of course nobody can predict what effects such a crude effort is having on human food and the environment . "
industry leaders claim that if the eu does not jump onto the gmo cultivation bandwagon , the continent may be left behind , then the continent will be left behind and put at a technological disadvantage over other countries who have deployed the cutting-edge agricultural methods .
but that may be a little off the mark , since few countries have adopted gmo foodstuffs despite a decade of attempts by american companies to promote genetically engineered agricultural technologies .
around 70 percent of land devoted to genetically engineered crops is in the united states , with almost all of the rest in argentina and canada . most other countries have been put off by the potential risks .
safeguards for conventional farmers the new german bill doesn ’ t specify what steps gmo farmers here will have to do to protect neighboring areas from being effected by their crops .
but in the event of contamination , the bill would allow for lawsuits to be filed and heard swiftly .
" should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighbouring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , " künast said , " the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits .
such lawsuits may be initiated , if for instance a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . "
künast also pointed out that it will be largely up to consumers to decide whether gmo foodstuffs become a major success in germany .
mandatory labeling within the european union informs consumers whether a product contains gmos and thus gives them the freedom to decide what they want to place on their dinner tables .
the bill must still be approved in a vote by germany 's parliament , the bundestag . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain : the promised land for gm corn spain is home to the greatest amount of genetically modified food production in europe .
the experience gained there could prove valuable for germany and the rest europe .

several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .
experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed . many germans were shocked last week when they saw video footage of a group of students who physically abused one of their class mates .
up to 10 students at a vocational school in hildesheim in northern germany were allegedly involved in beating and humiliating a 17-year-old , kicking him , forcing him to brush his teeth with a wire brush and smearing motor oil on his genitalia .
the abuse apparently continued for months and took place during school hours in a storage room while the teacher remained in the classroom next door . five of the alleged abusers have been jailed so far and prosecutors are investigating the teacher 's apparent failure to supervise his class . on monday , a second case of abuse at another vocational school in nearby hannover made the news .
two 16-year-old students , a boy and a girl , were allegedly abused by five classmates .
the boy was repeatedly beaten with a rubber hammer in a changing room ; the girl was reportedly sexually abused . in the last week , several more cases have come into the open .
in bavaria , a 13-year-old boy was allegedly beaten unconscious by several students at a bus stop in the town of coburg .
in a town near munich , three students allegedly filmed themselves beating a 14-year-old over several weeks .
in the southwestern german state of rhineland-palatinate , a 16-year-old student was jailed for allegedly beating a schoolmate . early intervention needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-hermann sölter , center , in front of his school in hildesheim .
the case in hildesheim has created the most uproar , causing officials to call for the installation of video cameras to prevent further incidents .
" it 's one of the options we 're looking at , " hans-herrman sölter -lrb- photo -rrb- , the school 's principal , told reporters . but experts said video cameras wo n't help to prevent similar incidents in the future .
" cameras can be destroyed or covered up , " angela ittel , who researches teenage behavior at berlin 's free university , told dw-world .
schools instead need to create a sense of community and involve students in the decision-making process . " you have to reach out to the students and that 's not really happening right now , " ittel said , adding that in general , school violence is not on the rise in germany . teachers also have to make sure they deal with problems early on , said mechthild schäfer , an expert on teenage bullying at ludwig-maximilians-university in munich .
she added that teachers should also enforce " basic rules of democracy " in their classrooms and prevent a culture in which swearing and abuse is accepted . in order to prepare teachers better for their jobs , they should also receive pedagogic training during their university education , schäfer said .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday approved a bill regulating the cultivation of genetically modified organisms .
the bill would make it legal for german farmers and supermarkets to sell gmo goods . the bill passed by germany 's ministers aims to codify european union legislation and guidelines for the cultivation and export of genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- into national law . several days ago , eu consumer protection commissioner david byrne criticized the german government for dragging its feet on regulating the export and import of gm foodstuffs out of fears that the products could swamp the market .
but with a new set of regulations in place , eu member states no longer have the right to exclude gmos from their territory , neither from cultivation nor from supermarket shelves . on wednesday , german agriculture minister renate künast conceded that her ministry could no longer prevent the cultivation of gm crops in germany .

" such lawsuits may be initiated if , for instance , a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . ” critics : gmos dangerous but opponents of the use of gmos are not convinced .
they claim that not enough scientific evidence is available to gauge the impact of what they call gm-contaminated foodstuffs on humans .
" genetically modified crops in general are dangerous for human health and also for the environment because what the g.e. -lrb- genetic engineering -rrb- industry is doing is putting new genes into new organisms , like taking a growth gene from a fish and putting it in a tomato , " said ulrike brendel of greenpeace germany .
" and of course nobody can predict what effects such a crude effort is having on human food and the environment . "
industry leaders claim that if the eu does not jump onto the gmo cultivation bandwagon , the continent may be left behind , then the continent will be left behind and put at a technological disadvantage over other countries who have deployed the cutting-edge agricultural methods .

several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .
experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed . many germans were shocked last week when they saw video footage of a group of students who physically abused one of their class mates .
up to 10 students at a vocational school in hildesheim in northern germany were allegedly involved in beating and humiliating a 17-year-old , kicking him , forcing him to brush his teeth with a wire brush and smearing motor oil on his genitalia .
the abuse apparently continued for months and took place during school hours in a storage room while the teacher remained in the classroom next door . five of the alleged abusers have been jailed so far and prosecutors are investigating the teacher 's apparent failure to supervise his class . on monday , a second case of abuse at another vocational school in nearby hannover made the news .
two 16-year-old students , a boy and a girl , were allegedly abused by five classmates .
the boy was repeatedly beaten with a rubber hammer in a changing room ; the girl was reportedly sexually abused . in the last week , several more cases have come into the open .
in bavaria , a 13-year-old boy was allegedly beaten unconscious by several students at a bus stop in the town of coburg .
in a town near munich , three students allegedly filmed themselves beating a 14-year-old over several weeks .

the experience gained there could prove valuable for germany and the rest europe . the use of genetically modified organisms remains a hot-button topic throughout most of european union .
and the german government , led by the social democrats and the greens , is n't exactly seen as a friend of the gmo industry .
indeed , the pesticide and crop care industry association agrar on wednesday criticized remarks made by consumer protection minister renate künast , a skeptic of gmos , and a new government bill the industry says would inhibit the fair use of so-called " green genetic technologies " rather than permit them as intended .
but as germany continues to debate how to deal with gmos , it could look to the lessons learned in spain , where gmos have been widely embraced .
the eu frontrunner in gm food production cultivates 32,000 hectares -lrb- 79,000 acres -rrb- of gm crops .
bt-176 is one of the spanish farmer 's gm corns of choice .
it 's designed to be resistant to weeds and other pests , including the crop-wasting european corn borer .
the fat white caterpillars regularly chew through catalonian farmers ' corn fields , ruining entire harvests .
while few conventional varieties of corn can survive the onslaughts , bt-176 crops remain unaffected .
" we spanish farmers have had very good experiences with gm corn .
with a minimum of pesticides we have pests under control , " jesus ribera of the spanish young farmers association told deutsche welle .
" that 's good for the environment and good for the farmers because we do n't lose any crops now . "
greater yields , more money spanish farmers are practically encouraged to cultivate gm corn .
they reap greater crops and animal feed producers are willing to pay premium for the corn .
additionally , they are unhindered by any restrictions from the spanish agricultural ministry .
" when someone consciously decides to sow gm corn , we know who does it where - and it 's fine , " said luis bayon of the ecological agriculture committee in madrid .
" but it 's something else if someone thinks they 're sowing conventional corn and genetically modified seeds are actually there . "
the incident in navarra no one knows exactly what happens when the wind blows gm corn pollen onto conventional fields .
but in 2001 , organic farmers in northern spanish region of navarra were prohibited from selling their corn as organic because gm stock had strayed onto their fields .
as yet , no fault has been determined in the case and the farmers have not been compensated .
the spanish government has commissioned the university of barcelona to investigate the consequences of genetic transfers , but the results of the research has not yet been released .
nevertheless , the government in madrid approved five new sorts of gm corn in the last five years .
protest has come mostly from the usual suspects , including environmentalists such as greenpeace .
and even though many spanish supermarket chains have " zero genetic technology " tolerance policies , the concerns of environmentalists and convention farmers are often plowed over .
" the conventional farmers do n't want to allow any kind of commingling so that their harvest is pure , " said ribera .
" that 's why they now have a problem .

others borrow money from relatives or friends or call colleagues who owe them a favor to help out for free , she added . video 's the way to go the video boom came after nigeria 's movie theaters started losing customers during an economic downturn in the 1980s .

" i do n't think anyone from the west can understand what it 's like to build an industry without any help from the state , " said brenda goldblatt , a south african filmmaker who recently made a documentary on nollywood .
" these films are companions in life for people .
in the west , there 's nothing like the depth of the relationship -lrb- between viewers and movies -rrb- . " movies people can relate to what 's produced looks a lot like latin american telenovelas and has little to do with hollywood blockbusters .
viewers seem to like it that way .
renting american-made films in the video stores costs half as much as nollywood productions , but the imports still collect dust on the shelves . " most nigerians don ’ t want to watch ' terminator 3 , " ' fiberesima said .
" they want to watch ' real love ' or ' true love ' or ' saving alero , " ' she added , referring to recent nigerian releases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 200,000 copies are sold per film .
unlike bollywood films - melodramatic productions from india - not all nollywood movies are similar , as fiberesima , amata and their colleagues are eager to point out .
" it 's not a style of making films , it 's the nigerian market for films , " said jeta amata , a 29-year-old director , producer and actor who has already made 40 movies .
he added that all he wants to do is entertain his countrymen . " it 's a cultural thing of appreciating home , " fiberesima said , adding that nigerians can relate to the stories about crime , love , sex , and power which are set in their neighborhoods .
while some films focus on rituals and myths from a specific ethnic group , " most of the films talk to everybody , " she said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale 2004 read , watch and listen to dw-world 's entire 2004 berlinale coverage .

dw-tv and the international film festival invited three young female documentary film makers to berlin to participate in workshops with accomplished colleagues . it took six long weeks of wrestling with the afghan authorities to get visas and exit permits for the three film makers .
gul makai ranjbar , halima hussiani and shakeba adill had a hard time getting to germany and the berlinale talent campus . although they had the support of international television broadcaster dw-tv and the german foreign ministry , it became increasingly doubtful whether they would be able to make the journey at all .
to cap it all off , the weather almost put an end to their plans .
the bundeswehr plane that was to bring the three young women safely to germany had to leave a day earlier than planned . from the airport in berlin , gul makai , halima and shakeba had to go straight to the " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " event at the haus der kulturen der welt the house of world cultures , which took place last sunday . after finally arriving , they told the young audience at the talent campus about their work and lives in one of the poorest and most crisis-ridden countries in the world .
they also presented excerpts from two of their films . dressed in jeans , sweaters and leather jackets , only their heads covered with the traditional hijab or headscarf , the women sat on the podium while talking about their work to iranian writer , documentary film maker and afghanistan expert , siba shakib , who hosted the discussion and acted as their interpreter . siba shakib presented the aïna media center in her introduction .
independent from the government , aïna is an afghan-french project that has been running for two years and has built up a network of independent journalists and media in afghanistan .
gul makai , halima and shakeba were trained through aïna and are now , with the aid of the organisation , producing their own films . " afghanistan unveiled " gul makai , who is 22-years-old , said that she had never known a life without war .
her father and brothers are dead , and even as a young girl she had to work to feed the family , despite having an injured leg . hard as this life may seem , it 's all too common in afghanistan .
apart from depicting the years of war against the russians , the three film makers concentrated on the reign of terror carried out by the radical islamic taliban .
the six years of their dictatorship were known to have been especially cruel for afghanistan 's female population . the film makers travelled to the afghan countryside to make their documentary film " afghanistan unveiled " .
it was probably the first time that women had travelled into the rural provinces alone .
they talked to women about their life and their experiences under the taliban .
whether they were female nomads with machine guns in their tents , or cave dwellers in the bamian valley , where the taliban destroyed the giant statues of buddha , their stories are very similar .
they deal with murder , rape and destruction , with unimaginable violence and contempt for the people , especially the women . the young film makers found filming an intense and disturbing experience .
during their courageous work , they learned much about their own country and its inhabitants .
afghanistan is a country full of cultural variety , they saidl . the desolate countryside and harsh climate make basic living conditions very difficult for its people . critiquing the new afghanistan another important subject is the period since the end of the taliban regime .
life in afghanistan is still far from any kind of normality .
a critical view of the situation is presented in the women 's second film , " shadows " , the sequel to " afghanistan unveiled " .
while kabul university prefers to enroll students with money and the right contacts , in the provinces , women and girls are still being abducted and raped .
there is a considerable amount of work left before there is real freedom of expression and the press . all the same , gul makai , halima and shakeba say that there have been great improvements in the direction of freedom .
what people in afghanistan need most for social change after such a long period of destructive chaos is time .
the presence of isaf , the international security assistance force , and the americans is necessary at the moment to ensure relative calm in the country .
in the long term , the afghans would like to develop their future identity free from external influences . gul makai , halima and shakeba are sure that their informative films will contribute to bringing about change in afghanistan .
the strength and intelligence , the involvement and self-confidence of these three young women provides hope for the future of their country . at the end of the discussion , günter knabe , deutsche welle 's afghanistan expert , spoke about " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " as a representative of the international broadcaster and organiser of the event .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : berlinale 2004 berlin goes berlinale lord of the films germany boosts profile of home-grown filmmakers abroad young film makers gather at talent campus culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.02.2004 afghan film makers at the berlinale talent campus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " afghanistan : film , freedom , future “ was the panel 's topic .
dw-tv and the international film festival invited three young female documentary film makers to berlin to participate in workshops with accomplished colleagues . it took six long weeks of wrestling with the afghan authorities to get visas and exit permits for the three film makers .
gul makai ranjbar , halima hussiani and shakeba adill had a hard time getting to germany and the berlinale talent campus . although they had the support of international television broadcaster dw-tv and the german foreign ministry , it became increasingly doubtful whether they would be able to make the journey at all .
to cap it all off , the weather almost put an end to their plans .
the bundeswehr plane that was to bring the three young women safely to germany had to leave a day earlier than planned . from the airport in berlin , gul makai , halima and shakeba had to go straight to the " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " event at the haus der kulturen der welt the house of world cultures , which took place last sunday . after finally arriving , they told the young audience at the talent campus about their work and lives in one of the poorest and most crisis-ridden countries in the world .
they also presented excerpts from two of their films . dressed in jeans , sweaters and leather jackets , only their heads covered with the traditional hijab or headscarf , the women sat on the podium while talking about their work to iranian writer , documentary film maker and afghanistan expert , siba shakib , who hosted the discussion and acted as their interpreter . siba shakib presented the aïna media center in her introduction .
independent from the government , aïna is an afghan-french project that has been running for two years and has built up a network of independent journalists and media in afghanistan .
gul makai , halima and shakeba were trained through aïna and are now , with the aid of the organisation , producing their own films . " afghanistan unveiled " gul makai , who is 22-years-old , said that she had never known a life without war .
her father and brothers are dead , and even as a young girl she had to work to feed the family , despite having an injured leg . hard as this life may seem , it 's all too common in afghanistan .
apart from depicting the years of war against the russians , the three film makers concentrated on the reign of terror carried out by the radical islamic taliban .
the six years of their dictatorship were known to have been especially cruel for afghanistan 's female population . the film makers travelled to the afghan countryside to make their documentary film " afghanistan unveiled " .
it was probably the first time that women had travelled into the rural provinces alone .
they talked to women about their life and their experiences under the taliban .
whether they were female nomads with machine guns in their tents , or cave dwellers in the bamian valley , where the taliban destroyed the giant statues of buddha , their stories are very similar .
they deal with murder , rape and destruction , with unimaginable violence and contempt for the people , especially the women . the young film makers found filming an intense and disturbing experience .
during their courageous work , they learned much about their own country and its inhabitants .
afghanistan is a country full of cultural variety , they saidl . the desolate countryside and harsh climate make basic living conditions very difficult for its people . critiquing the new afghanistan another important subject is the period since the end of the taliban regime .
life in afghanistan is still far from any kind of normality .
a critical view of the situation is presented in the women 's second film , " shadows " , the sequel to " afghanistan unveiled " .
while kabul university prefers to enroll students with money and the right contacts , in the provinces , women and girls are still being abducted and raped .
there is a considerable amount of work left before there is real freedom of expression and the press . all the same , gul makai , halima and shakeba say that there have been great improvements in the direction of freedom .
what people in afghanistan need most for social change after such a long period of destructive chaos is time .
the presence of isaf , the international security assistance force , and the americans is necessary at the moment to ensure relative calm in the country .
in the long term , the afghans would like to develop their future identity free from external influences . gul makai , halima and shakeba are sure that their informative films will contribute to bringing about change in afghanistan .
the strength and intelligence , the involvement and self-confidence of these three young women provides hope for the future of their country . at the end of the discussion , günter knabe , deutsche welle 's afghanistan expert , spoke about " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " as a representative of the international broadcaster and organiser of the event .
he introduced the audience to dw-tv 's afghan program which broadcasts daily in dari and pashtu , and the donation campaign : " 100 classrooms for afghanistan " which was sponsored by the aid organisation cap anamur and deutsche welle .

several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .
experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed . many germans were shocked last week when they saw video footage of a group of students who physically abused one of their class mates .
up to 10 students at a vocational school in hildesheim in northern germany were allegedly involved in beating and humiliating a 17-year-old , kicking him , forcing him to brush his teeth with a wire brush and smearing motor oil on his genitalia .
the abuse apparently continued for months and took place during school hours in a storage room while the teacher remained in the classroom next door . five of the alleged abusers have been jailed so far and prosecutors are investigating the teacher 's apparent failure to supervise his class . on monday , a second case of abuse at another vocational school in nearby hannover made the news .
two 16-year-old students , a boy and a girl , were allegedly abused by five classmates .
the boy was repeatedly beaten with a rubber hammer in a changing room ; the girl was reportedly sexually abused . in the last week , several more cases have come into the open .
in bavaria , a 13-year-old boy was allegedly beaten unconscious by several students at a bus stop in the town of coburg .
in a town near munich , three students allegedly filmed themselves beating a 14-year-old over several weeks .
in the southwestern german state of rhineland-palatinate , a 16-year-old student was jailed for allegedly beating a schoolmate . early intervention needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-hermann sölter , center , in front of his school in hildesheim .
the case in hildesheim has created the most uproar , causing officials to call for the installation of video cameras to prevent further incidents .
" it 's one of the options we 're looking at , " hans-herrman sölter -lrb- photo -rrb- , the school 's principal , told reporters . but experts said video cameras wo n't help to prevent similar incidents in the future .
" cameras can be destroyed or covered up , " angela ittel , who researches teenage behavior at berlin 's free university , told dw-world .
schools instead need to create a sense of community and involve students in the decision-making process . " you have to reach out to the students and that 's not really happening right now , " ittel said , adding that in general , school violence is not on the rise in germany . teachers also have to make sure they deal with problems early on , said mechthild schäfer , an expert on teenage bullying at ludwig-maximilians-university in munich .
she added that teachers should also enforce " basic rules of democracy " in their classrooms and prevent a culture in which swearing and abuse is accepted . in order to prepare teachers better for their jobs , they should also receive pedagogic training during their university education , schäfer said .
so far , prospective secondary school teachers are almost exclusively trained in the subject areas they plan to teach , but don ’ t get much guidance on how to interact with students . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de student killed in school shooting spree a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine .

south africa might be the special focus at this year 's berlin film festival , but the continent 's movie industry epicenter seems to lie further north : thousands of low-budget pictures are released in nigeria every year . when hollywood star charlize theron recently told reporters that it took just 28 days to shoot her latest film , " monster , " an appreciative murmur went through the room .
any nigerian filmmakers present must have chuckled a little - shooting a movie in five days sounds about right to them . " i 've made 25 films over the last five years , " charles novia , a nigerian director and producer , told his audience at a panel discussion on " nollywood , " nigeria 's booming movie industry in berlin this week .
equipped with a video camera , a script and often as little as € 5,000 , novia and his colleagues churn out up to 50 feature-length films every week . " sometimes people sell their cars to start a film , " said peace fiberesima , another producer and director .
others borrow money from relatives or friends or call colleagues who owe them a favor to help out for free , she added . video 's the way to go the video boom came after nigeria 's movie theaters started losing customers during an economic downturn in the 1980s .
while many of the theaters have now been turned into churches , about 200,000 people earn their money through working for the movies .
estimates of the industry 's revenue range from € 95 million -lrb- $ 121 million -rrb- to € 680 million . " i did n't believe what they were telling me , " said dorothee wenner , who works for the berlinale 's international forum and organized the two-day event at berlin 's hebbel am ufer theater .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.02.2004 german schools struggle with bullying großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these two are posing , but others struggle with the real thing .
several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .
experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed . many germans were shocked last week when they saw video footage of a group of students who physically abused one of their class mates .
up to 10 students at a vocational school in hildesheim in northern germany were allegedly involved in beating and humiliating a 17-year-old , kicking him , forcing him to brush his teeth with a wire brush and smearing motor oil on his genitalia .
the abuse apparently continued for months and took place during school hours in a storage room while the teacher remained in the classroom next door . five of the alleged abusers have been jailed so far and prosecutors are investigating the teacher 's apparent failure to supervise his class . on monday , a second case of abuse at another vocational school in nearby hannover made the news .
two 16-year-old students , a boy and a girl , were allegedly abused by five classmates .
the boy was repeatedly beaten with a rubber hammer in a changing room ; the girl was reportedly sexually abused . in the last week , several more cases have come into the open .
in bavaria , a 13-year-old boy was allegedly beaten unconscious by several students at a bus stop in the town of coburg .
in a town near munich , three students allegedly filmed themselves beating a 14-year-old over several weeks .
in the southwestern german state of rhineland-palatinate , a 16-year-old student was jailed for allegedly beating a schoolmate . early intervention needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-hermann sölter , center , in front of his school in hildesheim .
the case in hildesheim has created the most uproar , causing officials to call for the installation of video cameras to prevent further incidents .
" it 's one of the options we 're looking at , " hans-herrman sölter -lrb- photo -rrb- , the school 's principal , told reporters . but experts said video cameras wo n't help to prevent similar incidents in the future .
" cameras can be destroyed or covered up , " angela ittel , who researches teenage behavior at berlin 's free university , told dw-world .
schools instead need to create a sense of community and involve students in the decision-making process . " you have to reach out to the students and that 's not really happening right now , " ittel said , adding that in general , school violence is not on the rise in germany . teachers also have to make sure they deal with problems early on , said mechthild schäfer , an expert on teenage bullying at ludwig-maximilians-university in munich .
she added that teachers should also enforce " basic rules of democracy " in their classrooms and prevent a culture in which swearing and abuse is accepted . in order to prepare teachers better for their jobs , they should also receive pedagogic training during their university education , schäfer said .
so far , prospective secondary school teachers are almost exclusively trained in the subject areas they plan to teach , but don ’ t get much guidance on how to interact with students . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de student killed in school shooting spree a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine .

dw-tv and the international film festival invited three young female documentary film makers to berlin to participate in workshops with accomplished colleagues . it took six long weeks of wrestling with the afghan authorities to get visas and exit permits for the three film makers .
gul makai ranjbar , halima hussiani and shakeba adill had a hard time getting to germany and the berlinale talent campus . although they had the support of international television broadcaster dw-tv and the german foreign ministry , it became increasingly doubtful whether they would be able to make the journey at all .
to cap it all off , the weather almost put an end to their plans .
the bundeswehr plane that was to bring the three young women safely to germany had to leave a day earlier than planned . from the airport in berlin , gul makai , halima and shakeba had to go straight to the " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " event at the haus der kulturen der welt the house of world cultures , which took place last sunday . after finally arriving , they told the young audience at the talent campus about their work and lives in one of the poorest and most crisis-ridden countries in the world .
they also presented excerpts from two of their films . dressed in jeans , sweaters and leather jackets , only their heads covered with the traditional hijab or headscarf , the women sat on the podium while talking about their work to iranian writer , documentary film maker and afghanistan expert , siba shakib , who hosted the discussion and acted as their interpreter . siba shakib presented the aïna media center in her introduction .
independent from the government , aïna is an afghan-french project that has been running for two years and has built up a network of independent journalists and media in afghanistan .
gul makai , halima and shakeba were trained through aïna and are now , with the aid of the organisation , producing their own films . " afghanistan unveiled " gul makai , who is 22-years-old , said that she had never known a life without war .
her father and brothers are dead , and even as a young girl she had to work to feed the family , despite having an injured leg . hard as this life may seem , it 's all too common in afghanistan .
apart from depicting the years of war against the russians , the three film makers concentrated on the reign of terror carried out by the radical islamic taliban .
the six years of their dictatorship were known to have been especially cruel for afghanistan 's female population . the film makers travelled to the afghan countryside to make their documentary film " afghanistan unveiled " .
it was probably the first time that women had travelled into the rural provinces alone .
they talked to women about their life and their experiences under the taliban .
whether they were female nomads with machine guns in their tents , or cave dwellers in the bamian valley , where the taliban destroyed the giant statues of buddha , their stories are very similar .
they deal with murder , rape and destruction , with unimaginable violence and contempt for the people , especially the women . the young film makers found filming an intense and disturbing experience .
during their courageous work , they learned much about their own country and its inhabitants .
afghanistan is a country full of cultural variety , they saidl . the desolate countryside and harsh climate make basic living conditions very difficult for its people . critiquing the new afghanistan another important subject is the period since the end of the taliban regime .
life in afghanistan is still far from any kind of normality .
a critical view of the situation is presented in the women 's second film , " shadows " , the sequel to " afghanistan unveiled " .
while kabul university prefers to enroll students with money and the right contacts , in the provinces , women and girls are still being abducted and raped .
there is a considerable amount of work left before there is real freedom of expression and the press . all the same , gul makai , halima and shakeba say that there have been great improvements in the direction of freedom .
what people in afghanistan need most for social change after such a long period of destructive chaos is time .
the presence of isaf , the international security assistance force , and the americans is necessary at the moment to ensure relative calm in the country .
in the long term , the afghans would like to develop their future identity free from external influences . gul makai , halima and shakeba are sure that their informative films will contribute to bringing about change in afghanistan .
the strength and intelligence , the involvement and self-confidence of these three young women provides hope for the future of their country . at the end of the discussion , günter knabe , deutsche welle 's afghanistan expert , spoke about " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " as a representative of the international broadcaster and organiser of the event .
he introduced the audience to dw-tv 's afghan program which broadcasts daily in dari and pashtu , and the donation campaign : " 100 classrooms for afghanistan " which was sponsored by the aid organisation cap anamur and deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : berlinale 2004 berlin goes berlinale lord of the films germany boosts profile of home-grown filmmakers abroad young film makers gather at talent campus culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.02.2004 afghan film makers at the berlinale talent campus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " afghanistan : film , freedom , future “ was the panel 's topic .
dw-tv and the international film festival invited three young female documentary film makers to berlin to participate in workshops with accomplished colleagues . it took six long weeks of wrestling with the afghan authorities to get visas and exit permits for the three film makers .
gul makai ranjbar , halima hussiani and shakeba adill had a hard time getting to germany and the berlinale talent campus . although they had the support of international television broadcaster dw-tv and the german foreign ministry , it became increasingly doubtful whether they would be able to make the journey at all .
to cap it all off , the weather almost put an end to their plans .
the bundeswehr plane that was to bring the three young women safely to germany had to leave a day earlier than planned . from the airport in berlin , gul makai , halima and shakeba had to go straight to the " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " event at the haus der kulturen der welt the house of world cultures , which took place last sunday . after finally arriving , they told the young audience at the talent campus about their work and lives in one of the poorest and most crisis-ridden countries in the world .
they also presented excerpts from two of their films . dressed in jeans , sweaters and leather jackets , only their heads covered with the traditional hijab or headscarf , the women sat on the podium while talking about their work to iranian writer , documentary film maker and afghanistan expert , siba shakib , who hosted the discussion and acted as their interpreter . siba shakib presented the aïna media center in her introduction .
independent from the government , aïna is an afghan-french project that has been running for two years and has built up a network of independent journalists and media in afghanistan .
gul makai , halima and shakeba were trained through aïna and are now , with the aid of the organisation , producing their own films . " afghanistan unveiled " gul makai , who is 22-years-old , said that she had never known a life without war .
her father and brothers are dead , and even as a young girl she had to work to feed the family , despite having an injured leg . hard as this life may seem , it 's all too common in afghanistan .
apart from depicting the years of war against the russians , the three film makers concentrated on the reign of terror carried out by the radical islamic taliban .
the six years of their dictatorship were known to have been especially cruel for afghanistan 's female population . the film makers travelled to the afghan countryside to make their documentary film " afghanistan unveiled " .
it was probably the first time that women had travelled into the rural provinces alone .
they talked to women about their life and their experiences under the taliban .
whether they were female nomads with machine guns in their tents , or cave dwellers in the bamian valley , where the taliban destroyed the giant statues of buddha , their stories are very similar .
they deal with murder , rape and destruction , with unimaginable violence and contempt for the people , especially the women . the young film makers found filming an intense and disturbing experience .
during their courageous work , they learned much about their own country and its inhabitants .
afghanistan is a country full of cultural variety , they saidl . the desolate countryside and harsh climate make basic living conditions very difficult for its people . critiquing the new afghanistan another important subject is the period since the end of the taliban regime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.02.2004 german schools struggle with bullying großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these two are posing , but others struggle with the real thing .
several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .
experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed . many germans were shocked last week when they saw video footage of a group of students who physically abused one of their class mates .
up to 10 students at a vocational school in hildesheim in northern germany were allegedly involved in beating and humiliating a 17-year-old , kicking him , forcing him to brush his teeth with a wire brush and smearing motor oil on his genitalia .
the abuse apparently continued for months and took place during school hours in a storage room while the teacher remained in the classroom next door . five of the alleged abusers have been jailed so far and prosecutors are investigating the teacher 's apparent failure to supervise his class . on monday , a second case of abuse at another vocational school in nearby hannover made the news .
two 16-year-old students , a boy and a girl , were allegedly abused by five classmates .
the boy was repeatedly beaten with a rubber hammer in a changing room ; the girl was reportedly sexually abused . in the last week , several more cases have come into the open .
in bavaria , a 13-year-old boy was allegedly beaten unconscious by several students at a bus stop in the town of coburg .
in a town near munich , three students allegedly filmed themselves beating a 14-year-old over several weeks .
in the southwestern german state of rhineland-palatinate , a 16-year-old student was jailed for allegedly beating a schoolmate . early intervention needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-hermann sölter , center , in front of his school in hildesheim .
the case in hildesheim has created the most uproar , causing officials to call for the installation of video cameras to prevent further incidents .
" it 's one of the options we 're looking at , " hans-herrman sölter -lrb- photo -rrb- , the school 's principal , told reporters . but experts said video cameras wo n't help to prevent similar incidents in the future .
" cameras can be destroyed or covered up , " angela ittel , who researches teenage behavior at berlin 's free university , told dw-world .
schools instead need to create a sense of community and involve students in the decision-making process .

several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .
experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed . many germans were shocked last week when they saw video footage of a group of students who physically abused one of their class mates .
up to 10 students at a vocational school in hildesheim in northern germany were allegedly involved in beating and humiliating a 17-year-old , kicking him , forcing him to brush his teeth with a wire brush and smearing motor oil on his genitalia .
the abuse apparently continued for months and took place during school hours in a storage room while the teacher remained in the classroom next door . five of the alleged abusers have been jailed so far and prosecutors are investigating the teacher 's apparent failure to supervise his class . on monday , a second case of abuse at another vocational school in nearby hannover made the news .
two 16-year-old students , a boy and a girl , were allegedly abused by five classmates .
the boy was repeatedly beaten with a rubber hammer in a changing room ; the girl was reportedly sexually abused . in the last week , several more cases have come into the open .
in bavaria , a 13-year-old boy was allegedly beaten unconscious by several students at a bus stop in the town of coburg .
in a town near munich , three students allegedly filmed themselves beating a 14-year-old over several weeks .

the case in hildesheim has created the most uproar , causing officials to call for the installation of video cameras to prevent further incidents .
" it 's one of the options we 're looking at , " hans-herrman sölter -lrb- photo -rrb- , the school 's principal , told reporters . but experts said video cameras wo n't help to prevent similar incidents in the future .

south africa might be the special focus at this year 's berlin film festival , but the continent 's movie industry epicenter seems to lie further north : thousands of low-budget pictures are released in nigeria every year . when hollywood star charlize theron recently told reporters that it took just 28 days to shoot her latest film , " monster , " an appreciative murmur went through the room .
any nigerian filmmakers present must have chuckled a little - shooting a movie in five days sounds about right to them . " i 've made 25 films over the last five years , " charles novia , a nigerian director and producer , told his audience at a panel discussion on " nollywood , " nigeria 's booming movie industry in berlin this week .
equipped with a video camera , a script and often as little as € 5,000 , novia and his colleagues churn out up to 50 feature-length films every week . " sometimes people sell their cars to start a film , " said peace fiberesima , another producer and director .
others borrow money from relatives or friends or call colleagues who owe them a favor to help out for free , she added . video 's the way to go the video boom came after nigeria 's movie theaters started losing customers during an economic downturn in the 1980s .
while many of the theaters have now been turned into churches , about 200,000 people earn their money through working for the movies .

nollywood booms without government funding .
in fact , nigeria 's movie industry , which is centered in the country 's former capital , lagos -lrb- photo -rrb- , pays the government about € 3.5 million per year to censor its products , according to fiberesima . " i do n't think anyone from the west can understand what it 's like to build an industry without any help from the state , " said brenda goldblatt , a south african filmmaker who recently made a documentary on nollywood .
" these films are companions in life for people .

renting american-made films in the video stores costs half as much as nollywood productions , but the imports still collect dust on the shelves . " most nigerians don ’ t want to watch ' terminator 3 , " ' fiberesima said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.02.2004 spain : the promised land for gm corn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : golden fields of gmos spain is home to the greatest amount of genetically modified food production in europe .
the experience gained there could prove valuable for germany and the rest europe . the use of genetically modified organisms remains a hot-button topic throughout most of european union .
and the german government , led by the social democrats and the greens , is n't exactly seen as a friend of the gmo industry .
indeed , the pesticide and crop care industry association agrar on wednesday criticized remarks made by consumer protection minister renate künast , a skeptic of gmos , and a new government bill the industry says would inhibit the fair use of so-called " green genetic technologies " rather than permit them as intended .
but as germany continues to debate how to deal with gmos , it could look to the lessons learned in spain , where gmos have been widely embraced .
the eu frontrunner in gm food production cultivates 32,000 hectares -lrb- 79,000 acres -rrb- of gm crops .
bt-176 is one of the spanish farmer 's gm corns of choice .
it 's designed to be resistant to weeds and other pests , including the crop-wasting european corn borer .
the fat white caterpillars regularly chew through catalonian farmers ' corn fields , ruining entire harvests .
while few conventional varieties of corn can survive the onslaughts , bt-176 crops remain unaffected .
" we spanish farmers have had very good experiences with gm corn .
with a minimum of pesticides we have pests under control , " jesus ribera of the spanish young farmers association told deutsche welle .
" that 's good for the environment and good for the farmers because we do n't lose any crops now . "
greater yields , more money spanish farmers are practically encouraged to cultivate gm corn .
they reap greater crops and animal feed producers are willing to pay premium for the corn .
additionally , they are unhindered by any restrictions from the spanish agricultural ministry .
" when someone consciously decides to sow gm corn , we know who does it where - and it 's fine , " said luis bayon of the ecological agriculture committee in madrid .
" but it 's something else if someone thinks they 're sowing conventional corn and genetically modified seeds are actually there . "
the incident in navarra no one knows exactly what happens when the wind blows gm corn pollen onto conventional fields .
but in 2001 , organic farmers in northern spanish region of navarra were prohibited from selling their corn as organic because gm stock had strayed onto their fields .
as yet , no fault has been determined in the case and the farmers have not been compensated .
the spanish government has commissioned the university of barcelona to investigate the consequences of genetic transfers , but the results of the research has not yet been released .
nevertheless , the government in madrid approved five new sorts of gm corn in the last five years .
protest has come mostly from the usual suspects , including environmentalists such as greenpeace .
and even though many spanish supermarket chains have " zero genetic technology " tolerance policies , the concerns of environmentalists and convention farmers are often plowed over .
" the conventional farmers do n't want to allow any kind of commingling so that their harvest is pure , " said ribera .
" that 's why they now have a problem .

the experience gained there could prove valuable for germany and the rest europe . the use of genetically modified organisms remains a hot-button topic throughout most of european union .
and the german government , led by the social democrats and the greens , is n't exactly seen as a friend of the gmo industry .
indeed , the pesticide and crop care industry association agrar on wednesday criticized remarks made by consumer protection minister renate künast , a skeptic of gmos , and a new government bill the industry says would inhibit the fair use of so-called " green genetic technologies " rather than permit them as intended .
but as germany continues to debate how to deal with gmos , it could look to the lessons learned in spain , where gmos have been widely embraced .
the eu frontrunner in gm food production cultivates 32,000 hectares -lrb- 79,000 acres -rrb- of gm crops .
bt-176 is one of the spanish farmer 's gm corns of choice .
it 's designed to be resistant to weeds and other pests , including the crop-wasting european corn borer .
the fat white caterpillars regularly chew through catalonian farmers ' corn fields , ruining entire harvests .
while few conventional varieties of corn can survive the onslaughts , bt-176 crops remain unaffected .
" we spanish farmers have had very good experiences with gm corn .
with a minimum of pesticides we have pests under control , " jesus ribera of the spanish young farmers association told deutsche welle .
" that 's good for the environment and good for the farmers because we do n't lose any crops now . "
greater yields , more money spanish farmers are practically encouraged to cultivate gm corn .
they reap greater crops and animal feed producers are willing to pay premium for the corn .
additionally , they are unhindered by any restrictions from the spanish agricultural ministry .
" when someone consciously decides to sow gm corn , we know who does it where - and it 's fine , " said luis bayon of the ecological agriculture committee in madrid .
" but it 's something else if someone thinks they 're sowing conventional corn and genetically modified seeds are actually there . "
the incident in navarra no one knows exactly what happens when the wind blows gm corn pollen onto conventional fields .
but in 2001 , organic farmers in northern spanish region of navarra were prohibited from selling their corn as organic because gm stock had strayed onto their fields .
as yet , no fault has been determined in the case and the farmers have not been compensated .
the spanish government has commissioned the university of barcelona to investigate the consequences of genetic transfers , but the results of the research has not yet been released .
nevertheless , the government in madrid approved five new sorts of gm corn in the last five years .
protest has come mostly from the usual suspects , including environmentalists such as greenpeace .
and even though many spanish supermarket chains have " zero genetic technology " tolerance policies , the concerns of environmentalists and convention farmers are often plowed over .
" the conventional farmers do n't want to allow any kind of commingling so that their harvest is pure , " said ribera .
" that 's why they now have a problem .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday approved a bill regulating the cultivation of genetically modified organisms .
the bill would make it legal for german farmers and supermarkets to sell gmo goods . the bill passed by germany 's ministers aims to codify european union legislation and guidelines for the cultivation and export of genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- into national law . several days ago , eu consumer protection commissioner david byrne criticized the german government for dragging its feet on regulating the export and import of gm foodstuffs out of fears that the products could swamp the market .
but with a new set of regulations in place , eu member states no longer have the right to exclude gmos from their territory , neither from cultivation nor from supermarket shelves . on wednesday , german agriculture minister renate künast conceded that her ministry could no longer prevent the cultivation of gm crops in germany .
but she pledged that her office would closely monitor crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast bei der eröffnung der fruit logistica " should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighboring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits , " künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" such lawsuits may be initiated if , for instance , a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . ” critics : gmos dangerous but opponents of the use of gmos are not convinced .
they claim that not enough scientific evidence is available to gauge the impact of what they call gm-contaminated foodstuffs on humans .
" genetically modified crops in general are dangerous for human health and also for the environment because what the g.e. -lrb- genetic engineering -rrb- industry is doing is putting new genes into new organisms , like taking a growth gene from a fish and putting it in a tomato , " said ulrike brendel of greenpeace germany .
" and of course nobody can predict what effects such a crude effort is having on human food and the environment . "
industry leaders claim that if the eu does not jump onto the gmo cultivation bandwagon , the continent may be left behind , then the continent will be left behind and put at a technological disadvantage over other countries who have deployed the cutting-edge agricultural methods .
but that may be a little off the mark , since few countries have adopted gmo foodstuffs despite a decade of attempts by american companies to promote genetically engineered agricultural technologies .
around 70 percent of land devoted to genetically engineered crops is in the united states , with almost all of the rest in argentina and canada . most other countries have been put off by the potential risks .
safeguards for conventional farmers the new german bill doesn ’ t specify what steps gmo farmers here will have to do to protect neighboring areas from being effected by their crops .
but in the event of contamination , the bill would allow for lawsuits to be filed and heard swiftly .

künast also pointed out that it will be largely up to consumers to decide whether gmo foodstuffs become a major success in germany .
mandatory labeling within the european union informs consumers whether a product contains gmos and thus gives them the freedom to decide what they want to place on their dinner tables .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday approved a bill regulating the cultivation of genetically modified organisms .
the bill would make it legal for german farmers and supermarkets to sell gmo goods . the bill passed by germany 's ministers aims to codify european union legislation and guidelines for the cultivation and export of genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- into national law . several days ago , eu consumer protection commissioner david byrne criticized the german government for dragging its feet on regulating the export and import of gm foodstuffs out of fears that the products could swamp the market .
but with a new set of regulations in place , eu member states no longer have the right to exclude gmos from their territory , neither from cultivation nor from supermarket shelves . on wednesday , german agriculture minister renate künast conceded that her ministry could no longer prevent the cultivation of gm crops in germany .
but she pledged that her office would closely monitor crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast bei der eröffnung der fruit logistica " should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighboring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits , " künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" such lawsuits may be initiated if , for instance , a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . ” critics : gmos dangerous but opponents of the use of gmos are not convinced .
they claim that not enough scientific evidence is available to gauge the impact of what they call gm-contaminated foodstuffs on humans .
" genetically modified crops in general are dangerous for human health and also for the environment because what the g.e. -lrb- genetic engineering -rrb- industry is doing is putting new genes into new organisms , like taking a growth gene from a fish and putting it in a tomato , " said ulrike brendel of greenpeace germany .
" and of course nobody can predict what effects such a crude effort is having on human food and the environment . "
industry leaders claim that if the eu does not jump onto the gmo cultivation bandwagon , the continent may be left behind , then the continent will be left behind and put at a technological disadvantage over other countries who have deployed the cutting-edge agricultural methods .
but that may be a little off the mark , since few countries have adopted gmo foodstuffs despite a decade of attempts by american companies to promote genetically engineered agricultural technologies .
around 70 percent of land devoted to genetically engineered crops is in the united states , with almost all of the rest in argentina and canada . most other countries have been put off by the potential risks .
safeguards for conventional farmers the new german bill doesn ’ t specify what steps gmo farmers here will have to do to protect neighboring areas from being effected by their crops .
but in the event of contamination , the bill would allow for lawsuits to be filed and heard swiftly .
" should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighbouring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , " künast said , " the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits .
such lawsuits may be initiated , if for instance a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . "
künast also pointed out that it will be largely up to consumers to decide whether gmo foodstuffs become a major success in germany .
mandatory labeling within the european union informs consumers whether a product contains gmos and thus gives them the freedom to decide what they want to place on their dinner tables .
the bill must still be approved in a vote by germany 's parliament , the bundestag . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain : the promised land for gm corn spain is home to the greatest amount of genetically modified food production in europe .

the german government is set to contribute to small eu military units proposed by france and britain to stabilize crisis zones .
should eu members approve , they could be operating by 2007 . french and british officials announced the plan on tuesday , saying they each intend to set up one unit , which would be made up of 1,500 soldiers .
they emphasized that the proposal would not conflict with nato 's planned response force of 21,000 troops or an earlier eu plan to create a military unit comprised of 60,000 soldiers . " the objective is to have a new tool for europeans which will not compete with others , " a french foreign ministry spokesman told reuters news agency .
" it allows the europeans to be present -lrb- in a crisis -rrb- . "
reuters also quoted a senior diplomat , who said germany would fund an additional unit , with hopes that italy , spain and poland would join in as well .
groups of smaller member states could form multinational units . in and out within 45 days the soldiers would serve as a stabilizing force in crisis regions until u.n. peacekeepers can be sent there .
groups should be ready for deployment within 15 days and serve a maximum of 30 days .
the teams would be similar to a french-led military unit that was sent to the democratic republic of congo last year .
operation " artemis " focused on keeping things under control and securing infrastructure until un troops arrived .
germany participated in this operation , albeit only with logistical support . should the eu approve the proposal , seven or eight units could be up and running by 2007 . france , britain and germany hope to get the green light from other member states by june .

south africa might be the special focus at this year 's berlin film festival , but the continent 's movie industry epicenter seems to lie further north : thousands of low-budget pictures are released in nigeria every year . when hollywood star charlize theron recently told reporters that it took just 28 days to shoot her latest film , " monster , " an appreciative murmur went through the room .
any nigerian filmmakers present must have chuckled a little - shooting a movie in five days sounds about right to them . " i 've made 25 films over the last five years , " charles novia , a nigerian director and producer , told his audience at a panel discussion on " nollywood , " nigeria 's booming movie industry in berlin this week .
equipped with a video camera , a script and often as little as € 5,000 , novia and his colleagues churn out up to 50 feature-length films every week . " sometimes people sell their cars to start a film , " said peace fiberesima , another producer and director .
others borrow money from relatives or friends or call colleagues who owe them a favor to help out for free , she added . video 's the way to go the video boom came after nigeria 's movie theaters started losing customers during an economic downturn in the 1980s .
while many of the theaters have now been turned into churches , about 200,000 people earn their money through working for the movies .
estimates of the industry 's revenue range from € 95 million -lrb- $ 121 million -rrb- to € 680 million . " i did n't believe what they were telling me , " said dorothee wenner , who works for the berlinale 's international forum and organized the two-day event at berlin 's hebbel am ufer theater .

" i do n't think anyone from the west can understand what it 's like to build an industry without any help from the state , " said brenda goldblatt , a south african filmmaker who recently made a documentary on nollywood .
" these films are companions in life for people .

the german government is set to contribute to small eu military units proposed by france and britain to stabilize crisis zones .
should eu members approve , they could be operating by 2007 . french and british officials announced the plan on tuesday , saying they each intend to set up one unit , which would be made up of 1,500 soldiers .
they emphasized that the proposal would not conflict with nato 's planned response force of 21,000 troops or an earlier eu plan to create a military unit comprised of 60,000 soldiers . " the objective is to have a new tool for europeans which will not compete with others , " a french foreign ministry spokesman told reuters news agency .
" it allows the europeans to be present -lrb- in a crisis -rrb- . "
reuters also quoted a senior diplomat , who said germany would fund an additional unit , with hopes that italy , spain and poland would join in as well .
groups of smaller member states could form multinational units . in and out within 45 days the soldiers would serve as a stabilizing force in crisis regions until u.n. peacekeepers can be sent there .
groups should be ready for deployment within 15 days and serve a maximum of 30 days .
the teams would be similar to a french-led military unit that was sent to the democratic republic of congo last year .
operation " artemis " focused on keeping things under control and securing infrastructure until un troops arrived .
germany participated in this operation , albeit only with logistical support . should the eu approve the proposal , seven or eight units could be up and running by 2007 . france , britain and germany hope to get the green light from other member states by june .
the three countries ' leaders , french president jacques chirac , britain 's premier tony blair and german chancellor gerhard schröder , are expected to discuss the issue at a meeting in berlin on feb .

several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .
experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed . many germans were shocked last week when they saw video footage of a group of students who physically abused one of their class mates .
up to 10 students at a vocational school in hildesheim in northern germany were allegedly involved in beating and humiliating a 17-year-old , kicking him , forcing him to brush his teeth with a wire brush and smearing motor oil on his genitalia .
the abuse apparently continued for months and took place during school hours in a storage room while the teacher remained in the classroom next door . five of the alleged abusers have been jailed so far and prosecutors are investigating the teacher 's apparent failure to supervise his class . on monday , a second case of abuse at another vocational school in nearby hannover made the news .
two 16-year-old students , a boy and a girl , were allegedly abused by five classmates .
the boy was repeatedly beaten with a rubber hammer in a changing room ; the girl was reportedly sexually abused . in the last week , several more cases have come into the open .
in bavaria , a 13-year-old boy was allegedly beaten unconscious by several students at a bus stop in the town of coburg .

the case in hildesheim has created the most uproar , causing officials to call for the installation of video cameras to prevent further incidents .
" it 's one of the options we 're looking at , " hans-herrman sölter -lrb- photo -rrb- , the school 's principal , told reporters . but experts said video cameras wo n't help to prevent similar incidents in the future .
" cameras can be destroyed or covered up , " angela ittel , who researches teenage behavior at berlin 's free university , told dw-world .
schools instead need to create a sense of community and involve students in the decision-making process . " you have to reach out to the students and that 's not really happening right now , " ittel said , adding that in general , school violence is not on the rise in germany . teachers also have to make sure they deal with problems early on , said mechthild schäfer , an expert on teenage bullying at ludwig-maximilians-university in munich .
she added that teachers should also enforce " basic rules of democracy " in their classrooms and prevent a culture in which swearing and abuse is accepted . in order to prepare teachers better for their jobs , they should also receive pedagogic training during their university education , schäfer said .
so far , prospective secondary school teachers are almost exclusively trained in the subject areas they plan to teach , but don ’ t get much guidance on how to interact with students . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de student killed in school shooting spree a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine .

several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .
experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed . many germans were shocked last week when they saw video footage of a group of students who physically abused one of their class mates .
up to 10 students at a vocational school in hildesheim in northern germany were allegedly involved in beating and humiliating a 17-year-old , kicking him , forcing him to brush his teeth with a wire brush and smearing motor oil on his genitalia .
the abuse apparently continued for months and took place during school hours in a storage room while the teacher remained in the classroom next door . five of the alleged abusers have been jailed so far and prosecutors are investigating the teacher 's apparent failure to supervise his class . on monday , a second case of abuse at another vocational school in nearby hannover made the news .
two 16-year-old students , a boy and a girl , were allegedly abused by five classmates .
the boy was repeatedly beaten with a rubber hammer in a changing room ; the girl was reportedly sexually abused . in the last week , several more cases have come into the open .
in bavaria , a 13-year-old boy was allegedly beaten unconscious by several students at a bus stop in the town of coburg .
in a town near munich , three students allegedly filmed themselves beating a 14-year-old over several weeks .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday approved a bill regulating the cultivation of genetically modified organisms .
the bill would make it legal for german farmers and supermarkets to sell gmo goods . the bill passed by germany 's ministers aims to codify european union legislation and guidelines for the cultivation and export of genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- into national law . several days ago , eu consumer protection commissioner david byrne criticized the german government for dragging its feet on regulating the export and import of gm foodstuffs out of fears that the products could swamp the market .
but with a new set of regulations in place , eu member states no longer have the right to exclude gmos from their territory , neither from cultivation nor from supermarket shelves . on wednesday , german agriculture minister renate künast conceded that her ministry could no longer prevent the cultivation of gm crops in germany .
but she pledged that her office would closely monitor crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast bei der eröffnung der fruit logistica " should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighboring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits , " künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" such lawsuits may be initiated if , for instance , a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . ” critics : gmos dangerous but opponents of the use of gmos are not convinced .
they claim that not enough scientific evidence is available to gauge the impact of what they call gm-contaminated foodstuffs on humans .
" genetically modified crops in general are dangerous for human health and also for the environment because what the g.e. -lrb- genetic engineering -rrb- industry is doing is putting new genes into new organisms , like taking a growth gene from a fish and putting it in a tomato , " said ulrike brendel of greenpeace germany .
" and of course nobody can predict what effects such a crude effort is having on human food and the environment . "
industry leaders claim that if the eu does not jump onto the gmo cultivation bandwagon , the continent may be left behind , then the continent will be left behind and put at a technological disadvantage over other countries who have deployed the cutting-edge agricultural methods .
but that may be a little off the mark , since few countries have adopted gmo foodstuffs despite a decade of attempts by american companies to promote genetically engineered agricultural technologies .
around 70 percent of land devoted to genetically engineered crops is in the united states , with almost all of the rest in argentina and canada . most other countries have been put off by the potential risks .
safeguards for conventional farmers the new german bill doesn ’ t specify what steps gmo farmers here will have to do to protect neighboring areas from being effected by their crops .
but in the event of contamination , the bill would allow for lawsuits to be filed and heard swiftly .
" should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighbouring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , " künast said , " the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits .
such lawsuits may be initiated , if for instance a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . "
künast also pointed out that it will be largely up to consumers to decide whether gmo foodstuffs become a major success in germany .
mandatory labeling within the european union informs consumers whether a product contains gmos and thus gives them the freedom to decide what they want to place on their dinner tables .
the bill must still be approved in a vote by germany 's parliament , the bundestag . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain : the promised land for gm corn spain is home to the greatest amount of genetically modified food production in europe .

the german government is set to contribute to small eu military units proposed by france and britain to stabilize crisis zones .
should eu members approve , they could be operating by 2007 . french and british officials announced the plan on tuesday , saying they each intend to set up one unit , which would be made up of 1,500 soldiers .
they emphasized that the proposal would not conflict with nato 's planned response force of 21,000 troops or an earlier eu plan to create a military unit comprised of 60,000 soldiers . " the objective is to have a new tool for europeans which will not compete with others , " a french foreign ministry spokesman told reuters news agency .
" it allows the europeans to be present -lrb- in a crisis -rrb- . "
reuters also quoted a senior diplomat , who said germany would fund an additional unit , with hopes that italy , spain and poland would join in as well .
groups of smaller member states could form multinational units . in and out within 45 days the soldiers would serve as a stabilizing force in crisis regions until u.n. peacekeepers can be sent there .
groups should be ready for deployment within 15 days and serve a maximum of 30 days .
the teams would be similar to a french-led military unit that was sent to the democratic republic of congo last year .
operation " artemis " focused on keeping things under control and securing infrastructure until un troops arrived .
germany participated in this operation , albeit only with logistical support . should the eu approve the proposal , seven or eight units could be up and running by 2007 . france , britain and germany hope to get the green light from other member states by june .
the three countries ' leaders , french president jacques chirac , britain 's premier tony blair and german chancellor gerhard schröder , are expected to discuss the issue at a meeting in berlin on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.02.2004 spain : the promised land for gm corn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : golden fields of gmos spain is home to the greatest amount of genetically modified food production in europe .
the experience gained there could prove valuable for germany and the rest europe . the use of genetically modified organisms remains a hot-button topic throughout most of european union .
and the german government , led by the social democrats and the greens , is n't exactly seen as a friend of the gmo industry .
indeed , the pesticide and crop care industry association agrar on wednesday criticized remarks made by consumer protection minister renate künast , a skeptic of gmos , and a new government bill the industry says would inhibit the fair use of so-called " green genetic technologies " rather than permit them as intended .
but as germany continues to debate how to deal with gmos , it could look to the lessons learned in spain , where gmos have been widely embraced .
the eu frontrunner in gm food production cultivates 32,000 hectares -lrb- 79,000 acres -rrb- of gm crops .
bt-176 is one of the spanish farmer 's gm corns of choice .
it 's designed to be resistant to weeds and other pests , including the crop-wasting european corn borer .
the fat white caterpillars regularly chew through catalonian farmers ' corn fields , ruining entire harvests .
while few conventional varieties of corn can survive the onslaughts , bt-176 crops remain unaffected .
" we spanish farmers have had very good experiences with gm corn .
with a minimum of pesticides we have pests under control , " jesus ribera of the spanish young farmers association told deutsche welle .
" that 's good for the environment and good for the farmers because we do n't lose any crops now . "
greater yields , more money spanish farmers are practically encouraged to cultivate gm corn .
they reap greater crops and animal feed producers are willing to pay premium for the corn .
additionally , they are unhindered by any restrictions from the spanish agricultural ministry .
" when someone consciously decides to sow gm corn , we know who does it where - and it 's fine , " said luis bayon of the ecological agriculture committee in madrid .
" but it 's something else if someone thinks they 're sowing conventional corn and genetically modified seeds are actually there . "
the incident in navarra no one knows exactly what happens when the wind blows gm corn pollen onto conventional fields .
but in 2001 , organic farmers in northern spanish region of navarra were prohibited from selling their corn as organic because gm stock had strayed onto their fields .
as yet , no fault has been determined in the case and the farmers have not been compensated .
the spanish government has commissioned the university of barcelona to investigate the consequences of genetic transfers , but the results of the research has not yet been released .
nevertheless , the government in madrid approved five new sorts of gm corn in the last five years .
protest has come mostly from the usual suspects , including environmentalists such as greenpeace .
and even though many spanish supermarket chains have " zero genetic technology " tolerance policies , the concerns of environmentalists and convention farmers are often plowed over .
" the conventional farmers do n't want to allow any kind of commingling so that their harvest is pure , " said ribera .
" that 's why they now have a problem .
agriculture is just like life : absolute purity does n't exist . " marc koch send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's reluctant cabinet to allow gmo foods german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday approved a bill regulating the cultivation of genetically modified organisms .
the bill would make it legal for german farmers and supermarkets to sell gmo goods .

dw-tv and the international film festival invited three young female documentary film makers to berlin to participate in workshops with accomplished colleagues . it took six long weeks of wrestling with the afghan authorities to get visas and exit permits for the three film makers .
gul makai ranjbar , halima hussiani and shakeba adill had a hard time getting to germany and the berlinale talent campus . although they had the support of international television broadcaster dw-tv and the german foreign ministry , it became increasingly doubtful whether they would be able to make the journey at all .
to cap it all off , the weather almost put an end to their plans .
the bundeswehr plane that was to bring the three young women safely to germany had to leave a day earlier than planned . from the airport in berlin , gul makai , halima and shakeba had to go straight to the " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " event at the haus der kulturen der welt the house of world cultures , which took place last sunday . after finally arriving , they told the young audience at the talent campus about their work and lives in one of the poorest and most crisis-ridden countries in the world .
they also presented excerpts from two of their films . dressed in jeans , sweaters and leather jackets , only their heads covered with the traditional hijab or headscarf , the women sat on the podium while talking about their work to iranian writer , documentary film maker and afghanistan expert , siba shakib , who hosted the discussion and acted as their interpreter . siba shakib presented the aïna media center in her introduction .
independent from the government , aïna is an afghan-french project that has been running for two years and has built up a network of independent journalists and media in afghanistan .
gul makai , halima and shakeba were trained through aïna and are now , with the aid of the organisation , producing their own films . " afghanistan unveiled " gul makai , who is 22-years-old , said that she had never known a life without war .
her father and brothers are dead , and even as a young girl she had to work to feed the family , despite having an injured leg . hard as this life may seem , it 's all too common in afghanistan .
apart from depicting the years of war against the russians , the three film makers concentrated on the reign of terror carried out by the radical islamic taliban .
the six years of their dictatorship were known to have been especially cruel for afghanistan 's female population . the film makers travelled to the afghan countryside to make their documentary film " afghanistan unveiled " .
it was probably the first time that women had travelled into the rural provinces alone .
they talked to women about their life and their experiences under the taliban .
whether they were female nomads with machine guns in their tents , or cave dwellers in the bamian valley , where the taliban destroyed the giant statues of buddha , their stories are very similar .
they deal with murder , rape and destruction , with unimaginable violence and contempt for the people , especially the women . the young film makers found filming an intense and disturbing experience .
during their courageous work , they learned much about their own country and its inhabitants .
afghanistan is a country full of cultural variety , they saidl . the desolate countryside and harsh climate make basic living conditions very difficult for its people . critiquing the new afghanistan another important subject is the period since the end of the taliban regime .
life in afghanistan is still far from any kind of normality .
a critical view of the situation is presented in the women 's second film , " shadows " , the sequel to " afghanistan unveiled " .
while kabul university prefers to enroll students with money and the right contacts , in the provinces , women and girls are still being abducted and raped .
there is a considerable amount of work left before there is real freedom of expression and the press . all the same , gul makai , halima and shakeba say that there have been great improvements in the direction of freedom .
what people in afghanistan need most for social change after such a long period of destructive chaos is time .
the presence of isaf , the international security assistance force , and the americans is necessary at the moment to ensure relative calm in the country .
in the long term , the afghans would like to develop their future identity free from external influences . gul makai , halima and shakeba are sure that their informative films will contribute to bringing about change in afghanistan .
the strength and intelligence , the involvement and self-confidence of these three young women provides hope for the future of their country . at the end of the discussion , günter knabe , deutsche welle 's afghanistan expert , spoke about " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " as a representative of the international broadcaster and organiser of the event .

dw-tv and the international film festival invited three young female documentary film makers to berlin to participate in workshops with accomplished colleagues . it took six long weeks of wrestling with the afghan authorities to get visas and exit permits for the three film makers .
gul makai ranjbar , halima hussiani and shakeba adill had a hard time getting to germany and the berlinale talent campus . although they had the support of international television broadcaster dw-tv and the german foreign ministry , it became increasingly doubtful whether they would be able to make the journey at all .
to cap it all off , the weather almost put an end to their plans .
the bundeswehr plane that was to bring the three young women safely to germany had to leave a day earlier than planned . from the airport in berlin , gul makai , halima and shakeba had to go straight to the " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " event at the haus der kulturen der welt the house of world cultures , which took place last sunday . after finally arriving , they told the young audience at the talent campus about their work and lives in one of the poorest and most crisis-ridden countries in the world .
they also presented excerpts from two of their films . dressed in jeans , sweaters and leather jackets , only their heads covered with the traditional hijab or headscarf , the women sat on the podium while talking about their work to iranian writer , documentary film maker and afghanistan expert , siba shakib , who hosted the discussion and acted as their interpreter . siba shakib presented the aïna media center in her introduction .
independent from the government , aïna is an afghan-french project that has been running for two years and has built up a network of independent journalists and media in afghanistan .
gul makai , halima and shakeba were trained through aïna and are now , with the aid of the organisation , producing their own films . " afghanistan unveiled " gul makai , who is 22-years-old , said that she had never known a life without war .
her father and brothers are dead , and even as a young girl she had to work to feed the family , despite having an injured leg . hard as this life may seem , it 's all too common in afghanistan .
apart from depicting the years of war against the russians , the three film makers concentrated on the reign of terror carried out by the radical islamic taliban .
the six years of their dictatorship were known to have been especially cruel for afghanistan 's female population . the film makers travelled to the afghan countryside to make their documentary film " afghanistan unveiled " .
it was probably the first time that women had travelled into the rural provinces alone .
they talked to women about their life and their experiences under the taliban .
whether they were female nomads with machine guns in their tents , or cave dwellers in the bamian valley , where the taliban destroyed the giant statues of buddha , their stories are very similar .
they deal with murder , rape and destruction , with unimaginable violence and contempt for the people , especially the women . the young film makers found filming an intense and disturbing experience .
during their courageous work , they learned much about their own country and its inhabitants .
afghanistan is a country full of cultural variety , they saidl . the desolate countryside and harsh climate make basic living conditions very difficult for its people . critiquing the new afghanistan another important subject is the period since the end of the taliban regime .
life in afghanistan is still far from any kind of normality .
a critical view of the situation is presented in the women 's second film , " shadows " , the sequel to " afghanistan unveiled " .
while kabul university prefers to enroll students with money and the right contacts , in the provinces , women and girls are still being abducted and raped .
there is a considerable amount of work left before there is real freedom of expression and the press . all the same , gul makai , halima and shakeba say that there have been great improvements in the direction of freedom .
what people in afghanistan need most for social change after such a long period of destructive chaos is time .
the presence of isaf , the international security assistance force , and the americans is necessary at the moment to ensure relative calm in the country .
in the long term , the afghans would like to develop their future identity free from external influences . gul makai , halima and shakeba are sure that their informative films will contribute to bringing about change in afghanistan .
the strength and intelligence , the involvement and self-confidence of these three young women provides hope for the future of their country . at the end of the discussion , günter knabe , deutsche welle 's afghanistan expert , spoke about " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " as a representative of the international broadcaster and organiser of the event .

the german government is set to contribute to small eu military units proposed by france and britain to stabilize crisis zones .
should eu members approve , they could be operating by 2007 . french and british officials announced the plan on tuesday , saying they each intend to set up one unit , which would be made up of 1,500 soldiers .
they emphasized that the proposal would not conflict with nato 's planned response force of 21,000 troops or an earlier eu plan to create a military unit comprised of 60,000 soldiers . " the objective is to have a new tool for europeans which will not compete with others , " a french foreign ministry spokesman told reuters news agency .
" it allows the europeans to be present -lrb- in a crisis -rrb- . "
reuters also quoted a senior diplomat , who said germany would fund an additional unit , with hopes that italy , spain and poland would join in as well .
groups of smaller member states could form multinational units . in and out within 45 days the soldiers would serve as a stabilizing force in crisis regions until u.n. peacekeepers can be sent there .
groups should be ready for deployment within 15 days and serve a maximum of 30 days .
the teams would be similar to a french-led military unit that was sent to the democratic republic of congo last year .
operation " artemis " focused on keeping things under control and securing infrastructure until un troops arrived .
germany participated in this operation , albeit only with logistical support . should the eu approve the proposal , seven or eight units could be up and running by 2007 . france , britain and germany hope to get the green light from other member states by june .
the three countries ' leaders , french president jacques chirac , britain 's premier tony blair and german chancellor gerhard schröder , are expected to discuss the issue at a meeting in berlin on feb .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday approved a bill regulating the cultivation of genetically modified organisms .
the bill would make it legal for german farmers and supermarkets to sell gmo goods . the bill passed by germany 's ministers aims to codify european union legislation and guidelines for the cultivation and export of genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- into national law . several days ago , eu consumer protection commissioner david byrne criticized the german government for dragging its feet on regulating the export and import of gm foodstuffs out of fears that the products could swamp the market .
but with a new set of regulations in place , eu member states no longer have the right to exclude gmos from their territory , neither from cultivation nor from supermarket shelves . on wednesday , german agriculture minister renate künast conceded that her ministry could no longer prevent the cultivation of gm crops in germany .
but she pledged that her office would closely monitor crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast bei der eröffnung der fruit logistica " should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighboring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits , " künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" such lawsuits may be initiated if , for instance , a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . ” critics : gmos dangerous but opponents of the use of gmos are not convinced .
they claim that not enough scientific evidence is available to gauge the impact of what they call gm-contaminated foodstuffs on humans .
" genetically modified crops in general are dangerous for human health and also for the environment because what the g.e. -lrb- genetic engineering -rrb- industry is doing is putting new genes into new organisms , like taking a growth gene from a fish and putting it in a tomato , " said ulrike brendel of greenpeace germany .
" and of course nobody can predict what effects such a crude effort is having on human food and the environment . "
industry leaders claim that if the eu does not jump onto the gmo cultivation bandwagon , the continent may be left behind , then the continent will be left behind and put at a technological disadvantage over other countries who have deployed the cutting-edge agricultural methods .
but that may be a little off the mark , since few countries have adopted gmo foodstuffs despite a decade of attempts by american companies to promote genetically engineered agricultural technologies .
around 70 percent of land devoted to genetically engineered crops is in the united states , with almost all of the rest in argentina and canada . most other countries have been put off by the potential risks .
safeguards for conventional farmers the new german bill doesn ’ t specify what steps gmo farmers here will have to do to protect neighboring areas from being effected by their crops .
but in the event of contamination , the bill would allow for lawsuits to be filed and heard swiftly .
" should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighbouring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , " künast said , " the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits .
such lawsuits may be initiated , if for instance a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . "
künast also pointed out that it will be largely up to consumers to decide whether gmo foodstuffs become a major success in germany .
mandatory labeling within the european union informs consumers whether a product contains gmos and thus gives them the freedom to decide what they want to place on their dinner tables .
the bill must still be approved in a vote by germany 's parliament , the bundestag . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain : the promised land for gm corn spain is home to the greatest amount of genetically modified food production in europe .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday approved a bill regulating the cultivation of genetically modified organisms .
the bill would make it legal for german farmers and supermarkets to sell gmo goods . the bill passed by germany 's ministers aims to codify european union legislation and guidelines for the cultivation and export of genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- into national law . several days ago , eu consumer protection commissioner david byrne criticized the german government for dragging its feet on regulating the export and import of gm foodstuffs out of fears that the products could swamp the market .
but with a new set of regulations in place , eu member states no longer have the right to exclude gmos from their territory , neither from cultivation nor from supermarket shelves . on wednesday , german agriculture minister renate künast conceded that her ministry could no longer prevent the cultivation of gm crops in germany .
but she pledged that her office would closely monitor crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast bei der eröffnung der fruit logistica " should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighboring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits , " künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" such lawsuits may be initiated if , for instance , a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . ” critics : gmos dangerous but opponents of the use of gmos are not convinced .
they claim that not enough scientific evidence is available to gauge the impact of what they call gm-contaminated foodstuffs on humans .
" genetically modified crops in general are dangerous for human health and also for the environment because what the g.e. -lrb- genetic engineering -rrb- industry is doing is putting new genes into new organisms , like taking a growth gene from a fish and putting it in a tomato , " said ulrike brendel of greenpeace germany .
" and of course nobody can predict what effects such a crude effort is having on human food and the environment . "
industry leaders claim that if the eu does not jump onto the gmo cultivation bandwagon , the continent may be left behind , then the continent will be left behind and put at a technological disadvantage over other countries who have deployed the cutting-edge agricultural methods .
but that may be a little off the mark , since few countries have adopted gmo foodstuffs despite a decade of attempts by american companies to promote genetically engineered agricultural technologies .
around 70 percent of land devoted to genetically engineered crops is in the united states , with almost all of the rest in argentina and canada . most other countries have been put off by the potential risks .
safeguards for conventional farmers the new german bill doesn ’ t specify what steps gmo farmers here will have to do to protect neighboring areas from being effected by their crops .
but in the event of contamination , the bill would allow for lawsuits to be filed and heard swiftly .
" should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighbouring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , " künast said , " the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits .
such lawsuits may be initiated , if for instance a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . "
künast also pointed out that it will be largely up to consumers to decide whether gmo foodstuffs become a major success in germany .

the german government is set to contribute to small eu military units proposed by france and britain to stabilize crisis zones .
should eu members approve , they could be operating by 2007 . french and british officials announced the plan on tuesday , saying they each intend to set up one unit , which would be made up of 1,500 soldiers .
they emphasized that the proposal would not conflict with nato 's planned response force of 21,000 troops or an earlier eu plan to create a military unit comprised of 60,000 soldiers . " the objective is to have a new tool for europeans which will not compete with others , " a french foreign ministry spokesman told reuters news agency .
" it allows the europeans to be present -lrb- in a crisis -rrb- . "
reuters also quoted a senior diplomat , who said germany would fund an additional unit , with hopes that italy , spain and poland would join in as well .
groups of smaller member states could form multinational units . in and out within 45 days the soldiers would serve as a stabilizing force in crisis regions until u.n. peacekeepers can be sent there .
groups should be ready for deployment within 15 days and serve a maximum of 30 days .
the teams would be similar to a french-led military unit that was sent to the democratic republic of congo last year .
operation " artemis " focused on keeping things under control and securing infrastructure until un troops arrived .
germany participated in this operation , albeit only with logistical support . should the eu approve the proposal , seven or eight units could be up and running by 2007 . france , britain and germany hope to get the green light from other member states by june .
the three countries ' leaders , french president jacques chirac , britain 's premier tony blair and german chancellor gerhard schröder , are expected to discuss the issue at a meeting in berlin on feb .

and the german government , led by the social democrats and the greens , is n't exactly seen as a friend of the gmo industry .
indeed , the pesticide and crop care industry association agrar on wednesday criticized remarks made by consumer protection minister renate künast , a skeptic of gmos , and a new government bill the industry says would inhibit the fair use of so-called " green genetic technologies " rather than permit them as intended .
but as germany continues to debate how to deal with gmos , it could look to the lessons learned in spain , where gmos have been widely embraced .

" when someone consciously decides to sow gm corn , we know who does it where - and it 's fine , " said luis bayon of the ecological agriculture committee in madrid .
" but it 's something else if someone thinks they 're sowing conventional corn and genetically modified seeds are actually there . "
the incident in navarra no one knows exactly what happens when the wind blows gm corn pollen onto conventional fields .
but in 2001 , organic farmers in northern spanish region of navarra were prohibited from selling their corn as organic because gm stock had strayed onto their fields .

south africa might be the special focus at this year 's berlin film festival , but the continent 's movie industry epicenter seems to lie further north : thousands of low-budget pictures are released in nigeria every year . when hollywood star charlize theron recently told reporters that it took just 28 days to shoot her latest film , " monster , " an appreciative murmur went through the room .
any nigerian filmmakers present must have chuckled a little - shooting a movie in five days sounds about right to them . " i 've made 25 films over the last five years , " charles novia , a nigerian director and producer , told his audience at a panel discussion on " nollywood , " nigeria 's booming movie industry in berlin this week .
equipped with a video camera , a script and often as little as € 5,000 , novia and his colleagues churn out up to 50 feature-length films every week . " sometimes people sell their cars to start a film , " said peace fiberesima , another producer and director .
others borrow money from relatives or friends or call colleagues who owe them a favor to help out for free , she added . video 's the way to go the video boom came after nigeria 's movie theaters started losing customers during an economic downturn in the 1980s .
while many of the theaters have now been turned into churches , about 200,000 people earn their money through working for the movies .
estimates of the industry 's revenue range from € 95 million -lrb- $ 121 million -rrb- to € 680 million . " i did n't believe what they were telling me , " said dorothee wenner , who works for the berlinale 's international forum and organized the two-day event at berlin 's hebbel am ufer theater .
" in the end , i came back -lrb- to germany -rrb- and found out that i was n't the only one who did n't have a clue . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedestrians push their way through a traffic jam in downtown lagos .
nollywood booms without government funding .
in fact , nigeria 's movie industry , which is centered in the country 's former capital , lagos -lrb- photo -rrb- , pays the government about € 3.5 million per year to censor its products , according to fiberesima . " i do n't think anyone from the west can understand what it 's like to build an industry without any help from the state , " said brenda goldblatt , a south african filmmaker who recently made a documentary on nollywood .
" these films are companions in life for people .
in the west , there 's nothing like the depth of the relationship -lrb- between viewers and movies -rrb- . " movies people can relate to what 's produced looks a lot like latin american telenovelas and has little to do with hollywood blockbusters .
viewers seem to like it that way .
renting american-made films in the video stores costs half as much as nollywood productions , but the imports still collect dust on the shelves . " most nigerians don ’ t want to watch ' terminator 3 , " ' fiberesima said .
" they want to watch ' real love ' or ' true love ' or ' saving alero , " ' she added , referring to recent nigerian releases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 200,000 copies are sold per film .
unlike bollywood films - melodramatic productions from india - not all nollywood movies are similar , as fiberesima , amata and their colleagues are eager to point out .
" it 's not a style of making films , it 's the nigerian market for films , " said jeta amata , a 29-year-old director , producer and actor who has already made 40 movies .
he added that all he wants to do is entertain his countrymen . " it 's a cultural thing of appreciating home , " fiberesima said , adding that nigerians can relate to the stories about crime , love , sex , and power which are set in their neighborhoods .
while some films focus on rituals and myths from a specific ethnic group , " most of the films talk to everybody , " she said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale 2004 read , watch and listen to dw-world 's entire 2004 berlinale coverage .

south africa might be the special focus at this year 's berlin film festival , but the continent 's movie industry epicenter seems to lie further north : thousands of low-budget pictures are released in nigeria every year . when hollywood star charlize theron recently told reporters that it took just 28 days to shoot her latest film , " monster , " an appreciative murmur went through the room .
any nigerian filmmakers present must have chuckled a little - shooting a movie in five days sounds about right to them . " i 've made 25 films over the last five years , " charles novia , a nigerian director and producer , told his audience at a panel discussion on " nollywood , " nigeria 's booming movie industry in berlin this week .
equipped with a video camera , a script and often as little as € 5,000 , novia and his colleagues churn out up to 50 feature-length films every week . " sometimes people sell their cars to start a film , " said peace fiberesima , another producer and director .
others borrow money from relatives or friends or call colleagues who owe them a favor to help out for free , she added . video 's the way to go the video boom came after nigeria 's movie theaters started losing customers during an economic downturn in the 1980s .
while many of the theaters have now been turned into churches , about 200,000 people earn their money through working for the movies .
estimates of the industry 's revenue range from € 95 million -lrb- $ 121 million -rrb- to € 680 million . " i did n't believe what they were telling me , " said dorothee wenner , who works for the berlinale 's international forum and organized the two-day event at berlin 's hebbel am ufer theater .
" in the end , i came back -lrb- to germany -rrb- and found out that i was n't the only one who did n't have a clue . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedestrians push their way through a traffic jam in downtown lagos .
nollywood booms without government funding .
in fact , nigeria 's movie industry , which is centered in the country 's former capital , lagos -lrb- photo -rrb- , pays the government about € 3.5 million per year to censor its products , according to fiberesima . " i do n't think anyone from the west can understand what it 's like to build an industry without any help from the state , " said brenda goldblatt , a south african filmmaker who recently made a documentary on nollywood .
" these films are companions in life for people .
in the west , there 's nothing like the depth of the relationship -lrb- between viewers and movies -rrb- . " movies people can relate to what 's produced looks a lot like latin american telenovelas and has little to do with hollywood blockbusters .
viewers seem to like it that way .
renting american-made films in the video stores costs half as much as nollywood productions , but the imports still collect dust on the shelves . " most nigerians don ’ t want to watch ' terminator 3 , " ' fiberesima said .
" they want to watch ' real love ' or ' true love ' or ' saving alero , " ' she added , referring to recent nigerian releases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 200,000 copies are sold per film .

" it 's not a style of making films , it 's the nigerian market for films , " said jeta amata , a 29-year-old director , producer and actor who has already made 40 movies .
he added that all he wants to do is entertain his countrymen . " it 's a cultural thing of appreciating home , " fiberesima said , adding that nigerians can relate to the stories about crime , love , sex , and power which are set in their neighborhoods .

several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .
experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed . many germans were shocked last week when they saw video footage of a group of students who physically abused one of their class mates .
up to 10 students at a vocational school in hildesheim in northern germany were allegedly involved in beating and humiliating a 17-year-old , kicking him , forcing him to brush his teeth with a wire brush and smearing motor oil on his genitalia .
the abuse apparently continued for months and took place during school hours in a storage room while the teacher remained in the classroom next door . five of the alleged abusers have been jailed so far and prosecutors are investigating the teacher 's apparent failure to supervise his class . on monday , a second case of abuse at another vocational school in nearby hannover made the news .
two 16-year-old students , a boy and a girl , were allegedly abused by five classmates .
the boy was repeatedly beaten with a rubber hammer in a changing room ; the girl was reportedly sexually abused . in the last week , several more cases have come into the open .
in bavaria , a 13-year-old boy was allegedly beaten unconscious by several students at a bus stop in the town of coburg .
in a town near munich , three students allegedly filmed themselves beating a 14-year-old over several weeks .
in the southwestern german state of rhineland-palatinate , a 16-year-old student was jailed for allegedly beating a schoolmate . early intervention needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-hermann sölter , center , in front of his school in hildesheim .
the case in hildesheim has created the most uproar , causing officials to call for the installation of video cameras to prevent further incidents .
" it 's one of the options we 're looking at , " hans-herrman sölter -lrb- photo -rrb- , the school 's principal , told reporters . but experts said video cameras wo n't help to prevent similar incidents in the future .
" cameras can be destroyed or covered up , " angela ittel , who researches teenage behavior at berlin 's free university , told dw-world .
schools instead need to create a sense of community and involve students in the decision-making process . " you have to reach out to the students and that 's not really happening right now , " ittel said , adding that in general , school violence is not on the rise in germany . teachers also have to make sure they deal with problems early on , said mechthild schäfer , an expert on teenage bullying at ludwig-maximilians-university in munich .
she added that teachers should also enforce " basic rules of democracy " in their classrooms and prevent a culture in which swearing and abuse is accepted . in order to prepare teachers better for their jobs , they should also receive pedagogic training during their university education , schäfer said .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday approved a bill regulating the cultivation of genetically modified organisms .
the bill would make it legal for german farmers and supermarkets to sell gmo goods . the bill passed by germany 's ministers aims to codify european union legislation and guidelines for the cultivation and export of genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- into national law . several days ago , eu consumer protection commissioner david byrne criticized the german government for dragging its feet on regulating the export and import of gm foodstuffs out of fears that the products could swamp the market .
but with a new set of regulations in place , eu member states no longer have the right to exclude gmos from their territory , neither from cultivation nor from supermarket shelves . on wednesday , german agriculture minister renate künast conceded that her ministry could no longer prevent the cultivation of gm crops in germany .
but she pledged that her office would closely monitor crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast bei der eröffnung der fruit logistica " should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighboring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits , " künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" such lawsuits may be initiated if , for instance , a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . ” critics : gmos dangerous but opponents of the use of gmos are not convinced .
they claim that not enough scientific evidence is available to gauge the impact of what they call gm-contaminated foodstuffs on humans .
" genetically modified crops in general are dangerous for human health and also for the environment because what the g.e. -lrb- genetic engineering -rrb- industry is doing is putting new genes into new organisms , like taking a growth gene from a fish and putting it in a tomato , " said ulrike brendel of greenpeace germany .
" and of course nobody can predict what effects such a crude effort is having on human food and the environment . "
industry leaders claim that if the eu does not jump onto the gmo cultivation bandwagon , the continent may be left behind , then the continent will be left behind and put at a technological disadvantage over other countries who have deployed the cutting-edge agricultural methods .
but that may be a little off the mark , since few countries have adopted gmo foodstuffs despite a decade of attempts by american companies to promote genetically engineered agricultural technologies .
around 70 percent of land devoted to genetically engineered crops is in the united states , with almost all of the rest in argentina and canada . most other countries have been put off by the potential risks .
safeguards for conventional farmers the new german bill doesn ’ t specify what steps gmo farmers here will have to do to protect neighboring areas from being effected by their crops .
but in the event of contamination , the bill would allow for lawsuits to be filed and heard swiftly .
" should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighbouring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , " künast said , " the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits .
such lawsuits may be initiated , if for instance a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . "
künast also pointed out that it will be largely up to consumers to decide whether gmo foodstuffs become a major success in germany .
mandatory labeling within the european union informs consumers whether a product contains gmos and thus gives them the freedom to decide what they want to place on their dinner tables .
the bill must still be approved in a vote by germany 's parliament , the bundestag . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain : the promised land for gm corn spain is home to the greatest amount of genetically modified food production in europe .
the experience gained there could prove valuable for germany and the rest europe .

dw-tv and the international film festival invited three young female documentary film makers to berlin to participate in workshops with accomplished colleagues . it took six long weeks of wrestling with the afghan authorities to get visas and exit permits for the three film makers .
gul makai ranjbar , halima hussiani and shakeba adill had a hard time getting to germany and the berlinale talent campus . although they had the support of international television broadcaster dw-tv and the german foreign ministry , it became increasingly doubtful whether they would be able to make the journey at all .
to cap it all off , the weather almost put an end to their plans .
the bundeswehr plane that was to bring the three young women safely to germany had to leave a day earlier than planned . from the airport in berlin , gul makai , halima and shakeba had to go straight to the " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " event at the haus der kulturen der welt the house of world cultures , which took place last sunday . after finally arriving , they told the young audience at the talent campus about their work and lives in one of the poorest and most crisis-ridden countries in the world .
they also presented excerpts from two of their films . dressed in jeans , sweaters and leather jackets , only their heads covered with the traditional hijab or headscarf , the women sat on the podium while talking about their work to iranian writer , documentary film maker and afghanistan expert , siba shakib , who hosted the discussion and acted as their interpreter . siba shakib presented the aïna media center in her introduction .
independent from the government , aïna is an afghan-french project that has been running for two years and has built up a network of independent journalists and media in afghanistan .
gul makai , halima and shakeba were trained through aïna and are now , with the aid of the organisation , producing their own films . " afghanistan unveiled " gul makai , who is 22-years-old , said that she had never known a life without war .
her father and brothers are dead , and even as a young girl she had to work to feed the family , despite having an injured leg . hard as this life may seem , it 's all too common in afghanistan .
apart from depicting the years of war against the russians , the three film makers concentrated on the reign of terror carried out by the radical islamic taliban .
the six years of their dictatorship were known to have been especially cruel for afghanistan 's female population . the film makers travelled to the afghan countryside to make their documentary film " afghanistan unveiled " .
it was probably the first time that women had travelled into the rural provinces alone .
they talked to women about their life and their experiences under the taliban .
whether they were female nomads with machine guns in their tents , or cave dwellers in the bamian valley , where the taliban destroyed the giant statues of buddha , their stories are very similar .
they deal with murder , rape and destruction , with unimaginable violence and contempt for the people , especially the women . the young film makers found filming an intense and disturbing experience .
during their courageous work , they learned much about their own country and its inhabitants .
afghanistan is a country full of cultural variety , they saidl . the desolate countryside and harsh climate make basic living conditions very difficult for its people . critiquing the new afghanistan another important subject is the period since the end of the taliban regime .
life in afghanistan is still far from any kind of normality .
a critical view of the situation is presented in the women 's second film , " shadows " , the sequel to " afghanistan unveiled " .
while kabul university prefers to enroll students with money and the right contacts , in the provinces , women and girls are still being abducted and raped .
there is a considerable amount of work left before there is real freedom of expression and the press . all the same , gul makai , halima and shakeba say that there have been great improvements in the direction of freedom .
what people in afghanistan need most for social change after such a long period of destructive chaos is time .
the presence of isaf , the international security assistance force , and the americans is necessary at the moment to ensure relative calm in the country .
in the long term , the afghans would like to develop their future identity free from external influences . gul makai , halima and shakeba are sure that their informative films will contribute to bringing about change in afghanistan .
the strength and intelligence , the involvement and self-confidence of these three young women provides hope for the future of their country . at the end of the discussion , günter knabe , deutsche welle 's afghanistan expert , spoke about " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " as a representative of the international broadcaster and organiser of the event .
he introduced the audience to dw-tv 's afghan program which broadcasts daily in dari and pashtu , and the donation campaign : " 100 classrooms for afghanistan " which was sponsored by the aid organisation cap anamur and deutsche welle .

dw-tv and the international film festival invited three young female documentary film makers to berlin to participate in workshops with accomplished colleagues . it took six long weeks of wrestling with the afghan authorities to get visas and exit permits for the three film makers .
gul makai ranjbar , halima hussiani and shakeba adill had a hard time getting to germany and the berlinale talent campus . although they had the support of international television broadcaster dw-tv and the german foreign ministry , it became increasingly doubtful whether they would be able to make the journey at all .
to cap it all off , the weather almost put an end to their plans .
the bundeswehr plane that was to bring the three young women safely to germany had to leave a day earlier than planned . from the airport in berlin , gul makai , halima and shakeba had to go straight to the " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " event at the haus der kulturen der welt the house of world cultures , which took place last sunday . after finally arriving , they told the young audience at the talent campus about their work and lives in one of the poorest and most crisis-ridden countries in the world .
they also presented excerpts from two of their films . dressed in jeans , sweaters and leather jackets , only their heads covered with the traditional hijab or headscarf , the women sat on the podium while talking about their work to iranian writer , documentary film maker and afghanistan expert , siba shakib , who hosted the discussion and acted as their interpreter . siba shakib presented the aïna media center in her introduction .
independent from the government , aïna is an afghan-french project that has been running for two years and has built up a network of independent journalists and media in afghanistan .
gul makai , halima and shakeba were trained through aïna and are now , with the aid of the organisation , producing their own films . " afghanistan unveiled " gul makai , who is 22-years-old , said that she had never known a life without war .
her father and brothers are dead , and even as a young girl she had to work to feed the family , despite having an injured leg . hard as this life may seem , it 's all too common in afghanistan .
apart from depicting the years of war against the russians , the three film makers concentrated on the reign of terror carried out by the radical islamic taliban .
the six years of their dictatorship were known to have been especially cruel for afghanistan 's female population . the film makers travelled to the afghan countryside to make their documentary film " afghanistan unveiled " .
it was probably the first time that women had travelled into the rural provinces alone .
they talked to women about their life and their experiences under the taliban .
whether they were female nomads with machine guns in their tents , or cave dwellers in the bamian valley , where the taliban destroyed the giant statues of buddha , their stories are very similar .
they deal with murder , rape and destruction , with unimaginable violence and contempt for the people , especially the women . the young film makers found filming an intense and disturbing experience .
during their courageous work , they learned much about their own country and its inhabitants .
afghanistan is a country full of cultural variety , they saidl . the desolate countryside and harsh climate make basic living conditions very difficult for its people . critiquing the new afghanistan another important subject is the period since the end of the taliban regime .
life in afghanistan is still far from any kind of normality .
a critical view of the situation is presented in the women 's second film , " shadows " , the sequel to " afghanistan unveiled " .
while kabul university prefers to enroll students with money and the right contacts , in the provinces , women and girls are still being abducted and raped .
there is a considerable amount of work left before there is real freedom of expression and the press . all the same , gul makai , halima and shakeba say that there have been great improvements in the direction of freedom .
what people in afghanistan need most for social change after such a long period of destructive chaos is time .
the presence of isaf , the international security assistance force , and the americans is necessary at the moment to ensure relative calm in the country .
in the long term , the afghans would like to develop their future identity free from external influences . gul makai , halima and shakeba are sure that their informative films will contribute to bringing about change in afghanistan .
the strength and intelligence , the involvement and self-confidence of these three young women provides hope for the future of their country . at the end of the discussion , günter knabe , deutsche welle 's afghanistan expert , spoke about " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " as a representative of the international broadcaster and organiser of the event .
he introduced the audience to dw-tv 's afghan program which broadcasts daily in dari and pashtu , and the donation campaign : " 100 classrooms for afghanistan " which was sponsored by the aid organisation cap anamur and deutsche welle .

the german government is set to contribute to small eu military units proposed by france and britain to stabilize crisis zones .
should eu members approve , they could be operating by 2007 . french and british officials announced the plan on tuesday , saying they each intend to set up one unit , which would be made up of 1,500 soldiers .
they emphasized that the proposal would not conflict with nato 's planned response force of 21,000 troops or an earlier eu plan to create a military unit comprised of 60,000 soldiers . " the objective is to have a new tool for europeans which will not compete with others , " a french foreign ministry spokesman told reuters news agency .
" it allows the europeans to be present -lrb- in a crisis -rrb- . "
reuters also quoted a senior diplomat , who said germany would fund an additional unit , with hopes that italy , spain and poland would join in as well .
groups of smaller member states could form multinational units . in and out within 45 days the soldiers would serve as a stabilizing force in crisis regions until u.n. peacekeepers can be sent there .
groups should be ready for deployment within 15 days and serve a maximum of 30 days .
the teams would be similar to a french-led military unit that was sent to the democratic republic of congo last year .
operation " artemis " focused on keeping things under control and securing infrastructure until un troops arrived .
germany participated in this operation , albeit only with logistical support . should the eu approve the proposal , seven or eight units could be up and running by 2007 . france , britain and germany hope to get the green light from other member states by june .
the three countries ' leaders , french president jacques chirac , britain 's premier tony blair and german chancellor gerhard schröder , are expected to discuss the issue at a meeting in berlin on feb .

the german government is set to contribute to small eu military units proposed by france and britain to stabilize crisis zones .
should eu members approve , they could be operating by 2007 . french and british officials announced the plan on tuesday , saying they each intend to set up one unit , which would be made up of 1,500 soldiers .
they emphasized that the proposal would not conflict with nato 's planned response force of 21,000 troops or an earlier eu plan to create a military unit comprised of 60,000 soldiers . " the objective is to have a new tool for europeans which will not compete with others , " a french foreign ministry spokesman told reuters news agency .
" it allows the europeans to be present -lrb- in a crisis -rrb- . "
reuters also quoted a senior diplomat , who said germany would fund an additional unit , with hopes that italy , spain and poland would join in as well .
groups of smaller member states could form multinational units . in and out within 45 days the soldiers would serve as a stabilizing force in crisis regions until u.n. peacekeepers can be sent there .
groups should be ready for deployment within 15 days and serve a maximum of 30 days .
the teams would be similar to a french-led military unit that was sent to the democratic republic of congo last year .
operation " artemis " focused on keeping things under control and securing infrastructure until un troops arrived .
germany participated in this operation , albeit only with logistical support . should the eu approve the proposal , seven or eight units could be up and running by 2007 . france , britain and germany hope to get the green light from other member states by june .
the three countries ' leaders , french president jacques chirac , britain 's premier tony blair and german chancellor gerhard schröder , are expected to discuss the issue at a meeting in berlin on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.02.2004 schröder 's reluctant cabinet to allow gmo foods großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nature or bt-176 ?
german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday approved a bill regulating the cultivation of genetically modified organisms .
the bill would make it legal for german farmers and supermarkets to sell gmo goods . the bill passed by germany 's ministers aims to codify european union legislation and guidelines for the cultivation and export of genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- into national law . several days ago , eu consumer protection commissioner david byrne criticized the german government for dragging its feet on regulating the export and import of gm foodstuffs out of fears that the products could swamp the market .
but with a new set of regulations in place , eu member states no longer have the right to exclude gmos from their territory , neither from cultivation nor from supermarket shelves . on wednesday , german agriculture minister renate künast conceded that her ministry could no longer prevent the cultivation of gm crops in germany .
but she pledged that her office would closely monitor crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast bei der eröffnung der fruit logistica " should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighboring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits , " künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" such lawsuits may be initiated if , for instance , a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . ” critics : gmos dangerous but opponents of the use of gmos are not convinced .
they claim that not enough scientific evidence is available to gauge the impact of what they call gm-contaminated foodstuffs on humans .
" genetically modified crops in general are dangerous for human health and also for the environment because what the g.e. -lrb- genetic engineering -rrb- industry is doing is putting new genes into new organisms , like taking a growth gene from a fish and putting it in a tomato , " said ulrike brendel of greenpeace germany .
" and of course nobody can predict what effects such a crude effort is having on human food and the environment . "
industry leaders claim that if the eu does not jump onto the gmo cultivation bandwagon , the continent may be left behind , then the continent will be left behind and put at a technological disadvantage over other countries who have deployed the cutting-edge agricultural methods .
but that may be a little off the mark , since few countries have adopted gmo foodstuffs despite a decade of attempts by american companies to promote genetically engineered agricultural technologies .
around 70 percent of land devoted to genetically engineered crops is in the united states , with almost all of the rest in argentina and canada . most other countries have been put off by the potential risks .
safeguards for conventional farmers the new german bill doesn ’ t specify what steps gmo farmers here will have to do to protect neighboring areas from being effected by their crops .
but in the event of contamination , the bill would allow for lawsuits to be filed and heard swiftly .
" should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighbouring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , " künast said , " the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits .
such lawsuits may be initiated , if for instance a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . "
künast also pointed out that it will be largely up to consumers to decide whether gmo foodstuffs become a major success in germany .
mandatory labeling within the european union informs consumers whether a product contains gmos and thus gives them the freedom to decide what they want to place on their dinner tables .
the bill must still be approved in a vote by germany 's parliament , the bundestag . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain : the promised land for gm corn spain is home to the greatest amount of genetically modified food production in europe .

dw-tv and the international film festival invited three young female documentary film makers to berlin to participate in workshops with accomplished colleagues . it took six long weeks of wrestling with the afghan authorities to get visas and exit permits for the three film makers .
gul makai ranjbar , halima hussiani and shakeba adill had a hard time getting to germany and the berlinale talent campus . although they had the support of international television broadcaster dw-tv and the german foreign ministry , it became increasingly doubtful whether they would be able to make the journey at all .
to cap it all off , the weather almost put an end to their plans .
the bundeswehr plane that was to bring the three young women safely to germany had to leave a day earlier than planned . from the airport in berlin , gul makai , halima and shakeba had to go straight to the " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " event at the haus der kulturen der welt the house of world cultures , which took place last sunday . after finally arriving , they told the young audience at the talent campus about their work and lives in one of the poorest and most crisis-ridden countries in the world .
they also presented excerpts from two of their films . dressed in jeans , sweaters and leather jackets , only their heads covered with the traditional hijab or headscarf , the women sat on the podium while talking about their work to iranian writer , documentary film maker and afghanistan expert , siba shakib , who hosted the discussion and acted as their interpreter . siba shakib presented the aïna media center in her introduction .
independent from the government , aïna is an afghan-french project that has been running for two years and has built up a network of independent journalists and media in afghanistan .
gul makai , halima and shakeba were trained through aïna and are now , with the aid of the organisation , producing their own films . " afghanistan unveiled " gul makai , who is 22-years-old , said that she had never known a life without war .
her father and brothers are dead , and even as a young girl she had to work to feed the family , despite having an injured leg . hard as this life may seem , it 's all too common in afghanistan .
apart from depicting the years of war against the russians , the three film makers concentrated on the reign of terror carried out by the radical islamic taliban .
the six years of their dictatorship were known to have been especially cruel for afghanistan 's female population . the film makers travelled to the afghan countryside to make their documentary film " afghanistan unveiled " .
it was probably the first time that women had travelled into the rural provinces alone .
they talked to women about their life and their experiences under the taliban .
whether they were female nomads with machine guns in their tents , or cave dwellers in the bamian valley , where the taliban destroyed the giant statues of buddha , their stories are very similar .
they deal with murder , rape and destruction , with unimaginable violence and contempt for the people , especially the women . the young film makers found filming an intense and disturbing experience .
during their courageous work , they learned much about their own country and its inhabitants .
afghanistan is a country full of cultural variety , they saidl . the desolate countryside and harsh climate make basic living conditions very difficult for its people . critiquing the new afghanistan another important subject is the period since the end of the taliban regime .
life in afghanistan is still far from any kind of normality .
a critical view of the situation is presented in the women 's second film , " shadows " , the sequel to " afghanistan unveiled " .
while kabul university prefers to enroll students with money and the right contacts , in the provinces , women and girls are still being abducted and raped .
there is a considerable amount of work left before there is real freedom of expression and the press . all the same , gul makai , halima and shakeba say that there have been great improvements in the direction of freedom .
what people in afghanistan need most for social change after such a long period of destructive chaos is time .
the presence of isaf , the international security assistance force , and the americans is necessary at the moment to ensure relative calm in the country .
in the long term , the afghans would like to develop their future identity free from external influences . gul makai , halima and shakeba are sure that their informative films will contribute to bringing about change in afghanistan .
the strength and intelligence , the involvement and self-confidence of these three young women provides hope for the future of their country . at the end of the discussion , günter knabe , deutsche welle 's afghanistan expert , spoke about " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " as a representative of the international broadcaster and organiser of the event .
he introduced the audience to dw-tv 's afghan program which broadcasts daily in dari and pashtu , and the donation campaign : " 100 classrooms for afghanistan " which was sponsored by the aid organisation cap anamur and deutsche welle .

several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .
experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed . many germans were shocked last week when they saw video footage of a group of students who physically abused one of their class mates .
up to 10 students at a vocational school in hildesheim in northern germany were allegedly involved in beating and humiliating a 17-year-old , kicking him , forcing him to brush his teeth with a wire brush and smearing motor oil on his genitalia .
the abuse apparently continued for months and took place during school hours in a storage room while the teacher remained in the classroom next door . five of the alleged abusers have been jailed so far and prosecutors are investigating the teacher 's apparent failure to supervise his class . on monday , a second case of abuse at another vocational school in nearby hannover made the news .
two 16-year-old students , a boy and a girl , were allegedly abused by five classmates .
the boy was repeatedly beaten with a rubber hammer in a changing room ; the girl was reportedly sexually abused . in the last week , several more cases have come into the open .
in bavaria , a 13-year-old boy was allegedly beaten unconscious by several students at a bus stop in the town of coburg .

she added that teachers should also enforce " basic rules of democracy " in their classrooms and prevent a culture in which swearing and abuse is accepted . in order to prepare teachers better for their jobs , they should also receive pedagogic training during their university education , schäfer said .

the boy was repeatedly beaten with a rubber hammer in a changing room ; the girl was reportedly sexually abused . in the last week , several more cases have come into the open .
in bavaria , a 13-year-old boy was allegedly beaten unconscious by several students at a bus stop in the town of coburg .
in a town near munich , three students allegedly filmed themselves beating a 14-year-old over several weeks .

the case in hildesheim has created the most uproar , causing officials to call for the installation of video cameras to prevent further incidents .
" it 's one of the options we 're looking at , " hans-herrman sölter -lrb- photo -rrb- , the school 's principal , told reporters . but experts said video cameras wo n't help to prevent similar incidents in the future .
" cameras can be destroyed or covered up , " angela ittel , who researches teenage behavior at berlin 's free university , told dw-world .
schools instead need to create a sense of community and involve students in the decision-making process . " you have to reach out to the students and that 's not really happening right now , " ittel said , adding that in general , school violence is not on the rise in germany . teachers also have to make sure they deal with problems early on , said mechthild schäfer , an expert on teenage bullying at ludwig-maximilians-university in munich .
she added that teachers should also enforce " basic rules of democracy " in their classrooms and prevent a culture in which swearing and abuse is accepted . in order to prepare teachers better for their jobs , they should also receive pedagogic training during their university education , schäfer said .
so far , prospective secondary school teachers are almost exclusively trained in the subject areas they plan to teach , but don ’ t get much guidance on how to interact with students . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de student killed in school shooting spree a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday approved a bill regulating the cultivation of genetically modified organisms .
the bill would make it legal for german farmers and supermarkets to sell gmo goods . the bill passed by germany 's ministers aims to codify european union legislation and guidelines for the cultivation and export of genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- into national law . several days ago , eu consumer protection commissioner david byrne criticized the german government for dragging its feet on regulating the export and import of gm foodstuffs out of fears that the products could swamp the market .
but with a new set of regulations in place , eu member states no longer have the right to exclude gmos from their territory , neither from cultivation nor from supermarket shelves . on wednesday , german agriculture minister renate künast conceded that her ministry could no longer prevent the cultivation of gm crops in germany .
but she pledged that her office would closely monitor crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast bei der eröffnung der fruit logistica " should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighboring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits , " künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" such lawsuits may be initiated if , for instance , a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . ” critics : gmos dangerous but opponents of the use of gmos are not convinced .
they claim that not enough scientific evidence is available to gauge the impact of what they call gm-contaminated foodstuffs on humans .
" genetically modified crops in general are dangerous for human health and also for the environment because what the g.e. -lrb- genetic engineering -rrb- industry is doing is putting new genes into new organisms , like taking a growth gene from a fish and putting it in a tomato , " said ulrike brendel of greenpeace germany .
" and of course nobody can predict what effects such a crude effort is having on human food and the environment . "
industry leaders claim that if the eu does not jump onto the gmo cultivation bandwagon , the continent may be left behind , then the continent will be left behind and put at a technological disadvantage over other countries who have deployed the cutting-edge agricultural methods .
but that may be a little off the mark , since few countries have adopted gmo foodstuffs despite a decade of attempts by american companies to promote genetically engineered agricultural technologies .
around 70 percent of land devoted to genetically engineered crops is in the united states , with almost all of the rest in argentina and canada . most other countries have been put off by the potential risks .
safeguards for conventional farmers the new german bill doesn ’ t specify what steps gmo farmers here will have to do to protect neighboring areas from being effected by their crops .
but in the event of contamination , the bill would allow for lawsuits to be filed and heard swiftly .
" should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighbouring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , " künast said , " the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits .
such lawsuits may be initiated , if for instance a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . "
künast also pointed out that it will be largely up to consumers to decide whether gmo foodstuffs become a major success in germany .
mandatory labeling within the european union informs consumers whether a product contains gmos and thus gives them the freedom to decide what they want to place on their dinner tables .
the bill must still be approved in a vote by germany 's parliament , the bundestag . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain : the promised land for gm corn spain is home to the greatest amount of genetically modified food production in europe .

south africa might be the special focus at this year 's berlin film festival , but the continent 's movie industry epicenter seems to lie further north : thousands of low-budget pictures are released in nigeria every year . when hollywood star charlize theron recently told reporters that it took just 28 days to shoot her latest film , " monster , " an appreciative murmur went through the room .
any nigerian filmmakers present must have chuckled a little - shooting a movie in five days sounds about right to them . " i 've made 25 films over the last five years , " charles novia , a nigerian director and producer , told his audience at a panel discussion on " nollywood , " nigeria 's booming movie industry in berlin this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : berlinale 2004 berlin goes berlinale lord of the films germany boosts profile of home-grown filmmakers abroad young film makers gather at talent campus culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.02.2004 afghan film makers at the berlinale talent campus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " afghanistan : film , freedom , future “ was the panel 's topic .
dw-tv and the international film festival invited three young female documentary film makers to berlin to participate in workshops with accomplished colleagues . it took six long weeks of wrestling with the afghan authorities to get visas and exit permits for the three film makers .
gul makai ranjbar , halima hussiani and shakeba adill had a hard time getting to germany and the berlinale talent campus . although they had the support of international television broadcaster dw-tv and the german foreign ministry , it became increasingly doubtful whether they would be able to make the journey at all .
to cap it all off , the weather almost put an end to their plans .
the bundeswehr plane that was to bring the three young women safely to germany had to leave a day earlier than planned . from the airport in berlin , gul makai , halima and shakeba had to go straight to the " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " event at the haus der kulturen der welt the house of world cultures , which took place last sunday . after finally arriving , they told the young audience at the talent campus about their work and lives in one of the poorest and most crisis-ridden countries in the world .
they also presented excerpts from two of their films . dressed in jeans , sweaters and leather jackets , only their heads covered with the traditional hijab or headscarf , the women sat on the podium while talking about their work to iranian writer , documentary film maker and afghanistan expert , siba shakib , who hosted the discussion and acted as their interpreter . siba shakib presented the aïna media center in her introduction .
independent from the government , aïna is an afghan-french project that has been running for two years and has built up a network of independent journalists and media in afghanistan .
gul makai , halima and shakeba were trained through aïna and are now , with the aid of the organisation , producing their own films . " afghanistan unveiled " gul makai , who is 22-years-old , said that she had never known a life without war .
her father and brothers are dead , and even as a young girl she had to work to feed the family , despite having an injured leg . hard as this life may seem , it 's all too common in afghanistan .
apart from depicting the years of war against the russians , the three film makers concentrated on the reign of terror carried out by the radical islamic taliban .
the six years of their dictatorship were known to have been especially cruel for afghanistan 's female population . the film makers travelled to the afghan countryside to make their documentary film " afghanistan unveiled " .
it was probably the first time that women had travelled into the rural provinces alone .
they talked to women about their life and their experiences under the taliban .
whether they were female nomads with machine guns in their tents , or cave dwellers in the bamian valley , where the taliban destroyed the giant statues of buddha , their stories are very similar .
they deal with murder , rape and destruction , with unimaginable violence and contempt for the people , especially the women . the young film makers found filming an intense and disturbing experience .
during their courageous work , they learned much about their own country and its inhabitants .
afghanistan is a country full of cultural variety , they saidl . the desolate countryside and harsh climate make basic living conditions very difficult for its people . critiquing the new afghanistan another important subject is the period since the end of the taliban regime .
life in afghanistan is still far from any kind of normality .
a critical view of the situation is presented in the women 's second film , " shadows " , the sequel to " afghanistan unveiled " .
while kabul university prefers to enroll students with money and the right contacts , in the provinces , women and girls are still being abducted and raped .
there is a considerable amount of work left before there is real freedom of expression and the press . all the same , gul makai , halima and shakeba say that there have been great improvements in the direction of freedom .
what people in afghanistan need most for social change after such a long period of destructive chaos is time .
the presence of isaf , the international security assistance force , and the americans is necessary at the moment to ensure relative calm in the country .
in the long term , the afghans would like to develop their future identity free from external influences . gul makai , halima and shakeba are sure that their informative films will contribute to bringing about change in afghanistan .
the strength and intelligence , the involvement and self-confidence of these three young women provides hope for the future of their country . at the end of the discussion , günter knabe , deutsche welle 's afghanistan expert , spoke about " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " as a representative of the international broadcaster and organiser of the event .
he introduced the audience to dw-tv 's afghan program which broadcasts daily in dari and pashtu , and the donation campaign : " 100 classrooms for afghanistan " which was sponsored by the aid organisation cap anamur and deutsche welle .

the german government is set to contribute to small eu military units proposed by france and britain to stabilize crisis zones .
should eu members approve , they could be operating by 2007 . french and british officials announced the plan on tuesday , saying they each intend to set up one unit , which would be made up of 1,500 soldiers .
they emphasized that the proposal would not conflict with nato 's planned response force of 21,000 troops or an earlier eu plan to create a military unit comprised of 60,000 soldiers . " the objective is to have a new tool for europeans which will not compete with others , " a french foreign ministry spokesman told reuters news agency .
" it allows the europeans to be present -lrb- in a crisis -rrb- . "
reuters also quoted a senior diplomat , who said germany would fund an additional unit , with hopes that italy , spain and poland would join in as well .
groups of smaller member states could form multinational units . in and out within 45 days the soldiers would serve as a stabilizing force in crisis regions until u.n. peacekeepers can be sent there .
groups should be ready for deployment within 15 days and serve a maximum of 30 days .
the teams would be similar to a french-led military unit that was sent to the democratic republic of congo last year .
operation " artemis " focused on keeping things under control and securing infrastructure until un troops arrived .
germany participated in this operation , albeit only with logistical support . should the eu approve the proposal , seven or eight units could be up and running by 2007 . france , britain and germany hope to get the green light from other member states by june .
the three countries ' leaders , french president jacques chirac , britain 's premier tony blair and german chancellor gerhard schröder , are expected to discuss the issue at a meeting in berlin on feb .

the german government is set to contribute to small eu military units proposed by france and britain to stabilize crisis zones .
should eu members approve , they could be operating by 2007 . french and british officials announced the plan on tuesday , saying they each intend to set up one unit , which would be made up of 1,500 soldiers .
they emphasized that the proposal would not conflict with nato 's planned response force of 21,000 troops or an earlier eu plan to create a military unit comprised of 60,000 soldiers . " the objective is to have a new tool for europeans which will not compete with others , " a french foreign ministry spokesman told reuters news agency .
" it allows the europeans to be present -lrb- in a crisis -rrb- . "
reuters also quoted a senior diplomat , who said germany would fund an additional unit , with hopes that italy , spain and poland would join in as well .
groups of smaller member states could form multinational units . in and out within 45 days the soldiers would serve as a stabilizing force in crisis regions until u.n. peacekeepers can be sent there .
groups should be ready for deployment within 15 days and serve a maximum of 30 days .
the teams would be similar to a french-led military unit that was sent to the democratic republic of congo last year .
operation " artemis " focused on keeping things under control and securing infrastructure until un troops arrived .
germany participated in this operation , albeit only with logistical support . should the eu approve the proposal , seven or eight units could be up and running by 2007 . france , britain and germany hope to get the green light from other member states by june .
the three countries ' leaders , french president jacques chirac , britain 's premier tony blair and german chancellor gerhard schröder , are expected to discuss the issue at a meeting in berlin on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : berlinale 2004 berlin goes berlinale lord of the films germany boosts profile of home-grown filmmakers abroad young film makers gather at talent campus culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.02.2004 watch out hollywood , here comes nollywood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " dynasty , " nigerian style .
south africa might be the special focus at this year 's berlin film festival , but the continent 's movie industry epicenter seems to lie further north : thousands of low-budget pictures are released in nigeria every year . when hollywood star charlize theron recently told reporters that it took just 28 days to shoot her latest film , " monster , " an appreciative murmur went through the room .
any nigerian filmmakers present must have chuckled a little - shooting a movie in five days sounds about right to them . " i 've made 25 films over the last five years , " charles novia , a nigerian director and producer , told his audience at a panel discussion on " nollywood , " nigeria 's booming movie industry in berlin this week .
equipped with a video camera , a script and often as little as € 5,000 , novia and his colleagues churn out up to 50 feature-length films every week . " sometimes people sell their cars to start a film , " said peace fiberesima , another producer and director .
others borrow money from relatives or friends or call colleagues who owe them a favor to help out for free , she added . video 's the way to go the video boom came after nigeria 's movie theaters started losing customers during an economic downturn in the 1980s .
while many of the theaters have now been turned into churches , about 200,000 people earn their money through working for the movies .
estimates of the industry 's revenue range from € 95 million -lrb- $ 121 million -rrb- to € 680 million . " i did n't believe what they were telling me , " said dorothee wenner , who works for the berlinale 's international forum and organized the two-day event at berlin 's hebbel am ufer theater .
" in the end , i came back -lrb- to germany -rrb- and found out that i was n't the only one who did n't have a clue . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedestrians push their way through a traffic jam in downtown lagos .
nollywood booms without government funding .
in fact , nigeria 's movie industry , which is centered in the country 's former capital , lagos -lrb- photo -rrb- , pays the government about € 3.5 million per year to censor its products , according to fiberesima . " i do n't think anyone from the west can understand what it 's like to build an industry without any help from the state , " said brenda goldblatt , a south african filmmaker who recently made a documentary on nollywood .
" these films are companions in life for people .
in the west , there 's nothing like the depth of the relationship -lrb- between viewers and movies -rrb- . " movies people can relate to what 's produced looks a lot like latin american telenovelas and has little to do with hollywood blockbusters .
viewers seem to like it that way .
renting american-made films in the video stores costs half as much as nollywood productions , but the imports still collect dust on the shelves . " most nigerians don ’ t want to watch ' terminator 3 , " ' fiberesima said .
" they want to watch ' real love ' or ' true love ' or ' saving alero , " ' she added , referring to recent nigerian releases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 200,000 copies are sold per film .
unlike bollywood films - melodramatic productions from india - not all nollywood movies are similar , as fiberesima , amata and their colleagues are eager to point out .
" it 's not a style of making films , it 's the nigerian market for films , " said jeta amata , a 29-year-old director , producer and actor who has already made 40 movies .
he added that all he wants to do is entertain his countrymen . " it 's a cultural thing of appreciating home , " fiberesima said , adding that nigerians can relate to the stories about crime , love , sex , and power which are set in their neighborhoods .
while some films focus on rituals and myths from a specific ethnic group , " most of the films talk to everybody , " she said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale 2004 read , watch and listen to dw-world 's entire 2004 berlinale coverage . dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .
experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed . many germans were shocked last week when they saw video footage of a group of students who physically abused one of their class mates .
up to 10 students at a vocational school in hildesheim in northern germany were allegedly involved in beating and humiliating a 17-year-old , kicking him , forcing him to brush his teeth with a wire brush and smearing motor oil on his genitalia .
the abuse apparently continued for months and took place during school hours in a storage room while the teacher remained in the classroom next door . five of the alleged abusers have been jailed so far and prosecutors are investigating the teacher 's apparent failure to supervise his class . on monday , a second case of abuse at another vocational school in nearby hannover made the news .
two 16-year-old students , a boy and a girl , were allegedly abused by five classmates .
the boy was repeatedly beaten with a rubber hammer in a changing room ; the girl was reportedly sexually abused . in the last week , several more cases have come into the open .
in bavaria , a 13-year-old boy was allegedly beaten unconscious by several students at a bus stop in the town of coburg .

" it 's one of the options we 're looking at , " hans-herrman sölter -lrb- photo -rrb- , the school 's principal , told reporters . but experts said video cameras wo n't help to prevent similar incidents in the future .
" cameras can be destroyed or covered up , " angela ittel , who researches teenage behavior at berlin 's free university , told dw-world .
schools instead need to create a sense of community and involve students in the decision-making process . " you have to reach out to the students and that 's not really happening right now , " ittel said , adding that in general , school violence is not on the rise in germany . teachers also have to make sure they deal with problems early on , said mechthild schäfer , an expert on teenage bullying at ludwig-maximilians-university in munich .
she added that teachers should also enforce " basic rules of democracy " in their classrooms and prevent a culture in which swearing and abuse is accepted . in order to prepare teachers better for their jobs , they should also receive pedagogic training during their university education , schäfer said .

" cameras can be destroyed or covered up , " angela ittel , who researches teenage behavior at berlin 's free university , told dw-world .
schools instead need to create a sense of community and involve students in the decision-making process . " you have to reach out to the students and that 's not really happening right now , " ittel said , adding that in general , school violence is not on the rise in germany . teachers also have to make sure they deal with problems early on , said mechthild schäfer , an expert on teenage bullying at ludwig-maximilians-university in munich .
she added that teachers should also enforce " basic rules of democracy " in their classrooms and prevent a culture in which swearing and abuse is accepted . in order to prepare teachers better for their jobs , they should also receive pedagogic training during their university education , schäfer said .
so far , prospective secondary school teachers are almost exclusively trained in the subject areas they plan to teach , but don ’ t get much guidance on how to interact with students . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de student killed in school shooting spree a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine .

south africa might be the special focus at this year 's berlin film festival , but the continent 's movie industry epicenter seems to lie further north : thousands of low-budget pictures are released in nigeria every year . when hollywood star charlize theron recently told reporters that it took just 28 days to shoot her latest film , " monster , " an appreciative murmur went through the room .
any nigerian filmmakers present must have chuckled a little - shooting a movie in five days sounds about right to them . " i 've made 25 films over the last five years , " charles novia , a nigerian director and producer , told his audience at a panel discussion on " nollywood , " nigeria 's booming movie industry in berlin this week .
equipped with a video camera , a script and often as little as € 5,000 , novia and his colleagues churn out up to 50 feature-length films every week . " sometimes people sell their cars to start a film , " said peace fiberesima , another producer and director .
others borrow money from relatives or friends or call colleagues who owe them a favor to help out for free , she added . video 's the way to go the video boom came after nigeria 's movie theaters started losing customers during an economic downturn in the 1980s .
while many of the theaters have now been turned into churches , about 200,000 people earn their money through working for the movies .
estimates of the industry 's revenue range from € 95 million -lrb- $ 121 million -rrb- to € 680 million . " i did n't believe what they were telling me , " said dorothee wenner , who works for the berlinale 's international forum and organized the two-day event at berlin 's hebbel am ufer theater .

nollywood booms without government funding .
in fact , nigeria 's movie industry , which is centered in the country 's former capital , lagos -lrb- photo -rrb- , pays the government about € 3.5 million per year to censor its products , according to fiberesima . " i do n't think anyone from the west can understand what it 's like to build an industry without any help from the state , " said brenda goldblatt , a south african filmmaker who recently made a documentary on nollywood .
" these films are companions in life for people .
in the west , there 's nothing like the depth of the relationship -lrb- between viewers and movies -rrb- . " movies people can relate to what 's produced looks a lot like latin american telenovelas and has little to do with hollywood blockbusters .
viewers seem to like it that way .
renting american-made films in the video stores costs half as much as nollywood productions , but the imports still collect dust on the shelves . " most nigerians don ’ t want to watch ' terminator 3 , " ' fiberesima said .
" they want to watch ' real love ' or ' true love ' or ' saving alero , " ' she added , referring to recent nigerian releases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 200,000 copies are sold per film .

" it 's not a style of making films , it 's the nigerian market for films , " said jeta amata , a 29-year-old director , producer and actor who has already made 40 movies .
he added that all he wants to do is entertain his countrymen . " it 's a cultural thing of appreciating home , " fiberesima said , adding that nigerians can relate to the stories about crime , love , sex , and power which are set in their neighborhoods .

dw-tv and the international film festival invited three young female documentary film makers to berlin to participate in workshops with accomplished colleagues . it took six long weeks of wrestling with the afghan authorities to get visas and exit permits for the three film makers .
gul makai ranjbar , halima hussiani and shakeba adill had a hard time getting to germany and the berlinale talent campus . although they had the support of international television broadcaster dw-tv and the german foreign ministry , it became increasingly doubtful whether they would be able to make the journey at all .
to cap it all off , the weather almost put an end to their plans .
the bundeswehr plane that was to bring the three young women safely to germany had to leave a day earlier than planned . from the airport in berlin , gul makai , halima and shakeba had to go straight to the " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " event at the haus der kulturen der welt the house of world cultures , which took place last sunday . after finally arriving , they told the young audience at the talent campus about their work and lives in one of the poorest and most crisis-ridden countries in the world .
they also presented excerpts from two of their films . dressed in jeans , sweaters and leather jackets , only their heads covered with the traditional hijab or headscarf , the women sat on the podium while talking about their work to iranian writer , documentary film maker and afghanistan expert , siba shakib , who hosted the discussion and acted as their interpreter . siba shakib presented the aïna media center in her introduction .
independent from the government , aïna is an afghan-french project that has been running for two years and has built up a network of independent journalists and media in afghanistan .
gul makai , halima and shakeba were trained through aïna and are now , with the aid of the organisation , producing their own films . " afghanistan unveiled " gul makai , who is 22-years-old , said that she had never known a life without war .
her father and brothers are dead , and even as a young girl she had to work to feed the family , despite having an injured leg . hard as this life may seem , it 's all too common in afghanistan .
apart from depicting the years of war against the russians , the three film makers concentrated on the reign of terror carried out by the radical islamic taliban .
the six years of their dictatorship were known to have been especially cruel for afghanistan 's female population . the film makers travelled to the afghan countryside to make their documentary film " afghanistan unveiled " .
it was probably the first time that women had travelled into the rural provinces alone .
they talked to women about their life and their experiences under the taliban .
whether they were female nomads with machine guns in their tents , or cave dwellers in the bamian valley , where the taliban destroyed the giant statues of buddha , their stories are very similar .
they deal with murder , rape and destruction , with unimaginable violence and contempt for the people , especially the women . the young film makers found filming an intense and disturbing experience .
during their courageous work , they learned much about their own country and its inhabitants .
afghanistan is a country full of cultural variety , they saidl . the desolate countryside and harsh climate make basic living conditions very difficult for its people . critiquing the new afghanistan another important subject is the period since the end of the taliban regime .
life in afghanistan is still far from any kind of normality .
a critical view of the situation is presented in the women 's second film , " shadows " , the sequel to " afghanistan unveiled " .
while kabul university prefers to enroll students with money and the right contacts , in the provinces , women and girls are still being abducted and raped .
there is a considerable amount of work left before there is real freedom of expression and the press . all the same , gul makai , halima and shakeba say that there have been great improvements in the direction of freedom .
what people in afghanistan need most for social change after such a long period of destructive chaos is time .
the presence of isaf , the international security assistance force , and the americans is necessary at the moment to ensure relative calm in the country .
in the long term , the afghans would like to develop their future identity free from external influences . gul makai , halima and shakeba are sure that their informative films will contribute to bringing about change in afghanistan .
the strength and intelligence , the involvement and self-confidence of these three young women provides hope for the future of their country . at the end of the discussion , günter knabe , deutsche welle 's afghanistan expert , spoke about " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " as a representative of the international broadcaster and organiser of the event .

dw-tv and the international film festival invited three young female documentary film makers to berlin to participate in workshops with accomplished colleagues . it took six long weeks of wrestling with the afghan authorities to get visas and exit permits for the three film makers .
gul makai ranjbar , halima hussiani and shakeba adill had a hard time getting to germany and the berlinale talent campus . although they had the support of international television broadcaster dw-tv and the german foreign ministry , it became increasingly doubtful whether they would be able to make the journey at all .
to cap it all off , the weather almost put an end to their plans .
the bundeswehr plane that was to bring the three young women safely to germany had to leave a day earlier than planned . from the airport in berlin , gul makai , halima and shakeba had to go straight to the " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " event at the haus der kulturen der welt the house of world cultures , which took place last sunday . after finally arriving , they told the young audience at the talent campus about their work and lives in one of the poorest and most crisis-ridden countries in the world .
they also presented excerpts from two of their films . dressed in jeans , sweaters and leather jackets , only their heads covered with the traditional hijab or headscarf , the women sat on the podium while talking about their work to iranian writer , documentary film maker and afghanistan expert , siba shakib , who hosted the discussion and acted as their interpreter . siba shakib presented the aïna media center in her introduction .
independent from the government , aïna is an afghan-french project that has been running for two years and has built up a network of independent journalists and media in afghanistan .
gul makai , halima and shakeba were trained through aïna and are now , with the aid of the organisation , producing their own films . " afghanistan unveiled " gul makai , who is 22-years-old , said that she had never known a life without war .
her father and brothers are dead , and even as a young girl she had to work to feed the family , despite having an injured leg . hard as this life may seem , it 's all too common in afghanistan .
apart from depicting the years of war against the russians , the three film makers concentrated on the reign of terror carried out by the radical islamic taliban .
the six years of their dictatorship were known to have been especially cruel for afghanistan 's female population . the film makers travelled to the afghan countryside to make their documentary film " afghanistan unveiled " .
it was probably the first time that women had travelled into the rural provinces alone .
they talked to women about their life and their experiences under the taliban .
whether they were female nomads with machine guns in their tents , or cave dwellers in the bamian valley , where the taliban destroyed the giant statues of buddha , their stories are very similar .
they deal with murder , rape and destruction , with unimaginable violence and contempt for the people , especially the women . the young film makers found filming an intense and disturbing experience .
during their courageous work , they learned much about their own country and its inhabitants .
afghanistan is a country full of cultural variety , they saidl . the desolate countryside and harsh climate make basic living conditions very difficult for its people . critiquing the new afghanistan another important subject is the period since the end of the taliban regime .
life in afghanistan is still far from any kind of normality .
a critical view of the situation is presented in the women 's second film , " shadows " , the sequel to " afghanistan unveiled " .
while kabul university prefers to enroll students with money and the right contacts , in the provinces , women and girls are still being abducted and raped .
there is a considerable amount of work left before there is real freedom of expression and the press . all the same , gul makai , halima and shakeba say that there have been great improvements in the direction of freedom .
what people in afghanistan need most for social change after such a long period of destructive chaos is time .
the presence of isaf , the international security assistance force , and the americans is necessary at the moment to ensure relative calm in the country .
in the long term , the afghans would like to develop their future identity free from external influences . gul makai , halima and shakeba are sure that their informative films will contribute to bringing about change in afghanistan .
the strength and intelligence , the involvement and self-confidence of these three young women provides hope for the future of their country . at the end of the discussion , günter knabe , deutsche welle 's afghanistan expert , spoke about " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " as a representative of the international broadcaster and organiser of the event .
he introduced the audience to dw-tv 's afghan program which broadcasts daily in dari and pashtu , and the donation campaign : " 100 classrooms for afghanistan " which was sponsored by the aid organisation cap anamur and deutsche welle .

dw-tv and the international film festival invited three young female documentary film makers to berlin to participate in workshops with accomplished colleagues . it took six long weeks of wrestling with the afghan authorities to get visas and exit permits for the three film makers .
gul makai ranjbar , halima hussiani and shakeba adill had a hard time getting to germany and the berlinale talent campus . although they had the support of international television broadcaster dw-tv and the german foreign ministry , it became increasingly doubtful whether they would be able to make the journey at all .
to cap it all off , the weather almost put an end to their plans .
the bundeswehr plane that was to bring the three young women safely to germany had to leave a day earlier than planned . from the airport in berlin , gul makai , halima and shakeba had to go straight to the " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " event at the haus der kulturen der welt the house of world cultures , which took place last sunday . after finally arriving , they told the young audience at the talent campus about their work and lives in one of the poorest and most crisis-ridden countries in the world .
they also presented excerpts from two of their films . dressed in jeans , sweaters and leather jackets , only their heads covered with the traditional hijab or headscarf , the women sat on the podium while talking about their work to iranian writer , documentary film maker and afghanistan expert , siba shakib , who hosted the discussion and acted as their interpreter . siba shakib presented the aïna media center in her introduction .
independent from the government , aïna is an afghan-french project that has been running for two years and has built up a network of independent journalists and media in afghanistan .
gul makai , halima and shakeba were trained through aïna and are now , with the aid of the organisation , producing their own films . " afghanistan unveiled " gul makai , who is 22-years-old , said that she had never known a life without war .
her father and brothers are dead , and even as a young girl she had to work to feed the family , despite having an injured leg . hard as this life may seem , it 's all too common in afghanistan .
apart from depicting the years of war against the russians , the three film makers concentrated on the reign of terror carried out by the radical islamic taliban .
the six years of their dictatorship were known to have been especially cruel for afghanistan 's female population . the film makers travelled to the afghan countryside to make their documentary film " afghanistan unveiled " .
it was probably the first time that women had travelled into the rural provinces alone .
they talked to women about their life and their experiences under the taliban .
whether they were female nomads with machine guns in their tents , or cave dwellers in the bamian valley , where the taliban destroyed the giant statues of buddha , their stories are very similar .
they deal with murder , rape and destruction , with unimaginable violence and contempt for the people , especially the women . the young film makers found filming an intense and disturbing experience .
during their courageous work , they learned much about their own country and its inhabitants .
afghanistan is a country full of cultural variety , they saidl . the desolate countryside and harsh climate make basic living conditions very difficult for its people . critiquing the new afghanistan another important subject is the period since the end of the taliban regime .
life in afghanistan is still far from any kind of normality .
a critical view of the situation is presented in the women 's second film , " shadows " , the sequel to " afghanistan unveiled " .
while kabul university prefers to enroll students with money and the right contacts , in the provinces , women and girls are still being abducted and raped .
there is a considerable amount of work left before there is real freedom of expression and the press . all the same , gul makai , halima and shakeba say that there have been great improvements in the direction of freedom .
what people in afghanistan need most for social change after such a long period of destructive chaos is time .
the presence of isaf , the international security assistance force , and the americans is necessary at the moment to ensure relative calm in the country .
in the long term , the afghans would like to develop their future identity free from external influences . gul makai , halima and shakeba are sure that their informative films will contribute to bringing about change in afghanistan .
the strength and intelligence , the involvement and self-confidence of these three young women provides hope for the future of their country . at the end of the discussion , günter knabe , deutsche welle 's afghanistan expert , spoke about " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " as a representative of the international broadcaster and organiser of the event .

south africa might be the special focus at this year 's berlin film festival , but the continent 's movie industry epicenter seems to lie further north : thousands of low-budget pictures are released in nigeria every year . when hollywood star charlize theron recently told reporters that it took just 28 days to shoot her latest film , " monster , " an appreciative murmur went through the room .
any nigerian filmmakers present must have chuckled a little - shooting a movie in five days sounds about right to them . " i 've made 25 films over the last five years , " charles novia , a nigerian director and producer , told his audience at a panel discussion on " nollywood , " nigeria 's booming movie industry in berlin this week .
equipped with a video camera , a script and often as little as € 5,000 , novia and his colleagues churn out up to 50 feature-length films every week . " sometimes people sell their cars to start a film , " said peace fiberesima , another producer and director .
others borrow money from relatives or friends or call colleagues who owe them a favor to help out for free , she added . video 's the way to go the video boom came after nigeria 's movie theaters started losing customers during an economic downturn in the 1980s .
while many of the theaters have now been turned into churches , about 200,000 people earn their money through working for the movies .
estimates of the industry 's revenue range from € 95 million -lrb- $ 121 million -rrb- to € 680 million . " i did n't believe what they were telling me , " said dorothee wenner , who works for the berlinale 's international forum and organized the two-day event at berlin 's hebbel am ufer theater .

nollywood booms without government funding .
in fact , nigeria 's movie industry , which is centered in the country 's former capital , lagos -lrb- photo -rrb- , pays the government about € 3.5 million per year to censor its products , according to fiberesima . " i do n't think anyone from the west can understand what it 's like to build an industry without any help from the state , " said brenda goldblatt , a south african filmmaker who recently made a documentary on nollywood .
" these films are companions in life for people .
in the west , there 's nothing like the depth of the relationship -lrb- between viewers and movies -rrb- . " movies people can relate to what 's produced looks a lot like latin american telenovelas and has little to do with hollywood blockbusters .
viewers seem to like it that way .
renting american-made films in the video stores costs half as much as nollywood productions , but the imports still collect dust on the shelves . " most nigerians don ’ t want to watch ' terminator 3 , " ' fiberesima said .
" they want to watch ' real love ' or ' true love ' or ' saving alero , " ' she added , referring to recent nigerian releases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 200,000 copies are sold per film .
unlike bollywood films - melodramatic productions from india - not all nollywood movies are similar , as fiberesima , amata and their colleagues are eager to point out .
" it 's not a style of making films , it 's the nigerian market for films , " said jeta amata , a 29-year-old director , producer and actor who has already made 40 movies .
he added that all he wants to do is entertain his countrymen . " it 's a cultural thing of appreciating home , " fiberesima said , adding that nigerians can relate to the stories about crime , love , sex , and power which are set in their neighborhoods .

the new countries " also are in a situation where they have a lot of domestic expenditure , and , although they are preparing to receive a lot of support from the eu , at the same time , they will also be interested in giving as little as possible in terms of fees to the eu " , added the minister .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.02.2004 spain : the promised land for gm corn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : golden fields of gmos spain is home to the greatest amount of genetically modified food production in europe .
the experience gained there could prove valuable for germany and the rest europe . the use of genetically modified organisms remains a hot-button topic throughout most of european union .
and the german government , led by the social democrats and the greens , is n't exactly seen as a friend of the gmo industry .
indeed , the pesticide and crop care industry association agrar on wednesday criticized remarks made by consumer protection minister renate künast , a skeptic of gmos , and a new government bill the industry says would inhibit the fair use of so-called " green genetic technologies " rather than permit them as intended .
but as germany continues to debate how to deal with gmos , it could look to the lessons learned in spain , where gmos have been widely embraced .
the eu frontrunner in gm food production cultivates 32,000 hectares -lrb- 79,000 acres -rrb- of gm crops .
bt-176 is one of the spanish farmer 's gm corns of choice .
it 's designed to be resistant to weeds and other pests , including the crop-wasting european corn borer .
the fat white caterpillars regularly chew through catalonian farmers ' corn fields , ruining entire harvests .
while few conventional varieties of corn can survive the onslaughts , bt-176 crops remain unaffected .
" we spanish farmers have had very good experiences with gm corn .
with a minimum of pesticides we have pests under control , " jesus ribera of the spanish young farmers association told deutsche welle .
" that 's good for the environment and good for the farmers because we do n't lose any crops now . "
greater yields , more money spanish farmers are practically encouraged to cultivate gm corn .
they reap greater crops and animal feed producers are willing to pay premium for the corn .
additionally , they are unhindered by any restrictions from the spanish agricultural ministry .
" when someone consciously decides to sow gm corn , we know who does it where - and it 's fine , " said luis bayon of the ecological agriculture committee in madrid .
" but it 's something else if someone thinks they 're sowing conventional corn and genetically modified seeds are actually there . "
the incident in navarra no one knows exactly what happens when the wind blows gm corn pollen onto conventional fields .
but in 2001 , organic farmers in northern spanish region of navarra were prohibited from selling their corn as organic because gm stock had strayed onto their fields .
as yet , no fault has been determined in the case and the farmers have not been compensated .
the spanish government has commissioned the university of barcelona to investigate the consequences of genetic transfers , but the results of the research has not yet been released .
nevertheless , the government in madrid approved five new sorts of gm corn in the last five years .
protest has come mostly from the usual suspects , including environmentalists such as greenpeace .
and even though many spanish supermarket chains have " zero genetic technology " tolerance policies , the concerns of environmentalists and convention farmers are often plowed over .
" the conventional farmers do n't want to allow any kind of commingling so that their harvest is pure , " said ribera .
" that 's why they now have a problem .
agriculture is just like life : absolute purity does n't exist . " marc koch send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's reluctant cabinet to allow gmo foods german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday approved a bill regulating the cultivation of genetically modified organisms .
the bill would make it legal for german farmers and supermarkets to sell gmo goods .

several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .
experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed . many germans were shocked last week when they saw video footage of a group of students who physically abused one of their class mates .
up to 10 students at a vocational school in hildesheim in northern germany were allegedly involved in beating and humiliating a 17-year-old , kicking him , forcing him to brush his teeth with a wire brush and smearing motor oil on his genitalia .
the abuse apparently continued for months and took place during school hours in a storage room while the teacher remained in the classroom next door . five of the alleged abusers have been jailed so far and prosecutors are investigating the teacher 's apparent failure to supervise his class . on monday , a second case of abuse at another vocational school in nearby hannover made the news .
two 16-year-old students , a boy and a girl , were allegedly abused by five classmates .
the boy was repeatedly beaten with a rubber hammer in a changing room ; the girl was reportedly sexually abused . in the last week , several more cases have come into the open .
in bavaria , a 13-year-old boy was allegedly beaten unconscious by several students at a bus stop in the town of coburg .
in a town near munich , three students allegedly filmed themselves beating a 14-year-old over several weeks .
in the southwestern german state of rhineland-palatinate , a 16-year-old student was jailed for allegedly beating a schoolmate . early intervention needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-hermann sölter , center , in front of his school in hildesheim .
the case in hildesheim has created the most uproar , causing officials to call for the installation of video cameras to prevent further incidents .
" it 's one of the options we 're looking at , " hans-herrman sölter -lrb- photo -rrb- , the school 's principal , told reporters . but experts said video cameras wo n't help to prevent similar incidents in the future .
" cameras can be destroyed or covered up , " angela ittel , who researches teenage behavior at berlin 's free university , told dw-world .
schools instead need to create a sense of community and involve students in the decision-making process . " you have to reach out to the students and that 's not really happening right now , " ittel said , adding that in general , school violence is not on the rise in germany . teachers also have to make sure they deal with problems early on , said mechthild schäfer , an expert on teenage bullying at ludwig-maximilians-university in munich .
she added that teachers should also enforce " basic rules of democracy " in their classrooms and prevent a culture in which swearing and abuse is accepted . in order to prepare teachers better for their jobs , they should also receive pedagogic training during their university education , schäfer said .

several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .
experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed . many germans were shocked last week when they saw video footage of a group of students who physically abused one of their class mates .
up to 10 students at a vocational school in hildesheim in northern germany were allegedly involved in beating and humiliating a 17-year-old , kicking him , forcing him to brush his teeth with a wire brush and smearing motor oil on his genitalia .
the abuse apparently continued for months and took place during school hours in a storage room while the teacher remained in the classroom next door . five of the alleged abusers have been jailed so far and prosecutors are investigating the teacher 's apparent failure to supervise his class . on monday , a second case of abuse at another vocational school in nearby hannover made the news .
two 16-year-old students , a boy and a girl , were allegedly abused by five classmates .
the boy was repeatedly beaten with a rubber hammer in a changing room ; the girl was reportedly sexually abused . in the last week , several more cases have come into the open .
in bavaria , a 13-year-old boy was allegedly beaten unconscious by several students at a bus stop in the town of coburg .
in a town near munich , three students allegedly filmed themselves beating a 14-year-old over several weeks .
in the southwestern german state of rhineland-palatinate , a 16-year-old student was jailed for allegedly beating a schoolmate . early intervention needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-hermann sölter , center , in front of his school in hildesheim .
the case in hildesheim has created the most uproar , causing officials to call for the installation of video cameras to prevent further incidents .
" it 's one of the options we 're looking at , " hans-herrman sölter -lrb- photo -rrb- , the school 's principal , told reporters . but experts said video cameras wo n't help to prevent similar incidents in the future .
" cameras can be destroyed or covered up , " angela ittel , who researches teenage behavior at berlin 's free university , told dw-world .
schools instead need to create a sense of community and involve students in the decision-making process . " you have to reach out to the students and that 's not really happening right now , " ittel said , adding that in general , school violence is not on the rise in germany . teachers also have to make sure they deal with problems early on , said mechthild schäfer , an expert on teenage bullying at ludwig-maximilians-university in munich .
she added that teachers should also enforce " basic rules of democracy " in their classrooms and prevent a culture in which swearing and abuse is accepted . in order to prepare teachers better for their jobs , they should also receive pedagogic training during their university education , schäfer said .
so far , prospective secondary school teachers are almost exclusively trained in the subject areas they plan to teach , but don ’ t get much guidance on how to interact with students . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de student killed in school shooting spree a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday approved a bill regulating the cultivation of genetically modified organisms .
the bill would make it legal for german farmers and supermarkets to sell gmo goods . the bill passed by germany 's ministers aims to codify european union legislation and guidelines for the cultivation and export of genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- into national law . several days ago , eu consumer protection commissioner david byrne criticized the german government for dragging its feet on regulating the export and import of gm foodstuffs out of fears that the products could swamp the market .
but with a new set of regulations in place , eu member states no longer have the right to exclude gmos from their territory , neither from cultivation nor from supermarket shelves . on wednesday , german agriculture minister renate künast conceded that her ministry could no longer prevent the cultivation of gm crops in germany .
but she pledged that her office would closely monitor crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast bei der eröffnung der fruit logistica " should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighboring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits , " künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" such lawsuits may be initiated if , for instance , a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . ” critics : gmos dangerous but opponents of the use of gmos are not convinced .
they claim that not enough scientific evidence is available to gauge the impact of what they call gm-contaminated foodstuffs on humans .
" genetically modified crops in general are dangerous for human health and also for the environment because what the g.e. -lrb- genetic engineering -rrb- industry is doing is putting new genes into new organisms , like taking a growth gene from a fish and putting it in a tomato , " said ulrike brendel of greenpeace germany .
" and of course nobody can predict what effects such a crude effort is having on human food and the environment . "
industry leaders claim that if the eu does not jump onto the gmo cultivation bandwagon , the continent may be left behind , then the continent will be left behind and put at a technological disadvantage over other countries who have deployed the cutting-edge agricultural methods .
but that may be a little off the mark , since few countries have adopted gmo foodstuffs despite a decade of attempts by american companies to promote genetically engineered agricultural technologies .
around 70 percent of land devoted to genetically engineered crops is in the united states , with almost all of the rest in argentina and canada . most other countries have been put off by the potential risks .
safeguards for conventional farmers the new german bill doesn ’ t specify what steps gmo farmers here will have to do to protect neighboring areas from being effected by their crops .
but in the event of contamination , the bill would allow for lawsuits to be filed and heard swiftly .
" should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighbouring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , " künast said , " the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits .
such lawsuits may be initiated , if for instance a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . "
künast also pointed out that it will be largely up to consumers to decide whether gmo foodstuffs become a major success in germany .
mandatory labeling within the european union informs consumers whether a product contains gmos and thus gives them the freedom to decide what they want to place on their dinner tables .
the bill must still be approved in a vote by germany 's parliament , the bundestag . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain : the promised land for gm corn spain is home to the greatest amount of genetically modified food production in europe .

" and of course nobody can predict what effects such a crude effort is having on human food and the environment . "
industry leaders claim that if the eu does not jump onto the gmo cultivation bandwagon , the continent may be left behind , then the continent will be left behind and put at a technological disadvantage over other countries who have deployed the cutting-edge agricultural methods .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday approved a bill regulating the cultivation of genetically modified organisms .
the bill would make it legal for german farmers and supermarkets to sell gmo goods . the bill passed by germany 's ministers aims to codify european union legislation and guidelines for the cultivation and export of genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- into national law . several days ago , eu consumer protection commissioner david byrne criticized the german government for dragging its feet on regulating the export and import of gm foodstuffs out of fears that the products could swamp the market .
but with a new set of regulations in place , eu member states no longer have the right to exclude gmos from their territory , neither from cultivation nor from supermarket shelves . on wednesday , german agriculture minister renate künast conceded that her ministry could no longer prevent the cultivation of gm crops in germany .
but she pledged that her office would closely monitor crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast bei der eröffnung der fruit logistica " should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighboring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits , " künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" such lawsuits may be initiated if , for instance , a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . ” critics : gmos dangerous but opponents of the use of gmos are not convinced .
they claim that not enough scientific evidence is available to gauge the impact of what they call gm-contaminated foodstuffs on humans .

bosse ringholm , finance minister of sweden - which along with the netherlands , france , the uk , germany and austria - signed the letter in december , said wednesday he expects to be able to drum up more support against tuesday 's european commission 's proposals to increase the budget .
he also indicated that support might come from new member states , which have most to benefit from an increased budget .
in an exclusive interview with the euobserver , ringholm said : " i have talked to some of the new countries and i am happy with the situation .
i think it will be possible to have more support for the one percent initiative . "
the new countries " also are in a situation where they have a lot of domestic expenditure , and , although they are preparing to receive a lot of support from the eu , at the same time , they will also be interested in giving as little as possible in terms of fees to the eu " , added the minister .
one day earlier , commission president romano prodi rejected calls for budgetary prudence , outlining a budget that runs to just over € 900 billion over seven years .
one of his main arguments to justify the expanded budget is that the eu needs more money to cope with enlargement .

bosse ringholm , finance minister of sweden - which along with the netherlands , france , the uk , germany and austria - signed the letter in december , said wednesday he expects to be able to drum up more support against tuesday 's european commission 's proposals to increase the budget .
he also indicated that support might come from new member states , which have most to benefit from an increased budget .
in an exclusive interview with the euobserver , ringholm said : " i have talked to some of the new countries and i am happy with the situation .
i think it will be possible to have more support for the one percent initiative . "
the new countries " also are in a situation where they have a lot of domestic expenditure , and , although they are preparing to receive a lot of support from the eu , at the same time , they will also be interested in giving as little as possible in terms of fees to the eu " , added the minister .
one day earlier , commission president romano prodi rejected calls for budgetary prudence , outlining a budget that runs to just over € 900 billion over seven years .
one of his main arguments to justify the expanded budget is that the eu needs more money to cope with enlargement .

he added that the state could help firms who are planning to set up operations in eastern germany . more briefs 11.02.2004 -pipe- deutsche bank under investigation in parmalat case 10.02.2004 -pipe- spd calls for changes in schröder 's reform plans 10.02.2004 -pipe- norwegian cruise aids insolvent lloyd werft 09.02.2004 -pipe- europe ’ s biggest education fair opens in cologne 09.02.2004 -pipe- iraq calls for more german investment 09.02.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler ceo schrempp to testify for the second time 09.02.2004 -pipe- gap to sell german outlets to h & m. 06.02.2004 -pipe- german industrial production rises radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday approved a bill regulating the cultivation of genetically modified organisms .
the bill would make it legal for german farmers and supermarkets to sell gmo goods . the bill passed by germany 's ministers aims to codify european union legislation and guidelines for the cultivation and export of genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- into national law . several days ago , eu consumer protection commissioner david byrne criticized the german government for dragging its feet on regulating the export and import of gm foodstuffs out of fears that the products could swamp the market .
but with a new set of regulations in place , eu member states no longer have the right to exclude gmos from their territory , neither from cultivation nor from supermarket shelves . on wednesday , german agriculture minister renate künast conceded that her ministry could no longer prevent the cultivation of gm crops in germany .
but she pledged that her office would closely monitor crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast bei der eröffnung der fruit logistica " should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighboring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits , " künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" such lawsuits may be initiated if , for instance , a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . ” critics : gmos dangerous but opponents of the use of gmos are not convinced .
they claim that not enough scientific evidence is available to gauge the impact of what they call gm-contaminated foodstuffs on humans .
" genetically modified crops in general are dangerous for human health and also for the environment because what the g.e. -lrb- genetic engineering -rrb- industry is doing is putting new genes into new organisms , like taking a growth gene from a fish and putting it in a tomato , " said ulrike brendel of greenpeace germany .
" and of course nobody can predict what effects such a crude effort is having on human food and the environment . "
industry leaders claim that if the eu does not jump onto the gmo cultivation bandwagon , the continent may be left behind , then the continent will be left behind and put at a technological disadvantage over other countries who have deployed the cutting-edge agricultural methods .
but that may be a little off the mark , since few countries have adopted gmo foodstuffs despite a decade of attempts by american companies to promote genetically engineered agricultural technologies .
around 70 percent of land devoted to genetically engineered crops is in the united states , with almost all of the rest in argentina and canada . most other countries have been put off by the potential risks .
safeguards for conventional farmers the new german bill doesn ’ t specify what steps gmo farmers here will have to do to protect neighboring areas from being effected by their crops .
but in the event of contamination , the bill would allow for lawsuits to be filed and heard swiftly .
" should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighbouring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , " künast said , " the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits .
such lawsuits may be initiated , if for instance a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . "
künast also pointed out that it will be largely up to consumers to decide whether gmo foodstuffs become a major success in germany .
mandatory labeling within the european union informs consumers whether a product contains gmos and thus gives them the freedom to decide what they want to place on their dinner tables .
the bill must still be approved in a vote by germany 's parliament , the bundestag . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain : the promised land for gm corn spain is home to the greatest amount of genetically modified food production in europe .

dw-tv and the international film festival invited three young female documentary film makers to berlin to participate in workshops with accomplished colleagues . it took six long weeks of wrestling with the afghan authorities to get visas and exit permits for the three film makers .
gul makai ranjbar , halima hussiani and shakeba adill had a hard time getting to germany and the berlinale talent campus . although they had the support of international television broadcaster dw-tv and the german foreign ministry , it became increasingly doubtful whether they would be able to make the journey at all .
to cap it all off , the weather almost put an end to their plans .
the bundeswehr plane that was to bring the three young women safely to germany had to leave a day earlier than planned . from the airport in berlin , gul makai , halima and shakeba had to go straight to the " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " event at the haus der kulturen der welt the house of world cultures , which took place last sunday . after finally arriving , they told the young audience at the talent campus about their work and lives in one of the poorest and most crisis-ridden countries in the world .
they also presented excerpts from two of their films . dressed in jeans , sweaters and leather jackets , only their heads covered with the traditional hijab or headscarf , the women sat on the podium while talking about their work to iranian writer , documentary film maker and afghanistan expert , siba shakib , who hosted the discussion and acted as their interpreter . siba shakib presented the aïna media center in her introduction .
independent from the government , aïna is an afghan-french project that has been running for two years and has built up a network of independent journalists and media in afghanistan .
gul makai , halima and shakeba were trained through aïna and are now , with the aid of the organisation , producing their own films . " afghanistan unveiled " gul makai , who is 22-years-old , said that she had never known a life without war .
her father and brothers are dead , and even as a young girl she had to work to feed the family , despite having an injured leg . hard as this life may seem , it 's all too common in afghanistan .
apart from depicting the years of war against the russians , the three film makers concentrated on the reign of terror carried out by the radical islamic taliban .
the six years of their dictatorship were known to have been especially cruel for afghanistan 's female population . the film makers travelled to the afghan countryside to make their documentary film " afghanistan unveiled " .
it was probably the first time that women had travelled into the rural provinces alone .
they talked to women about their life and their experiences under the taliban .
whether they were female nomads with machine guns in their tents , or cave dwellers in the bamian valley , where the taliban destroyed the giant statues of buddha , their stories are very similar .
they deal with murder , rape and destruction , with unimaginable violence and contempt for the people , especially the women . the young film makers found filming an intense and disturbing experience .
during their courageous work , they learned much about their own country and its inhabitants .
afghanistan is a country full of cultural variety , they saidl . the desolate countryside and harsh climate make basic living conditions very difficult for its people . critiquing the new afghanistan another important subject is the period since the end of the taliban regime .
life in afghanistan is still far from any kind of normality .
a critical view of the situation is presented in the women 's second film , " shadows " , the sequel to " afghanistan unveiled " .
while kabul university prefers to enroll students with money and the right contacts , in the provinces , women and girls are still being abducted and raped .
there is a considerable amount of work left before there is real freedom of expression and the press . all the same , gul makai , halima and shakeba say that there have been great improvements in the direction of freedom .
what people in afghanistan need most for social change after such a long period of destructive chaos is time .
the presence of isaf , the international security assistance force , and the americans is necessary at the moment to ensure relative calm in the country .
in the long term , the afghans would like to develop their future identity free from external influences . gul makai , halima and shakeba are sure that their informative films will contribute to bringing about change in afghanistan .
the strength and intelligence , the involvement and self-confidence of these three young women provides hope for the future of their country . at the end of the discussion , günter knabe , deutsche welle 's afghanistan expert , spoke about " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " as a representative of the international broadcaster and organiser of the event .
he introduced the audience to dw-tv 's afghan program which broadcasts daily in dari and pashtu , and the donation campaign : " 100 classrooms for afghanistan " which was sponsored by the aid organisation cap anamur and deutsche welle .

several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .
experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed . many germans were shocked last week when they saw video footage of a group of students who physically abused one of their class mates .
up to 10 students at a vocational school in hildesheim in northern germany were allegedly involved in beating and humiliating a 17-year-old , kicking him , forcing him to brush his teeth with a wire brush and smearing motor oil on his genitalia .
the abuse apparently continued for months and took place during school hours in a storage room while the teacher remained in the classroom next door . five of the alleged abusers have been jailed so far and prosecutors are investigating the teacher 's apparent failure to supervise his class . on monday , a second case of abuse at another vocational school in nearby hannover made the news .
two 16-year-old students , a boy and a girl , were allegedly abused by five classmates .
the boy was repeatedly beaten with a rubber hammer in a changing room ; the girl was reportedly sexually abused . in the last week , several more cases have come into the open .
in bavaria , a 13-year-old boy was allegedly beaten unconscious by several students at a bus stop in the town of coburg .
in a town near munich , three students allegedly filmed themselves beating a 14-year-old over several weeks .
in the southwestern german state of rhineland-palatinate , a 16-year-old student was jailed for allegedly beating a schoolmate . early intervention needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-hermann sölter , center , in front of his school in hildesheim .
the case in hildesheim has created the most uproar , causing officials to call for the installation of video cameras to prevent further incidents .
" it 's one of the options we 're looking at , " hans-herrman sölter -lrb- photo -rrb- , the school 's principal , told reporters . but experts said video cameras wo n't help to prevent similar incidents in the future .
" cameras can be destroyed or covered up , " angela ittel , who researches teenage behavior at berlin 's free university , told dw-world .
schools instead need to create a sense of community and involve students in the decision-making process . " you have to reach out to the students and that 's not really happening right now , " ittel said , adding that in general , school violence is not on the rise in germany . teachers also have to make sure they deal with problems early on , said mechthild schäfer , an expert on teenage bullying at ludwig-maximilians-university in munich .
she added that teachers should also enforce " basic rules of democracy " in their classrooms and prevent a culture in which swearing and abuse is accepted . in order to prepare teachers better for their jobs , they should also receive pedagogic training during their university education , schäfer said .
so far , prospective secondary school teachers are almost exclusively trained in the subject areas they plan to teach , but don ’ t get much guidance on how to interact with students . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de student killed in school shooting spree a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine .

several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .
experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed . many germans were shocked last week when they saw video footage of a group of students who physically abused one of their class mates .
up to 10 students at a vocational school in hildesheim in northern germany were allegedly involved in beating and humiliating a 17-year-old , kicking him , forcing him to brush his teeth with a wire brush and smearing motor oil on his genitalia .
the abuse apparently continued for months and took place during school hours in a storage room while the teacher remained in the classroom next door . five of the alleged abusers have been jailed so far and prosecutors are investigating the teacher 's apparent failure to supervise his class . on monday , a second case of abuse at another vocational school in nearby hannover made the news .
two 16-year-old students , a boy and a girl , were allegedly abused by five classmates .
the boy was repeatedly beaten with a rubber hammer in a changing room ; the girl was reportedly sexually abused . in the last week , several more cases have come into the open .
in bavaria , a 13-year-old boy was allegedly beaten unconscious by several students at a bus stop in the town of coburg .
in a town near munich , three students allegedly filmed themselves beating a 14-year-old over several weeks .
in the southwestern german state of rhineland-palatinate , a 16-year-old student was jailed for allegedly beating a schoolmate . early intervention needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-hermann sölter , center , in front of his school in hildesheim .
the case in hildesheim has created the most uproar , causing officials to call for the installation of video cameras to prevent further incidents .
" it 's one of the options we 're looking at , " hans-herrman sölter -lrb- photo -rrb- , the school 's principal , told reporters . but experts said video cameras wo n't help to prevent similar incidents in the future .
" cameras can be destroyed or covered up , " angela ittel , who researches teenage behavior at berlin 's free university , told dw-world .
schools instead need to create a sense of community and involve students in the decision-making process . " you have to reach out to the students and that 's not really happening right now , " ittel said , adding that in general , school violence is not on the rise in germany . teachers also have to make sure they deal with problems early on , said mechthild schäfer , an expert on teenage bullying at ludwig-maximilians-university in munich .
she added that teachers should also enforce " basic rules of democracy " in their classrooms and prevent a culture in which swearing and abuse is accepted . in order to prepare teachers better for their jobs , they should also receive pedagogic training during their university education , schäfer said .
so far , prospective secondary school teachers are almost exclusively trained in the subject areas they plan to teach , but don ’ t get much guidance on how to interact with students . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de student killed in school shooting spree a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine .

dw-tv and the international film festival invited three young female documentary film makers to berlin to participate in workshops with accomplished colleagues . it took six long weeks of wrestling with the afghan authorities to get visas and exit permits for the three film makers .
gul makai ranjbar , halima hussiani and shakeba adill had a hard time getting to germany and the berlinale talent campus . although they had the support of international television broadcaster dw-tv and the german foreign ministry , it became increasingly doubtful whether they would be able to make the journey at all .
to cap it all off , the weather almost put an end to their plans .
the bundeswehr plane that was to bring the three young women safely to germany had to leave a day earlier than planned . from the airport in berlin , gul makai , halima and shakeba had to go straight to the " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " event at the haus der kulturen der welt the house of world cultures , which took place last sunday . after finally arriving , they told the young audience at the talent campus about their work and lives in one of the poorest and most crisis-ridden countries in the world .
they also presented excerpts from two of their films . dressed in jeans , sweaters and leather jackets , only their heads covered with the traditional hijab or headscarf , the women sat on the podium while talking about their work to iranian writer , documentary film maker and afghanistan expert , siba shakib , who hosted the discussion and acted as their interpreter . siba shakib presented the aïna media center in her introduction .
independent from the government , aïna is an afghan-french project that has been running for two years and has built up a network of independent journalists and media in afghanistan .
gul makai , halima and shakeba were trained through aïna and are now , with the aid of the organisation , producing their own films . " afghanistan unveiled " gul makai , who is 22-years-old , said that she had never known a life without war .
her father and brothers are dead , and even as a young girl she had to work to feed the family , despite having an injured leg . hard as this life may seem , it 's all too common in afghanistan .
apart from depicting the years of war against the russians , the three film makers concentrated on the reign of terror carried out by the radical islamic taliban .
the six years of their dictatorship were known to have been especially cruel for afghanistan 's female population . the film makers travelled to the afghan countryside to make their documentary film " afghanistan unveiled " .
it was probably the first time that women had travelled into the rural provinces alone .
they talked to women about their life and their experiences under the taliban .
whether they were female nomads with machine guns in their tents , or cave dwellers in the bamian valley , where the taliban destroyed the giant statues of buddha , their stories are very similar .
they deal with murder , rape and destruction , with unimaginable violence and contempt for the people , especially the women . the young film makers found filming an intense and disturbing experience .
during their courageous work , they learned much about their own country and its inhabitants .
afghanistan is a country full of cultural variety , they saidl . the desolate countryside and harsh climate make basic living conditions very difficult for its people . critiquing the new afghanistan another important subject is the period since the end of the taliban regime .
life in afghanistan is still far from any kind of normality .
a critical view of the situation is presented in the women 's second film , " shadows " , the sequel to " afghanistan unveiled " .
while kabul university prefers to enroll students with money and the right contacts , in the provinces , women and girls are still being abducted and raped .
there is a considerable amount of work left before there is real freedom of expression and the press . all the same , gul makai , halima and shakeba say that there have been great improvements in the direction of freedom .
what people in afghanistan need most for social change after such a long period of destructive chaos is time .
the presence of isaf , the international security assistance force , and the americans is necessary at the moment to ensure relative calm in the country .
in the long term , the afghans would like to develop their future identity free from external influences . gul makai , halima and shakeba are sure that their informative films will contribute to bringing about change in afghanistan .
the strength and intelligence , the involvement and self-confidence of these three young women provides hope for the future of their country . at the end of the discussion , günter knabe , deutsche welle 's afghanistan expert , spoke about " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " as a representative of the international broadcaster and organiser of the event .

south africa might be the special focus at this year 's berlin film festival , but the continent 's movie industry epicenter seems to lie further north : thousands of low-budget pictures are released in nigeria every year . when hollywood star charlize theron recently told reporters that it took just 28 days to shoot her latest film , " monster , " an appreciative murmur went through the room .

the german government is set to contribute to small eu military units proposed by france and britain to stabilize crisis zones .
should eu members approve , they could be operating by 2007 . french and british officials announced the plan on tuesday , saying they each intend to set up one unit , which would be made up of 1,500 soldiers .
they emphasized that the proposal would not conflict with nato 's planned response force of 21,000 troops or an earlier eu plan to create a military unit comprised of 60,000 soldiers . " the objective is to have a new tool for europeans which will not compete with others , " a french foreign ministry spokesman told reuters news agency .
" it allows the europeans to be present -lrb- in a crisis -rrb- . "
reuters also quoted a senior diplomat , who said germany would fund an additional unit , with hopes that italy , spain and poland would join in as well .
groups of smaller member states could form multinational units . in and out within 45 days the soldiers would serve as a stabilizing force in crisis regions until u.n. peacekeepers can be sent there .
groups should be ready for deployment within 15 days and serve a maximum of 30 days .
the teams would be similar to a french-led military unit that was sent to the democratic republic of congo last year .
operation " artemis " focused on keeping things under control and securing infrastructure until un troops arrived .
germany participated in this operation , albeit only with logistical support . should the eu approve the proposal , seven or eight units could be up and running by 2007 . france , britain and germany hope to get the green light from other member states by june .
the three countries ' leaders , french president jacques chirac , britain 's premier tony blair and german chancellor gerhard schröder , are expected to discuss the issue at a meeting in berlin on feb .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday approved a bill regulating the cultivation of genetically modified organisms .
the bill would make it legal for german farmers and supermarkets to sell gmo goods . the bill passed by germany 's ministers aims to codify european union legislation and guidelines for the cultivation and export of genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- into national law . several days ago , eu consumer protection commissioner david byrne criticized the german government for dragging its feet on regulating the export and import of gm foodstuffs out of fears that the products could swamp the market .
but with a new set of regulations in place , eu member states no longer have the right to exclude gmos from their territory , neither from cultivation nor from supermarket shelves . on wednesday , german agriculture minister renate künast conceded that her ministry could no longer prevent the cultivation of gm crops in germany .
but she pledged that her office would closely monitor crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast bei der eröffnung der fruit logistica " should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighboring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits , " künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" such lawsuits may be initiated if , for instance , a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . ” critics : gmos dangerous but opponents of the use of gmos are not convinced .
they claim that not enough scientific evidence is available to gauge the impact of what they call gm-contaminated foodstuffs on humans .
" genetically modified crops in general are dangerous for human health and also for the environment because what the g.e. -lrb- genetic engineering -rrb- industry is doing is putting new genes into new organisms , like taking a growth gene from a fish and putting it in a tomato , " said ulrike brendel of greenpeace germany .
" and of course nobody can predict what effects such a crude effort is having on human food and the environment . "
industry leaders claim that if the eu does not jump onto the gmo cultivation bandwagon , the continent may be left behind , then the continent will be left behind and put at a technological disadvantage over other countries who have deployed the cutting-edge agricultural methods .
but that may be a little off the mark , since few countries have adopted gmo foodstuffs despite a decade of attempts by american companies to promote genetically engineered agricultural technologies .
around 70 percent of land devoted to genetically engineered crops is in the united states , with almost all of the rest in argentina and canada . most other countries have been put off by the potential risks .
safeguards for conventional farmers the new german bill doesn ’ t specify what steps gmo farmers here will have to do to protect neighboring areas from being effected by their crops .
but in the event of contamination , the bill would allow for lawsuits to be filed and heard swiftly .

künast also pointed out that it will be largely up to consumers to decide whether gmo foodstuffs become a major success in germany .
mandatory labeling within the european union informs consumers whether a product contains gmos and thus gives them the freedom to decide what they want to place on their dinner tables .
the bill must still be approved in a vote by germany 's parliament , the bundestag . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain : the promised land for gm corn spain is home to the greatest amount of genetically modified food production in europe .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday approved a bill regulating the cultivation of genetically modified organisms .
the bill would make it legal for german farmers and supermarkets to sell gmo goods . the bill passed by germany 's ministers aims to codify european union legislation and guidelines for the cultivation and export of genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- into national law . several days ago , eu consumer protection commissioner david byrne criticized the german government for dragging its feet on regulating the export and import of gm foodstuffs out of fears that the products could swamp the market .
but with a new set of regulations in place , eu member states no longer have the right to exclude gmos from their territory , neither from cultivation nor from supermarket shelves . on wednesday , german agriculture minister renate künast conceded that her ministry could no longer prevent the cultivation of gm crops in germany .
but she pledged that her office would closely monitor crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast bei der eröffnung der fruit logistica " should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighboring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits , " künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" such lawsuits may be initiated if , for instance , a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . ” critics : gmos dangerous but opponents of the use of gmos are not convinced .
they claim that not enough scientific evidence is available to gauge the impact of what they call gm-contaminated foodstuffs on humans .
" genetically modified crops in general are dangerous for human health and also for the environment because what the g.e. -lrb- genetic engineering -rrb- industry is doing is putting new genes into new organisms , like taking a growth gene from a fish and putting it in a tomato , " said ulrike brendel of greenpeace germany .
" and of course nobody can predict what effects such a crude effort is having on human food and the environment . "
industry leaders claim that if the eu does not jump onto the gmo cultivation bandwagon , the continent may be left behind , then the continent will be left behind and put at a technological disadvantage over other countries who have deployed the cutting-edge agricultural methods .
but that may be a little off the mark , since few countries have adopted gmo foodstuffs despite a decade of attempts by american companies to promote genetically engineered agricultural technologies .
around 70 percent of land devoted to genetically engineered crops is in the united states , with almost all of the rest in argentina and canada . most other countries have been put off by the potential risks .
safeguards for conventional farmers the new german bill doesn ’ t specify what steps gmo farmers here will have to do to protect neighboring areas from being effected by their crops .
but in the event of contamination , the bill would allow for lawsuits to be filed and heard swiftly .
" should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighbouring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , " künast said , " the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits .
such lawsuits may be initiated , if for instance a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . "
künast also pointed out that it will be largely up to consumers to decide whether gmo foodstuffs become a major success in germany .
mandatory labeling within the european union informs consumers whether a product contains gmos and thus gives them the freedom to decide what they want to place on their dinner tables .
the bill must still be approved in a vote by germany 's parliament , the bundestag . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain : the promised land for gm corn spain is home to the greatest amount of genetically modified food production in europe .

the german government is set to contribute to small eu military units proposed by france and britain to stabilize crisis zones .
should eu members approve , they could be operating by 2007 . french and british officials announced the plan on tuesday , saying they each intend to set up one unit , which would be made up of 1,500 soldiers .
they emphasized that the proposal would not conflict with nato 's planned response force of 21,000 troops or an earlier eu plan to create a military unit comprised of 60,000 soldiers . " the objective is to have a new tool for europeans which will not compete with others , " a french foreign ministry spokesman told reuters news agency .
" it allows the europeans to be present -lrb- in a crisis -rrb- . "
reuters also quoted a senior diplomat , who said germany would fund an additional unit , with hopes that italy , spain and poland would join in as well .
groups of smaller member states could form multinational units . in and out within 45 days the soldiers would serve as a stabilizing force in crisis regions until u.n. peacekeepers can be sent there .
groups should be ready for deployment within 15 days and serve a maximum of 30 days .
the teams would be similar to a french-led military unit that was sent to the democratic republic of congo last year .
operation " artemis " focused on keeping things under control and securing infrastructure until un troops arrived .
germany participated in this operation , albeit only with logistical support . should the eu approve the proposal , seven or eight units could be up and running by 2007 . france , britain and germany hope to get the green light from other member states by june .
the three countries ' leaders , french president jacques chirac , britain 's premier tony blair and german chancellor gerhard schröder , are expected to discuss the issue at a meeting in berlin on feb .

several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .
experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed . many germans were shocked last week when they saw video footage of a group of students who physically abused one of their class mates .
up to 10 students at a vocational school in hildesheim in northern germany were allegedly involved in beating and humiliating a 17-year-old , kicking him , forcing him to brush his teeth with a wire brush and smearing motor oil on his genitalia .
the abuse apparently continued for months and took place during school hours in a storage room while the teacher remained in the classroom next door . five of the alleged abusers have been jailed so far and prosecutors are investigating the teacher 's apparent failure to supervise his class . on monday , a second case of abuse at another vocational school in nearby hannover made the news .
two 16-year-old students , a boy and a girl , were allegedly abused by five classmates .
the boy was repeatedly beaten with a rubber hammer in a changing room ; the girl was reportedly sexually abused . in the last week , several more cases have come into the open .

several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .
experts say this wo n't help , adding that more trust between teachers and students is needed . many germans were shocked last week when they saw video footage of a group of students who physically abused one of their class mates .
up to 10 students at a vocational school in hildesheim in northern germany were allegedly involved in beating and humiliating a 17-year-old , kicking him , forcing him to brush his teeth with a wire brush and smearing motor oil on his genitalia .
the abuse apparently continued for months and took place during school hours in a storage room while the teacher remained in the classroom next door . five of the alleged abusers have been jailed so far and prosecutors are investigating the teacher 's apparent failure to supervise his class . on monday , a second case of abuse at another vocational school in nearby hannover made the news .
two 16-year-old students , a boy and a girl , were allegedly abused by five classmates .
the boy was repeatedly beaten with a rubber hammer in a changing room ; the girl was reportedly sexually abused . in the last week , several more cases have come into the open .

south africa might be the special focus at this year 's berlin film festival , but the continent 's movie industry epicenter seems to lie further north : thousands of low-budget pictures are released in nigeria every year . when hollywood star charlize theron recently told reporters that it took just 28 days to shoot her latest film , " monster , " an appreciative murmur went through the room .
any nigerian filmmakers present must have chuckled a little - shooting a movie in five days sounds about right to them . " i 've made 25 films over the last five years , " charles novia , a nigerian director and producer , told his audience at a panel discussion on " nollywood , " nigeria 's booming movie industry in berlin this week .
equipped with a video camera , a script and often as little as € 5,000 , novia and his colleagues churn out up to 50 feature-length films every week . " sometimes people sell their cars to start a film , " said peace fiberesima , another producer and director .
others borrow money from relatives or friends or call colleagues who owe them a favor to help out for free , she added . video 's the way to go the video boom came after nigeria 's movie theaters started losing customers during an economic downturn in the 1980s .
while many of the theaters have now been turned into churches , about 200,000 people earn their money through working for the movies .

nollywood booms without government funding .
in fact , nigeria 's movie industry , which is centered in the country 's former capital , lagos -lrb- photo -rrb- , pays the government about € 3.5 million per year to censor its products , according to fiberesima . " i do n't think anyone from the west can understand what it 's like to build an industry without any help from the state , " said brenda goldblatt , a south african filmmaker who recently made a documentary on nollywood .
" these films are companions in life for people .

renting american-made films in the video stores costs half as much as nollywood productions , but the imports still collect dust on the shelves . " most nigerians don ’ t want to watch ' terminator 3 , " ' fiberesima said .

south africa might be the special focus at this year 's berlin film festival , but the continent 's movie industry epicenter seems to lie further north : thousands of low-budget pictures are released in nigeria every year . when hollywood star charlize theron recently told reporters that it took just 28 days to shoot her latest film , " monster , " an appreciative murmur went through the room .
any nigerian filmmakers present must have chuckled a little - shooting a movie in five days sounds about right to them . " i 've made 25 films over the last five years , " charles novia , a nigerian director and producer , told his audience at a panel discussion on " nollywood , " nigeria 's booming movie industry in berlin this week .
equipped with a video camera , a script and often as little as € 5,000 , novia and his colleagues churn out up to 50 feature-length films every week . " sometimes people sell their cars to start a film , " said peace fiberesima , another producer and director .
others borrow money from relatives or friends or call colleagues who owe them a favor to help out for free , she added . video 's the way to go the video boom came after nigeria 's movie theaters started losing customers during an economic downturn in the 1980s .
while many of the theaters have now been turned into churches , about 200,000 people earn their money through working for the movies .
estimates of the industry 's revenue range from € 95 million -lrb- $ 121 million -rrb- to € 680 million . " i did n't believe what they were telling me , " said dorothee wenner , who works for the berlinale 's international forum and organized the two-day event at berlin 's hebbel am ufer theater .
" in the end , i came back -lrb- to germany -rrb- and found out that i was n't the only one who did n't have a clue . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedestrians push their way through a traffic jam in downtown lagos .

the german government is set to contribute to small eu military units proposed by france and britain to stabilize crisis zones .
should eu members approve , they could be operating by 2007 . french and british officials announced the plan on tuesday , saying they each intend to set up one unit , which would be made up of 1,500 soldiers .
they emphasized that the proposal would not conflict with nato 's planned response force of 21,000 troops or an earlier eu plan to create a military unit comprised of 60,000 soldiers . " the objective is to have a new tool for europeans which will not compete with others , " a french foreign ministry spokesman told reuters news agency .
" it allows the europeans to be present -lrb- in a crisis -rrb- . "
reuters also quoted a senior diplomat , who said germany would fund an additional unit , with hopes that italy , spain and poland would join in as well .
groups of smaller member states could form multinational units . in and out within 45 days the soldiers would serve as a stabilizing force in crisis regions until u.n. peacekeepers can be sent there .
groups should be ready for deployment within 15 days and serve a maximum of 30 days .
the teams would be similar to a french-led military unit that was sent to the democratic republic of congo last year .
operation " artemis " focused on keeping things under control and securing infrastructure until un troops arrived .
germany participated in this operation , albeit only with logistical support . should the eu approve the proposal , seven or eight units could be up and running by 2007 . france , britain and germany hope to get the green light from other member states by june .
the three countries ' leaders , french president jacques chirac , britain 's premier tony blair and german chancellor gerhard schröder , are expected to discuss the issue at a meeting in berlin on feb .

dw-tv and the international film festival invited three young female documentary film makers to berlin to participate in workshops with accomplished colleagues . it took six long weeks of wrestling with the afghan authorities to get visas and exit permits for the three film makers .
gul makai ranjbar , halima hussiani and shakeba adill had a hard time getting to germany and the berlinale talent campus . although they had the support of international television broadcaster dw-tv and the german foreign ministry , it became increasingly doubtful whether they would be able to make the journey at all .
to cap it all off , the weather almost put an end to their plans .
the bundeswehr plane that was to bring the three young women safely to germany had to leave a day earlier than planned . from the airport in berlin , gul makai , halima and shakeba had to go straight to the " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " event at the haus der kulturen der welt the house of world cultures , which took place last sunday . after finally arriving , they told the young audience at the talent campus about their work and lives in one of the poorest and most crisis-ridden countries in the world .
they also presented excerpts from two of their films . dressed in jeans , sweaters and leather jackets , only their heads covered with the traditional hijab or headscarf , the women sat on the podium while talking about their work to iranian writer , documentary film maker and afghanistan expert , siba shakib , who hosted the discussion and acted as their interpreter . siba shakib presented the aïna media center in her introduction .
independent from the government , aïna is an afghan-french project that has been running for two years and has built up a network of independent journalists and media in afghanistan .
gul makai , halima and shakeba were trained through aïna and are now , with the aid of the organisation , producing their own films . " afghanistan unveiled " gul makai , who is 22-years-old , said that she had never known a life without war .
her father and brothers are dead , and even as a young girl she had to work to feed the family , despite having an injured leg . hard as this life may seem , it 's all too common in afghanistan .
apart from depicting the years of war against the russians , the three film makers concentrated on the reign of terror carried out by the radical islamic taliban .
the six years of their dictatorship were known to have been especially cruel for afghanistan 's female population . the film makers travelled to the afghan countryside to make their documentary film " afghanistan unveiled " .
it was probably the first time that women had travelled into the rural provinces alone .
they talked to women about their life and their experiences under the taliban .
whether they were female nomads with machine guns in their tents , or cave dwellers in the bamian valley , where the taliban destroyed the giant statues of buddha , their stories are very similar .
they deal with murder , rape and destruction , with unimaginable violence and contempt for the people , especially the women . the young film makers found filming an intense and disturbing experience .
during their courageous work , they learned much about their own country and its inhabitants .
afghanistan is a country full of cultural variety , they saidl . the desolate countryside and harsh climate make basic living conditions very difficult for its people . critiquing the new afghanistan another important subject is the period since the end of the taliban regime .
life in afghanistan is still far from any kind of normality .
a critical view of the situation is presented in the women 's second film , " shadows " , the sequel to " afghanistan unveiled " .
while kabul university prefers to enroll students with money and the right contacts , in the provinces , women and girls are still being abducted and raped .
there is a considerable amount of work left before there is real freedom of expression and the press . all the same , gul makai , halima and shakeba say that there have been great improvements in the direction of freedom .
what people in afghanistan need most for social change after such a long period of destructive chaos is time .
the presence of isaf , the international security assistance force , and the americans is necessary at the moment to ensure relative calm in the country .
in the long term , the afghans would like to develop their future identity free from external influences . gul makai , halima and shakeba are sure that their informative films will contribute to bringing about change in afghanistan .
the strength and intelligence , the involvement and self-confidence of these three young women provides hope for the future of their country . at the end of the discussion , günter knabe , deutsche welle 's afghanistan expert , spoke about " afghanistan : film , freedom , future " as a representative of the international broadcaster and organiser of the event .
he introduced the audience to dw-tv 's afghan program which broadcasts daily in dari and pashtu , and the donation campaign : " 100 classrooms for afghanistan " which was sponsored by the aid organisation cap anamur and deutsche welle .

german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday approved a bill regulating the cultivation of genetically modified organisms .
the bill would make it legal for german farmers and supermarkets to sell gmo goods . the bill passed by germany 's ministers aims to codify european union legislation and guidelines for the cultivation and export of genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmo -rrb- into national law . several days ago , eu consumer protection commissioner david byrne criticized the german government for dragging its feet on regulating the export and import of gm foodstuffs out of fears that the products could swamp the market .
but with a new set of regulations in place , eu member states no longer have the right to exclude gmos from their territory , neither from cultivation nor from supermarket shelves . on wednesday , german agriculture minister renate künast conceded that her ministry could no longer prevent the cultivation of gm crops in germany .
but she pledged that her office would closely monitor crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast bei der eröffnung der fruit logistica " should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighboring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits , " künast -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" such lawsuits may be initiated if , for instance , a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . ” critics : gmos dangerous but opponents of the use of gmos are not convinced .
they claim that not enough scientific evidence is available to gauge the impact of what they call gm-contaminated foodstuffs on humans .
" genetically modified crops in general are dangerous for human health and also for the environment because what the g.e. -lrb- genetic engineering -rrb- industry is doing is putting new genes into new organisms , like taking a growth gene from a fish and putting it in a tomato , " said ulrike brendel of greenpeace germany .
" and of course nobody can predict what effects such a crude effort is having on human food and the environment . "
industry leaders claim that if the eu does not jump onto the gmo cultivation bandwagon , the continent may be left behind , then the continent will be left behind and put at a technological disadvantage over other countries who have deployed the cutting-edge agricultural methods .
but that may be a little off the mark , since few countries have adopted gmo foodstuffs despite a decade of attempts by american companies to promote genetically engineered agricultural technologies .
around 70 percent of land devoted to genetically engineered crops is in the united states , with almost all of the rest in argentina and canada . most other countries have been put off by the potential risks .
safeguards for conventional farmers the new german bill doesn ’ t specify what steps gmo farmers here will have to do to protect neighboring areas from being effected by their crops .
but in the event of contamination , the bill would allow for lawsuits to be filed and heard swiftly .
" should it turn out in the process of gmo cultivation that neighbouring conventional or organic farming units are affected in a negative way , " künast said , " the bill provides the instruments for speedy lawsuits .
such lawsuits may be initiated , if for instance a conventional farmer can no longer sell his produce under a specific high-quality or ecological label because his crops have been contaminated by gm strains . "
künast also pointed out that it will be largely up to consumers to decide whether gmo foodstuffs become a major success in germany .
mandatory labeling within the european union informs consumers whether a product contains gmos and thus gives them the freedom to decide what they want to place on their dinner tables .
the bill must still be approved in a vote by germany 's parliament , the bundestag . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain : the promised land for gm corn spain is home to the greatest amount of genetically modified food production in europe .

and the problem is not unique to adults , obesity in children aged two to four has now reached 9 % .
today 's figures are from a report called ' storing up the problems ' which was written jointly by the royal college of physicians , the faculty of public health and the royal college of paediatrics and child health .
we talked to one of the report 's authors professor peter kopelman .
he said : " we can not afford obesity and need immediate action . "
obesity is a serious condition .
we are focussing on prevention .
if prediction is right , half of us will be obese by 2020 .
we ca n't afford this as a nation .
we 're saying we want a minister in charge who will deliver joined up policies across different departments .

we also spoke to martin patterson from the food and drink federation and danuta krzyzanowska who is in the middle of a weight loss programme .
they both agreed something needed to be done .
they talked about the support that is now available for obese people , and they also discussed the creation of an independant body .

concerted action today 's report suggests that millions are at risk from health problems related to their weight and calls for ' immediate and concerted action ' , and a national strategy .
its authors want everyone to take responsibility whether at individual , local , community or national level .
more should also be done to about the cultural and social factors that play a part in obesity .
obesity in the uk in 2002 , 70 % of men and 63 % of women were obese or overweight obesity in 2-4 year olds almost doubled from 5 % to 9 % between 1989 and 1998 in 6-15 year olds trebled from 5 % to 16 % between 1990 and 2001 outlook the researchers found that the trend towards being obese was continuing to rise and if it carried on at the present rate then one third of adults would be obese by 2020 .
the report hopes to drive home the message that being overweight restricts body activity , damages health and shortens life .
heart disease , joint problems and a risk from stroke are just some of the problems which being overweight can cause .
the most commonest cause of diabetes - type 2 - is also linked to obesity .
but is it right for national organisations , to tell us what we can and ca n't do ?
many see this report as the an example of the nanny state trying to tell us how to live our lives .
but the report 's authors claim obesity leads to a drain on nhs resources and finances - the national audit office estimates that this cost amounts to £ 0.5 billion for the nhs and £ 2bn to the rest of the wider economy .
tell us what you think - is it right for the government to interfere and tell us whether we 're overweight ?

george raby and pauline casson first met in the navy in september 1970 when he was a 22-year-old sailor and she was an 18-year-old wren .
ms casson accepted her boyfriend 's marriage proposal , although the relationship failed when she was posted to a base more than 200 miles away .
but the couple have rekindled their romance after getting back in touch with each other through the website friends reunited , and are to marry later in the year .
mr raby , who is from powick , worcestershire , told bbc midlands today about the moment the internet brought them together again .
she came out through the door and she looked totally different to what i remembered george raby " i got this message saying : " is that you raby ?
my heart just went over ; i thought : ' great ' .
" i replied straight away because i was actually on the net when it came through . "
but once again geography was against them , as mr raby lived in worcestershire and his former sweetheart in aberdeen .
the couple did not let the distance between them deter them a second time though , and before long they arranged to meet at birmingham airport .
ms casson said : " it was n't until the doors opened at the airport and i thought : ' what am i going to find ? '

george raby and pauline casson first met in the navy in september 1970 when he was a 22-year-old sailor and she was an 18-year-old wren .
ms casson accepted her boyfriend 's marriage proposal , although the relationship failed when she was posted to a base more than 200 miles away .
but the couple have rekindled their romance after getting back in touch with each other through the website friends reunited , and are to marry later in the year .
mr raby , who is from powick , worcestershire , told bbc midlands today about the moment the internet brought them together again . "
she came out through the door and she looked totally different to what i remembered " george raby " i got this message saying : " is that you raby ?
my heart just went over ; i thought : ' great ' .
" i replied straight away because i was actually on the net when it came through . "
but once again geography was against them , as mr raby lived in worcestershire and his former sweetheart in aberdeen .
the couple did not let the distance between them deter them a second time though , and before long they arranged to meet at birmingham airport .
ms casson said : " it was n't until the doors opened at the airport and i thought : ' what am i going to find ? '
" i just looked sideways and he was there grinning , and that was it . "
mentally different mr raby said he was not expecting what he found .
" she came out through the door and she looked totally different to what i remembered .
" you just have this vision that exactly the same person 's going to walk through that door and it was n't .
" it was somebody who was physically different and emotionally and mentally different - what a wonderful person . "
the wedding is due to take place on 22 may at powick church .

the funding scheme is meant to provide a boost to europe 's poorest regions .
last week , economic development minister andrew davies wrote to councils telling them they would lose any allocated money that had not been spent on time , but rejected worries that councils will lose out in the process .
one welsh local authority , plaid cymru-controlled caerphilly council , is concerned about what is happening .
in a debate at the welsh assembly on tuesday , mr davies said local authorities had been under-spending their allocations , which was why he was clawing them back .
it is the latest controversy surrounding the huge objective one programme , which is intended to deliver £ 1.2bn of european aid to some of the poorest areas of south , west and north wales .
the objective one programme is intended to boost wealth creation but the latest figures show that average wealth in much of wales is actually going down .
match funding the scheme 's projects are match-funded , which means that , for every pound given by europe , a pound must also be supplied by other sources .
andrew davies says he is committed to the success of objective one caerphilly 's projects have relied on match funding from the lrf - the local regeneration fund .
last week , caerphilly say they received a letter from the assembly government which means they could lose £ 4m .
council cabinet member rob gough said it would affect some of his council 's plans to create more jobs .
he added : " in caerphilly last week , we had one empty unit on our 15 industrial estates .
" if you look around to get small units for small start-up companies , they are not there .
" we need to build units up to 5,000 or 7,000sq ft and this is going to affect that . "
we are very committed to making objective one a success economic development minister andrew davies caerphilly has drawn about £ 21m from objective one , which has helped create or safeguard about 4,500 jobs .
but alan garwood , who used to work at the ge works in bedwas , south wales , said he was concerned about the lack of well-paid jobs in the area .
he said : " so many jobs from this country are now going to other countries - call centres for example and all that kind of work .
" and i think that , if this continues , we 'll become a third world country like the -lrb- countries -rrb- they are going to . "
however , as employment in wales continues to rise , fewer of the new jobs are seen as well-paid .
if we are looking to see radical change in the welsh economy , i do n't think we should be expecting it in the first half of this decade stephen fothergill , sheffield hallam university on tuesday , mr davies said that , even though councils would lose money if it was not spent on time , extra cash was being made available to cover short-term difficulties .
he said : " having recognised that some local authorities like caerphilly may have short term problems , for an exceptional allowance i 've allowed £ 10m additional money to be put into the funds for next year .
" we are very committed to making objective one a success . "
mr davies added that figures on average welsh wealth will improve with time .
professor stephen fothergill of sheffield hallam university , an expert on european funds , agreed that objective one programmes take time to boost average earnings .
he said : " i think that the lesson from a place like merseyside is these things do n't happen overnight .

the objective one programme is intended to boost wealth creation but the latest figures show that average wealth in much of wales is actually going down .
match funding the scheme 's projects are match-funded , which means that , for every pound given by europe , a pound must also be supplied by other sources .
andrew davies says he is committed to the success of objective one caerphilly 's projects have relied on match funding from the lrf - the local regeneration fund .
last week , caerphilly say they received a letter from the assembly government which means they could lose £ 4m .
council cabinet member rob gough said it would affect some of his council 's plans to create more jobs .
he added : " in caerphilly last week , we had one empty unit on our 15 industrial estates .
" if you look around to get small units for small start-up companies , they are not there .
" we need to build units up to 5,000 or 7,000sq ft and this is going to affect that . "
we are very committed to making objective one a success economic development minister andrew davies caerphilly has drawn about £ 21m from objective one , which has helped create or safeguard about 4,500 jobs .
but alan garwood , who used to work at the ge works in bedwas , south wales , said he was concerned about the lack of well-paid jobs in the area .
he said : " so many jobs from this country are now going to other countries - call centres for example and all that kind of work .
" and i think that , if this continues , we 'll become a third world country like the -lrb- countries -rrb- they are going to . "
however , as employment in wales continues to rise , fewer of the new jobs are seen as well-paid .
if we are looking to see radical change in the welsh economy , i do n't think we should be expecting it in the first half of this decade stephen fothergill , sheffield hallam university on tuesday , mr davies said that , even though councils would lose money if it was not spent on time , extra cash was being made available to cover short-term difficulties .
he said : " having recognised that some local authorities like caerphilly may have short term problems , for an exceptional allowance i 've allowed £ 10m additional money to be put into the funds for next year .
" we are very committed to making objective one a success . "
mr davies added that figures on average welsh wealth will improve with time .
professor stephen fothergill of sheffield hallam university , an expert on european funds , agreed that objective one programmes take time to boost average earnings .
he said : " i think that the lesson from a place like merseyside is these things do n't happen overnight .

neath port talbot council , in south wales , is considering spending £ 1,500 on a scheme to provide safe slippers to elderly people , believing it could save much more by reducing injuries .
poorly-fitting footwear is among the biggest causes of accidents among elderly people .
last year , 14,000 people fell and broke their hips in the uk .
the nhs spends more than £ 1bn a year on treating fractures caused by falling .
when a similar scheme was tried in england , the number of people falling was reduced by 60 % .

" they have a good velcro fastener on the front so they wo n't slip off , you have to physically taken them off .

the idea is part of the authority 's strategy to improve life for older people .

lawyers for the monopoly watchdog said the move should be halted because it would hurt competition in the industry .
oracle , however , predicted its $ 9.4bn -lrb- £ 5bn ; 7.4bn euros -rrb- offer will be accepted by investors and regulators .
shares in peoplesoft , which has fought all of oracle 's advances , dropped about 2 % during extended trading in new york .

the department of justice is expected to give the government its final report by march 2 .
the bid also will need approval from anti-monopoly watchdogs in europe .
last week , oracle boosted its offer for peoplesoft ahead of a crucial shareholder vote scheduled for next month .
peoplesoft rejected the new deal , saying that even though the price was well above market value , it still undervalued the company .
oracle 's offer values peoplesoft at $ 26 a share .

peoplesoft shareholders , meanwhile , will be asked to vote on a new board of directors for the company at a meeting on 25 march .
oracle has put forward five new candidates in an attempt to gain control of the board .
peoplesoft 's resistance to the takeover attempt is supported by its staff , some of whom have set up a website promoting the benefits of keeping the firm independent .

the wave hub would link wave power machines with the national grid .
the south west regional development agency -lrb- swrda -rrb- is spending £ 500,000 on a study into whether the wave hub is viable , where it would be best located and the economic benefits of the project to the south west .
if the results are positive , the wave hub could be positioned about nine miles off the north cornwall coast in two years time .
this would put the south west on the map for wave and tidal energy dominic vincent , swrda the world 's first offshore tidal energy turbine was built into the seabed about a kilometre and a half -lrb- one mile -rrb- offshore from lynmouth in devon last year .
the wave hub will consist of an underwater cable to enable wave power companies to test how well groups of wave machines produce power before they move on to producing them on a commercial basis .
tim german , manager of the cornwall sustainable energy partnership , said : " we are starting to realise how we can capitalise on these big resources and to see if there is any way we can bring it onshore to help , not just cornwall , but the whole of the uk . "
dominic vincent , environment manager of the swrda , said : " we already know that the wave and tidal energy industry is very supportive of wave hub and if the results of this study are good , wave hub could be in the water by 2006 .
" this would put the south west on the map for wave and tidal energy . "

over 50 people were unable to attend the first meeting about ripple primary school , deal , as the venue was too small and could only hold 40 people .
the school only has 35 pupils but parents and governors have said the community would lose out if it shuts .
kent county council said the meeting on wednesday was to " make sure everyone interested could have their say " .
' expensive to maintain ' the local education authority claims that keeping the school open is not financially viable .
kent county council has said that cash may be better spent on other schools .
at the first meeting , more than 100 people crowded into the hall to voice opposition to the threatened closure .
councillors were greeted at the meeting by tuneful protests as ripple pupils have recorded a cd single voicing their opposition .
families also handed out balloons with " save our school " printed on them .

sylvia hardy , 71 , from barrack road , exeter , is due to appear before the city 's magistrates on 25 february to face a summons by the city council over outstanding council tax of £ 91 on her band b flat .
she is being supported by the devon pensioners ' action forum -lrb- dpaf -rrb- , which wants council tax in line with people 's ability to pay .
the campaign was sparked by devon county council tax rise of nearly 18 % last year .
' entirely alone ' pensioners have promised to continue their protest after the county council executive on monday approved a 5.25 % rise this year .
former social worker miss hardy , said she would not pay any liability order made by the court , and if bailiffs were sent to her home to collect the money they would have to " shin up the drainpipe " .
she said : " i am entirely alone with no family , and if anyone is going to make a stand to the bitter end i am the one to do it , even if it means going to prison . "
the day after her court appearance she is due to fight as an independent in the by-election for the city 's st david 's and pennsylvania ward county council seat .

" we are quite confident we can run it better and continue to give people the pleasure they get from it . "
ms pitts added that in the short-term consultants would be brought in to tighten up management procedures .

" they apparently included some figures that should have gone into november and that raises questions about financial control and why that spending was n't shown in november .
" also , and this is a management issue , we did have very good income figures in december , but we seem to have got that income at the expense of considerable extra expenditure . "
