the lazy one pays out over € 3000 a day .
european businesses are losing billions of euros a year through internet virus attacks .
however , some firms have little to complain about as many do not take the necessary precautions . the effect of internet viruses on european businesses is more devastating than first thought and many firms are still not doing enough to protect themselves from the computerized menaces , according to a recent survey by data security software company mcafee .
companies in europe are losing billions of euros each year as a result of internet viruses and yet many are still failing to take basic measures to ward off attacks , such as keeping anti-virus software up to date .
the worst offenders are the british and the french with only 39 percent of firms in the uk regularly updating their anti-virus software and 40 percent of french companies leaving themselves open to infection .
the italians and spaniards followed behind with 46 percent and 73 percent respectively saying that they update their protection systems on a weekly basis .
germany among the more vigilant germany came out as one of the most vigilant countries in the survey with only one in ten firms saying they operated with no anti-virus protection at all .
in britain and spain , only 1 percent said they were not protected .
spain , unique in europe , has laws requiring businesses to have security systems and keep them up to date .
in spain and the netherlands , more than half of the companies polled said they had been affected by a virus in the past 12 months , compared with 21 percent in germany .
it is estimated that each time a virus hits , it costs a company over € 3000 -lrb- around $ 3650 -rrb- a day while steps are taken to rectify it .
everyone can be affected , say security experts the survey polled 500 small to medium-sized businesses in the uk , italy , spain , france , netherlands , and germany .
despite the fact that only smaller firms were directly represented , security experts warned that poor security by companies and consumers can have a detrimental effect on any internet-connected business .
so-called computer " worms " use infected computers to generate more infected junk e-mail messages and attacks , spreading them throughout the internet community .
one third of all unsolicited email or " spam " is now relayed by consumers and businesses unaware that their computers are infected with remote-access bugs , according to anti-virus company sophos .
many of the businesses polled by mcafee were largely unaware of such dangers , with only 20 percent not knowing that viruses could send e-mail messages to recipients listed in their computer 's address book , and 48 percent had no idea that viruses could secretly store pornographic content on their computer .
two-thirds of french companies polled , and more than half in germany admitted they could have unknowingly forwarded an infected e-mail to colleagues and other businesses .
" any unprotected user , whether corporate , small business or end-user , becomes part of the problem , " said mcafee european product manager jack clark in an interview with computer weekly magazine .
" we need to encourage people to use what virus protection they have . "
concern has not necessarily translated into action , however , with 45 percent of uk companies and 54 percent in the netherlands listing security as a " low " priority . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares laws to battle spam germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam .

germans took to the streets in vast numbers on saturday to send a clear signal of defiance against the social reform programs implemented by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government . nearly half a million people turned out in three major german cities to express their anger and to urge the social democrat-green coalition government to roll back the agenda 2010 social reform programs which they said would reduce federal funding in welfare and health services as well as pension benefits .
in marches , rallies and demonstrations organized by trade unions and an array of social lobby organizations , anti-globalization groups and anti-war activists , the cities of berlin , cologne and stuttgart throbbed with protest as huge crowds heeded labour union calls to " stand up and be counted . " in the capital , 270,000 protesters converged on the highly symbolic brandenburg gate blowing whistles , holding placards proclaiming " social demolition creates no jobs " and waving union flags in the biggest rally yet against the chancellor 's year-old reform drive while 100,000 took to the streets in cologne and 125,000 in stuttgart , according to statistics issued by the organizers . speaking at the rally in berlin , michael sommer , head of the german labor federation , said that the huge turnout was a " a clear signal to those in power " that working-class germans oppose the government 's attempts to rekindle the national economy by paring social-welfare , health and pension programs . in cologne , jürgen peters , the head of german manufacturing union ig metall , told the throng of protestors , " we 're fed up with so-called reforms that we have to pay for but others benefit from . "
chancellor says there 's no turning back in an attempt to pre-empt the demonstrations , gerhard schröder acknowledged that he had " failed to get the message across " to many germans that his reforms are necessary to rejuvenate the nation 's economy and to avert bankruptcy of national health and pension systems .
" when you organize a reform process , you have a problem - the burdens become apparent immediately , " schröder said in a radio interview on friday .
" the positive effects will come later . " " if you look around europe , you will see that all its governments have a lot of explaining to do , " he added .
" but we must carry on explaining patiently and put up with the fact that polls do n't look how we would like them to . "
" there is no turning back , " he concluded .
schroeder 's so-called " agenda 2010 " of reforms , launched last year as germany limped into a third year of economic stagnation , includes higher health-care fees , lower retirement and jobless benefits , looser job protection laws and income tax cuts .
but since then his belt-tightening proposals have dominated germany 's political agenda mainly due to the increasingly vocal opposition . many distrust chancellor 's message many still distrust schröder 's insistence that he has no intention of dismantling the welfare state and have made that distrust well known .
in response , schröder has argued that he can only preserve the welfare state for future generations by pressing ahead now with cuts , but that has done little to dampen resentment over higher health-care costs and a freeze of retirement benefits this year . confronted with populations that are aging rapidly , germany and other european nations are attempting to reform generous , and expensive , welfare systems .
but these efforts have been met with fierce resistance across the continent , along with complaints that pensioners and the jobless are bearing an unfair share of the pain . italians and french join european day of action saturday 's demonstrations were part of a " european day of action " that also drew tens of thousands of pensioners onto the streets of rome to demand higher pensions and complain of steep increases in their cost of living and brought thousands of french out into the streets of france to call for " a more social europe . " the europe-wide protest was summed up by one demonstrator on saturday : " i hope people will start to wake up and realize that these so-called reforms are nothing but a radical program of social demolition , " said accountant hermann lehmer , 56 , one of the protesters in berlin .

germans took to the streets in vast numbers on saturday to send a clear signal of defiance against the social reform programs implemented by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government . nearly half a million people turned out in three major german cities to express their anger and to urge the social democrat-green coalition government to roll back the agenda 2010 social reform programs which they said would reduce federal funding in welfare and health services as well as pension benefits .
in marches , rallies and demonstrations organized by trade unions and an array of social lobby organizations , anti-globalization groups and anti-war activists , the cities of berlin , cologne and stuttgart throbbed with protest as huge crowds heeded labour union calls to " stand up and be counted . " in the capital , 270,000 protesters converged on the highly symbolic brandenburg gate blowing whistles , holding placards proclaiming " social demolition creates no jobs " and waving union flags in the biggest rally yet against the chancellor 's year-old reform drive while 100,000 took to the streets in cologne and 125,000 in stuttgart , according to statistics issued by the organizers . speaking at the rally in berlin , michael sommer , head of the german labor federation , said that the huge turnout was a " a clear signal to those in power " that working-class germans oppose the government 's attempts to rekindle the national economy by paring social-welfare , health and pension programs . in cologne , jürgen peters , the head of german manufacturing union ig metall , told the throng of protestors , " we 're fed up with so-called reforms that we have to pay for but others benefit from . "
chancellor says there 's no turning back in an attempt to pre-empt the demonstrations , gerhard schröder acknowledged that he had " failed to get the message across " to many germans that his reforms are necessary to rejuvenate the nation 's economy and to avert bankruptcy of national health and pension systems .
" when you organize a reform process , you have a problem - the burdens become apparent immediately , " schröder said in a radio interview on friday .
" the positive effects will come later . " " if you look around europe , you will see that all its governments have a lot of explaining to do , " he added .

european bank for reconstruction and development president jean lemierre has been put forward for the vacant job of international monetary fund chief by germany and france . while european finance ministers have so far failed to agree on a common candidate for the vacant post of head of the international monetary fund this weekend , the field was cut down to a two-horse race as france and germany made public their backing for european bank for reconstruction and development president jean lemierre . the european big guns stood by their man as the challenger to the other name in the frame , spanish economy minister rodrigo rato , as the meeting to discuss the vacancy slipped inot stalemate on the choice of the eu 's single candidate . " the finance ministers agreed there were two clear candidates - rato and lemierre , " dutch finance minister gerrit zalm told reporters during the meeting being held at a racecourse outside punchestown , ireland .
british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown , chairman of the imf 's interim committee , " will check that these candidates are appreciated by others , " zalm said . " we have to discuss the matter in depth , taking into consideration what colleagues in other parts of the world think , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker told reporters on the sidelines of the meeting on sunday . " we have said that we support the french candidate who is a very good candidate , " german finance minister hans eichel told reporters " the spanish one is also undoubtedly one , but everyone has to make a choice . " france and germany suspected of dealing observers have speculated about some behind the scenes dealing between the two powerhouses where germany would be rewarded for its support of lemierre by receiving french backing for a german to be given a proposed new job of " super commissioner " responsible for the european union 's economic , industrial and trade policy .
" if lemierre is a candidate , and this looks almost certain , he is likely to get the job , " one source said .
the ministers will now hold further talks in london later this month to try and come to agreement on the single candidate .
the ministers , meeting for the final day of informal talks in ireland , hoped to have a " final round " of talks at a meeting of the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- in london on april 18-19 .
" i do n't think that we 'll have a decision today .
we 'll have to discuss the matter in depth , taking into consideration what colleagues in other parts of the world are thinking , " he said .
ministers pencil in talks for london meeting " i guess that we 'll have a final informal round in the margin of the meeting in london , " he said , adding : " i do n't know if we will have a decision there but we will make final proress in the course of that meeting . "
eu finance ministers convened on friday to discuss their favored european candidates with lemierre and rato already ahead of the chasing pack .
but instead of presenting a united front , the process has been mired in complications .
ireland 's charlie mccreevy opened the two days of informal talks which would attempt to decide a candidate to succeed germany 's horst köhler at the imf .
but after initial discussions , mccreevy dampened hopes of a quick decision by saying that the weekend talks may not even finalize a shortlist .
the irish foreign minister told reporters that it had been the intention " to have all nominees at least in the frame at this weekend 's meeting . "
but mccreevy added that this may not be possible as some member states may not be in a position to put forward their particular candidate .
irish officials indicated earlier this week that agreement could be reached on europe 's candidate for imf chief at the weekend talks .
search for a candidate to unite behind " i and my european colleagues would hope that there would be a european candidate around which all european countries could unite , " mccreevy said .
already " a good period of time " has passed since köhler resigned , he added . the talks come after köhler announced his resignation as the imf chief on march 4 to concentrate on running for president in his native germany , for which he is widely seen as the front runner in the may elections .
since his announcement , the only point of agreement among european leaders is that a european should replace him . eleven imf board members from developing countries are challenging that view , demanding that all 184 imf member countries take part in choosing a leader in a decision made without regard to nationality .
since the founding of the imf and the world bank in 1944 , the managing director of the imf has by custom been a european and the president of the world bank an american .
us and japan may threaten eu dominance challenging the european dominance of the post , the united states , japan and other countries have said that they may propose their own candidates if the eu fails to come up with a single strong candidate supported by its member nations , the source added .
things may become more complicated still if italian prime minister silvio berlusconi makes good on a promise to name an " exceptional " candidate - named by some sources as eu competition commissioner mario monti .
whoever takes over the imf reins will need a firm grip .
the fund promotes monetary co-operation and economic and employment growth , but has been sharply criticized for its handling of recent financial crises in developing countries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , france want european imf chief germany and france have expressed desires for another european to be named head of the international monetary fund to replace the departing director , german horst köhler , according to germany 's finance minister hans eichel .

european bank for reconstruction and development president jean lemierre has been put forward for the vacant job of international monetary fund chief by germany and france . while european finance ministers have so far failed to agree on a common candidate for the vacant post of head of the international monetary fund this weekend , the field was cut down to a two-horse race as france and germany made public their backing for european bank for reconstruction and development president jean lemierre . the european big guns stood by their man as the challenger to the other name in the frame , spanish economy minister rodrigo rato , as the meeting to discuss the vacancy slipped inot stalemate on the choice of the eu 's single candidate . " the finance ministers agreed there were two clear candidates - rato and lemierre , " dutch finance minister gerrit zalm told reporters during the meeting being held at a racecourse outside punchestown , ireland .
british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown , chairman of the imf 's interim committee , " will check that these candidates are appreciated by others , " zalm said . " we have to discuss the matter in depth , taking into consideration what colleagues in other parts of the world think , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker told reporters on the sidelines of the meeting on sunday . " we have said that we support the french candidate who is a very good candidate , " german finance minister hans eichel told reporters " the spanish one is also undoubtedly one , but everyone has to make a choice . " france and germany suspected of dealing observers have speculated about some behind the scenes dealing between the two powerhouses where germany would be rewarded for its support of lemierre by receiving french backing for a german to be given a proposed new job of " super commissioner " responsible for the european union 's economic , industrial and trade policy .
" if lemierre is a candidate , and this looks almost certain , he is likely to get the job , " one source said .

the irish foreign minister told reporters that it had been the intention " to have all nominees at least in the frame at this weekend 's meeting . "

european businesses are losing billions of euros a year through internet virus attacks .
however , some firms have little to complain about as many do not take the necessary precautions . the effect of internet viruses on european businesses is more devastating than first thought and many firms are still not doing enough to protect themselves from the computerized menaces , according to a recent survey by data security software company mcafee .
companies in europe are losing billions of euros each year as a result of internet viruses and yet many are still failing to take basic measures to ward off attacks , such as keeping anti-virus software up to date .
the worst offenders are the british and the french with only 39 percent of firms in the uk regularly updating their anti-virus software and 40 percent of french companies leaving themselves open to infection .
the italians and spaniards followed behind with 46 percent and 73 percent respectively saying that they update their protection systems on a weekly basis .
germany among the more vigilant germany came out as one of the most vigilant countries in the survey with only one in ten firms saying they operated with no anti-virus protection at all .
in britain and spain , only 1 percent said they were not protected .
spain , unique in europe , has laws requiring businesses to have security systems and keep them up to date .
in spain and the netherlands , more than half of the companies polled said they had been affected by a virus in the past 12 months , compared with 21 percent in germany .
it is estimated that each time a virus hits , it costs a company over € 3000 -lrb- around $ 3650 -rrb- a day while steps are taken to rectify it .
everyone can be affected , say security experts the survey polled 500 small to medium-sized businesses in the uk , italy , spain , france , netherlands , and germany .
despite the fact that only smaller firms were directly represented , security experts warned that poor security by companies and consumers can have a detrimental effect on any internet-connected business .
so-called computer " worms " use infected computers to generate more infected junk e-mail messages and attacks , spreading them throughout the internet community .
one third of all unsolicited email or " spam " is now relayed by consumers and businesses unaware that their computers are infected with remote-access bugs , according to anti-virus company sophos .
many of the businesses polled by mcafee were largely unaware of such dangers , with only 20 percent not knowing that viruses could send e-mail messages to recipients listed in their computer 's address book , and 48 percent had no idea that viruses could secretly store pornographic content on their computer .
two-thirds of french companies polled , and more than half in germany admitted they could have unknowingly forwarded an infected e-mail to colleagues and other businesses .
" any unprotected user , whether corporate , small business or end-user , becomes part of the problem , " said mcafee european product manager jack clark in an interview with computer weekly magazine .
" we need to encourage people to use what virus protection they have . "
concern has not necessarily translated into action , however , with 45 percent of uk companies and 54 percent in the netherlands listing security as a " low " priority . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares laws to battle spam germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam .

the lazy one pays out over € 3000 a day .
european businesses are losing billions of euros a year through internet virus attacks .
however , some firms have little to complain about as many do not take the necessary precautions . the effect of internet viruses on european businesses is more devastating than first thought and many firms are still not doing enough to protect themselves from the computerized menaces , according to a recent survey by data security software company mcafee .
companies in europe are losing billions of euros each year as a result of internet viruses and yet many are still failing to take basic measures to ward off attacks , such as keeping anti-virus software up to date .
the worst offenders are the british and the french with only 39 percent of firms in the uk regularly updating their anti-virus software and 40 percent of french companies leaving themselves open to infection .
the italians and spaniards followed behind with 46 percent and 73 percent respectively saying that they update their protection systems on a weekly basis .
germany among the more vigilant germany came out as one of the most vigilant countries in the survey with only one in ten firms saying they operated with no anti-virus protection at all .
in britain and spain , only 1 percent said they were not protected .
spain , unique in europe , has laws requiring businesses to have security systems and keep them up to date .
in spain and the netherlands , more than half of the companies polled said they had been affected by a virus in the past 12 months , compared with 21 percent in germany .
it is estimated that each time a virus hits , it costs a company over € 3000 -lrb- around $ 3650 -rrb- a day while steps are taken to rectify it .
everyone can be affected , say security experts the survey polled 500 small to medium-sized businesses in the uk , italy , spain , france , netherlands , and germany .
despite the fact that only smaller firms were directly represented , security experts warned that poor security by companies and consumers can have a detrimental effect on any internet-connected business .
so-called computer " worms " use infected computers to generate more infected junk e-mail messages and attacks , spreading them throughout the internet community .
one third of all unsolicited email or " spam " is now relayed by consumers and businesses unaware that their computers are infected with remote-access bugs , according to anti-virus company sophos .
many of the businesses polled by mcafee were largely unaware of such dangers , with only 20 percent not knowing that viruses could send e-mail messages to recipients listed in their computer 's address book , and 48 percent had no idea that viruses could secretly store pornographic content on their computer .
two-thirds of french companies polled , and more than half in germany admitted they could have unknowingly forwarded an infected e-mail to colleagues and other businesses .
" any unprotected user , whether corporate , small business or end-user , becomes part of the problem , " said mcafee european product manager jack clark in an interview with computer weekly magazine .
" we need to encourage people to use what virus protection they have . "
concern has not necessarily translated into action , however , with 45 percent of uk companies and 54 percent in the netherlands listing security as a " low " priority . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares laws to battle spam germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam .

european businesses are losing billions of euros a year through internet virus attacks .
however , some firms have little to complain about as many do not take the necessary precautions . the effect of internet viruses on european businesses is more devastating than first thought and many firms are still not doing enough to protect themselves from the computerized menaces , according to a recent survey by data security software company mcafee .
companies in europe are losing billions of euros each year as a result of internet viruses and yet many are still failing to take basic measures to ward off attacks , such as keeping anti-virus software up to date .
the worst offenders are the british and the french with only 39 percent of firms in the uk regularly updating their anti-virus software and 40 percent of french companies leaving themselves open to infection .
the italians and spaniards followed behind with 46 percent and 73 percent respectively saying that they update their protection systems on a weekly basis .
germany among the more vigilant germany came out as one of the most vigilant countries in the survey with only one in ten firms saying they operated with no anti-virus protection at all .
in britain and spain , only 1 percent said they were not protected .
spain , unique in europe , has laws requiring businesses to have security systems and keep them up to date .
in spain and the netherlands , more than half of the companies polled said they had been affected by a virus in the past 12 months , compared with 21 percent in germany .
it is estimated that each time a virus hits , it costs a company over € 3000 -lrb- around $ 3650 -rrb- a day while steps are taken to rectify it .
everyone can be affected , say security experts the survey polled 500 small to medium-sized businesses in the uk , italy , spain , france , netherlands , and germany .
despite the fact that only smaller firms were directly represented , security experts warned that poor security by companies and consumers can have a detrimental effect on any internet-connected business .
so-called computer " worms " use infected computers to generate more infected junk e-mail messages and attacks , spreading them throughout the internet community .
one third of all unsolicited email or " spam " is now relayed by consumers and businesses unaware that their computers are infected with remote-access bugs , according to anti-virus company sophos .
many of the businesses polled by mcafee were largely unaware of such dangers , with only 20 percent not knowing that viruses could send e-mail messages to recipients listed in their computer 's address book , and 48 percent had no idea that viruses could secretly store pornographic content on their computer .
two-thirds of french companies polled , and more than half in germany admitted they could have unknowingly forwarded an infected e-mail to colleagues and other businesses .
" any unprotected user , whether corporate , small business or end-user , becomes part of the problem , " said mcafee european product manager jack clark in an interview with computer weekly magazine .
" we need to encourage people to use what virus protection they have . "
concern has not necessarily translated into action , however , with 45 percent of uk companies and 54 percent in the netherlands listing security as a " low " priority . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares laws to battle spam germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam .

germans took to the streets in vast numbers on saturday to send a clear signal of defiance against the social reform programs implemented by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government . nearly half a million people turned out in three major german cities to express their anger and to urge the social democrat-green coalition government to roll back the agenda 2010 social reform programs which they said would reduce federal funding in welfare and health services as well as pension benefits .
in marches , rallies and demonstrations organized by trade unions and an array of social lobby organizations , anti-globalization groups and anti-war activists , the cities of berlin , cologne and stuttgart throbbed with protest as huge crowds heeded labour union calls to " stand up and be counted . " in the capital , 270,000 protesters converged on the highly symbolic brandenburg gate blowing whistles , holding placards proclaiming " social demolition creates no jobs " and waving union flags in the biggest rally yet against the chancellor 's year-old reform drive while 100,000 took to the streets in cologne and 125,000 in stuttgart , according to statistics issued by the organizers . speaking at the rally in berlin , michael sommer , head of the german labor federation , said that the huge turnout was a " a clear signal to those in power " that working-class germans oppose the government 's attempts to rekindle the national economy by paring social-welfare , health and pension programs . in cologne , jürgen peters , the head of german manufacturing union ig metall , told the throng of protestors , " we 're fed up with so-called reforms that we have to pay for but others benefit from . "
chancellor says there 's no turning back in an attempt to pre-empt the demonstrations , gerhard schröder acknowledged that he had " failed to get the message across " to many germans that his reforms are necessary to rejuvenate the nation 's economy and to avert bankruptcy of national health and pension systems .
" when you organize a reform process , you have a problem - the burdens become apparent immediately , " schröder said in a radio interview on friday .
" the positive effects will come later . " " if you look around europe , you will see that all its governments have a lot of explaining to do , " he added .
" but we must carry on explaining patiently and put up with the fact that polls do n't look how we would like them to . "
" there is no turning back , " he concluded .
schroeder 's so-called " agenda 2010 " of reforms , launched last year as germany limped into a third year of economic stagnation , includes higher health-care fees , lower retirement and jobless benefits , looser job protection laws and income tax cuts .
but since then his belt-tightening proposals have dominated germany 's political agenda mainly due to the increasingly vocal opposition . many distrust chancellor 's message many still distrust schröder 's insistence that he has no intention of dismantling the welfare state and have made that distrust well known .
in response , schröder has argued that he can only preserve the welfare state for future generations by pressing ahead now with cuts , but that has done little to dampen resentment over higher health-care costs and a freeze of retirement benefits this year . confronted with populations that are aging rapidly , germany and other european nations are attempting to reform generous , and expensive , welfare systems .
but these efforts have been met with fierce resistance across the continent , along with complaints that pensioners and the jobless are bearing an unfair share of the pain . italians and french join european day of action saturday 's demonstrations were part of a " european day of action " that also drew tens of thousands of pensioners onto the streets of rome to demand higher pensions and complain of steep increases in their cost of living and brought thousands of french out into the streets of france to call for " a more social europe . " the europe-wide protest was summed up by one demonstrator on saturday : " i hope people will start to wake up and realize that these so-called reforms are nothing but a radical program of social demolition , " said accountant hermann lehmer , 56 , one of the protesters in berlin .

germans took to the streets in vast numbers on saturday to send a clear signal of defiance against the social reform programs implemented by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government . nearly half a million people turned out in three major german cities to express their anger and to urge the social democrat-green coalition government to roll back the agenda 2010 social reform programs which they said would reduce federal funding in welfare and health services as well as pension benefits .
in marches , rallies and demonstrations organized by trade unions and an array of social lobby organizations , anti-globalization groups and anti-war activists , the cities of berlin , cologne and stuttgart throbbed with protest as huge crowds heeded labour union calls to " stand up and be counted . " in the capital , 270,000 protesters converged on the highly symbolic brandenburg gate blowing whistles , holding placards proclaiming " social demolition creates no jobs " and waving union flags in the biggest rally yet against the chancellor 's year-old reform drive while 100,000 took to the streets in cologne and 125,000 in stuttgart , according to statistics issued by the organizers . speaking at the rally in berlin , michael sommer , head of the german labor federation , said that the huge turnout was a " a clear signal to those in power " that working-class germans oppose the government 's attempts to rekindle the national economy by paring social-welfare , health and pension programs . in cologne , jürgen peters , the head of german manufacturing union ig metall , told the throng of protestors , " we 're fed up with so-called reforms that we have to pay for but others benefit from . "
chancellor says there 's no turning back in an attempt to pre-empt the demonstrations , gerhard schröder acknowledged that he had " failed to get the message across " to many germans that his reforms are necessary to rejuvenate the nation 's economy and to avert bankruptcy of national health and pension systems .
" when you organize a reform process , you have a problem - the burdens become apparent immediately , " schröder said in a radio interview on friday .
" the positive effects will come later . " " if you look around europe , you will see that all its governments have a lot of explaining to do , " he added .
" but we must carry on explaining patiently and put up with the fact that polls do n't look how we would like them to . "
" there is no turning back , " he concluded .
schroeder 's so-called " agenda 2010 " of reforms , launched last year as germany limped into a third year of economic stagnation , includes higher health-care fees , lower retirement and jobless benefits , looser job protection laws and income tax cuts .
but since then his belt-tightening proposals have dominated germany 's political agenda mainly due to the increasingly vocal opposition . many distrust chancellor 's message many still distrust schröder 's insistence that he has no intention of dismantling the welfare state and have made that distrust well known .
in response , schröder has argued that he can only preserve the welfare state for future generations by pressing ahead now with cuts , but that has done little to dampen resentment over higher health-care costs and a freeze of retirement benefits this year . confronted with populations that are aging rapidly , germany and other european nations are attempting to reform generous , and expensive , welfare systems .
but these efforts have been met with fierce resistance across the continent , along with complaints that pensioners and the jobless are bearing an unfair share of the pain . italians and french join european day of action saturday 's demonstrations were part of a " european day of action " that also drew tens of thousands of pensioners onto the streets of rome to demand higher pensions and complain of steep increases in their cost of living and brought thousands of french out into the streets of france to call for " a more social europe . " the europe-wide protest was summed up by one demonstrator on saturday : " i hope people will start to wake up and realize that these so-called reforms are nothing but a radical program of social demolition , " said accountant hermann lehmer , 56 , one of the protesters in berlin .

european bank for reconstruction and development president jean lemierre has been put forward for the vacant job of international monetary fund chief by germany and france . while european finance ministers have so far failed to agree on a common candidate for the vacant post of head of the international monetary fund this weekend , the field was cut down to a two-horse race as france and germany made public their backing for european bank for reconstruction and development president jean lemierre . the european big guns stood by their man as the challenger to the other name in the frame , spanish economy minister rodrigo rato , as the meeting to discuss the vacancy slipped inot stalemate on the choice of the eu 's single candidate . " the finance ministers agreed there were two clear candidates - rato and lemierre , " dutch finance minister gerrit zalm told reporters during the meeting being held at a racecourse outside punchestown , ireland .
british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown , chairman of the imf 's interim committee , " will check that these candidates are appreciated by others , " zalm said . " we have to discuss the matter in depth , taking into consideration what colleagues in other parts of the world think , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker told reporters on the sidelines of the meeting on sunday .

germans took to the streets in vast numbers on saturday to send a clear signal of defiance against the social reform programs implemented by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government . nearly half a million people turned out in three major german cities to express their anger and to urge the social democrat-green coalition government to roll back the agenda 2010 social reform programs which they said would reduce federal funding in welfare and health services as well as pension benefits .
in marches , rallies and demonstrations organized by trade unions and an array of social lobby organizations , anti-globalization groups and anti-war activists , the cities of berlin , cologne and stuttgart throbbed with protest as huge crowds heeded labour union calls to " stand up and be counted . " in the capital , 270,000 protesters converged on the highly symbolic brandenburg gate blowing whistles , holding placards proclaiming " social demolition creates no jobs " and waving union flags in the biggest rally yet against the chancellor 's year-old reform drive while 100,000 took to the streets in cologne and 125,000 in stuttgart , according to statistics issued by the organizers . speaking at the rally in berlin , michael sommer , head of the german labor federation , said that the huge turnout was a " a clear signal to those in power " that working-class germans oppose the government 's attempts to rekindle the national economy by paring social-welfare , health and pension programs . in cologne , jürgen peters , the head of german manufacturing union ig metall , told the throng of protestors , " we 're fed up with so-called reforms that we have to pay for but others benefit from . "
chancellor says there 's no turning back in an attempt to pre-empt the demonstrations , gerhard schröder acknowledged that he had " failed to get the message across " to many germans that his reforms are necessary to rejuvenate the nation 's economy and to avert bankruptcy of national health and pension systems .
" when you organize a reform process , you have a problem - the burdens become apparent immediately , " schröder said in a radio interview on friday .
" the positive effects will come later . " " if you look around europe , you will see that all its governments have a lot of explaining to do , " he added .
" but we must carry on explaining patiently and put up with the fact that polls do n't look how we would like them to . "
" there is no turning back , " he concluded .
schroeder 's so-called " agenda 2010 " of reforms , launched last year as germany limped into a third year of economic stagnation , includes higher health-care fees , lower retirement and jobless benefits , looser job protection laws and income tax cuts .
but since then his belt-tightening proposals have dominated germany 's political agenda mainly due to the increasingly vocal opposition . many distrust chancellor 's message many still distrust schröder 's insistence that he has no intention of dismantling the welfare state and have made that distrust well known .
in response , schröder has argued that he can only preserve the welfare state for future generations by pressing ahead now with cuts , but that has done little to dampen resentment over higher health-care costs and a freeze of retirement benefits this year . confronted with populations that are aging rapidly , germany and other european nations are attempting to reform generous , and expensive , welfare systems .
but these efforts have been met with fierce resistance across the continent , along with complaints that pensioners and the jobless are bearing an unfair share of the pain . italians and french join european day of action saturday 's demonstrations were part of a " european day of action " that also drew tens of thousands of pensioners onto the streets of rome to demand higher pensions and complain of steep increases in their cost of living and brought thousands of french out into the streets of france to call for " a more social europe . " the europe-wide protest was summed up by one demonstrator on saturday : " i hope people will start to wake up and realize that these so-called reforms are nothing but a radical program of social demolition , " said accountant hermann lehmer , 56 , one of the protesters in berlin .

" in the capital , 270,000 protesters converged on the highly symbolic brandenburg gate blowing whistles , holding placards proclaiming " social demolition creates no jobs " and waving union flags in the biggest rally yet against the chancellor 's year-old reform drive while 100,000 took to the streets in cologne and 125,000 in stuttgart , according to statistics issued by the organizers . speaking at the rally in berlin , michael sommer , head of the german labor federation , said that the huge turnout was a " a clear signal to those in power " that working-class germans oppose the government 's attempts to rekindle the national economy by paring social-welfare , health and pension programs . in cologne , jürgen peters , the head of german manufacturing union ig metall , told the throng of protestors , " we 're fed up with so-called reforms that we have to pay for but others benefit from . "
chancellor says there 's no turning back in an attempt to pre-empt the demonstrations , gerhard schröder acknowledged that he had " failed to get the message across " to many germans that his reforms are necessary to rejuvenate the nation 's economy and to avert bankruptcy of national health and pension systems .
" when you organize a reform process , you have a problem - the burdens become apparent immediately , " schröder said in a radio interview on friday .
" the positive effects will come later . " " if you look around europe , you will see that all its governments have a lot of explaining to do , " he added .
" but we must carry on explaining patiently and put up with the fact that polls do n't look how we would like them to . "
" there is no turning back , " he concluded .
schroeder 's so-called " agenda 2010 " of reforms , launched last year as germany limped into a third year of economic stagnation , includes higher health-care fees , lower retirement and jobless benefits , looser job protection laws and income tax cuts .
but since then his belt-tightening proposals have dominated germany 's political agenda mainly due to the increasingly vocal opposition . many distrust chancellor 's message many still distrust schröder 's insistence that he has no intention of dismantling the welfare state and have made that distrust well known .
in response , schröder has argued that he can only preserve the welfare state for future generations by pressing ahead now with cuts , but that has done little to dampen resentment over higher health-care costs and a freeze of retirement benefits this year . confronted with populations that are aging rapidly , germany and other european nations are attempting to reform generous , and expensive , welfare systems .
but these efforts have been met with fierce resistance across the continent , along with complaints that pensioners and the jobless are bearing an unfair share of the pain . italians and french join european day of action saturday 's demonstrations were part of a " european day of action " that also drew tens of thousands of pensioners onto the streets of rome to demand higher pensions and complain of steep increases in their cost of living and brought thousands of french out into the streets of france to call for " a more social europe . " the europe-wide protest was summed up by one demonstrator on saturday : " i hope people will start to wake up and realize that these so-called reforms are nothing but a radical program of social demolition , " said accountant hermann lehmer , 56 , one of the protesters in berlin .

european businesses are losing billions of euros a year through internet virus attacks .
however , some firms have little to complain about as many do not take the necessary precautions . the effect of internet viruses on european businesses is more devastating than first thought and many firms are still not doing enough to protect themselves from the computerized menaces , according to a recent survey by data security software company mcafee .
companies in europe are losing billions of euros each year as a result of internet viruses and yet many are still failing to take basic measures to ward off attacks , such as keeping anti-virus software up to date .
the worst offenders are the british and the french with only 39 percent of firms in the uk regularly updating their anti-virus software and 40 percent of french companies leaving themselves open to infection .
the italians and spaniards followed behind with 46 percent and 73 percent respectively saying that they update their protection systems on a weekly basis .
germany among the more vigilant germany came out as one of the most vigilant countries in the survey with only one in ten firms saying they operated with no anti-virus protection at all .
in britain and spain , only 1 percent said they were not protected .
spain , unique in europe , has laws requiring businesses to have security systems and keep them up to date .
in spain and the netherlands , more than half of the companies polled said they had been affected by a virus in the past 12 months , compared with 21 percent in germany .
it is estimated that each time a virus hits , it costs a company over € 3000 -lrb- around $ 3650 -rrb- a day while steps are taken to rectify it .
everyone can be affected , say security experts the survey polled 500 small to medium-sized businesses in the uk , italy , spain , france , netherlands , and germany .
despite the fact that only smaller firms were directly represented , security experts warned that poor security by companies and consumers can have a detrimental effect on any internet-connected business .
so-called computer " worms " use infected computers to generate more infected junk e-mail messages and attacks , spreading them throughout the internet community .
one third of all unsolicited email or " spam " is now relayed by consumers and businesses unaware that their computers are infected with remote-access bugs , according to anti-virus company sophos .
many of the businesses polled by mcafee were largely unaware of such dangers , with only 20 percent not knowing that viruses could send e-mail messages to recipients listed in their computer 's address book , and 48 percent had no idea that viruses could secretly store pornographic content on their computer .
two-thirds of french companies polled , and more than half in germany admitted they could have unknowingly forwarded an infected e-mail to colleagues and other businesses .
" any unprotected user , whether corporate , small business or end-user , becomes part of the problem , " said mcafee european product manager jack clark in an interview with computer weekly magazine .
" we need to encourage people to use what virus protection they have . "
concern has not necessarily translated into action , however , with 45 percent of uk companies and 54 percent in the netherlands listing security as a " low " priority . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares laws to battle spam germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam .

european businesses are losing billions of euros a year through internet virus attacks .
however , some firms have little to complain about as many do not take the necessary precautions . the effect of internet viruses on european businesses is more devastating than first thought and many firms are still not doing enough to protect themselves from the computerized menaces , according to a recent survey by data security software company mcafee .
companies in europe are losing billions of euros each year as a result of internet viruses and yet many are still failing to take basic measures to ward off attacks , such as keeping anti-virus software up to date .
the worst offenders are the british and the french with only 39 percent of firms in the uk regularly updating their anti-virus software and 40 percent of french companies leaving themselves open to infection .
the italians and spaniards followed behind with 46 percent and 73 percent respectively saying that they update their protection systems on a weekly basis .
germany among the more vigilant germany came out as one of the most vigilant countries in the survey with only one in ten firms saying they operated with no anti-virus protection at all .
in britain and spain , only 1 percent said they were not protected .
spain , unique in europe , has laws requiring businesses to have security systems and keep them up to date .
in spain and the netherlands , more than half of the companies polled said they had been affected by a virus in the past 12 months , compared with 21 percent in germany .
it is estimated that each time a virus hits , it costs a company over € 3000 -lrb- around $ 3650 -rrb- a day while steps are taken to rectify it .

many feel the risk is just too great to take .
life had begun to get back to normal .
it is just over three weeks since the attack at madrid 's atocha station , which left 191 people dead .
you still saw black ribbons of mourning hanging in shops , cafes and even car windows .
the ad hoc shrines to the victims , of candles , flowers and hand written prayers , were still being maintained at the madrid station .
vigils to the bomb victims are still being held in madrid but on the whole , people felt the worst was over .
then came the news that explosives had been found on a high speed train line on friday .
it has shocked people , once again , to the core .
the newspaper la razon , commented , " our enemies know us well and how best to hurt us the most " .
the 11 march train attacks were timed to explode at the height of the rush hour .
this second attempt coincided with the beginning of the easter holiday .
if people really want to cause another bloodbath , eventually they will find a way .
what can you do ?
certainly not lock yourself up forever train passenger a reported 23 million spaniards were on the move when the bomb attempt was foiled , a large proportion of them travelling in crowded trains .
many in spain have already made up their minds as to who was responsible .
el mundo , a daily newspaper , blames " islamic terrorists " .
they say police sources have told them one radical moroccan combatant group was behind both operations .

defiance i spoke to one young man as he boarded a train in madrid with his three young children .
" no matter what measures are implemented by the government , " he said .
" if people really want to cause another bloodbath , eventually they will find a way .
what can you do ?
certainly not lock yourself up forever . "
scared but defiant is probably the best way to describe the mood in madrid .
people are un-nerved at the apparent ease with which the would-be attackers were able to plant the explosives on friday .
but most are determined not to give in .
i approached one woman who was weighed down with flowers and easter eggs .
she was on her way to visit her family in seville .
" we spaniards have lived with basque separatist violence for over 30 years " she said .
" the new islamic threat worries us , but it will never break our spirit .
i hope they know that i have chosen to take the same train line today that they targeted yesterday " .

the visit began with a tour of the secret titov centre near moscow , which collects spy satellite data , in what is seen as a sign of trust .
mr putin 's talks with mr chirac come a day after a visit by german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
both trips are seen as an attempt to soothe moscow 's concerns over the expansion of nato and the eu .
president chirac was the first foreigner to visit the titov centre , about 40kms -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- west of moscow .
the bbc 's steve rosenberg in moscow says the symbolism was not lost on president chirac - who said he welcomed this " sign of trust " .
high-tech during the tour on saturday mr putin showed him models of two russian satellites .
the older one was the size of a man and weighed 600kg -lrb- 1300 pounds -rrb- - the modern type the size of a football and weighed two kg -lrb- four pounds -rrb- .
" this is the difference 10 years makes , " mr putin said .
mr chirac left moscow at the end of the day .
our correspondent says that in recent weeks relations between russia and the west have been clouded by mistrust .
europe has expressed concern about the state of russian democracy .
russia remains anxious it is losing key political and economic levers , as eight countries from its own former sphere of influence join the european fold .
mr putin was also looking for reassurance from his french and german allies over nato .
the enlargement of the military alliance to seven central and eastern european countries on friday had long been announced - but it was nevertheless not welcomed by moscow .

the cost of tin is now £ 4,700 a ton - a rise of £ 1,000 in only a few weeks .
the owners of south crofty tin mine , baseresult , say it gives them added confidence they will be back in production within two years .
mining historian , alan buckley , said the price increase could be a setback for anyone who wanted to develop the site for other uses .
" they will probably be worried about the increase in price because it might throw a spanner in the works . "
it means we can be very positive about going back into production " david stone , baseresult technical director " if the tin price was to go sufficiently high , large financial backing would come to the project to reopen south crofty . "
baseresult technical director david stone said he was delighted by the news .
" it gives us comfort , and those people who are investing in us to sustain the operation so far .
" it means we can be very positive about going back into production . "
south crofty closed as a working mine in 1998 , bringing to an end a 3,000-year-old tin mining tradition in cornwall .
the camborne , pool and redruth regeneration company wants to push through a compulsory purchase of all or part of the site so it can improve the run-down area .
but baseresult says it believes there is a realistic prospect of breathing new life into the prominent site .
