with the depressed labor market showing no signs of an upturn , jobless germans are now taking matters into their hands - by seeking their fortunes overseas and turning to self-employment . according to germany 's federal statistical office , around 110,000 germans yearly pack up their bags to work abroad , at least for some time . much of that is a reaction to the country 's persistently high unemployment rate , which hovers around the 11 percent mark .
it 's not just highly-qualified germans , but increasingly also casual laborers and seasonal workers who are looking abroad for jobs . monika varnhagen , director of the bonn-based international employment agency -lrb- zav -rrb- , which helps german construction workers among others to find jobs for limited periods abroad , says that interest among germans in overseas jobs has been on the rise in the past few years .
" on the one hand it certainly has to do with the state of the labor market , but increasingly , many young people want to acquire additional qualifications by having worked abroad , " varnhagen told deutsche welle . she added that the flexibility of the european union had facilitated the rise of the phenomenon .
" the european labor market is open and thus offers chances to gain qualifications for those interested , " varnhagen said . looking for jobs beyond europe but jobseekers are n't stopping at the eu 's borders in their quest for work .
in the past 10 years , the zav has helped around 60,000 germans find employment all over the world . zav spokeswoman sabine seidler said that the agency started special programs in the face of increased willingness among germans to try their luck further away from the european continent .
" for instance we find jobs for teachers in specific subjects , like in the u.s. state of texas , where they have a great demand for teachers of german or other subjects , but ca n't fulfill that need locally , " seidler explained . canada , too , is a coveted destination for german jobseekers according to seidler , in particular for recent university graduates interested in an internship overseas . the zav 's initiatives like the " young workers exchange program " has sparked much interest in regions where high unemployment prevails , so much so that local job centers in smaller towns and cities have also begun to finance language courses in addition to helping german jobseekers with the move to a foreign country . being your own boss looking overseas for work is n't the only way germany 's long-term unemployed have found of dragging themselves out of the job market misery .
a study released by the german state-owned credit bank kfw in frankfurt on monday concluded that an increasing number of jobless germans are taking the plunge into self-employment and setting up their own businesses . every fourth person opting for self-employment last year , from a total of 1.6 million germans , was registered as jobless prior to the move , according to the study .
in former communist east germany , where unemployment is highest , every second entrepreneur was unemployed . the kfw study also pointed out that the number of people who decided to go it alone with the help of the " ich-ag " -lrb- me incorporated -rrb- scheme - a labor market reform introduced by the government which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own businesses - had doubled within a year to 249,800 . the trend has led to a lowering of the start-up capital , the study said .
about 40 percent of the newly self-employed needed a maximum of € 1,000 to start their business , while every tenth person who set up shop required more than € 50,000 . " an interesting alternative " most independent start-ups are in the service industry , followed by the retail and car-repair sectors . hans reich , head of kfw 's supervisory board told a press conference that the numbers prove people are learning to make the best out of a dire situation .

with the depressed labor market showing no signs of an upturn , jobless germans are now taking matters into their hands - by seeking their fortunes overseas and turning to self-employment . according to germany 's federal statistical office , around 110,000 germans yearly pack up their bags to work abroad , at least for some time . much of that is a reaction to the country 's persistently high unemployment rate , which hovers around the 11 percent mark .
it 's not just highly-qualified germans , but increasingly also casual laborers and seasonal workers who are looking abroad for jobs . monika varnhagen , director of the bonn-based international employment agency -lrb- zav -rrb- , which helps german construction workers among others to find jobs for limited periods abroad , says that interest among germans in overseas jobs has been on the rise in the past few years .
" on the one hand it certainly has to do with the state of the labor market , but increasingly , many young people want to acquire additional qualifications by having worked abroad , " varnhagen told deutsche welle . she added that the flexibility of the european union had facilitated the rise of the phenomenon .
" the european labor market is open and thus offers chances to gain qualifications for those interested , " varnhagen said . looking for jobs beyond europe but jobseekers are n't stopping at the eu 's borders in their quest for work .
in the past 10 years , the zav has helped around 60,000 germans find employment all over the world . zav spokeswoman sabine seidler said that the agency started special programs in the face of increased willingness among germans to try their luck further away from the european continent .
" for instance we find jobs for teachers in specific subjects , like in the u.s. state of texas , where they have a great demand for teachers of german or other subjects , but ca n't fulfill that need locally , " seidler explained . canada , too , is a coveted destination for german jobseekers according to seidler , in particular for recent university graduates interested in an internship overseas . the zav 's initiatives like the " young workers exchange program " has sparked much interest in regions where high unemployment prevails , so much so that local job centers in smaller towns and cities have also begun to finance language courses in addition to helping german jobseekers with the move to a foreign country . being your own boss looking overseas for work is n't the only way germany 's long-term unemployed have found of dragging themselves out of the job market misery .
a study released by the german state-owned credit bank kfw in frankfurt on monday concluded that an increasing number of jobless germans are taking the plunge into self-employment and setting up their own businesses . every fourth person opting for self-employment last year , from a total of 1.6 million germans , was registered as jobless prior to the move , according to the study .
in former communist east germany , where unemployment is highest , every second entrepreneur was unemployed . the kfw study also pointed out that the number of people who decided to go it alone with the help of the " ich-ag " -lrb- me incorporated -rrb- scheme - a labor market reform introduced by the government which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own businesses - had doubled within a year to 249,800 . the trend has led to a lowering of the start-up capital , the study said .
about 40 percent of the newly self-employed needed a maximum of € 1,000 to start their business , while every tenth person who set up shop required more than € 50,000 . " an interesting alternative " most independent start-ups are in the service industry , followed by the retail and car-repair sectors . hans reich , head of kfw 's supervisory board told a press conference that the numbers prove people are learning to make the best out of a dire situation .
" despite the difficult economic situation , independence is still an interesting alternative for many people , " reich remarked . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate introducing national minimum wage germany is one of the few european countries which does not have a minimum wage .

with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n. with one short speech on monday , spanish prime-minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero made official that his country , long one of washington 's staunchest supporters in the war , is considering withdrawing its forces from iraq .
the prospect of losing a close ally is disquieting for the bush administration , and on monday , u.s. state department spokesman adam ereli said the united states would consider drafting a new united nations resolution aimed at providing the international body with a mandate to send troops to iraq and assuage fears of the incoming spanish government .
" the new -lrb- spanish -rrb- government is just forming .
they 're formulating their policies .
they 'll be taking actions over the next couple of months .
simultaneously , there will be things happening in iraq and in new york , " he said .
but ereli also questioned the need for a new resolution , arguing that the u.n. already has an iraq mandate under a previously approved resolution .
" it has been said that there needs to be a u.n. mandate for those troops , " ereli told reporters .
" we believe there is such a mandate in -lrb- u.n. resolution -rrb- 1511 .
at the same time , we 've also said that , in the context of a transfer of sovereignty on june 30th , a new resolution is possible . "
" the war in iraq was a disaster " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party leader jose rodriguez zapatero on monday , zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- criticized the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , describing the war and occupation as a " disaster , " and threatened to withdraw his troops by june 30 if a multinational u.n. force is not sent to the country .
" the spanish troops in iraq will come home , " zapatero told a spanish radio station .
zapatero 's position represents a 180-degree turn for spain , whose outgoing conservative prime minister , jose maria aznar , and his people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- served as loyal backers of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , even though the majority of spaniards opposed the war .
though zapatero ran his campaign on pledges to withdraw troops , the issue has taken on more urgency in spain this week , with major public outrage following terrorist bombings of commuter trains in madrid that killed 200 and wounded 1,500 .
initially , aznar 's -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar government insisted the basque terrorist organization eta was responsible for the bombings , but recent evidence and arrests have shifted the focus of investigators to islam extremists .
with evidence suggesting eta may not have been part of the attacks after all and that aznar 's government may have manipulated information with an eye on the polls , spaniards turned their backs on the people 's party , instead voting in zapatero and his anti-war platform .
allies : we 're staying put even as spain appears to be preparing to exit iraq , other members of the so-called " coalition of the willing , " have come out quickly with statements offering their steadfast support for the occupation .
great britain , bulgaria , denmark , the czech republic , the ukraine and japan have all said they would maintain their troops in iraq .
if spain pulled out its troops , polish prime minister leszek miller warned , it " would amount to an admission that the terrorists are right and that they are stronger than the whole civilized world . "
the spanish pullout could have serious consequences for poland .
currently , warsaw is in charge of a 9,000-strong military contingent comprising 24 nations in south-central iraq , including spain 's troops .
spain was expected to take control of the contingent in july , but those plans are now in question .
although poland has said it could continue to command the troops , it would create an additional strain for the country .
a domino effect ?
spain 's dramatic shift comes as a major setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq policies .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
observers , including ted galen carpenter of the conservative cato institute in washington , d.c. , said if washington is unable to keep spain from removing its troops , it could lead to a " domino effect " in other countries where governments have supported the war but popular opinion has stood against it . dw staff -lrb- dsl / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain to withdraw troops from iraq fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq .

with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n. with one short speech on monday , spanish prime-minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero made official that his country , long one of washington 's staunchest supporters in the war , is considering withdrawing its forces from iraq .
the prospect of losing a close ally is disquieting for the bush administration , and on monday , u.s. state department spokesman adam ereli said the united states would consider drafting a new united nations resolution aimed at providing the international body with a mandate to send troops to iraq and assuage fears of the incoming spanish government .
" the new -lrb- spanish -rrb- government is just forming .
they 're formulating their policies .
they 'll be taking actions over the next couple of months .
simultaneously , there will be things happening in iraq and in new york , " he said .
but ereli also questioned the need for a new resolution , arguing that the u.n. already has an iraq mandate under a previously approved resolution .
" it has been said that there needs to be a u.n. mandate for those troops , " ereli told reporters .
" we believe there is such a mandate in -lrb- u.n. resolution -rrb- 1511 .
at the same time , we 've also said that , in the context of a transfer of sovereignty on june 30th , a new resolution is possible . "
" the war in iraq was a disaster " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party leader jose rodriguez zapatero on monday , zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- criticized the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , describing the war and occupation as a " disaster , " and threatened to withdraw his troops by june 30 if a multinational u.n. force is not sent to the country .
" the spanish troops in iraq will come home , " zapatero told a spanish radio station .
zapatero 's position represents a 180-degree turn for spain , whose outgoing conservative prime minister , jose maria aznar , and his people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- served as loyal backers of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , even though the majority of spaniards opposed the war .
though zapatero ran his campaign on pledges to withdraw troops , the issue has taken on more urgency in spain this week , with major public outrage following terrorist bombings of commuter trains in madrid that killed 200 and wounded 1,500 .
initially , aznar 's -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar government insisted the basque terrorist organization eta was responsible for the bombings , but recent evidence and arrests have shifted the focus of investigators to islam extremists .
with evidence suggesting eta may not have been part of the attacks after all and that aznar 's government may have manipulated information with an eye on the polls , spaniards turned their backs on the people 's party , instead voting in zapatero and his anti-war platform .
allies : we 're staying put even as spain appears to be preparing to exit iraq , other members of the so-called " coalition of the willing , " have come out quickly with statements offering their steadfast support for the occupation .
great britain , bulgaria , denmark , the czech republic , the ukraine and japan have all said they would maintain their troops in iraq .

germany is facing yet another corruption scandal .
after a spectacular munich soccer stadium bribery affair , news that rail company deutsche bahn is under investigation is adding to the country 's tarnished reputation . once upon a time , germany was regarded as a country whose government officials and companies operated with fairness and competence , and whose post-war economy was founded on principles of quality and honesty . until a few years ago , the country 's media had little to say about political or industrial scandals . now , however , the german newspapers are increasingly filled with stories on bribery and corruption . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly no longer has its squeaky clean image of old .
two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club and the nation 's railway company are the latest to make unwanted headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn .
for deutsche bahn , the state-backed rail operator , the trouble stems from alleged illegal payments possibly involving the company 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn , who is currently being investigated for possible corruption by prosecutors in the german city of neuruppin .
according to media reports , deutsche bahn offices across the country , including the company 's headquarters in berlin , were raided by police and officials from the prosecutor 's office on tuesday .
the raids were part of an investigation into a contract between deutsche bahn and the german state of brandenburg signed in 2002 which gives deutsche bahn control of the most lucrative rail lines in the state until 2012 .
the ten-year contract , worth € 1.92 billion -lrb- $ 2.35 billion -rrb- , handed deutsche bahn subsidized passenger services on between 70 and 75 percent of rail lines in the state .
the contract was negotiated by mehdorn and hartmut meyer , who was the transport minister of brandenburg at the time .
less than a year after the contract was signed , meyer surprisingly quit his job at the ministry in september , 2003 after ten years in office .
he has since become an adviser to deutsche bahn . investigators from the public prosecutor 's office are looking into the possibility that the contract was not open to competitive bidding and whether illegal financial incentives were involved in the sealing of the deal .
meyer himself is now under investigation and his home and the office of his consulting firm " short cut " were also included in the sweep on tuesday .
deutsche bahn spokesman werner klingberg rejected the possibility of corruption and said the company was cooperating with the investigation , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on wednesday .
munich soccer corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsv 1860 münich president karl heinz wildmoser resigns .
the deutsche bahn scandal comes hot on the heels of the munich soccer stadium affair .
last week , karl-heinz wildmoser -lrb- photo -rrb- , the president of german soccer club tsv 1860 munich , was arrested on suspicion of taking bribes from a company that won the bid to build the new allianz arena , one of the showcase stadiums for the 2006 world cup finals in germany . wildmoser , his son and two others were accused of involvement in a shadowy exchange of sealed bids for the construction contract for the new arena and of participating in illegal payments for the information .
wildmoser was released on bail on friday and resigned from his position as club president on monday . the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , dr. hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , told dw-world that the latest developments were unsurprising .
" nobody knows if germany is becoming more corrupt because -lrb- these scandals -rrb- are quite normal .
nobody thinks there are problems until major scandals break and grab everyone 's attention , " he said .
middle of the table transparency international 's own corruption perceptions table for 2003 actually shows that germany is not particularly bad by international standards .
the country occupies a middle ranking in the berlin-based watchdog 's rankings , however , the 2004 table may look a little different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international and hansjörg elshorst , chairman transparency international germany .
elshorst -lrb- photo , right , with ti chairman peter eigen -rrb- explained that the exposure of cases like the munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption . " we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " however , he added there was more to be done : " we 've seen an increase in corruption between companies in germany as firms find themselves under more pressure in sectors where there is less business .
to stop this , we need more legislation , heavier punishments and fines to stop this.transparency international will continue to push for these measures .

germany is facing yet another corruption scandal .
after a spectacular munich soccer stadium bribery affair , news that rail company deutsche bahn is under investigation is adding to the country 's tarnished reputation . once upon a time , germany was regarded as a country whose government officials and companies operated with fairness and competence , and whose post-war economy was founded on principles of quality and honesty . until a few years ago , the country 's media had little to say about political or industrial scandals . now , however , the german newspapers are increasingly filled with stories on bribery and corruption . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly no longer has its squeaky clean image of old .
two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club and the nation 's railway company are the latest to make unwanted headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn .
for deutsche bahn , the state-backed rail operator , the trouble stems from alleged illegal payments possibly involving the company 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn , who is currently being investigated for possible corruption by prosecutors in the german city of neuruppin .
according to media reports , deutsche bahn offices across the country , including the company 's headquarters in berlin , were raided by police and officials from the prosecutor 's office on tuesday .
the raids were part of an investigation into a contract between deutsche bahn and the german state of brandenburg signed in 2002 which gives deutsche bahn control of the most lucrative rail lines in the state until 2012 .
the ten-year contract , worth € 1.92 billion -lrb- $ 2.35 billion -rrb- , handed deutsche bahn subsidized passenger services on between 70 and 75 percent of rail lines in the state .
the contract was negotiated by mehdorn and hartmut meyer , who was the transport minister of brandenburg at the time .
less than a year after the contract was signed , meyer surprisingly quit his job at the ministry in september , 2003 after ten years in office .
he has since become an adviser to deutsche bahn . investigators from the public prosecutor 's office are looking into the possibility that the contract was not open to competitive bidding and whether illegal financial incentives were involved in the sealing of the deal .
meyer himself is now under investigation and his home and the office of his consulting firm " short cut " were also included in the sweep on tuesday .
deutsche bahn spokesman werner klingberg rejected the possibility of corruption and said the company was cooperating with the investigation , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on wednesday .
munich soccer corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsv 1860 münich president karl heinz wildmoser resigns .
the deutsche bahn scandal comes hot on the heels of the munich soccer stadium affair .
last week , karl-heinz wildmoser -lrb- photo -rrb- , the president of german soccer club tsv 1860 munich , was arrested on suspicion of taking bribes from a company that won the bid to build the new allianz arena , one of the showcase stadiums for the 2006 world cup finals in germany . wildmoser , his son and two others were accused of involvement in a shadowy exchange of sealed bids for the construction contract for the new arena and of participating in illegal payments for the information .
wildmoser was released on bail on friday and resigned from his position as club president on monday . the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , dr. hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , told dw-world that the latest developments were unsurprising .
" nobody knows if germany is becoming more corrupt because -lrb- these scandals -rrb- are quite normal .
nobody thinks there are problems until major scandals break and grab everyone 's attention , " he said .
middle of the table transparency international 's own corruption perceptions table for 2003 actually shows that germany is not particularly bad by international standards .
the country occupies a middle ranking in the berlin-based watchdog 's rankings , however , the 2004 table may look a little different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international and hansjörg elshorst , chairman transparency international germany .
elshorst -lrb- photo , right , with ti chairman peter eigen -rrb- explained that the exposure of cases like the munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption . " we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " however , he added there was more to be done : " we 've seen an increase in corruption between companies in germany as firms find themselves under more pressure in sectors where there is less business .

the raids were part of an investigation into a contract between deutsche bahn and the german state of brandenburg signed in 2002 which gives deutsche bahn control of the most lucrative rail lines in the state until 2012 .
the ten-year contract , worth € 1.92 billion -lrb- $ 2.35 billion -rrb- , handed deutsche bahn subsidized passenger services on between 70 and 75 percent of rail lines in the state .
the contract was negotiated by mehdorn and hartmut meyer , who was the transport minister of brandenburg at the time .
less than a year after the contract was signed , meyer surprisingly quit his job at the ministry in september , 2003 after ten years in office .
he has since become an adviser to deutsche bahn . investigators from the public prosecutor 's office are looking into the possibility that the contract was not open to competitive bidding and whether illegal financial incentives were involved in the sealing of the deal .
meyer himself is now under investigation and his home and the office of his consulting firm " short cut " were also included in the sweep on tuesday .
deutsche bahn spokesman werner klingberg rejected the possibility of corruption and said the company was cooperating with the investigation , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on wednesday .
munich soccer corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsv 1860 münich president karl heinz wildmoser resigns .
the deutsche bahn scandal comes hot on the heels of the munich soccer stadium affair .
last week , karl-heinz wildmoser -lrb- photo -rrb- , the president of german soccer club tsv 1860 munich , was arrested on suspicion of taking bribes from a company that won the bid to build the new allianz arena , one of the showcase stadiums for the 2006 world cup finals in germany . wildmoser , his son and two others were accused of involvement in a shadowy exchange of sealed bids for the construction contract for the new arena and of participating in illegal payments for the information .
wildmoser was released on bail on friday and resigned from his position as club president on monday . the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , dr. hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , told dw-world that the latest developments were unsurprising .
" nobody knows if germany is becoming more corrupt because -lrb- these scandals -rrb- are quite normal .
nobody thinks there are problems until major scandals break and grab everyone 's attention , " he said .
middle of the table transparency international 's own corruption perceptions table for 2003 actually shows that germany is not particularly bad by international standards .
the country occupies a middle ranking in the berlin-based watchdog 's rankings , however , the 2004 table may look a little different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international and hansjörg elshorst , chairman transparency international germany .
elshorst -lrb- photo , right , with ti chairman peter eigen -rrb- explained that the exposure of cases like the munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption . " we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " however , he added there was more to be done : " we 've seen an increase in corruption between companies in germany as firms find themselves under more pressure in sectors where there is less business .
to stop this , we need more legislation , heavier punishments and fines to stop this.transparency international will continue to push for these measures .

in the wake of the madrid bombings , germany 's gerhard schröder and france 's jacques chirac have vowed to increase anti-terror measures and pledged to stamp out the root causes - including poverty and underdevelopment . meeting at paris ' elysée palace just five days after the deadliest terrorist attacks on european soil in years , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac pledged tuesday to step up security measures without neglecting what causes terror , including inequality in third world countries .
chirac said his country was " not immune from terrorist attacks " and that citizens must remain vigilant and ready to work with partners in the international community " against terrorism in every form . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies next to a destroyed train car after a bomb , exploded in the atocha railway station in madrid .
the leaders called for increased cooperation between police and security agencies in france and germany to defend against the threat of terrorism like thursday 's railroad attacks in madrid that killed more than 200 and injured close to 1,500 .
eliminating the foundations of terror in addition to increased vigilance at the national level and greater cooperation at the international level , schröder and chirac said the roots of terrorism , including poverty in developing nations , must also be fought .
" terrorism can not only be fought with arms and police , " schröder said .
" we must also combat the roots of terrorism . "
conflicts that feed terrorism and the frustration of some peoples must be ended , chirac said , pleading for a " dialogue of cultures . "
he also said he expected anti-terror measures to play an important role at a european union summit planned for next week in brussels .

until march 11 europe 's fight against terror was mainly theoretical .
but since the madrid attacks , anti-terrorism measures have risen to the top of the political agenda as more and more security lapses are revealed . after sept .
11 , 2001 , leaders across europe held up their hands in solidarity and vowed to join forces and fight terrorism .
but two and a half years later , there is little to show from that battle .
" there are european instruments , but they have been poorly utilized ; the ratification of the agreement is slow ; the measures have been inadequately applied or have been misunderstood by security forces and justice offices in the member states . "
the wording is taken from a confidential report on the european union 's anti-terror policy presented just two days before the deadly bombings in madrid , and the conclusion drawn is a frighteningly realistic depiction of the sorry state of the eu 's fight against terror .
especially unsatisfactory is the exchange of information and data between the various european intelligence agencies and among the national police organizations .
although europol serves as a european go-between for cross-border investigations , its responsibilities in the fight against terror have been limited : it is primarily an observer in the fight against terror .
although there are plans for strengthening europol , they will not go into effect until a few years down the road ; and the eu commission will not start researching anti-terror measures and begin examining ways to develop new techniques until 2007 .
in the meantime the calls are getting louder for establishing a definitive european anti-terror authority along the lines of the american homeland security ministry .
during a recent meeting of eu justice ministers , austria proposed creating a european intelligence office similar to the u.s. central intelligence agency .
the initiative fell on deaf ears .
despite the rhetoric , it seems no country is really prepared to give up its sovereignty in the area of security for the sake of a europe-wide anti-terror initiative .
creating central anti-terror organization no one can really say for certain whether or not a central intelligence organization could have prevented the bombings in madrid .
but europe 's own experience with regional terror groups in the 1970s and 1980s lends support to the creation of a cross-border , anti-terror commando .
in order to successfully combat the ira , eta , raf and the red brigade , great britain , spain , germany and italy each developed special units to focus exclusively on the terror threat when the national police force was incapable of doing so .
such a model could be applied to the eu level , especially since the national justice departments with their police offices all too often end their pursuit of criminals at the border .
that should at least change soon .
by june europe will have introduced the eu arrest warrant , allowing police to pursue suspects across national borders .
much more crucial , however , is the development of forge-resistant passports and the ascertaining of biometric data for all visa applicants .
these measures are still in the testing phase .
in terms of infrastructure , the eu must do more to protect its road and rail networks .
the continent 's highways and railroads present an ideal target for terrorists and allow for easy transport of weapons and suspects across borders .
more than a silent tribute recent surveys show that eu citizens expect their political leaders to achieve an 80 percent success rate in the fight against terror .
terrorism and security issues are high on their list of priorities .
the eu , however , is far from such concrete goals .
only after lengthy debate was the bloc able to agree on a common definition of what terrorism actually is .
nonetheless , europe 's leaders have made anti-terror measures and the fight against terror their priority for the next summit .
if one were a cynic , one could say , it 's unfortunate that it took a catastrophe such as the one in madrid to shake the eu out of its stupor and open its eyes to reality .
djerba , casablanca , bali , mombasa , istanbul : the list of warnings was long .
now terror has arrived in europe and this is the last chance to join forces and react , not just with moments of silence , but with real concrete actions . bernd riegert -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security discussions rage across europe european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil .

with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n. with one short speech on monday , spanish prime-minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero made official that his country , long one of washington 's staunchest supporters in the war , is considering withdrawing its forces from iraq .
the prospect of losing a close ally is disquieting for the bush administration , and on monday , u.s. state department spokesman adam ereli said the united states would consider drafting a new united nations resolution aimed at providing the international body with a mandate to send troops to iraq and assuage fears of the incoming spanish government .
" the new -lrb- spanish -rrb- government is just forming .
they 're formulating their policies .
they 'll be taking actions over the next couple of months .
simultaneously , there will be things happening in iraq and in new york , " he said .
but ereli also questioned the need for a new resolution , arguing that the u.n. already has an iraq mandate under a previously approved resolution .
" it has been said that there needs to be a u.n. mandate for those troops , " ereli told reporters .
" we believe there is such a mandate in -lrb- u.n. resolution -rrb- 1511 .
at the same time , we 've also said that , in the context of a transfer of sovereignty on june 30th , a new resolution is possible . "
" the war in iraq was a disaster " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party leader jose rodriguez zapatero on monday , zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- criticized the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , describing the war and occupation as a " disaster , " and threatened to withdraw his troops by june 30 if a multinational u.n. force is not sent to the country .
" the spanish troops in iraq will come home , " zapatero told a spanish radio station .
zapatero 's position represents a 180-degree turn for spain , whose outgoing conservative prime minister , jose maria aznar , and his people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- served as loyal backers of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , even though the majority of spaniards opposed the war .
though zapatero ran his campaign on pledges to withdraw troops , the issue has taken on more urgency in spain this week , with major public outrage following terrorist bombings of commuter trains in madrid that killed 200 and wounded 1,500 .
initially , aznar 's -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar government insisted the basque terrorist organization eta was responsible for the bombings , but recent evidence and arrests have shifted the focus of investigators to islam extremists .
with evidence suggesting eta may not have been part of the attacks after all and that aznar 's government may have manipulated information with an eye on the polls , spaniards turned their backs on the people 's party , instead voting in zapatero and his anti-war platform .
allies : we 're staying put even as spain appears to be preparing to exit iraq , other members of the so-called " coalition of the willing , " have come out quickly with statements offering their steadfast support for the occupation .
great britain , bulgaria , denmark , the czech republic , the ukraine and japan have all said they would maintain their troops in iraq .
if spain pulled out its troops , polish prime minister leszek miller warned , it " would amount to an admission that the terrorists are right and that they are stronger than the whole civilized world . "
the spanish pullout could have serious consequences for poland .
currently , warsaw is in charge of a 9,000-strong military contingent comprising 24 nations in south-central iraq , including spain 's troops .
spain was expected to take control of the contingent in july , but those plans are now in question .
although poland has said it could continue to command the troops , it would create an additional strain for the country .
a domino effect ?
spain 's dramatic shift comes as a major setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq policies .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
observers , including ted galen carpenter of the conservative cato institute in washington , d.c. , said if washington is unable to keep spain from removing its troops , it could lead to a " domino effect " in other countries where governments have supported the war but popular opinion has stood against it . dw staff -lrb- dsl / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain to withdraw troops from iraq fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq .

germany is facing yet another corruption scandal .
after a spectacular munich soccer stadium bribery affair , news that rail company deutsche bahn is under investigation is adding to the country 's tarnished reputation . once upon a time , germany was regarded as a country whose government officials and companies operated with fairness and competence , and whose post-war economy was founded on principles of quality and honesty . until a few years ago , the country 's media had little to say about political or industrial scandals . now , however , the german newspapers are increasingly filled with stories on bribery and corruption . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly no longer has its squeaky clean image of old .
two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club and the nation 's railway company are the latest to make unwanted headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn .
for deutsche bahn , the state-backed rail operator , the trouble stems from alleged illegal payments possibly involving the company 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn , who is currently being investigated for possible corruption by prosecutors in the german city of neuruppin .
according to media reports , deutsche bahn offices across the country , including the company 's headquarters in berlin , were raided by police and officials from the prosecutor 's office on tuesday .
the raids were part of an investigation into a contract between deutsche bahn and the german state of brandenburg signed in 2002 which gives deutsche bahn control of the most lucrative rail lines in the state until 2012 .
the ten-year contract , worth € 1.92 billion -lrb- $ 2.35 billion -rrb- , handed deutsche bahn subsidized passenger services on between 70 and 75 percent of rail lines in the state .
the contract was negotiated by mehdorn and hartmut meyer , who was the transport minister of brandenburg at the time .
less than a year after the contract was signed , meyer surprisingly quit his job at the ministry in september , 2003 after ten years in office .
he has since become an adviser to deutsche bahn . investigators from the public prosecutor 's office are looking into the possibility that the contract was not open to competitive bidding and whether illegal financial incentives were involved in the sealing of the deal .
meyer himself is now under investigation and his home and the office of his consulting firm " short cut " were also included in the sweep on tuesday .
deutsche bahn spokesman werner klingberg rejected the possibility of corruption and said the company was cooperating with the investigation , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on wednesday .
munich soccer corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsv 1860 münich president karl heinz wildmoser resigns .
the deutsche bahn scandal comes hot on the heels of the munich soccer stadium affair .
last week , karl-heinz wildmoser -lrb- photo -rrb- , the president of german soccer club tsv 1860 munich , was arrested on suspicion of taking bribes from a company that won the bid to build the new allianz arena , one of the showcase stadiums for the 2006 world cup finals in germany . wildmoser , his son and two others were accused of involvement in a shadowy exchange of sealed bids for the construction contract for the new arena and of participating in illegal payments for the information .
wildmoser was released on bail on friday and resigned from his position as club president on monday . the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , dr. hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , told dw-world that the latest developments were unsurprising .
" nobody knows if germany is becoming more corrupt because -lrb- these scandals -rrb- are quite normal .
nobody thinks there are problems until major scandals break and grab everyone 's attention , " he said .
middle of the table transparency international 's own corruption perceptions table for 2003 actually shows that germany is not particularly bad by international standards .
the country occupies a middle ranking in the berlin-based watchdog 's rankings , however , the 2004 table may look a little different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international and hansjörg elshorst , chairman transparency international germany .
elshorst -lrb- photo , right , with ti chairman peter eigen -rrb- explained that the exposure of cases like the munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption . " we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " however , he added there was more to be done : " we 've seen an increase in corruption between companies in germany as firms find themselves under more pressure in sectors where there is less business .
to stop this , we need more legislation , heavier punishments and fines to stop this.transparency international will continue to push for these measures .

until march 11 europe 's fight against terror was mainly theoretical .
but since the madrid attacks , anti-terrorism measures have risen to the top of the political agenda as more and more security lapses are revealed . after sept .
11 , 2001 , leaders across europe held up their hands in solidarity and vowed to join forces and fight terrorism .
but two and a half years later , there is little to show from that battle .
" there are european instruments , but they have been poorly utilized ; the ratification of the agreement is slow ; the measures have been inadequately applied or have been misunderstood by security forces and justice offices in the member states . "
the wording is taken from a confidential report on the european union 's anti-terror policy presented just two days before the deadly bombings in madrid , and the conclusion drawn is a frighteningly realistic depiction of the sorry state of the eu 's fight against terror .
especially unsatisfactory is the exchange of information and data between the various european intelligence agencies and among the national police organizations .
although europol serves as a european go-between for cross-border investigations , its responsibilities in the fight against terror have been limited : it is primarily an observer in the fight against terror .
although there are plans for strengthening europol , they will not go into effect until a few years down the road ; and the eu commission will not start researching anti-terror measures and begin examining ways to develop new techniques until 2007 .
in the meantime the calls are getting louder for establishing a definitive european anti-terror authority along the lines of the american homeland security ministry .
during a recent meeting of eu justice ministers , austria proposed creating a european intelligence office similar to the u.s. central intelligence agency .
the initiative fell on deaf ears .
despite the rhetoric , it seems no country is really prepared to give up its sovereignty in the area of security for the sake of a europe-wide anti-terror initiative .
creating central anti-terror organization no one can really say for certain whether or not a central intelligence organization could have prevented the bombings in madrid .

in order to successfully combat the ira , eta , raf and the red brigade , great britain , spain , germany and italy each developed special units to focus exclusively on the terror threat when the national police force was incapable of doing so .

that should at least change soon .
by june europe will have introduced the eu arrest warrant , allowing police to pursue suspects across national borders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.03.2004 u.s. hopes u.n. resolution will keep spain in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish troops may leave by july .
with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n. with one short speech on monday , spanish prime-minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero made official that his country , long one of washington 's staunchest supporters in the war , is considering withdrawing its forces from iraq .
the prospect of losing a close ally is disquieting for the bush administration , and on monday , u.s. state department spokesman adam ereli said the united states would consider drafting a new united nations resolution aimed at providing the international body with a mandate to send troops to iraq and assuage fears of the incoming spanish government .
" the new -lrb- spanish -rrb- government is just forming .
they 're formulating their policies .
they 'll be taking actions over the next couple of months .
simultaneously , there will be things happening in iraq and in new york , " he said .
but ereli also questioned the need for a new resolution , arguing that the u.n. already has an iraq mandate under a previously approved resolution .
" it has been said that there needs to be a u.n. mandate for those troops , " ereli told reporters .
" we believe there is such a mandate in -lrb- u.n. resolution -rrb- 1511 .
at the same time , we 've also said that , in the context of a transfer of sovereignty on june 30th , a new resolution is possible . "
" the war in iraq was a disaster " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party leader jose rodriguez zapatero on monday , zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- criticized the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , describing the war and occupation as a " disaster , " and threatened to withdraw his troops by june 30 if a multinational u.n. force is not sent to the country .
" the spanish troops in iraq will come home , " zapatero told a spanish radio station .
zapatero 's position represents a 180-degree turn for spain , whose outgoing conservative prime minister , jose maria aznar , and his people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- served as loyal backers of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , even though the majority of spaniards opposed the war .
though zapatero ran his campaign on pledges to withdraw troops , the issue has taken on more urgency in spain this week , with major public outrage following terrorist bombings of commuter trains in madrid that killed 200 and wounded 1,500 .
initially , aznar 's -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar government insisted the basque terrorist organization eta was responsible for the bombings , but recent evidence and arrests have shifted the focus of investigators to islam extremists .
with evidence suggesting eta may not have been part of the attacks after all and that aznar 's government may have manipulated information with an eye on the polls , spaniards turned their backs on the people 's party , instead voting in zapatero and his anti-war platform .
allies : we 're staying put even as spain appears to be preparing to exit iraq , other members of the so-called " coalition of the willing , " have come out quickly with statements offering their steadfast support for the occupation .
great britain , bulgaria , denmark , the czech republic , the ukraine and japan have all said they would maintain their troops in iraq .
if spain pulled out its troops , polish prime minister leszek miller warned , it " would amount to an admission that the terrorists are right and that they are stronger than the whole civilized world . "
the spanish pullout could have serious consequences for poland .
currently , warsaw is in charge of a 9,000-strong military contingent comprising 24 nations in south-central iraq , including spain 's troops .
spain was expected to take control of the contingent in july , but those plans are now in question .
although poland has said it could continue to command the troops , it would create an additional strain for the country .
a domino effect ?
spain 's dramatic shift comes as a major setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq policies .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
observers , including ted galen carpenter of the conservative cato institute in washington , d.c. , said if washington is unable to keep spain from removing its troops , it could lead to a " domino effect " in other countries where governments have supported the war but popular opinion has stood against it . dw staff -lrb- dsl / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain to withdraw troops from iraq fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq .

in the wake of the madrid bombings , germany 's gerhard schröder and france 's jacques chirac have vowed to increase anti-terror measures and pledged to stamp out the root causes - including poverty and underdevelopment . meeting at paris ' elysée palace just five days after the deadliest terrorist attacks on european soil in years , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac pledged tuesday to step up security measures without neglecting what causes terror , including inequality in third world countries .
chirac said his country was " not immune from terrorist attacks " and that citizens must remain vigilant and ready to work with partners in the international community " against terrorism in every form . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies next to a destroyed train car after a bomb , exploded in the atocha railway station in madrid .
the leaders called for increased cooperation between police and security agencies in france and germany to defend against the threat of terrorism like thursday 's railroad attacks in madrid that killed more than 200 and injured close to 1,500 .
eliminating the foundations of terror in addition to increased vigilance at the national level and greater cooperation at the international level , schröder and chirac said the roots of terrorism , including poverty in developing nations , must also be fought .
" terrorism can not only be fought with arms and police , " schröder said .
" we must also combat the roots of terrorism . "
conflicts that feed terrorism and the frustration of some peoples must be ended , chirac said , pleading for a " dialogue of cultures . "
he also said he expected anti-terror measures to play an important role at a european union summit planned for next week in brussels .
both berlin and paris have called for a unified european plan against terrorism .
" in the face of the threat , respecting liberties and states based on law and order , europe will protect its citizens , " chirac said .

until march 11 europe 's fight against terror was mainly theoretical .

11 , 2001 , leaders across europe held up their hands in solidarity and vowed to join forces and fight terrorism .
but two and a half years later , there is little to show from that battle .
" there are european instruments , but they have been poorly utilized ; the ratification of the agreement is slow ; the measures have been inadequately applied or have been misunderstood by security forces and justice offices in the member states . "
the wording is taken from a confidential report on the european union 's anti-terror policy presented just two days before the deadly bombings in madrid , and the conclusion drawn is a frighteningly realistic depiction of the sorry state of the eu 's fight against terror .
especially unsatisfactory is the exchange of information and data between the various european intelligence agencies and among the national police organizations .
although europol serves as a european go-between for cross-border investigations , its responsibilities in the fight against terror have been limited : it is primarily an observer in the fight against terror .
although there are plans for strengthening europol , they will not go into effect until a few years down the road ; and the eu commission will not start researching anti-terror measures and begin examining ways to develop new techniques until 2007 .
in the meantime the calls are getting louder for establishing a definitive european anti-terror authority along the lines of the american homeland security ministry .
during a recent meeting of eu justice ministers , austria proposed creating a european intelligence office similar to the u.s. central intelligence agency .
the initiative fell on deaf ears .
despite the rhetoric , it seems no country is really prepared to give up its sovereignty in the area of security for the sake of a europe-wide anti-terror initiative .

with the depressed labor market showing no signs of an upturn , jobless germans are now taking matters into their hands - by seeking their fortunes overseas and turning to self-employment . according to germany 's federal statistical office , around 110,000 germans yearly pack up their bags to work abroad , at least for some time . much of that is a reaction to the country 's persistently high unemployment rate , which hovers around the 11 percent mark .
it 's not just highly-qualified germans , but increasingly also casual laborers and seasonal workers who are looking abroad for jobs . monika varnhagen , director of the bonn-based international employment agency -lrb- zav -rrb- , which helps german construction workers among others to find jobs for limited periods abroad , says that interest among germans in overseas jobs has been on the rise in the past few years .
" on the one hand it certainly has to do with the state of the labor market , but increasingly , many young people want to acquire additional qualifications by having worked abroad , " varnhagen told deutsche welle . she added that the flexibility of the european union had facilitated the rise of the phenomenon .

with the depressed labor market showing no signs of an upturn , jobless germans are now taking matters into their hands - by seeking their fortunes overseas and turning to self-employment . according to germany 's federal statistical office , around 110,000 germans yearly pack up their bags to work abroad , at least for some time . much of that is a reaction to the country 's persistently high unemployment rate , which hovers around the 11 percent mark .

germany is facing yet another corruption scandal .
after a spectacular munich soccer stadium bribery affair , news that rail company deutsche bahn is under investigation is adding to the country 's tarnished reputation . once upon a time , germany was regarded as a country whose government officials and companies operated with fairness and competence , and whose post-war economy was founded on principles of quality and honesty . until a few years ago , the country 's media had little to say about political or industrial scandals . now , however , the german newspapers are increasingly filled with stories on bribery and corruption . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly no longer has its squeaky clean image of old .
two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club and the nation 's railway company are the latest to make unwanted headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn .
for deutsche bahn , the state-backed rail operator , the trouble stems from alleged illegal payments possibly involving the company 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn , who is currently being investigated for possible corruption by prosecutors in the german city of neuruppin .
according to media reports , deutsche bahn offices across the country , including the company 's headquarters in berlin , were raided by police and officials from the prosecutor 's office on tuesday .
the raids were part of an investigation into a contract between deutsche bahn and the german state of brandenburg signed in 2002 which gives deutsche bahn control of the most lucrative rail lines in the state until 2012 .
the ten-year contract , worth € 1.92 billion -lrb- $ 2.35 billion -rrb- , handed deutsche bahn subsidized passenger services on between 70 and 75 percent of rail lines in the state .
the contract was negotiated by mehdorn and hartmut meyer , who was the transport minister of brandenburg at the time .
less than a year after the contract was signed , meyer surprisingly quit his job at the ministry in september , 2003 after ten years in office .
he has since become an adviser to deutsche bahn . investigators from the public prosecutor 's office are looking into the possibility that the contract was not open to competitive bidding and whether illegal financial incentives were involved in the sealing of the deal .
meyer himself is now under investigation and his home and the office of his consulting firm " short cut " were also included in the sweep on tuesday .
deutsche bahn spokesman werner klingberg rejected the possibility of corruption and said the company was cooperating with the investigation , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on wednesday .
munich soccer corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsv 1860 münich president karl heinz wildmoser resigns .
the deutsche bahn scandal comes hot on the heels of the munich soccer stadium affair .
last week , karl-heinz wildmoser -lrb- photo -rrb- , the president of german soccer club tsv 1860 munich , was arrested on suspicion of taking bribes from a company that won the bid to build the new allianz arena , one of the showcase stadiums for the 2006 world cup finals in germany . wildmoser , his son and two others were accused of involvement in a shadowy exchange of sealed bids for the construction contract for the new arena and of participating in illegal payments for the information .
wildmoser was released on bail on friday and resigned from his position as club president on monday . the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , dr. hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , told dw-world that the latest developments were unsurprising .
" nobody knows if germany is becoming more corrupt because -lrb- these scandals -rrb- are quite normal .
nobody thinks there are problems until major scandals break and grab everyone 's attention , " he said .
middle of the table transparency international 's own corruption perceptions table for 2003 actually shows that germany is not particularly bad by international standards .
the country occupies a middle ranking in the berlin-based watchdog 's rankings , however , the 2004 table may look a little different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international and hansjörg elshorst , chairman transparency international germany .
elshorst -lrb- photo , right , with ti chairman peter eigen -rrb- explained that the exposure of cases like the munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption . " we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " however , he added there was more to be done : " we 've seen an increase in corruption between companies in germany as firms find themselves under more pressure in sectors where there is less business .
to stop this , we need more legislation , heavier punishments and fines to stop this.transparency international will continue to push for these measures .

two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club and the nation 's railway company are the latest to make unwanted headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn .
for deutsche bahn , the state-backed rail operator , the trouble stems from alleged illegal payments possibly involving the company 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn , who is currently being investigated for possible corruption by prosecutors in the german city of neuruppin .
according to media reports , deutsche bahn offices across the country , including the company 's headquarters in berlin , were raided by police and officials from the prosecutor 's office on tuesday .
the raids were part of an investigation into a contract between deutsche bahn and the german state of brandenburg signed in 2002 which gives deutsche bahn control of the most lucrative rail lines in the state until 2012 .
the ten-year contract , worth € 1.92 billion -lrb- $ 2.35 billion -rrb- , handed deutsche bahn subsidized passenger services on between 70 and 75 percent of rail lines in the state .
the contract was negotiated by mehdorn and hartmut meyer , who was the transport minister of brandenburg at the time .
less than a year after the contract was signed , meyer surprisingly quit his job at the ministry in september , 2003 after ten years in office .
he has since become an adviser to deutsche bahn . investigators from the public prosecutor 's office are looking into the possibility that the contract was not open to competitive bidding and whether illegal financial incentives were involved in the sealing of the deal .
meyer himself is now under investigation and his home and the office of his consulting firm " short cut " were also included in the sweep on tuesday .
deutsche bahn spokesman werner klingberg rejected the possibility of corruption and said the company was cooperating with the investigation , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on wednesday .
munich soccer corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsv 1860 münich president karl heinz wildmoser resigns .
the deutsche bahn scandal comes hot on the heels of the munich soccer stadium affair .
last week , karl-heinz wildmoser -lrb- photo -rrb- , the president of german soccer club tsv 1860 munich , was arrested on suspicion of taking bribes from a company that won the bid to build the new allianz arena , one of the showcase stadiums for the 2006 world cup finals in germany . wildmoser , his son and two others were accused of involvement in a shadowy exchange of sealed bids for the construction contract for the new arena and of participating in illegal payments for the information .
wildmoser was released on bail on friday and resigned from his position as club president on monday . the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , dr. hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , told dw-world that the latest developments were unsurprising .
" nobody knows if germany is becoming more corrupt because -lrb- these scandals -rrb- are quite normal .
nobody thinks there are problems until major scandals break and grab everyone 's attention , " he said .
middle of the table transparency international 's own corruption perceptions table for 2003 actually shows that germany is not particularly bad by international standards .
the country occupies a middle ranking in the berlin-based watchdog 's rankings , however , the 2004 table may look a little different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international and hansjörg elshorst , chairman transparency international germany .
elshorst -lrb- photo , right , with ti chairman peter eigen -rrb- explained that the exposure of cases like the munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption . " we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " however , he added there was more to be done : " we 've seen an increase in corruption between companies in germany as firms find themselves under more pressure in sectors where there is less business .
to stop this , we need more legislation , heavier punishments and fines to stop this.transparency international will continue to push for these measures .

in the wake of the madrid bombings , germany 's gerhard schröder and france 's jacques chirac have vowed to increase anti-terror measures and pledged to stamp out the root causes - including poverty and underdevelopment . meeting at paris ' elysée palace just five days after the deadliest terrorist attacks on european soil in years , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac pledged tuesday to step up security measures without neglecting what causes terror , including inequality in third world countries .
chirac said his country was " not immune from terrorist attacks " and that citizens must remain vigilant and ready to work with partners in the international community " against terrorism in every form . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies next to a destroyed train car after a bomb , exploded in the atocha railway station in madrid .
the leaders called for increased cooperation between police and security agencies in france and germany to defend against the threat of terrorism like thursday 's railroad attacks in madrid that killed more than 200 and injured close to 1,500 .
eliminating the foundations of terror in addition to increased vigilance at the national level and greater cooperation at the international level , schröder and chirac said the roots of terrorism , including poverty in developing nations , must also be fought .
" terrorism can not only be fought with arms and police , " schröder said .
" we must also combat the roots of terrorism . "
conflicts that feed terrorism and the frustration of some peoples must be ended , chirac said , pleading for a " dialogue of cultures . "
he also said he expected anti-terror measures to play an important role at a european union summit planned for next week in brussels .
both berlin and paris have called for a unified european plan against terrorism .
" in the face of the threat , respecting liberties and states based on law and order , europe will protect its citizens , " chirac said .
" this obligation will be at the heart of the work of the next european council . "
the first eu-level talks on terrorism are expected friday at a special meeting in brussels of interior ministers , who are expected to do preparatory work for a meeting of foreign ministers the following week .

schröder said he viewed statements from spanish prime-minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero that his country would drop its objections over the double majority voting outlined in the draft constitution as a sign of hope that a deal is near .
a shift in the spanish position would leave poland alone in its opposition of the current constitution text .

until march 11 europe 's fight against terror was mainly theoretical .
but since the madrid attacks , anti-terrorism measures have risen to the top of the political agenda as more and more security lapses are revealed . after sept .
11 , 2001 , leaders across europe held up their hands in solidarity and vowed to join forces and fight terrorism .
but two and a half years later , there is little to show from that battle .
" there are european instruments , but they have been poorly utilized ; the ratification of the agreement is slow ; the measures have been inadequately applied or have been misunderstood by security forces and justice offices in the member states . "
the wording is taken from a confidential report on the european union 's anti-terror policy presented just two days before the deadly bombings in madrid , and the conclusion drawn is a frighteningly realistic depiction of the sorry state of the eu 's fight against terror .
especially unsatisfactory is the exchange of information and data between the various european intelligence agencies and among the national police organizations .
although europol serves as a european go-between for cross-border investigations , its responsibilities in the fight against terror have been limited : it is primarily an observer in the fight against terror .
although there are plans for strengthening europol , they will not go into effect until a few years down the road ; and the eu commission will not start researching anti-terror measures and begin examining ways to develop new techniques until 2007 .
in the meantime the calls are getting louder for establishing a definitive european anti-terror authority along the lines of the american homeland security ministry .
during a recent meeting of eu justice ministers , austria proposed creating a european intelligence office similar to the u.s. central intelligence agency .
the initiative fell on deaf ears .
despite the rhetoric , it seems no country is really prepared to give up its sovereignty in the area of security for the sake of a europe-wide anti-terror initiative .
creating central anti-terror organization no one can really say for certain whether or not a central intelligence organization could have prevented the bombings in madrid .
but europe 's own experience with regional terror groups in the 1970s and 1980s lends support to the creation of a cross-border , anti-terror commando .
in order to successfully combat the ira , eta , raf and the red brigade , great britain , spain , germany and italy each developed special units to focus exclusively on the terror threat when the national police force was incapable of doing so .
such a model could be applied to the eu level , especially since the national justice departments with their police offices all too often end their pursuit of criminals at the border .
that should at least change soon .
by june europe will have introduced the eu arrest warrant , allowing police to pursue suspects across national borders .
much more crucial , however , is the development of forge-resistant passports and the ascertaining of biometric data for all visa applicants .
these measures are still in the testing phase .
in terms of infrastructure , the eu must do more to protect its road and rail networks .
the continent 's highways and railroads present an ideal target for terrorists and allow for easy transport of weapons and suspects across borders .
more than a silent tribute recent surveys show that eu citizens expect their political leaders to achieve an 80 percent success rate in the fight against terror .
terrorism and security issues are high on their list of priorities .
the eu , however , is far from such concrete goals .
only after lengthy debate was the bloc able to agree on a common definition of what terrorism actually is .
nonetheless , europe 's leaders have made anti-terror measures and the fight against terror their priority for the next summit .
if one were a cynic , one could say , it 's unfortunate that it took a catastrophe such as the one in madrid to shake the eu out of its stupor and open its eyes to reality .
djerba , casablanca , bali , mombasa , istanbul : the list of warnings was long .
now terror has arrived in europe and this is the last chance to join forces and react , not just with moments of silence , but with real concrete actions . bernd riegert -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security discussions rage across europe european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil .

with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n. with one short speech on monday , spanish prime-minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero made official that his country , long one of washington 's staunchest supporters in the war , is considering withdrawing its forces from iraq .
the prospect of losing a close ally is disquieting for the bush administration , and on monday , u.s. state department spokesman adam ereli said the united states would consider drafting a new united nations resolution aimed at providing the international body with a mandate to send troops to iraq and assuage fears of the incoming spanish government .
" the new -lrb- spanish -rrb- government is just forming .
they 're formulating their policies .
they 'll be taking actions over the next couple of months .
simultaneously , there will be things happening in iraq and in new york , " he said .
but ereli also questioned the need for a new resolution , arguing that the u.n. already has an iraq mandate under a previously approved resolution .
" it has been said that there needs to be a u.n. mandate for those troops , " ereli told reporters .
" we believe there is such a mandate in -lrb- u.n. resolution -rrb- 1511 .
at the same time , we 've also said that , in the context of a transfer of sovereignty on june 30th , a new resolution is possible . "
" the war in iraq was a disaster " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party leader jose rodriguez zapatero on monday , zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- criticized the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , describing the war and occupation as a " disaster , " and threatened to withdraw his troops by june 30 if a multinational u.n. force is not sent to the country .
" the spanish troops in iraq will come home , " zapatero told a spanish radio station .
zapatero 's position represents a 180-degree turn for spain , whose outgoing conservative prime minister , jose maria aznar , and his people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- served as loyal backers of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , even though the majority of spaniards opposed the war .
though zapatero ran his campaign on pledges to withdraw troops , the issue has taken on more urgency in spain this week , with major public outrage following terrorist bombings of commuter trains in madrid that killed 200 and wounded 1,500 .
initially , aznar 's -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar government insisted the basque terrorist organization eta was responsible for the bombings , but recent evidence and arrests have shifted the focus of investigators to islam extremists .
with evidence suggesting eta may not have been part of the attacks after all and that aznar 's government may have manipulated information with an eye on the polls , spaniards turned their backs on the people 's party , instead voting in zapatero and his anti-war platform .
allies : we 're staying put even as spain appears to be preparing to exit iraq , other members of the so-called " coalition of the willing , " have come out quickly with statements offering their steadfast support for the occupation .
great britain , bulgaria , denmark , the czech republic , the ukraine and japan have all said they would maintain their troops in iraq .
if spain pulled out its troops , polish prime minister leszek miller warned , it " would amount to an admission that the terrorists are right and that they are stronger than the whole civilized world . "
the spanish pullout could have serious consequences for poland .
currently , warsaw is in charge of a 9,000-strong military contingent comprising 24 nations in south-central iraq , including spain 's troops .
spain was expected to take control of the contingent in july , but those plans are now in question .
although poland has said it could continue to command the troops , it would create an additional strain for the country .
a domino effect ?
spain 's dramatic shift comes as a major setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq policies .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
observers , including ted galen carpenter of the conservative cato institute in washington , d.c. , said if washington is unable to keep spain from removing its troops , it could lead to a " domino effect " in other countries where governments have supported the war but popular opinion has stood against it . dw staff -lrb- dsl / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain to withdraw troops from iraq fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq .

with the depressed labor market showing no signs of an upturn , jobless germans are now taking matters into their hands - by seeking their fortunes overseas and turning to self-employment . according to germany 's federal statistical office , around 110,000 germans yearly pack up their bags to work abroad , at least for some time . much of that is a reaction to the country 's persistently high unemployment rate , which hovers around the 11 percent mark .
it 's not just highly-qualified germans , but increasingly also casual laborers and seasonal workers who are looking abroad for jobs . monika varnhagen , director of the bonn-based international employment agency -lrb- zav -rrb- , which helps german construction workers among others to find jobs for limited periods abroad , says that interest among germans in overseas jobs has been on the rise in the past few years .
" on the one hand it certainly has to do with the state of the labor market , but increasingly , many young people want to acquire additional qualifications by having worked abroad , " varnhagen told deutsche welle . she added that the flexibility of the european union had facilitated the rise of the phenomenon .
" the european labor market is open and thus offers chances to gain qualifications for those interested , " varnhagen said . looking for jobs beyond europe but jobseekers are n't stopping at the eu 's borders in their quest for work .
in the past 10 years , the zav has helped around 60,000 germans find employment all over the world . zav spokeswoman sabine seidler said that the agency started special programs in the face of increased willingness among germans to try their luck further away from the european continent .
" for instance we find jobs for teachers in specific subjects , like in the u.s. state of texas , where they have a great demand for teachers of german or other subjects , but ca n't fulfill that need locally , " seidler explained . canada , too , is a coveted destination for german jobseekers according to seidler , in particular for recent university graduates interested in an internship overseas . the zav 's initiatives like the " young workers exchange program " has sparked much interest in regions where high unemployment prevails , so much so that local job centers in smaller towns and cities have also begun to finance language courses in addition to helping german jobseekers with the move to a foreign country . being your own boss looking overseas for work is n't the only way germany 's long-term unemployed have found of dragging themselves out of the job market misery .
a study released by the german state-owned credit bank kfw in frankfurt on monday concluded that an increasing number of jobless germans are taking the plunge into self-employment and setting up their own businesses . every fourth person opting for self-employment last year , from a total of 1.6 million germans , was registered as jobless prior to the move , according to the study .
in former communist east germany , where unemployment is highest , every second entrepreneur was unemployed . the kfw study also pointed out that the number of people who decided to go it alone with the help of the " ich-ag " -lrb- me incorporated -rrb- scheme - a labor market reform introduced by the government which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own businesses - had doubled within a year to 249,800 . the trend has led to a lowering of the start-up capital , the study said .
about 40 percent of the newly self-employed needed a maximum of € 1,000 to start their business , while every tenth person who set up shop required more than € 50,000 .

germany is facing yet another corruption scandal .
after a spectacular munich soccer stadium bribery affair , news that rail company deutsche bahn is under investigation is adding to the country 's tarnished reputation . once upon a time , germany was regarded as a country whose government officials and companies operated with fairness and competence , and whose post-war economy was founded on principles of quality and honesty . until a few years ago , the country 's media had little to say about political or industrial scandals . now , however , the german newspapers are increasingly filled with stories on bribery and corruption . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly no longer has its squeaky clean image of old .
two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club and the nation 's railway company are the latest to make unwanted headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn .
for deutsche bahn , the state-backed rail operator , the trouble stems from alleged illegal payments possibly involving the company 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn , who is currently being investigated for possible corruption by prosecutors in the german city of neuruppin .
according to media reports , deutsche bahn offices across the country , including the company 's headquarters in berlin , were raided by police and officials from the prosecutor 's office on tuesday .
the raids were part of an investigation into a contract between deutsche bahn and the german state of brandenburg signed in 2002 which gives deutsche bahn control of the most lucrative rail lines in the state until 2012 .
the ten-year contract , worth € 1.92 billion -lrb- $ 2.35 billion -rrb- , handed deutsche bahn subsidized passenger services on between 70 and 75 percent of rail lines in the state .
the contract was negotiated by mehdorn and hartmut meyer , who was the transport minister of brandenburg at the time .
less than a year after the contract was signed , meyer surprisingly quit his job at the ministry in september , 2003 after ten years in office .
he has since become an adviser to deutsche bahn . investigators from the public prosecutor 's office are looking into the possibility that the contract was not open to competitive bidding and whether illegal financial incentives were involved in the sealing of the deal .
meyer himself is now under investigation and his home and the office of his consulting firm " short cut " were also included in the sweep on tuesday .
deutsche bahn spokesman werner klingberg rejected the possibility of corruption and said the company was cooperating with the investigation , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on wednesday .
munich soccer corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsv 1860 münich president karl heinz wildmoser resigns .
the deutsche bahn scandal comes hot on the heels of the munich soccer stadium affair .
last week , karl-heinz wildmoser -lrb- photo -rrb- , the president of german soccer club tsv 1860 munich , was arrested on suspicion of taking bribes from a company that won the bid to build the new allianz arena , one of the showcase stadiums for the 2006 world cup finals in germany . wildmoser , his son and two others were accused of involvement in a shadowy exchange of sealed bids for the construction contract for the new arena and of participating in illegal payments for the information .
wildmoser was released on bail on friday and resigned from his position as club president on monday . the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , dr. hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , told dw-world that the latest developments were unsurprising .
" nobody knows if germany is becoming more corrupt because -lrb- these scandals -rrb- are quite normal .
nobody thinks there are problems until major scandals break and grab everyone 's attention , " he said .
middle of the table transparency international 's own corruption perceptions table for 2003 actually shows that germany is not particularly bad by international standards .
the country occupies a middle ranking in the berlin-based watchdog 's rankings , however , the 2004 table may look a little different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international and hansjörg elshorst , chairman transparency international germany .
elshorst -lrb- photo , right , with ti chairman peter eigen -rrb- explained that the exposure of cases like the munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption . " we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " however , he added there was more to be done : " we 've seen an increase in corruption between companies in germany as firms find themselves under more pressure in sectors where there is less business .
to stop this , we need more legislation , heavier punishments and fines to stop this.transparency international will continue to push for these measures .

with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n. with one short speech on monday , spanish prime-minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero made official that his country , long one of washington 's staunchest supporters in the war , is considering withdrawing its forces from iraq .
the prospect of losing a close ally is disquieting for the bush administration , and on monday , u.s. state department spokesman adam ereli said the united states would consider drafting a new united nations resolution aimed at providing the international body with a mandate to send troops to iraq and assuage fears of the incoming spanish government .
" the new -lrb- spanish -rrb- government is just forming .
they 're formulating their policies .
they 'll be taking actions over the next couple of months .
simultaneously , there will be things happening in iraq and in new york , " he said .
but ereli also questioned the need for a new resolution , arguing that the u.n. already has an iraq mandate under a previously approved resolution .
" it has been said that there needs to be a u.n. mandate for those troops , " ereli told reporters .
" we believe there is such a mandate in -lrb- u.n. resolution -rrb- 1511 .
at the same time , we 've also said that , in the context of a transfer of sovereignty on june 30th , a new resolution is possible . "
" the war in iraq was a disaster " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party leader jose rodriguez zapatero on monday , zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- criticized the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , describing the war and occupation as a " disaster , " and threatened to withdraw his troops by june 30 if a multinational u.n. force is not sent to the country .
" the spanish troops in iraq will come home , " zapatero told a spanish radio station .
zapatero 's position represents a 180-degree turn for spain , whose outgoing conservative prime minister , jose maria aznar , and his people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- served as loyal backers of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , even though the majority of spaniards opposed the war .
though zapatero ran his campaign on pledges to withdraw troops , the issue has taken on more urgency in spain this week , with major public outrage following terrorist bombings of commuter trains in madrid that killed 200 and wounded 1,500 .
initially , aznar 's -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar government insisted the basque terrorist organization eta was responsible for the bombings , but recent evidence and arrests have shifted the focus of investigators to islam extremists .
with evidence suggesting eta may not have been part of the attacks after all and that aznar 's government may have manipulated information with an eye on the polls , spaniards turned their backs on the people 's party , instead voting in zapatero and his anti-war platform .
allies : we 're staying put even as spain appears to be preparing to exit iraq , other members of the so-called " coalition of the willing , " have come out quickly with statements offering their steadfast support for the occupation .
great britain , bulgaria , denmark , the czech republic , the ukraine and japan have all said they would maintain their troops in iraq .
if spain pulled out its troops , polish prime minister leszek miller warned , it " would amount to an admission that the terrorists are right and that they are stronger than the whole civilized world . "
the spanish pullout could have serious consequences for poland .
currently , warsaw is in charge of a 9,000-strong military contingent comprising 24 nations in south-central iraq , including spain 's troops .
spain was expected to take control of the contingent in july , but those plans are now in question .
although poland has said it could continue to command the troops , it would create an additional strain for the country .
a domino effect ?
spain 's dramatic shift comes as a major setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq policies .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
observers , including ted galen carpenter of the conservative cato institute in washington , d.c. , said if washington is unable to keep spain from removing its troops , it could lead to a " domino effect " in other countries where governments have supported the war but popular opinion has stood against it . dw staff -lrb- dsl / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain to withdraw troops from iraq fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq .

zapatero 's position represents a 180-degree turn for spain , whose outgoing conservative prime minister , jose maria aznar , and his people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- served as loyal backers of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , even though the majority of spaniards opposed the war .
though zapatero ran his campaign on pledges to withdraw troops , the issue has taken on more urgency in spain this week , with major public outrage following terrorist bombings of commuter trains in madrid that killed 200 and wounded 1,500 .
initially , aznar 's -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar government insisted the basque terrorist organization eta was responsible for the bombings , but recent evidence and arrests have shifted the focus of investigators to islam extremists .
with evidence suggesting eta may not have been part of the attacks after all and that aznar 's government may have manipulated information with an eye on the polls , spaniards turned their backs on the people 's party , instead voting in zapatero and his anti-war platform .
allies : we 're staying put even as spain appears to be preparing to exit iraq , other members of the so-called " coalition of the willing , " have come out quickly with statements offering their steadfast support for the occupation .
great britain , bulgaria , denmark , the czech republic , the ukraine and japan have all said they would maintain their troops in iraq .
if spain pulled out its troops , polish prime minister leszek miller warned , it " would amount to an admission that the terrorists are right and that they are stronger than the whole civilized world . "
the spanish pullout could have serious consequences for poland .
currently , warsaw is in charge of a 9,000-strong military contingent comprising 24 nations in south-central iraq , including spain 's troops .
spain was expected to take control of the contingent in july , but those plans are now in question .
although poland has said it could continue to command the troops , it would create an additional strain for the country .
a domino effect ?
spain 's dramatic shift comes as a major setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq policies .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
observers , including ted galen carpenter of the conservative cato institute in washington , d.c. , said if washington is unable to keep spain from removing its troops , it could lead to a " domino effect " in other countries where governments have supported the war but popular opinion has stood against it . dw staff -lrb- dsl / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain to withdraw troops from iraq fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq .

with the depressed labor market showing no signs of an upturn , jobless germans are now taking matters into their hands - by seeking their fortunes overseas and turning to self-employment . according to germany 's federal statistical office , around 110,000 germans yearly pack up their bags to work abroad , at least for some time . much of that is a reaction to the country 's persistently high unemployment rate , which hovers around the 11 percent mark .
it 's not just highly-qualified germans , but increasingly also casual laborers and seasonal workers who are looking abroad for jobs . monika varnhagen , director of the bonn-based international employment agency -lrb- zav -rrb- , which helps german construction workers among others to find jobs for limited periods abroad , says that interest among germans in overseas jobs has been on the rise in the past few years .
" on the one hand it certainly has to do with the state of the labor market , but increasingly , many young people want to acquire additional qualifications by having worked abroad , " varnhagen told deutsche welle . she added that the flexibility of the european union had facilitated the rise of the phenomenon .
" the european labor market is open and thus offers chances to gain qualifications for those interested , " varnhagen said . looking for jobs beyond europe but jobseekers are n't stopping at the eu 's borders in their quest for work .
in the past 10 years , the zav has helped around 60,000 germans find employment all over the world . zav spokeswoman sabine seidler said that the agency started special programs in the face of increased willingness among germans to try their luck further away from the european continent .
" for instance we find jobs for teachers in specific subjects , like in the u.s. state of texas , where they have a great demand for teachers of german or other subjects , but ca n't fulfill that need locally , " seidler explained . canada , too , is a coveted destination for german jobseekers according to seidler , in particular for recent university graduates interested in an internship overseas . the zav 's initiatives like the " young workers exchange program " has sparked much interest in regions where high unemployment prevails , so much so that local job centers in smaller towns and cities have also begun to finance language courses in addition to helping german jobseekers with the move to a foreign country . being your own boss looking overseas for work is n't the only way germany 's long-term unemployed have found of dragging themselves out of the job market misery .
a study released by the german state-owned credit bank kfw in frankfurt on monday concluded that an increasing number of jobless germans are taking the plunge into self-employment and setting up their own businesses . every fourth person opting for self-employment last year , from a total of 1.6 million germans , was registered as jobless prior to the move , according to the study .
in former communist east germany , where unemployment is highest , every second entrepreneur was unemployed . the kfw study also pointed out that the number of people who decided to go it alone with the help of the " ich-ag " -lrb- me incorporated -rrb- scheme - a labor market reform introduced by the government which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own businesses - had doubled within a year to 249,800 . the trend has led to a lowering of the start-up capital , the study said .
about 40 percent of the newly self-employed needed a maximum of € 1,000 to start their business , while every tenth person who set up shop required more than € 50,000 . " an interesting alternative " most independent start-ups are in the service industry , followed by the retail and car-repair sectors . hans reich , head of kfw 's supervisory board told a press conference that the numbers prove people are learning to make the best out of a dire situation .

in former communist east germany , where unemployment is highest , every second entrepreneur was unemployed . the kfw study also pointed out that the number of people who decided to go it alone with the help of the " ich-ag " -lrb- me incorporated -rrb- scheme - a labor market reform introduced by the government which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own businesses - had doubled within a year to 249,800 . the trend has led to a lowering of the start-up capital , the study said .

with the depressed labor market showing no signs of an upturn , jobless germans are now taking matters into their hands - by seeking their fortunes overseas and turning to self-employment . according to germany 's federal statistical office , around 110,000 germans yearly pack up their bags to work abroad , at least for some time . much of that is a reaction to the country 's persistently high unemployment rate , which hovers around the 11 percent mark .
it 's not just highly-qualified germans , but increasingly also casual laborers and seasonal workers who are looking abroad for jobs . monika varnhagen , director of the bonn-based international employment agency -lrb- zav -rrb- , which helps german construction workers among others to find jobs for limited periods abroad , says that interest among germans in overseas jobs has been on the rise in the past few years .
" on the one hand it certainly has to do with the state of the labor market , but increasingly , many young people want to acquire additional qualifications by having worked abroad , " varnhagen told deutsche welle . she added that the flexibility of the european union had facilitated the rise of the phenomenon .
" the european labor market is open and thus offers chances to gain qualifications for those interested , " varnhagen said . looking for jobs beyond europe but jobseekers are n't stopping at the eu 's borders in their quest for work .
in the past 10 years , the zav has helped around 60,000 germans find employment all over the world . zav spokeswoman sabine seidler said that the agency started special programs in the face of increased willingness among germans to try their luck further away from the european continent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.03.2004 opinion : while brussels slept großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe needs more than moments of silence for the victims of terror .
until march 11 europe 's fight against terror was mainly theoretical .
but since the madrid attacks , anti-terrorism measures have risen to the top of the political agenda as more and more security lapses are revealed . after sept .
11 , 2001 , leaders across europe held up their hands in solidarity and vowed to join forces and fight terrorism .
but two and a half years later , there is little to show from that battle .
" there are european instruments , but they have been poorly utilized ; the ratification of the agreement is slow ; the measures have been inadequately applied or have been misunderstood by security forces and justice offices in the member states . "
the wording is taken from a confidential report on the european union 's anti-terror policy presented just two days before the deadly bombings in madrid , and the conclusion drawn is a frighteningly realistic depiction of the sorry state of the eu 's fight against terror .
especially unsatisfactory is the exchange of information and data between the various european intelligence agencies and among the national police organizations .
although europol serves as a european go-between for cross-border investigations , its responsibilities in the fight against terror have been limited : it is primarily an observer in the fight against terror .
although there are plans for strengthening europol , they will not go into effect until a few years down the road ; and the eu commission will not start researching anti-terror measures and begin examining ways to develop new techniques until 2007 .
in the meantime the calls are getting louder for establishing a definitive european anti-terror authority along the lines of the american homeland security ministry .
during a recent meeting of eu justice ministers , austria proposed creating a european intelligence office similar to the u.s. central intelligence agency .
the initiative fell on deaf ears .
despite the rhetoric , it seems no country is really prepared to give up its sovereignty in the area of security for the sake of a europe-wide anti-terror initiative .
creating central anti-terror organization no one can really say for certain whether or not a central intelligence organization could have prevented the bombings in madrid .
but europe 's own experience with regional terror groups in the 1970s and 1980s lends support to the creation of a cross-border , anti-terror commando .
in order to successfully combat the ira , eta , raf and the red brigade , great britain , spain , germany and italy each developed special units to focus exclusively on the terror threat when the national police force was incapable of doing so .
such a model could be applied to the eu level , especially since the national justice departments with their police offices all too often end their pursuit of criminals at the border .
that should at least change soon .
by june europe will have introduced the eu arrest warrant , allowing police to pursue suspects across national borders .
much more crucial , however , is the development of forge-resistant passports and the ascertaining of biometric data for all visa applicants .
these measures are still in the testing phase .
in terms of infrastructure , the eu must do more to protect its road and rail networks .
the continent 's highways and railroads present an ideal target for terrorists and allow for easy transport of weapons and suspects across borders .
more than a silent tribute recent surveys show that eu citizens expect their political leaders to achieve an 80 percent success rate in the fight against terror .
terrorism and security issues are high on their list of priorities .
the eu , however , is far from such concrete goals .
only after lengthy debate was the bloc able to agree on a common definition of what terrorism actually is .
nonetheless , europe 's leaders have made anti-terror measures and the fight against terror their priority for the next summit .
if one were a cynic , one could say , it 's unfortunate that it took a catastrophe such as the one in madrid to shake the eu out of its stupor and open its eyes to reality .
djerba , casablanca , bali , mombasa , istanbul : the list of warnings was long .
now terror has arrived in europe and this is the last chance to join forces and react , not just with moments of silence , but with real concrete actions . bernd riegert -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security discussions rage across europe european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil .

11 , 2001 , leaders across europe held up their hands in solidarity and vowed to join forces and fight terrorism .
but two and a half years later , there is little to show from that battle .
" there are european instruments , but they have been poorly utilized ; the ratification of the agreement is slow ; the measures have been inadequately applied or have been misunderstood by security forces and justice offices in the member states . "
the wording is taken from a confidential report on the european union 's anti-terror policy presented just two days before the deadly bombings in madrid , and the conclusion drawn is a frighteningly realistic depiction of the sorry state of the eu 's fight against terror .
especially unsatisfactory is the exchange of information and data between the various european intelligence agencies and among the national police organizations .
although europol serves as a european go-between for cross-border investigations , its responsibilities in the fight against terror have been limited : it is primarily an observer in the fight against terror .
although there are plans for strengthening europol , they will not go into effect until a few years down the road ; and the eu commission will not start researching anti-terror measures and begin examining ways to develop new techniques until 2007 .
in the meantime the calls are getting louder for establishing a definitive european anti-terror authority along the lines of the american homeland security ministry .
during a recent meeting of eu justice ministers , austria proposed creating a european intelligence office similar to the u.s. central intelligence agency .
the initiative fell on deaf ears .
despite the rhetoric , it seems no country is really prepared to give up its sovereignty in the area of security for the sake of a europe-wide anti-terror initiative .
creating central anti-terror organization no one can really say for certain whether or not a central intelligence organization could have prevented the bombings in madrid .
but europe 's own experience with regional terror groups in the 1970s and 1980s lends support to the creation of a cross-border , anti-terror commando .
in order to successfully combat the ira , eta , raf and the red brigade , great britain , spain , germany and italy each developed special units to focus exclusively on the terror threat when the national police force was incapable of doing so .
such a model could be applied to the eu level , especially since the national justice departments with their police offices all too often end their pursuit of criminals at the border .
that should at least change soon .
by june europe will have introduced the eu arrest warrant , allowing police to pursue suspects across national borders .
much more crucial , however , is the development of forge-resistant passports and the ascertaining of biometric data for all visa applicants .
these measures are still in the testing phase .
in terms of infrastructure , the eu must do more to protect its road and rail networks .
the continent 's highways and railroads present an ideal target for terrorists and allow for easy transport of weapons and suspects across borders .
more than a silent tribute recent surveys show that eu citizens expect their political leaders to achieve an 80 percent success rate in the fight against terror .
terrorism and security issues are high on their list of priorities .
the eu , however , is far from such concrete goals .
only after lengthy debate was the bloc able to agree on a common definition of what terrorism actually is .
nonetheless , europe 's leaders have made anti-terror measures and the fight against terror their priority for the next summit .
if one were a cynic , one could say , it 's unfortunate that it took a catastrophe such as the one in madrid to shake the eu out of its stupor and open its eyes to reality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.03.2004 opinion : while brussels slept großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe needs more than moments of silence for the victims of terror .
until march 11 europe 's fight against terror was mainly theoretical .
but since the madrid attacks , anti-terrorism measures have risen to the top of the political agenda as more and more security lapses are revealed . after sept .
11 , 2001 , leaders across europe held up their hands in solidarity and vowed to join forces and fight terrorism .
but two and a half years later , there is little to show from that battle .
" there are european instruments , but they have been poorly utilized ; the ratification of the agreement is slow ; the measures have been inadequately applied or have been misunderstood by security forces and justice offices in the member states . "
the wording is taken from a confidential report on the european union 's anti-terror policy presented just two days before the deadly bombings in madrid , and the conclusion drawn is a frighteningly realistic depiction of the sorry state of the eu 's fight against terror .
especially unsatisfactory is the exchange of information and data between the various european intelligence agencies and among the national police organizations .
although europol serves as a european go-between for cross-border investigations , its responsibilities in the fight against terror have been limited : it is primarily an observer in the fight against terror .
although there are plans for strengthening europol , they will not go into effect until a few years down the road ; and the eu commission will not start researching anti-terror measures and begin examining ways to develop new techniques until 2007 .
in the meantime the calls are getting louder for establishing a definitive european anti-terror authority along the lines of the american homeland security ministry .
during a recent meeting of eu justice ministers , austria proposed creating a european intelligence office similar to the u.s. central intelligence agency .
the initiative fell on deaf ears .
despite the rhetoric , it seems no country is really prepared to give up its sovereignty in the area of security for the sake of a europe-wide anti-terror initiative .
creating central anti-terror organization no one can really say for certain whether or not a central intelligence organization could have prevented the bombings in madrid .
but europe 's own experience with regional terror groups in the 1970s and 1980s lends support to the creation of a cross-border , anti-terror commando .
in order to successfully combat the ira , eta , raf and the red brigade , great britain , spain , germany and italy each developed special units to focus exclusively on the terror threat when the national police force was incapable of doing so .
such a model could be applied to the eu level , especially since the national justice departments with their police offices all too often end their pursuit of criminals at the border .
that should at least change soon .
by june europe will have introduced the eu arrest warrant , allowing police to pursue suspects across national borders .
much more crucial , however , is the development of forge-resistant passports and the ascertaining of biometric data for all visa applicants .
these measures are still in the testing phase .
in terms of infrastructure , the eu must do more to protect its road and rail networks .
the continent 's highways and railroads present an ideal target for terrorists and allow for easy transport of weapons and suspects across borders .
more than a silent tribute recent surveys show that eu citizens expect their political leaders to achieve an 80 percent success rate in the fight against terror .
terrorism and security issues are high on their list of priorities .
the eu , however , is far from such concrete goals .
only after lengthy debate was the bloc able to agree on a common definition of what terrorism actually is .
nonetheless , europe 's leaders have made anti-terror measures and the fight against terror their priority for the next summit .
if one were a cynic , one could say , it 's unfortunate that it took a catastrophe such as the one in madrid to shake the eu out of its stupor and open its eyes to reality .
djerba , casablanca , bali , mombasa , istanbul : the list of warnings was long .
now terror has arrived in europe and this is the last chance to join forces and react , not just with moments of silence , but with real concrete actions . bernd riegert -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security discussions rage across europe european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil .
-lrb- march 15 , k 2004 -rrb- terror " getting closer " to germany german politicians have called for increased security at the nation 's train stations in the wake of thursday 's attacks in madrid .
government officials meanwhile rejected this , saying enough security was already in place .

in the wake of the madrid bombings , germany 's gerhard schröder and france 's jacques chirac have vowed to increase anti-terror measures and pledged to stamp out the root causes - including poverty and underdevelopment . meeting at paris ' elysée palace just five days after the deadliest terrorist attacks on european soil in years , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac pledged tuesday to step up security measures without neglecting what causes terror , including inequality in third world countries .
chirac said his country was " not immune from terrorist attacks " and that citizens must remain vigilant and ready to work with partners in the international community " against terrorism in every form . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies next to a destroyed train car after a bomb , exploded in the atocha railway station in madrid .
the leaders called for increased cooperation between police and security agencies in france and germany to defend against the threat of terrorism like thursday 's railroad attacks in madrid that killed more than 200 and injured close to 1,500 .
eliminating the foundations of terror in addition to increased vigilance at the national level and greater cooperation at the international level , schröder and chirac said the roots of terrorism , including poverty in developing nations , must also be fought .
" terrorism can not only be fought with arms and police , " schröder said .
" we must also combat the roots of terrorism . "
conflicts that feed terrorism and the frustration of some peoples must be ended , chirac said , pleading for a " dialogue of cultures . "
he also said he expected anti-terror measures to play an important role at a european union summit planned for next week in brussels .
both berlin and paris have called for a unified european plan against terrorism .
" in the face of the threat , respecting liberties and states based on law and order , europe will protect its citizens , " chirac said .

a shift in the spanish position would leave poland alone in its opposition of the current constitution text .

in the wake of the madrid bombings , germany 's gerhard schröder and france 's jacques chirac have vowed to increase anti-terror measures and pledged to stamp out the root causes - including poverty and underdevelopment . meeting at paris ' elysée palace just five days after the deadliest terrorist attacks on european soil in years , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac pledged tuesday to step up security measures without neglecting what causes terror , including inequality in third world countries .
chirac said his country was " not immune from terrorist attacks " and that citizens must remain vigilant and ready to work with partners in the international community " against terrorism in every form . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies next to a destroyed train car after a bomb , exploded in the atocha railway station in madrid .
the leaders called for increased cooperation between police and security agencies in france and germany to defend against the threat of terrorism like thursday 's railroad attacks in madrid that killed more than 200 and injured close to 1,500 .
eliminating the foundations of terror in addition to increased vigilance at the national level and greater cooperation at the international level , schröder and chirac said the roots of terrorism , including poverty in developing nations , must also be fought .
" terrorism can not only be fought with arms and police , " schröder said .
" we must also combat the roots of terrorism . "
conflicts that feed terrorism and the frustration of some peoples must be ended , chirac said , pleading for a " dialogue of cultures . "
he also said he expected anti-terror measures to play an important role at a european union summit planned for next week in brussels .
both berlin and paris have called for a unified european plan against terrorism .
" in the face of the threat , respecting liberties and states based on law and order , europe will protect its citizens , " chirac said .
" this obligation will be at the heart of the work of the next european council . "
the first eu-level talks on terrorism are expected friday at a special meeting in brussels of interior ministers , who are expected to do preparatory work for a meeting of foreign ministers the following week .
movement on constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pictured is a draft copy of the european constitution which was presented by convention president valery giscard d 'estaing during the eu summit at the porto carras resort in greece , friday june 20 , 2003 .
eu leaders will discuss friday a draft of a constitution that aims to streamline decision making and create a post of european president and foreign minister .
-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- on a separate issue , the two leaders discussed the stalled negotiations over the draft of an eu constitution .
schröder said he viewed statements from spanish prime-minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero that his country would drop its objections over the double majority voting outlined in the draft constitution as a sign of hope that a deal is near .
a shift in the spanish position would leave poland alone in its opposition of the current constitution text .
chirac said negotiations would likely be completed by the end of the year , with schröder suggesting a deal could be reached before the irish eu presidency ends its term in june . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. hopes u.n. resolution will keep spain in iraq with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n.

with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n. with one short speech on monday , spanish prime-minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero made official that his country , long one of washington 's staunchest supporters in the war , is considering withdrawing its forces from iraq .
the prospect of losing a close ally is disquieting for the bush administration , and on monday , u.s. state department spokesman adam ereli said the united states would consider drafting a new united nations resolution aimed at providing the international body with a mandate to send troops to iraq and assuage fears of the incoming spanish government .
" the new -lrb- spanish -rrb- government is just forming .
they 're formulating their policies .
they 'll be taking actions over the next couple of months .
simultaneously , there will be things happening in iraq and in new york , " he said .
but ereli also questioned the need for a new resolution , arguing that the u.n. already has an iraq mandate under a previously approved resolution .
" it has been said that there needs to be a u.n. mandate for those troops , " ereli told reporters .
" we believe there is such a mandate in -lrb- u.n. resolution -rrb- 1511 .
at the same time , we 've also said that , in the context of a transfer of sovereignty on june 30th , a new resolution is possible . "
" the war in iraq was a disaster " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party leader jose rodriguez zapatero on monday , zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- criticized the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , describing the war and occupation as a " disaster , " and threatened to withdraw his troops by june 30 if a multinational u.n. force is not sent to the country .
" the spanish troops in iraq will come home , " zapatero told a spanish radio station .
zapatero 's position represents a 180-degree turn for spain , whose outgoing conservative prime minister , jose maria aznar , and his people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- served as loyal backers of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , even though the majority of spaniards opposed the war .
though zapatero ran his campaign on pledges to withdraw troops , the issue has taken on more urgency in spain this week , with major public outrage following terrorist bombings of commuter trains in madrid that killed 200 and wounded 1,500 .
initially , aznar 's -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar government insisted the basque terrorist organization eta was responsible for the bombings , but recent evidence and arrests have shifted the focus of investigators to islam extremists .
with evidence suggesting eta may not have been part of the attacks after all and that aznar 's government may have manipulated information with an eye on the polls , spaniards turned their backs on the people 's party , instead voting in zapatero and his anti-war platform .
allies : we 're staying put even as spain appears to be preparing to exit iraq , other members of the so-called " coalition of the willing , " have come out quickly with statements offering their steadfast support for the occupation .
great britain , bulgaria , denmark , the czech republic , the ukraine and japan have all said they would maintain their troops in iraq .
if spain pulled out its troops , polish prime minister leszek miller warned , it " would amount to an admission that the terrorists are right and that they are stronger than the whole civilized world . "
the spanish pullout could have serious consequences for poland .
currently , warsaw is in charge of a 9,000-strong military contingent comprising 24 nations in south-central iraq , including spain 's troops .
spain was expected to take control of the contingent in july , but those plans are now in question .
although poland has said it could continue to command the troops , it would create an additional strain for the country .
a domino effect ?
spain 's dramatic shift comes as a major setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq policies .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
observers , including ted galen carpenter of the conservative cato institute in washington , d.c. , said if washington is unable to keep spain from removing its troops , it could lead to a " domino effect " in other countries where governments have supported the war but popular opinion has stood against it . dw staff -lrb- dsl / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain to withdraw troops from iraq fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq .

with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n. with one short speech on monday , spanish prime-minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero made official that his country , long one of washington 's staunchest supporters in the war , is considering withdrawing its forces from iraq .
the prospect of losing a close ally is disquieting for the bush administration , and on monday , u.s. state department spokesman adam ereli said the united states would consider drafting a new united nations resolution aimed at providing the international body with a mandate to send troops to iraq and assuage fears of the incoming spanish government .
" the new -lrb- spanish -rrb- government is just forming .
they 're formulating their policies .
they 'll be taking actions over the next couple of months .
simultaneously , there will be things happening in iraq and in new york , " he said .
but ereli also questioned the need for a new resolution , arguing that the u.n. already has an iraq mandate under a previously approved resolution .
" it has been said that there needs to be a u.n. mandate for those troops , " ereli told reporters .
" we believe there is such a mandate in -lrb- u.n. resolution -rrb- 1511 .
at the same time , we 've also said that , in the context of a transfer of sovereignty on june 30th , a new resolution is possible . "
" the war in iraq was a disaster " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party leader jose rodriguez zapatero on monday , zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- criticized the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , describing the war and occupation as a " disaster , " and threatened to withdraw his troops by june 30 if a multinational u.n. force is not sent to the country .
" the spanish troops in iraq will come home , " zapatero told a spanish radio station .
zapatero 's position represents a 180-degree turn for spain , whose outgoing conservative prime minister , jose maria aznar , and his people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- served as loyal backers of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , even though the majority of spaniards opposed the war .
though zapatero ran his campaign on pledges to withdraw troops , the issue has taken on more urgency in spain this week , with major public outrage following terrorist bombings of commuter trains in madrid that killed 200 and wounded 1,500 .
initially , aznar 's -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar government insisted the basque terrorist organization eta was responsible for the bombings , but recent evidence and arrests have shifted the focus of investigators to islam extremists .
with evidence suggesting eta may not have been part of the attacks after all and that aznar 's government may have manipulated information with an eye on the polls , spaniards turned their backs on the people 's party , instead voting in zapatero and his anti-war platform .
allies : we 're staying put even as spain appears to be preparing to exit iraq , other members of the so-called " coalition of the willing , " have come out quickly with statements offering their steadfast support for the occupation .
great britain , bulgaria , denmark , the czech republic , the ukraine and japan have all said they would maintain their troops in iraq .
if spain pulled out its troops , polish prime minister leszek miller warned , it " would amount to an admission that the terrorists are right and that they are stronger than the whole civilized world . "
the spanish pullout could have serious consequences for poland .
currently , warsaw is in charge of a 9,000-strong military contingent comprising 24 nations in south-central iraq , including spain 's troops .
spain was expected to take control of the contingent in july , but those plans are now in question .
although poland has said it could continue to command the troops , it would create an additional strain for the country .

with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n. with one short speech on monday , spanish prime-minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero made official that his country , long one of washington 's staunchest supporters in the war , is considering withdrawing its forces from iraq .
the prospect of losing a close ally is disquieting for the bush administration , and on monday , u.s. state department spokesman adam ereli said the united states would consider drafting a new united nations resolution aimed at providing the international body with a mandate to send troops to iraq and assuage fears of the incoming spanish government .
" the new -lrb- spanish -rrb- government is just forming .
they 're formulating their policies .
they 'll be taking actions over the next couple of months .
simultaneously , there will be things happening in iraq and in new york , " he said .
but ereli also questioned the need for a new resolution , arguing that the u.n. already has an iraq mandate under a previously approved resolution .
" it has been said that there needs to be a u.n. mandate for those troops , " ereli told reporters .
" we believe there is such a mandate in -lrb- u.n. resolution -rrb- 1511 .
at the same time , we 've also said that , in the context of a transfer of sovereignty on june 30th , a new resolution is possible . "
" the war in iraq was a disaster " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party leader jose rodriguez zapatero on monday , zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- criticized the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , describing the war and occupation as a " disaster , " and threatened to withdraw his troops by june 30 if a multinational u.n. force is not sent to the country .
" the spanish troops in iraq will come home , " zapatero told a spanish radio station .
zapatero 's position represents a 180-degree turn for spain , whose outgoing conservative prime minister , jose maria aznar , and his people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- served as loyal backers of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , even though the majority of spaniards opposed the war .
though zapatero ran his campaign on pledges to withdraw troops , the issue has taken on more urgency in spain this week , with major public outrage following terrorist bombings of commuter trains in madrid that killed 200 and wounded 1,500 .
initially , aznar 's -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar government insisted the basque terrorist organization eta was responsible for the bombings , but recent evidence and arrests have shifted the focus of investigators to islam extremists .
with evidence suggesting eta may not have been part of the attacks after all and that aznar 's government may have manipulated information with an eye on the polls , spaniards turned their backs on the people 's party , instead voting in zapatero and his anti-war platform .
allies : we 're staying put even as spain appears to be preparing to exit iraq , other members of the so-called " coalition of the willing , " have come out quickly with statements offering their steadfast support for the occupation .
great britain , bulgaria , denmark , the czech republic , the ukraine and japan have all said they would maintain their troops in iraq .
if spain pulled out its troops , polish prime minister leszek miller warned , it " would amount to an admission that the terrorists are right and that they are stronger than the whole civilized world . "
the spanish pullout could have serious consequences for poland .
currently , warsaw is in charge of a 9,000-strong military contingent comprising 24 nations in south-central iraq , including spain 's troops .
spain was expected to take control of the contingent in july , but those plans are now in question .
although poland has said it could continue to command the troops , it would create an additional strain for the country .
a domino effect ?
spain 's dramatic shift comes as a major setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq policies .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
observers , including ted galen carpenter of the conservative cato institute in washington , d.c. , said if washington is unable to keep spain from removing its troops , it could lead to a " domino effect " in other countries where governments have supported the war but popular opinion has stood against it . dw staff -lrb- dsl / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain to withdraw troops from iraq fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq .

germany is facing yet another corruption scandal .
after a spectacular munich soccer stadium bribery affair , news that rail company deutsche bahn is under investigation is adding to the country 's tarnished reputation . once upon a time , germany was regarded as a country whose government officials and companies operated with fairness and competence , and whose post-war economy was founded on principles of quality and honesty . until a few years ago , the country 's media had little to say about political or industrial scandals . now , however , the german newspapers are increasingly filled with stories on bribery and corruption . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly no longer has its squeaky clean image of old .
two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club and the nation 's railway company are the latest to make unwanted headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn .
for deutsche bahn , the state-backed rail operator , the trouble stems from alleged illegal payments possibly involving the company 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn , who is currently being investigated for possible corruption by prosecutors in the german city of neuruppin .
according to media reports , deutsche bahn offices across the country , including the company 's headquarters in berlin , were raided by police and officials from the prosecutor 's office on tuesday .
the raids were part of an investigation into a contract between deutsche bahn and the german state of brandenburg signed in 2002 which gives deutsche bahn control of the most lucrative rail lines in the state until 2012 .
the ten-year contract , worth € 1.92 billion -lrb- $ 2.35 billion -rrb- , handed deutsche bahn subsidized passenger services on between 70 and 75 percent of rail lines in the state .
the contract was negotiated by mehdorn and hartmut meyer , who was the transport minister of brandenburg at the time .
less than a year after the contract was signed , meyer surprisingly quit his job at the ministry in september , 2003 after ten years in office .
he has since become an adviser to deutsche bahn . investigators from the public prosecutor 's office are looking into the possibility that the contract was not open to competitive bidding and whether illegal financial incentives were involved in the sealing of the deal .
meyer himself is now under investigation and his home and the office of his consulting firm " short cut " were also included in the sweep on tuesday .
deutsche bahn spokesman werner klingberg rejected the possibility of corruption and said the company was cooperating with the investigation , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on wednesday .

the deutsche bahn scandal comes hot on the heels of the munich soccer stadium affair .
last week , karl-heinz wildmoser -lrb- photo -rrb- , the president of german soccer club tsv 1860 munich , was arrested on suspicion of taking bribes from a company that won the bid to build the new allianz arena , one of the showcase stadiums for the 2006 world cup finals in germany . wildmoser , his son and two others were accused of involvement in a shadowy exchange of sealed bids for the construction contract for the new arena and of participating in illegal payments for the information .
wildmoser was released on bail on friday and resigned from his position as club president on monday . the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , dr. hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , told dw-world that the latest developments were unsurprising .
" nobody knows if germany is becoming more corrupt because -lrb- these scandals -rrb- are quite normal .
nobody thinks there are problems until major scandals break and grab everyone 's attention , " he said .

the country occupies a middle ranking in the berlin-based watchdog 's rankings , however , the 2004 table may look a little different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international and hansjörg elshorst , chairman transparency international germany .

the raids were part of an investigation into a contract between deutsche bahn and the german state of brandenburg signed in 2002 which gives deutsche bahn control of the most lucrative rail lines in the state until 2012 .
the ten-year contract , worth € 1.92 billion -lrb- $ 2.35 billion -rrb- , handed deutsche bahn subsidized passenger services on between 70 and 75 percent of rail lines in the state .
the contract was negotiated by mehdorn and hartmut meyer , who was the transport minister of brandenburg at the time .
less than a year after the contract was signed , meyer surprisingly quit his job at the ministry in september , 2003 after ten years in office .
he has since become an adviser to deutsche bahn . investigators from the public prosecutor 's office are looking into the possibility that the contract was not open to competitive bidding and whether illegal financial incentives were involved in the sealing of the deal .
meyer himself is now under investigation and his home and the office of his consulting firm " short cut " were also included in the sweep on tuesday .
deutsche bahn spokesman werner klingberg rejected the possibility of corruption and said the company was cooperating with the investigation , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on wednesday .

germany is facing yet another corruption scandal .
after a spectacular munich soccer stadium bribery affair , news that rail company deutsche bahn is under investigation is adding to the country 's tarnished reputation . once upon a time , germany was regarded as a country whose government officials and companies operated with fairness and competence , and whose post-war economy was founded on principles of quality and honesty . until a few years ago , the country 's media had little to say about political or industrial scandals . now , however , the german newspapers are increasingly filled with stories on bribery and corruption . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly no longer has its squeaky clean image of old .
two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club and the nation 's railway company are the latest to make unwanted headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn .
for deutsche bahn , the state-backed rail operator , the trouble stems from alleged illegal payments possibly involving the company 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn , who is currently being investigated for possible corruption by prosecutors in the german city of neuruppin .
according to media reports , deutsche bahn offices across the country , including the company 's headquarters in berlin , were raided by police and officials from the prosecutor 's office on tuesday .
the raids were part of an investigation into a contract between deutsche bahn and the german state of brandenburg signed in 2002 which gives deutsche bahn control of the most lucrative rail lines in the state until 2012 .
the ten-year contract , worth € 1.92 billion -lrb- $ 2.35 billion -rrb- , handed deutsche bahn subsidized passenger services on between 70 and 75 percent of rail lines in the state .
the contract was negotiated by mehdorn and hartmut meyer , who was the transport minister of brandenburg at the time .
less than a year after the contract was signed , meyer surprisingly quit his job at the ministry in september , 2003 after ten years in office .
he has since become an adviser to deutsche bahn . investigators from the public prosecutor 's office are looking into the possibility that the contract was not open to competitive bidding and whether illegal financial incentives were involved in the sealing of the deal .
meyer himself is now under investigation and his home and the office of his consulting firm " short cut " were also included in the sweep on tuesday .
deutsche bahn spokesman werner klingberg rejected the possibility of corruption and said the company was cooperating with the investigation , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on wednesday .
munich soccer corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsv 1860 münich president karl heinz wildmoser resigns .
the deutsche bahn scandal comes hot on the heels of the munich soccer stadium affair .
last week , karl-heinz wildmoser -lrb- photo -rrb- , the president of german soccer club tsv 1860 munich , was arrested on suspicion of taking bribes from a company that won the bid to build the new allianz arena , one of the showcase stadiums for the 2006 world cup finals in germany . wildmoser , his son and two others were accused of involvement in a shadowy exchange of sealed bids for the construction contract for the new arena and of participating in illegal payments for the information .
wildmoser was released on bail on friday and resigned from his position as club president on monday . the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , dr. hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , told dw-world that the latest developments were unsurprising .
" nobody knows if germany is becoming more corrupt because -lrb- these scandals -rrb- are quite normal .
nobody thinks there are problems until major scandals break and grab everyone 's attention , " he said .

germany is facing yet another corruption scandal .
after a spectacular munich soccer stadium bribery affair , news that rail company deutsche bahn is under investigation is adding to the country 's tarnished reputation . once upon a time , germany was regarded as a country whose government officials and companies operated with fairness and competence , and whose post-war economy was founded on principles of quality and honesty . until a few years ago , the country 's media had little to say about political or industrial scandals . now , however , the german newspapers are increasingly filled with stories on bribery and corruption . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly no longer has its squeaky clean image of old .
two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club and the nation 's railway company are the latest to make unwanted headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn .
for deutsche bahn , the state-backed rail operator , the trouble stems from alleged illegal payments possibly involving the company 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn , who is currently being investigated for possible corruption by prosecutors in the german city of neuruppin .
according to media reports , deutsche bahn offices across the country , including the company 's headquarters in berlin , were raided by police and officials from the prosecutor 's office on tuesday .
the raids were part of an investigation into a contract between deutsche bahn and the german state of brandenburg signed in 2002 which gives deutsche bahn control of the most lucrative rail lines in the state until 2012 .
the ten-year contract , worth € 1.92 billion -lrb- $ 2.35 billion -rrb- , handed deutsche bahn subsidized passenger services on between 70 and 75 percent of rail lines in the state .
the contract was negotiated by mehdorn and hartmut meyer , who was the transport minister of brandenburg at the time .
less than a year after the contract was signed , meyer surprisingly quit his job at the ministry in september , 2003 after ten years in office .
he has since become an adviser to deutsche bahn . investigators from the public prosecutor 's office are looking into the possibility that the contract was not open to competitive bidding and whether illegal financial incentives were involved in the sealing of the deal .
meyer himself is now under investigation and his home and the office of his consulting firm " short cut " were also included in the sweep on tuesday .
deutsche bahn spokesman werner klingberg rejected the possibility of corruption and said the company was cooperating with the investigation , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on wednesday .
munich soccer corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsv 1860 münich president karl heinz wildmoser resigns .
the deutsche bahn scandal comes hot on the heels of the munich soccer stadium affair .
last week , karl-heinz wildmoser -lrb- photo -rrb- , the president of german soccer club tsv 1860 munich , was arrested on suspicion of taking bribes from a company that won the bid to build the new allianz arena , one of the showcase stadiums for the 2006 world cup finals in germany . wildmoser , his son and two others were accused of involvement in a shadowy exchange of sealed bids for the construction contract for the new arena and of participating in illegal payments for the information .
wildmoser was released on bail on friday and resigned from his position as club president on monday . the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , dr. hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , told dw-world that the latest developments were unsurprising .
" nobody knows if germany is becoming more corrupt because -lrb- these scandals -rrb- are quite normal .
nobody thinks there are problems until major scandals break and grab everyone 's attention , " he said .
middle of the table transparency international 's own corruption perceptions table for 2003 actually shows that germany is not particularly bad by international standards .
the country occupies a middle ranking in the berlin-based watchdog 's rankings , however , the 2004 table may look a little different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international and hansjörg elshorst , chairman transparency international germany .
elshorst -lrb- photo , right , with ti chairman peter eigen -rrb- explained that the exposure of cases like the munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption . " we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .

with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n. with one short speech on monday , spanish prime-minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero made official that his country , long one of washington 's staunchest supporters in the war , is considering withdrawing its forces from iraq .
the prospect of losing a close ally is disquieting for the bush administration , and on monday , u.s. state department spokesman adam ereli said the united states would consider drafting a new united nations resolution aimed at providing the international body with a mandate to send troops to iraq and assuage fears of the incoming spanish government .
" the new -lrb- spanish -rrb- government is just forming .
they 're formulating their policies .
they 'll be taking actions over the next couple of months .
simultaneously , there will be things happening in iraq and in new york , " he said .
but ereli also questioned the need for a new resolution , arguing that the u.n. already has an iraq mandate under a previously approved resolution .
" it has been said that there needs to be a u.n. mandate for those troops , " ereli told reporters .
" we believe there is such a mandate in -lrb- u.n. resolution -rrb- 1511 .
at the same time , we 've also said that , in the context of a transfer of sovereignty on june 30th , a new resolution is possible . "
" the war in iraq was a disaster " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party leader jose rodriguez zapatero on monday , zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- criticized the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , describing the war and occupation as a " disaster , " and threatened to withdraw his troops by june 30 if a multinational u.n. force is not sent to the country .
" the spanish troops in iraq will come home , " zapatero told a spanish radio station .
zapatero 's position represents a 180-degree turn for spain , whose outgoing conservative prime minister , jose maria aznar , and his people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- served as loyal backers of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , even though the majority of spaniards opposed the war .
though zapatero ran his campaign on pledges to withdraw troops , the issue has taken on more urgency in spain this week , with major public outrage following terrorist bombings of commuter trains in madrid that killed 200 and wounded 1,500 .
initially , aznar 's -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar government insisted the basque terrorist organization eta was responsible for the bombings , but recent evidence and arrests have shifted the focus of investigators to islam extremists .
with evidence suggesting eta may not have been part of the attacks after all and that aznar 's government may have manipulated information with an eye on the polls , spaniards turned their backs on the people 's party , instead voting in zapatero and his anti-war platform .
allies : we 're staying put even as spain appears to be preparing to exit iraq , other members of the so-called " coalition of the willing , " have come out quickly with statements offering their steadfast support for the occupation .
great britain , bulgaria , denmark , the czech republic , the ukraine and japan have all said they would maintain their troops in iraq .
if spain pulled out its troops , polish prime minister leszek miller warned , it " would amount to an admission that the terrorists are right and that they are stronger than the whole civilized world . "
the spanish pullout could have serious consequences for poland .
currently , warsaw is in charge of a 9,000-strong military contingent comprising 24 nations in south-central iraq , including spain 's troops .
spain was expected to take control of the contingent in july , but those plans are now in question .
although poland has said it could continue to command the troops , it would create an additional strain for the country .
a domino effect ?
spain 's dramatic shift comes as a major setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq policies .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
observers , including ted galen carpenter of the conservative cato institute in washington , d.c. , said if washington is unable to keep spain from removing its troops , it could lead to a " domino effect " in other countries where governments have supported the war but popular opinion has stood against it . dw staff -lrb- dsl / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain to withdraw troops from iraq fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq .

" we believe there is such a mandate in -lrb- u.n. resolution -rrb- 1511 .

" the war in iraq was a disaster " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party leader jose rodriguez zapatero on monday , zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- criticized the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , describing the war and occupation as a " disaster , " and threatened to withdraw his troops by june 30 if a multinational u.n. force is not sent to the country .
" the spanish troops in iraq will come home , " zapatero told a spanish radio station .
zapatero 's position represents a 180-degree turn for spain , whose outgoing conservative prime minister , jose maria aznar , and his people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- served as loyal backers of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , even though the majority of spaniards opposed the war .
though zapatero ran his campaign on pledges to withdraw troops , the issue has taken on more urgency in spain this week , with major public outrage following terrorist bombings of commuter trains in madrid that killed 200 and wounded 1,500 .

germany is facing yet another corruption scandal .
after a spectacular munich soccer stadium bribery affair , news that rail company deutsche bahn is under investigation is adding to the country 's tarnished reputation . once upon a time , germany was regarded as a country whose government officials and companies operated with fairness and competence , and whose post-war economy was founded on principles of quality and honesty . until a few years ago , the country 's media had little to say about political or industrial scandals . now , however , the german newspapers are increasingly filled with stories on bribery and corruption . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly no longer has its squeaky clean image of old .
two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club and the nation 's railway company are the latest to make unwanted headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn .
for deutsche bahn , the state-backed rail operator , the trouble stems from alleged illegal payments possibly involving the company 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn , who is currently being investigated for possible corruption by prosecutors in the german city of neuruppin .
according to media reports , deutsche bahn offices across the country , including the company 's headquarters in berlin , were raided by police and officials from the prosecutor 's office on tuesday .
the raids were part of an investigation into a contract between deutsche bahn and the german state of brandenburg signed in 2002 which gives deutsche bahn control of the most lucrative rail lines in the state until 2012 .
the ten-year contract , worth € 1.92 billion -lrb- $ 2.35 billion -rrb- , handed deutsche bahn subsidized passenger services on between 70 and 75 percent of rail lines in the state .
the contract was negotiated by mehdorn and hartmut meyer , who was the transport minister of brandenburg at the time .
less than a year after the contract was signed , meyer surprisingly quit his job at the ministry in september , 2003 after ten years in office .
he has since become an adviser to deutsche bahn . investigators from the public prosecutor 's office are looking into the possibility that the contract was not open to competitive bidding and whether illegal financial incentives were involved in the sealing of the deal .
meyer himself is now under investigation and his home and the office of his consulting firm " short cut " were also included in the sweep on tuesday .
deutsche bahn spokesman werner klingberg rejected the possibility of corruption and said the company was cooperating with the investigation , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on wednesday .
munich soccer corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsv 1860 münich president karl heinz wildmoser resigns .
the deutsche bahn scandal comes hot on the heels of the munich soccer stadium affair .
last week , karl-heinz wildmoser -lrb- photo -rrb- , the president of german soccer club tsv 1860 munich , was arrested on suspicion of taking bribes from a company that won the bid to build the new allianz arena , one of the showcase stadiums for the 2006 world cup finals in germany . wildmoser , his son and two others were accused of involvement in a shadowy exchange of sealed bids for the construction contract for the new arena and of participating in illegal payments for the information .
wildmoser was released on bail on friday and resigned from his position as club president on monday . the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , dr. hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , told dw-world that the latest developments were unsurprising .
" nobody knows if germany is becoming more corrupt because -lrb- these scandals -rrb- are quite normal .
nobody thinks there are problems until major scandals break and grab everyone 's attention , " he said .

with the depressed labor market showing no signs of an upturn , jobless germans are now taking matters into their hands - by seeking their fortunes overseas and turning to self-employment . according to germany 's federal statistical office , around 110,000 germans yearly pack up their bags to work abroad , at least for some time . much of that is a reaction to the country 's persistently high unemployment rate , which hovers around the 11 percent mark .
it 's not just highly-qualified germans , but increasingly also casual laborers and seasonal workers who are looking abroad for jobs . monika varnhagen , director of the bonn-based international employment agency -lrb- zav -rrb- , which helps german construction workers among others to find jobs for limited periods abroad , says that interest among germans in overseas jobs has been on the rise in the past few years .
" on the one hand it certainly has to do with the state of the labor market , but increasingly , many young people want to acquire additional qualifications by having worked abroad , " varnhagen told deutsche welle . she added that the flexibility of the european union had facilitated the rise of the phenomenon .
" the european labor market is open and thus offers chances to gain qualifications for those interested , " varnhagen said . looking for jobs beyond europe but jobseekers are n't stopping at the eu 's borders in their quest for work .
in the past 10 years , the zav has helped around 60,000 germans find employment all over the world . zav spokeswoman sabine seidler said that the agency started special programs in the face of increased willingness among germans to try their luck further away from the european continent .
" for instance we find jobs for teachers in specific subjects , like in the u.s. state of texas , where they have a great demand for teachers of german or other subjects , but ca n't fulfill that need locally , " seidler explained . canada , too , is a coveted destination for german jobseekers according to seidler , in particular for recent university graduates interested in an internship overseas . the zav 's initiatives like the " young workers exchange program " has sparked much interest in regions where high unemployment prevails , so much so that local job centers in smaller towns and cities have also begun to finance language courses in addition to helping german jobseekers with the move to a foreign country . being your own boss looking overseas for work is n't the only way germany 's long-term unemployed have found of dragging themselves out of the job market misery .
a study released by the german state-owned credit bank kfw in frankfurt on monday concluded that an increasing number of jobless germans are taking the plunge into self-employment and setting up their own businesses . every fourth person opting for self-employment last year , from a total of 1.6 million germans , was registered as jobless prior to the move , according to the study .
in former communist east germany , where unemployment is highest , every second entrepreneur was unemployed . the kfw study also pointed out that the number of people who decided to go it alone with the help of the " ich-ag " -lrb- me incorporated -rrb- scheme - a labor market reform introduced by the government which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own businesses - had doubled within a year to 249,800 . the trend has led to a lowering of the start-up capital , the study said .
about 40 percent of the newly self-employed needed a maximum of € 1,000 to start their business , while every tenth person who set up shop required more than € 50,000 .

about 40 percent of the newly self-employed needed a maximum of € 1,000 to start their business , while every tenth person who set up shop required more than € 50,000 . " an interesting alternative " most independent start-ups are in the service industry , followed by the retail and car-repair sectors . hans reich , head of kfw 's supervisory board told a press conference that the numbers prove people are learning to make the best out of a dire situation .

with the depressed labor market showing no signs of an upturn , jobless germans are now taking matters into their hands - by seeking their fortunes overseas and turning to self-employment . according to germany 's federal statistical office , around 110,000 germans yearly pack up their bags to work abroad , at least for some time . much of that is a reaction to the country 's persistently high unemployment rate , which hovers around the 11 percent mark .
it 's not just highly-qualified germans , but increasingly also casual laborers and seasonal workers who are looking abroad for jobs . monika varnhagen , director of the bonn-based international employment agency -lrb- zav -rrb- , which helps german construction workers among others to find jobs for limited periods abroad , says that interest among germans in overseas jobs has been on the rise in the past few years .
" on the one hand it certainly has to do with the state of the labor market , but increasingly , many young people want to acquire additional qualifications by having worked abroad , " varnhagen told deutsche welle . she added that the flexibility of the european union had facilitated the rise of the phenomenon .
" the european labor market is open and thus offers chances to gain qualifications for those interested , " varnhagen said . looking for jobs beyond europe but jobseekers are n't stopping at the eu 's borders in their quest for work .
in the past 10 years , the zav has helped around 60,000 germans find employment all over the world . zav spokeswoman sabine seidler said that the agency started special programs in the face of increased willingness among germans to try their luck further away from the european continent .
" for instance we find jobs for teachers in specific subjects , like in the u.s. state of texas , where they have a great demand for teachers of german or other subjects , but ca n't fulfill that need locally , " seidler explained . canada , too , is a coveted destination for german jobseekers according to seidler , in particular for recent university graduates interested in an internship overseas . the zav 's initiatives like the " young workers exchange program " has sparked much interest in regions where high unemployment prevails , so much so that local job centers in smaller towns and cities have also begun to finance language courses in addition to helping german jobseekers with the move to a foreign country . being your own boss looking overseas for work is n't the only way germany 's long-term unemployed have found of dragging themselves out of the job market misery .
a study released by the german state-owned credit bank kfw in frankfurt on monday concluded that an increasing number of jobless germans are taking the plunge into self-employment and setting up their own businesses . every fourth person opting for self-employment last year , from a total of 1.6 million germans , was registered as jobless prior to the move , according to the study .

until march 11 europe 's fight against terror was mainly theoretical .
but since the madrid attacks , anti-terrorism measures have risen to the top of the political agenda as more and more security lapses are revealed . after sept .
11 , 2001 , leaders across europe held up their hands in solidarity and vowed to join forces and fight terrorism .
but two and a half years later , there is little to show from that battle .
" there are european instruments , but they have been poorly utilized ; the ratification of the agreement is slow ; the measures have been inadequately applied or have been misunderstood by security forces and justice offices in the member states . "
the wording is taken from a confidential report on the european union 's anti-terror policy presented just two days before the deadly bombings in madrid , and the conclusion drawn is a frighteningly realistic depiction of the sorry state of the eu 's fight against terror .
especially unsatisfactory is the exchange of information and data between the various european intelligence agencies and among the national police organizations .
although europol serves as a european go-between for cross-border investigations , its responsibilities in the fight against terror have been limited : it is primarily an observer in the fight against terror .
although there are plans for strengthening europol , they will not go into effect until a few years down the road ; and the eu commission will not start researching anti-terror measures and begin examining ways to develop new techniques until 2007 .
in the meantime the calls are getting louder for establishing a definitive european anti-terror authority along the lines of the american homeland security ministry .
during a recent meeting of eu justice ministers , austria proposed creating a european intelligence office similar to the u.s. central intelligence agency .
the initiative fell on deaf ears .
despite the rhetoric , it seems no country is really prepared to give up its sovereignty in the area of security for the sake of a europe-wide anti-terror initiative .
creating central anti-terror organization no one can really say for certain whether or not a central intelligence organization could have prevented the bombings in madrid .
but europe 's own experience with regional terror groups in the 1970s and 1980s lends support to the creation of a cross-border , anti-terror commando .
in order to successfully combat the ira , eta , raf and the red brigade , great britain , spain , germany and italy each developed special units to focus exclusively on the terror threat when the national police force was incapable of doing so .
such a model could be applied to the eu level , especially since the national justice departments with their police offices all too often end their pursuit of criminals at the border .
that should at least change soon .
by june europe will have introduced the eu arrest warrant , allowing police to pursue suspects across national borders .
much more crucial , however , is the development of forge-resistant passports and the ascertaining of biometric data for all visa applicants .
these measures are still in the testing phase .
in terms of infrastructure , the eu must do more to protect its road and rail networks .
the continent 's highways and railroads present an ideal target for terrorists and allow for easy transport of weapons and suspects across borders .
more than a silent tribute recent surveys show that eu citizens expect their political leaders to achieve an 80 percent success rate in the fight against terror .
terrorism and security issues are high on their list of priorities .
the eu , however , is far from such concrete goals .
only after lengthy debate was the bloc able to agree on a common definition of what terrorism actually is .
nonetheless , europe 's leaders have made anti-terror measures and the fight against terror their priority for the next summit .
if one were a cynic , one could say , it 's unfortunate that it took a catastrophe such as the one in madrid to shake the eu out of its stupor and open its eyes to reality .
djerba , casablanca , bali , mombasa , istanbul : the list of warnings was long .

until march 11 europe 's fight against terror was mainly theoretical .
but since the madrid attacks , anti-terrorism measures have risen to the top of the political agenda as more and more security lapses are revealed . after sept .
11 , 2001 , leaders across europe held up their hands in solidarity and vowed to join forces and fight terrorism .
but two and a half years later , there is little to show from that battle .
" there are european instruments , but they have been poorly utilized ; the ratification of the agreement is slow ; the measures have been inadequately applied or have been misunderstood by security forces and justice offices in the member states . "
the wording is taken from a confidential report on the european union 's anti-terror policy presented just two days before the deadly bombings in madrid , and the conclusion drawn is a frighteningly realistic depiction of the sorry state of the eu 's fight against terror .
especially unsatisfactory is the exchange of information and data between the various european intelligence agencies and among the national police organizations .
although europol serves as a european go-between for cross-border investigations , its responsibilities in the fight against terror have been limited : it is primarily an observer in the fight against terror .
although there are plans for strengthening europol , they will not go into effect until a few years down the road ; and the eu commission will not start researching anti-terror measures and begin examining ways to develop new techniques until 2007 .
in the meantime the calls are getting louder for establishing a definitive european anti-terror authority along the lines of the american homeland security ministry .
during a recent meeting of eu justice ministers , austria proposed creating a european intelligence office similar to the u.s. central intelligence agency .
the initiative fell on deaf ears .
despite the rhetoric , it seems no country is really prepared to give up its sovereignty in the area of security for the sake of a europe-wide anti-terror initiative .
creating central anti-terror organization no one can really say for certain whether or not a central intelligence organization could have prevented the bombings in madrid .
but europe 's own experience with regional terror groups in the 1970s and 1980s lends support to the creation of a cross-border , anti-terror commando .
in order to successfully combat the ira , eta , raf and the red brigade , great britain , spain , germany and italy each developed special units to focus exclusively on the terror threat when the national police force was incapable of doing so .
such a model could be applied to the eu level , especially since the national justice departments with their police offices all too often end their pursuit of criminals at the border .
that should at least change soon .

in the wake of the madrid bombings , germany 's gerhard schröder and france 's jacques chirac have vowed to increase anti-terror measures and pledged to stamp out the root causes - including poverty and underdevelopment . meeting at paris ' elysée palace just five days after the deadliest terrorist attacks on european soil in years , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac pledged tuesday to step up security measures without neglecting what causes terror , including inequality in third world countries .
chirac said his country was " not immune from terrorist attacks " and that citizens must remain vigilant and ready to work with partners in the international community " against terrorism in every form . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies next to a destroyed train car after a bomb , exploded in the atocha railway station in madrid .
the leaders called for increased cooperation between police and security agencies in france and germany to defend against the threat of terrorism like thursday 's railroad attacks in madrid that killed more than 200 and injured close to 1,500 .
eliminating the foundations of terror in addition to increased vigilance at the national level and greater cooperation at the international level , schröder and chirac said the roots of terrorism , including poverty in developing nations , must also be fought .
" terrorism can not only be fought with arms and police , " schröder said .
" we must also combat the roots of terrorism . "
conflicts that feed terrorism and the frustration of some peoples must be ended , chirac said , pleading for a " dialogue of cultures . "
he also said he expected anti-terror measures to play an important role at a european union summit planned for next week in brussels .
both berlin and paris have called for a unified european plan against terrorism .
" in the face of the threat , respecting liberties and states based on law and order , europe will protect its citizens , " chirac said .
" this obligation will be at the heart of the work of the next european council . "
the first eu-level talks on terrorism are expected friday at a special meeting in brussels of interior ministers , who are expected to do preparatory work for a meeting of foreign ministers the following week .

eu leaders will discuss friday a draft of a constitution that aims to streamline decision making and create a post of european president and foreign minister .
-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- on a separate issue , the two leaders discussed the stalled negotiations over the draft of an eu constitution .
schröder said he viewed statements from spanish prime-minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero that his country would drop its objections over the double majority voting outlined in the draft constitution as a sign of hope that a deal is near .
a shift in the spanish position would leave poland alone in its opposition of the current constitution text .
chirac said negotiations would likely be completed by the end of the year , with schröder suggesting a deal could be reached before the irish eu presidency ends its term in june . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. hopes u.n. resolution will keep spain in iraq with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n.

germany is facing yet another corruption scandal .
after a spectacular munich soccer stadium bribery affair , news that rail company deutsche bahn is under investigation is adding to the country 's tarnished reputation . once upon a time , germany was regarded as a country whose government officials and companies operated with fairness and competence , and whose post-war economy was founded on principles of quality and honesty . until a few years ago , the country 's media had little to say about political or industrial scandals . now , however , the german newspapers are increasingly filled with stories on bribery and corruption . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly no longer has its squeaky clean image of old .
two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club and the nation 's railway company are the latest to make unwanted headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn .
for deutsche bahn , the state-backed rail operator , the trouble stems from alleged illegal payments possibly involving the company 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn , who is currently being investigated for possible corruption by prosecutors in the german city of neuruppin .
according to media reports , deutsche bahn offices across the country , including the company 's headquarters in berlin , were raided by police and officials from the prosecutor 's office on tuesday .
the raids were part of an investigation into a contract between deutsche bahn and the german state of brandenburg signed in 2002 which gives deutsche bahn control of the most lucrative rail lines in the state until 2012 .
the ten-year contract , worth € 1.92 billion -lrb- $ 2.35 billion -rrb- , handed deutsche bahn subsidized passenger services on between 70 and 75 percent of rail lines in the state .
the contract was negotiated by mehdorn and hartmut meyer , who was the transport minister of brandenburg at the time .
less than a year after the contract was signed , meyer surprisingly quit his job at the ministry in september , 2003 after ten years in office .
he has since become an adviser to deutsche bahn . investigators from the public prosecutor 's office are looking into the possibility that the contract was not open to competitive bidding and whether illegal financial incentives were involved in the sealing of the deal .
meyer himself is now under investigation and his home and the office of his consulting firm " short cut " were also included in the sweep on tuesday .
deutsche bahn spokesman werner klingberg rejected the possibility of corruption and said the company was cooperating with the investigation , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on wednesday .
munich soccer corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsv 1860 münich president karl heinz wildmoser resigns .
the deutsche bahn scandal comes hot on the heels of the munich soccer stadium affair .
last week , karl-heinz wildmoser -lrb- photo -rrb- , the president of german soccer club tsv 1860 munich , was arrested on suspicion of taking bribes from a company that won the bid to build the new allianz arena , one of the showcase stadiums for the 2006 world cup finals in germany . wildmoser , his son and two others were accused of involvement in a shadowy exchange of sealed bids for the construction contract for the new arena and of participating in illegal payments for the information .
wildmoser was released on bail on friday and resigned from his position as club president on monday . the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , dr. hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , told dw-world that the latest developments were unsurprising .
" nobody knows if germany is becoming more corrupt because -lrb- these scandals -rrb- are quite normal .
nobody thinks there are problems until major scandals break and grab everyone 's attention , " he said .
middle of the table transparency international 's own corruption perceptions table for 2003 actually shows that germany is not particularly bad by international standards .
the country occupies a middle ranking in the berlin-based watchdog 's rankings , however , the 2004 table may look a little different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international and hansjörg elshorst , chairman transparency international germany .
elshorst -lrb- photo , right , with ti chairman peter eigen -rrb- explained that the exposure of cases like the munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption . " we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " however , he added there was more to be done : " we 've seen an increase in corruption between companies in germany as firms find themselves under more pressure in sectors where there is less business .

germany is facing yet another corruption scandal .
after a spectacular munich soccer stadium bribery affair , news that rail company deutsche bahn is under investigation is adding to the country 's tarnished reputation . once upon a time , germany was regarded as a country whose government officials and companies operated with fairness and competence , and whose post-war economy was founded on principles of quality and honesty . until a few years ago , the country 's media had little to say about political or industrial scandals . now , however , the german newspapers are increasingly filled with stories on bribery and corruption . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly no longer has its squeaky clean image of old .
two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club and the nation 's railway company are the latest to make unwanted headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn .
for deutsche bahn , the state-backed rail operator , the trouble stems from alleged illegal payments possibly involving the company 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn , who is currently being investigated for possible corruption by prosecutors in the german city of neuruppin .
according to media reports , deutsche bahn offices across the country , including the company 's headquarters in berlin , were raided by police and officials from the prosecutor 's office on tuesday .
the raids were part of an investigation into a contract between deutsche bahn and the german state of brandenburg signed in 2002 which gives deutsche bahn control of the most lucrative rail lines in the state until 2012 .
the ten-year contract , worth € 1.92 billion -lrb- $ 2.35 billion -rrb- , handed deutsche bahn subsidized passenger services on between 70 and 75 percent of rail lines in the state .
the contract was negotiated by mehdorn and hartmut meyer , who was the transport minister of brandenburg at the time .
less than a year after the contract was signed , meyer surprisingly quit his job at the ministry in september , 2003 after ten years in office .
he has since become an adviser to deutsche bahn . investigators from the public prosecutor 's office are looking into the possibility that the contract was not open to competitive bidding and whether illegal financial incentives were involved in the sealing of the deal .
meyer himself is now under investigation and his home and the office of his consulting firm " short cut " were also included in the sweep on tuesday .
deutsche bahn spokesman werner klingberg rejected the possibility of corruption and said the company was cooperating with the investigation , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on wednesday .

with the depressed labor market showing no signs of an upturn , jobless germans are now taking matters into their hands - by seeking their fortunes overseas and turning to self-employment . according to germany 's federal statistical office , around 110,000 germans yearly pack up their bags to work abroad , at least for some time . much of that is a reaction to the country 's persistently high unemployment rate , which hovers around the 11 percent mark .
it 's not just highly-qualified germans , but increasingly also casual laborers and seasonal workers who are looking abroad for jobs . monika varnhagen , director of the bonn-based international employment agency -lrb- zav -rrb- , which helps german construction workers among others to find jobs for limited periods abroad , says that interest among germans in overseas jobs has been on the rise in the past few years .
" on the one hand it certainly has to do with the state of the labor market , but increasingly , many young people want to acquire additional qualifications by having worked abroad , " varnhagen told deutsche welle . she added that the flexibility of the european union had facilitated the rise of the phenomenon .
" the european labor market is open and thus offers chances to gain qualifications for those interested , " varnhagen said . looking for jobs beyond europe but jobseekers are n't stopping at the eu 's borders in their quest for work .
in the past 10 years , the zav has helped around 60,000 germans find employment all over the world . zav spokeswoman sabine seidler said that the agency started special programs in the face of increased willingness among germans to try their luck further away from the european continent .
" for instance we find jobs for teachers in specific subjects , like in the u.s. state of texas , where they have a great demand for teachers of german or other subjects , but ca n't fulfill that need locally , " seidler explained . canada , too , is a coveted destination for german jobseekers according to seidler , in particular for recent university graduates interested in an internship overseas . the zav 's initiatives like the " young workers exchange program " has sparked much interest in regions where high unemployment prevails , so much so that local job centers in smaller towns and cities have also begun to finance language courses in addition to helping german jobseekers with the move to a foreign country . being your own boss looking overseas for work is n't the only way germany 's long-term unemployed have found of dragging themselves out of the job market misery .
a study released by the german state-owned credit bank kfw in frankfurt on monday concluded that an increasing number of jobless germans are taking the plunge into self-employment and setting up their own businesses . every fourth person opting for self-employment last year , from a total of 1.6 million germans , was registered as jobless prior to the move , according to the study .
in former communist east germany , where unemployment is highest , every second entrepreneur was unemployed . the kfw study also pointed out that the number of people who decided to go it alone with the help of the " ich-ag " -lrb- me incorporated -rrb- scheme - a labor market reform introduced by the government which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own businesses - had doubled within a year to 249,800 . the trend has led to a lowering of the start-up capital , the study said .
about 40 percent of the newly self-employed needed a maximum of € 1,000 to start their business , while every tenth person who set up shop required more than € 50,000 . " an interesting alternative " most independent start-ups are in the service industry , followed by the retail and car-repair sectors . hans reich , head of kfw 's supervisory board told a press conference that the numbers prove people are learning to make the best out of a dire situation .

" on the one hand it certainly has to do with the state of the labor market , but increasingly , many young people want to acquire additional qualifications by having worked abroad , " varnhagen told deutsche welle . she added that the flexibility of the european union had facilitated the rise of the phenomenon .
" the european labor market is open and thus offers chances to gain qualifications for those interested , " varnhagen said . looking for jobs beyond europe but jobseekers are n't stopping at the eu 's borders in their quest for work .
in the past 10 years , the zav has helped around 60,000 germans find employment all over the world . zav spokeswoman sabine seidler said that the agency started special programs in the face of increased willingness among germans to try their luck further away from the european continent .
" for instance we find jobs for teachers in specific subjects , like in the u.s. state of texas , where they have a great demand for teachers of german or other subjects , but ca n't fulfill that need locally , " seidler explained . canada , too , is a coveted destination for german jobseekers according to seidler , in particular for recent university graduates interested in an internship overseas . the zav 's initiatives like the " young workers exchange program " has sparked much interest in regions where high unemployment prevails , so much so that local job centers in smaller towns and cities have also begun to finance language courses in addition to helping german jobseekers with the move to a foreign country . being your own boss looking overseas for work is n't the only way germany 's long-term unemployed have found of dragging themselves out of the job market misery .
a study released by the german state-owned credit bank kfw in frankfurt on monday concluded that an increasing number of jobless germans are taking the plunge into self-employment and setting up their own businesses . every fourth person opting for self-employment last year , from a total of 1.6 million germans , was registered as jobless prior to the move , according to the study .
in former communist east germany , where unemployment is highest , every second entrepreneur was unemployed . the kfw study also pointed out that the number of people who decided to go it alone with the help of the " ich-ag " -lrb- me incorporated -rrb- scheme - a labor market reform introduced by the government which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own businesses - had doubled within a year to 249,800 . the trend has led to a lowering of the start-up capital , the study said .
about 40 percent of the newly self-employed needed a maximum of € 1,000 to start their business , while every tenth person who set up shop required more than € 50,000 . " an interesting alternative " most independent start-ups are in the service industry , followed by the retail and car-repair sectors . hans reich , head of kfw 's supervisory board told a press conference that the numbers prove people are learning to make the best out of a dire situation .
" despite the difficult economic situation , independence is still an interesting alternative for many people , " reich remarked . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate introducing national minimum wage germany is one of the few european countries which does not have a minimum wage .

with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n. with one short speech on monday , spanish prime-minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero made official that his country , long one of washington 's staunchest supporters in the war , is considering withdrawing its forces from iraq .
the prospect of losing a close ally is disquieting for the bush administration , and on monday , u.s. state department spokesman adam ereli said the united states would consider drafting a new united nations resolution aimed at providing the international body with a mandate to send troops to iraq and assuage fears of the incoming spanish government .
" the new -lrb- spanish -rrb- government is just forming .
they 're formulating their policies .
they 'll be taking actions over the next couple of months .
simultaneously , there will be things happening in iraq and in new york , " he said .
but ereli also questioned the need for a new resolution , arguing that the u.n. already has an iraq mandate under a previously approved resolution .
" it has been said that there needs to be a u.n. mandate for those troops , " ereli told reporters .
" we believe there is such a mandate in -lrb- u.n. resolution -rrb- 1511 .
at the same time , we 've also said that , in the context of a transfer of sovereignty on june 30th , a new resolution is possible . "
" the war in iraq was a disaster " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party leader jose rodriguez zapatero on monday , zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- criticized the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , describing the war and occupation as a " disaster , " and threatened to withdraw his troops by june 30 if a multinational u.n. force is not sent to the country .
" the spanish troops in iraq will come home , " zapatero told a spanish radio station .
zapatero 's position represents a 180-degree turn for spain , whose outgoing conservative prime minister , jose maria aznar , and his people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- served as loyal backers of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , even though the majority of spaniards opposed the war .
though zapatero ran his campaign on pledges to withdraw troops , the issue has taken on more urgency in spain this week , with major public outrage following terrorist bombings of commuter trains in madrid that killed 200 and wounded 1,500 .
initially , aznar 's -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar government insisted the basque terrorist organization eta was responsible for the bombings , but recent evidence and arrests have shifted the focus of investigators to islam extremists .
with evidence suggesting eta may not have been part of the attacks after all and that aznar 's government may have manipulated information with an eye on the polls , spaniards turned their backs on the people 's party , instead voting in zapatero and his anti-war platform .
allies : we 're staying put even as spain appears to be preparing to exit iraq , other members of the so-called " coalition of the willing , " have come out quickly with statements offering their steadfast support for the occupation .
great britain , bulgaria , denmark , the czech republic , the ukraine and japan have all said they would maintain their troops in iraq .
if spain pulled out its troops , polish prime minister leszek miller warned , it " would amount to an admission that the terrorists are right and that they are stronger than the whole civilized world . "
the spanish pullout could have serious consequences for poland .
currently , warsaw is in charge of a 9,000-strong military contingent comprising 24 nations in south-central iraq , including spain 's troops .
spain was expected to take control of the contingent in july , but those plans are now in question .
although poland has said it could continue to command the troops , it would create an additional strain for the country .
a domino effect ?
spain 's dramatic shift comes as a major setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq policies .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
observers , including ted galen carpenter of the conservative cato institute in washington , d.c. , said if washington is unable to keep spain from removing its troops , it could lead to a " domino effect " in other countries where governments have supported the war but popular opinion has stood against it . dw staff -lrb- dsl / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain to withdraw troops from iraq fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq .

with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n. with one short speech on monday , spanish prime-minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero made official that his country , long one of washington 's staunchest supporters in the war , is considering withdrawing its forces from iraq .
the prospect of losing a close ally is disquieting for the bush administration , and on monday , u.s. state department spokesman adam ereli said the united states would consider drafting a new united nations resolution aimed at providing the international body with a mandate to send troops to iraq and assuage fears of the incoming spanish government .
" the new -lrb- spanish -rrb- government is just forming .
they 're formulating their policies .
they 'll be taking actions over the next couple of months .
simultaneously , there will be things happening in iraq and in new york , " he said .
but ereli also questioned the need for a new resolution , arguing that the u.n. already has an iraq mandate under a previously approved resolution .
" it has been said that there needs to be a u.n. mandate for those troops , " ereli told reporters .
" we believe there is such a mandate in -lrb- u.n. resolution -rrb- 1511 .
at the same time , we 've also said that , in the context of a transfer of sovereignty on june 30th , a new resolution is possible . "
" the war in iraq was a disaster " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party leader jose rodriguez zapatero on monday , zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- criticized the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , describing the war and occupation as a " disaster , " and threatened to withdraw his troops by june 30 if a multinational u.n. force is not sent to the country .
" the spanish troops in iraq will come home , " zapatero told a spanish radio station .
zapatero 's position represents a 180-degree turn for spain , whose outgoing conservative prime minister , jose maria aznar , and his people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- served as loyal backers of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , even though the majority of spaniards opposed the war .
though zapatero ran his campaign on pledges to withdraw troops , the issue has taken on more urgency in spain this week , with major public outrage following terrorist bombings of commuter trains in madrid that killed 200 and wounded 1,500 .
initially , aznar 's -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar government insisted the basque terrorist organization eta was responsible for the bombings , but recent evidence and arrests have shifted the focus of investigators to islam extremists .
with evidence suggesting eta may not have been part of the attacks after all and that aznar 's government may have manipulated information with an eye on the polls , spaniards turned their backs on the people 's party , instead voting in zapatero and his anti-war platform .
allies : we 're staying put even as spain appears to be preparing to exit iraq , other members of the so-called " coalition of the willing , " have come out quickly with statements offering their steadfast support for the occupation .
great britain , bulgaria , denmark , the czech republic , the ukraine and japan have all said they would maintain their troops in iraq .
if spain pulled out its troops , polish prime minister leszek miller warned , it " would amount to an admission that the terrorists are right and that they are stronger than the whole civilized world . "
the spanish pullout could have serious consequences for poland .
currently , warsaw is in charge of a 9,000-strong military contingent comprising 24 nations in south-central iraq , including spain 's troops .
spain was expected to take control of the contingent in july , but those plans are now in question .
although poland has said it could continue to command the troops , it would create an additional strain for the country .

germany is facing yet another corruption scandal .
after a spectacular munich soccer stadium bribery affair , news that rail company deutsche bahn is under investigation is adding to the country 's tarnished reputation . once upon a time , germany was regarded as a country whose government officials and companies operated with fairness and competence , and whose post-war economy was founded on principles of quality and honesty . until a few years ago , the country 's media had little to say about political or industrial scandals . now , however , the german newspapers are increasingly filled with stories on bribery and corruption . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly no longer has its squeaky clean image of old .
two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club and the nation 's railway company are the latest to make unwanted headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn .
for deutsche bahn , the state-backed rail operator , the trouble stems from alleged illegal payments possibly involving the company 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn , who is currently being investigated for possible corruption by prosecutors in the german city of neuruppin .
according to media reports , deutsche bahn offices across the country , including the company 's headquarters in berlin , were raided by police and officials from the prosecutor 's office on tuesday .
the raids were part of an investigation into a contract between deutsche bahn and the german state of brandenburg signed in 2002 which gives deutsche bahn control of the most lucrative rail lines in the state until 2012 .
the ten-year contract , worth € 1.92 billion -lrb- $ 2.35 billion -rrb- , handed deutsche bahn subsidized passenger services on between 70 and 75 percent of rail lines in the state .
the contract was negotiated by mehdorn and hartmut meyer , who was the transport minister of brandenburg at the time .
less than a year after the contract was signed , meyer surprisingly quit his job at the ministry in september , 2003 after ten years in office .
he has since become an adviser to deutsche bahn . investigators from the public prosecutor 's office are looking into the possibility that the contract was not open to competitive bidding and whether illegal financial incentives were involved in the sealing of the deal .
meyer himself is now under investigation and his home and the office of his consulting firm " short cut " were also included in the sweep on tuesday .
deutsche bahn spokesman werner klingberg rejected the possibility of corruption and said the company was cooperating with the investigation , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on wednesday .
munich soccer corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsv 1860 münich president karl heinz wildmoser resigns .
the deutsche bahn scandal comes hot on the heels of the munich soccer stadium affair .
last week , karl-heinz wildmoser -lrb- photo -rrb- , the president of german soccer club tsv 1860 munich , was arrested on suspicion of taking bribes from a company that won the bid to build the new allianz arena , one of the showcase stadiums for the 2006 world cup finals in germany . wildmoser , his son and two others were accused of involvement in a shadowy exchange of sealed bids for the construction contract for the new arena and of participating in illegal payments for the information .
wildmoser was released on bail on friday and resigned from his position as club president on monday . the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , dr. hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , told dw-world that the latest developments were unsurprising .
" nobody knows if germany is becoming more corrupt because -lrb- these scandals -rrb- are quite normal .
nobody thinks there are problems until major scandals break and grab everyone 's attention , " he said .
middle of the table transparency international 's own corruption perceptions table for 2003 actually shows that germany is not particularly bad by international standards .
the country occupies a middle ranking in the berlin-based watchdog 's rankings , however , the 2004 table may look a little different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international and hansjörg elshorst , chairman transparency international germany .
elshorst -lrb- photo , right , with ti chairman peter eigen -rrb- explained that the exposure of cases like the munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption . " we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said .

germany is facing yet another corruption scandal .
after a spectacular munich soccer stadium bribery affair , news that rail company deutsche bahn is under investigation is adding to the country 's tarnished reputation . once upon a time , germany was regarded as a country whose government officials and companies operated with fairness and competence , and whose post-war economy was founded on principles of quality and honesty . until a few years ago , the country 's media had little to say about political or industrial scandals . now , however , the german newspapers are increasingly filled with stories on bribery and corruption . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly no longer has its squeaky clean image of old .
two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club and the nation 's railway company are the latest to make unwanted headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn .
for deutsche bahn , the state-backed rail operator , the trouble stems from alleged illegal payments possibly involving the company 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn , who is currently being investigated for possible corruption by prosecutors in the german city of neuruppin .
according to media reports , deutsche bahn offices across the country , including the company 's headquarters in berlin , were raided by police and officials from the prosecutor 's office on tuesday .
the raids were part of an investigation into a contract between deutsche bahn and the german state of brandenburg signed in 2002 which gives deutsche bahn control of the most lucrative rail lines in the state until 2012 .
the ten-year contract , worth € 1.92 billion -lrb- $ 2.35 billion -rrb- , handed deutsche bahn subsidized passenger services on between 70 and 75 percent of rail lines in the state .
the contract was negotiated by mehdorn and hartmut meyer , who was the transport minister of brandenburg at the time .
less than a year after the contract was signed , meyer surprisingly quit his job at the ministry in september , 2003 after ten years in office .
he has since become an adviser to deutsche bahn . investigators from the public prosecutor 's office are looking into the possibility that the contract was not open to competitive bidding and whether illegal financial incentives were involved in the sealing of the deal .
meyer himself is now under investigation and his home and the office of his consulting firm " short cut " were also included in the sweep on tuesday .
deutsche bahn spokesman werner klingberg rejected the possibility of corruption and said the company was cooperating with the investigation , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on wednesday .
munich soccer corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsv 1860 münich president karl heinz wildmoser resigns .
the deutsche bahn scandal comes hot on the heels of the munich soccer stadium affair .
last week , karl-heinz wildmoser -lrb- photo -rrb- , the president of german soccer club tsv 1860 munich , was arrested on suspicion of taking bribes from a company that won the bid to build the new allianz arena , one of the showcase stadiums for the 2006 world cup finals in germany . wildmoser , his son and two others were accused of involvement in a shadowy exchange of sealed bids for the construction contract for the new arena and of participating in illegal payments for the information .
wildmoser was released on bail on friday and resigned from his position as club president on monday . the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , dr. hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , told dw-world that the latest developments were unsurprising .
" nobody knows if germany is becoming more corrupt because -lrb- these scandals -rrb- are quite normal .
nobody thinks there are problems until major scandals break and grab everyone 's attention , " he said .
middle of the table transparency international 's own corruption perceptions table for 2003 actually shows that germany is not particularly bad by international standards .
the country occupies a middle ranking in the berlin-based watchdog 's rankings , however , the 2004 table may look a little different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international and hansjörg elshorst , chairman transparency international germany .
elshorst -lrb- photo , right , with ti chairman peter eigen -rrb- explained that the exposure of cases like the munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption .

" on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .

in the wake of the madrid bombings , germany 's gerhard schröder and france 's jacques chirac have vowed to increase anti-terror measures and pledged to stamp out the root causes - including poverty and underdevelopment . meeting at paris ' elysée palace just five days after the deadliest terrorist attacks on european soil in years , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac pledged tuesday to step up security measures without neglecting what causes terror , including inequality in third world countries .
chirac said his country was " not immune from terrorist attacks " and that citizens must remain vigilant and ready to work with partners in the international community " against terrorism in every form . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies next to a destroyed train car after a bomb , exploded in the atocha railway station in madrid .
the leaders called for increased cooperation between police and security agencies in france and germany to defend against the threat of terrorism like thursday 's railroad attacks in madrid that killed more than 200 and injured close to 1,500 .
eliminating the foundations of terror in addition to increased vigilance at the national level and greater cooperation at the international level , schröder and chirac said the roots of terrorism , including poverty in developing nations , must also be fought .
" terrorism can not only be fought with arms and police , " schröder said .
" we must also combat the roots of terrorism . "
conflicts that feed terrorism and the frustration of some peoples must be ended , chirac said , pleading for a " dialogue of cultures . "
he also said he expected anti-terror measures to play an important role at a european union summit planned for next week in brussels .
both berlin and paris have called for a unified european plan against terrorism .

until march 11 europe 's fight against terror was mainly theoretical .
but since the madrid attacks , anti-terrorism measures have risen to the top of the political agenda as more and more security lapses are revealed . after sept .
11 , 2001 , leaders across europe held up their hands in solidarity and vowed to join forces and fight terrorism .
but two and a half years later , there is little to show from that battle .
" there are european instruments , but they have been poorly utilized ; the ratification of the agreement is slow ; the measures have been inadequately applied or have been misunderstood by security forces and justice offices in the member states . "
the wording is taken from a confidential report on the european union 's anti-terror policy presented just two days before the deadly bombings in madrid , and the conclusion drawn is a frighteningly realistic depiction of the sorry state of the eu 's fight against terror .
especially unsatisfactory is the exchange of information and data between the various european intelligence agencies and among the national police organizations .
although europol serves as a european go-between for cross-border investigations , its responsibilities in the fight against terror have been limited : it is primarily an observer in the fight against terror .
although there are plans for strengthening europol , they will not go into effect until a few years down the road ; and the eu commission will not start researching anti-terror measures and begin examining ways to develop new techniques until 2007 .
in the meantime the calls are getting louder for establishing a definitive european anti-terror authority along the lines of the american homeland security ministry .
during a recent meeting of eu justice ministers , austria proposed creating a european intelligence office similar to the u.s. central intelligence agency .
the initiative fell on deaf ears .
despite the rhetoric , it seems no country is really prepared to give up its sovereignty in the area of security for the sake of a europe-wide anti-terror initiative .
creating central anti-terror organization no one can really say for certain whether or not a central intelligence organization could have prevented the bombings in madrid .
but europe 's own experience with regional terror groups in the 1970s and 1980s lends support to the creation of a cross-border , anti-terror commando .
in order to successfully combat the ira , eta , raf and the red brigade , great britain , spain , germany and italy each developed special units to focus exclusively on the terror threat when the national police force was incapable of doing so .
such a model could be applied to the eu level , especially since the national justice departments with their police offices all too often end their pursuit of criminals at the border .
that should at least change soon .
by june europe will have introduced the eu arrest warrant , allowing police to pursue suspects across national borders .
much more crucial , however , is the development of forge-resistant passports and the ascertaining of biometric data for all visa applicants .
these measures are still in the testing phase .
in terms of infrastructure , the eu must do more to protect its road and rail networks .
the continent 's highways and railroads present an ideal target for terrorists and allow for easy transport of weapons and suspects across borders .
more than a silent tribute recent surveys show that eu citizens expect their political leaders to achieve an 80 percent success rate in the fight against terror .
terrorism and security issues are high on their list of priorities .
the eu , however , is far from such concrete goals .
only after lengthy debate was the bloc able to agree on a common definition of what terrorism actually is .
nonetheless , europe 's leaders have made anti-terror measures and the fight against terror their priority for the next summit .
if one were a cynic , one could say , it 's unfortunate that it took a catastrophe such as the one in madrid to shake the eu out of its stupor and open its eyes to reality .

until march 11 europe 's fight against terror was mainly theoretical .
but since the madrid attacks , anti-terrorism measures have risen to the top of the political agenda as more and more security lapses are revealed . after sept .
11 , 2001 , leaders across europe held up their hands in solidarity and vowed to join forces and fight terrorism .
but two and a half years later , there is little to show from that battle .
" there are european instruments , but they have been poorly utilized ; the ratification of the agreement is slow ; the measures have been inadequately applied or have been misunderstood by security forces and justice offices in the member states . "
the wording is taken from a confidential report on the european union 's anti-terror policy presented just two days before the deadly bombings in madrid , and the conclusion drawn is a frighteningly realistic depiction of the sorry state of the eu 's fight against terror .
especially unsatisfactory is the exchange of information and data between the various european intelligence agencies and among the national police organizations .
although europol serves as a european go-between for cross-border investigations , its responsibilities in the fight against terror have been limited : it is primarily an observer in the fight against terror .
although there are plans for strengthening europol , they will not go into effect until a few years down the road ; and the eu commission will not start researching anti-terror measures and begin examining ways to develop new techniques until 2007 .
in the meantime the calls are getting louder for establishing a definitive european anti-terror authority along the lines of the american homeland security ministry .
during a recent meeting of eu justice ministers , austria proposed creating a european intelligence office similar to the u.s. central intelligence agency .
the initiative fell on deaf ears .
despite the rhetoric , it seems no country is really prepared to give up its sovereignty in the area of security for the sake of a europe-wide anti-terror initiative .
creating central anti-terror organization no one can really say for certain whether or not a central intelligence organization could have prevented the bombings in madrid .
but europe 's own experience with regional terror groups in the 1970s and 1980s lends support to the creation of a cross-border , anti-terror commando .
in order to successfully combat the ira , eta , raf and the red brigade , great britain , spain , germany and italy each developed special units to focus exclusively on the terror threat when the national police force was incapable of doing so .
such a model could be applied to the eu level , especially since the national justice departments with their police offices all too often end their pursuit of criminals at the border .
that should at least change soon .
by june europe will have introduced the eu arrest warrant , allowing police to pursue suspects across national borders .
much more crucial , however , is the development of forge-resistant passports and the ascertaining of biometric data for all visa applicants .
these measures are still in the testing phase .
in terms of infrastructure , the eu must do more to protect its road and rail networks .
the continent 's highways and railroads present an ideal target for terrorists and allow for easy transport of weapons and suspects across borders .
more than a silent tribute recent surveys show that eu citizens expect their political leaders to achieve an 80 percent success rate in the fight against terror .
terrorism and security issues are high on their list of priorities .
the eu , however , is far from such concrete goals .
only after lengthy debate was the bloc able to agree on a common definition of what terrorism actually is .
nonetheless , europe 's leaders have made anti-terror measures and the fight against terror their priority for the next summit .
if one were a cynic , one could say , it 's unfortunate that it took a catastrophe such as the one in madrid to shake the eu out of its stupor and open its eyes to reality .
djerba , casablanca , bali , mombasa , istanbul : the list of warnings was long .

with the depressed labor market showing no signs of an upturn , jobless germans are now taking matters into their hands - by seeking their fortunes overseas and turning to self-employment . according to germany 's federal statistical office , around 110,000 germans yearly pack up their bags to work abroad , at least for some time . much of that is a reaction to the country 's persistently high unemployment rate , which hovers around the 11 percent mark .
it 's not just highly-qualified germans , but increasingly also casual laborers and seasonal workers who are looking abroad for jobs . monika varnhagen , director of the bonn-based international employment agency -lrb- zav -rrb- , which helps german construction workers among others to find jobs for limited periods abroad , says that interest among germans in overseas jobs has been on the rise in the past few years .
" on the one hand it certainly has to do with the state of the labor market , but increasingly , many young people want to acquire additional qualifications by having worked abroad , " varnhagen told deutsche welle . she added that the flexibility of the european union had facilitated the rise of the phenomenon .
" the european labor market is open and thus offers chances to gain qualifications for those interested , " varnhagen said . looking for jobs beyond europe but jobseekers are n't stopping at the eu 's borders in their quest for work .
in the past 10 years , the zav has helped around 60,000 germans find employment all over the world . zav spokeswoman sabine seidler said that the agency started special programs in the face of increased willingness among germans to try their luck further away from the european continent .
" for instance we find jobs for teachers in specific subjects , like in the u.s. state of texas , where they have a great demand for teachers of german or other subjects , but ca n't fulfill that need locally , " seidler explained . canada , too , is a coveted destination for german jobseekers according to seidler , in particular for recent university graduates interested in an internship overseas . the zav 's initiatives like the " young workers exchange program " has sparked much interest in regions where high unemployment prevails , so much so that local job centers in smaller towns and cities have also begun to finance language courses in addition to helping german jobseekers with the move to a foreign country . being your own boss looking overseas for work is n't the only way germany 's long-term unemployed have found of dragging themselves out of the job market misery .
a study released by the german state-owned credit bank kfw in frankfurt on monday concluded that an increasing number of jobless germans are taking the plunge into self-employment and setting up their own businesses . every fourth person opting for self-employment last year , from a total of 1.6 million germans , was registered as jobless prior to the move , according to the study .
in former communist east germany , where unemployment is highest , every second entrepreneur was unemployed . the kfw study also pointed out that the number of people who decided to go it alone with the help of the " ich-ag " -lrb- me incorporated -rrb- scheme - a labor market reform introduced by the government which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own businesses - had doubled within a year to 249,800 . the trend has led to a lowering of the start-up capital , the study said .
about 40 percent of the newly self-employed needed a maximum of € 1,000 to start their business , while every tenth person who set up shop required more than € 50,000 . " an interesting alternative " most independent start-ups are in the service industry , followed by the retail and car-repair sectors . hans reich , head of kfw 's supervisory board told a press conference that the numbers prove people are learning to make the best out of a dire situation .

in the wake of the madrid bombings , germany 's gerhard schröder and france 's jacques chirac have vowed to increase anti-terror measures and pledged to stamp out the root causes - including poverty and underdevelopment . meeting at paris ' elysée palace just five days after the deadliest terrorist attacks on european soil in years , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac pledged tuesday to step up security measures without neglecting what causes terror , including inequality in third world countries .
chirac said his country was " not immune from terrorist attacks " and that citizens must remain vigilant and ready to work with partners in the international community " against terrorism in every form . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies next to a destroyed train car after a bomb , exploded in the atocha railway station in madrid .
the leaders called for increased cooperation between police and security agencies in france and germany to defend against the threat of terrorism like thursday 's railroad attacks in madrid that killed more than 200 and injured close to 1,500 .
eliminating the foundations of terror in addition to increased vigilance at the national level and greater cooperation at the international level , schröder and chirac said the roots of terrorism , including poverty in developing nations , must also be fought .
" terrorism can not only be fought with arms and police , " schröder said .
" we must also combat the roots of terrorism . "
conflicts that feed terrorism and the frustration of some peoples must be ended , chirac said , pleading for a " dialogue of cultures . "
he also said he expected anti-terror measures to play an important role at a european union summit planned for next week in brussels .
both berlin and paris have called for a unified european plan against terrorism .
" in the face of the threat , respecting liberties and states based on law and order , europe will protect its citizens , " chirac said .
" this obligation will be at the heart of the work of the next european council . "
the first eu-level talks on terrorism are expected friday at a special meeting in brussels of interior ministers , who are expected to do preparatory work for a meeting of foreign ministers the following week .

germany is facing yet another corruption scandal .
after a spectacular munich soccer stadium bribery affair , news that rail company deutsche bahn is under investigation is adding to the country 's tarnished reputation . once upon a time , germany was regarded as a country whose government officials and companies operated with fairness and competence , and whose post-war economy was founded on principles of quality and honesty . until a few years ago , the country 's media had little to say about political or industrial scandals . now , however , the german newspapers are increasingly filled with stories on bribery and corruption . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly no longer has its squeaky clean image of old .
two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club and the nation 's railway company are the latest to make unwanted headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn .
for deutsche bahn , the state-backed rail operator , the trouble stems from alleged illegal payments possibly involving the company 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn , who is currently being investigated for possible corruption by prosecutors in the german city of neuruppin .
according to media reports , deutsche bahn offices across the country , including the company 's headquarters in berlin , were raided by police and officials from the prosecutor 's office on tuesday .
the raids were part of an investigation into a contract between deutsche bahn and the german state of brandenburg signed in 2002 which gives deutsche bahn control of the most lucrative rail lines in the state until 2012 .
the ten-year contract , worth € 1.92 billion -lrb- $ 2.35 billion -rrb- , handed deutsche bahn subsidized passenger services on between 70 and 75 percent of rail lines in the state .
the contract was negotiated by mehdorn and hartmut meyer , who was the transport minister of brandenburg at the time .
less than a year after the contract was signed , meyer surprisingly quit his job at the ministry in september , 2003 after ten years in office .
he has since become an adviser to deutsche bahn . investigators from the public prosecutor 's office are looking into the possibility that the contract was not open to competitive bidding and whether illegal financial incentives were involved in the sealing of the deal .
meyer himself is now under investigation and his home and the office of his consulting firm " short cut " were also included in the sweep on tuesday .
deutsche bahn spokesman werner klingberg rejected the possibility of corruption and said the company was cooperating with the investigation , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on wednesday .
munich soccer corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsv 1860 münich president karl heinz wildmoser resigns .
the deutsche bahn scandal comes hot on the heels of the munich soccer stadium affair .
last week , karl-heinz wildmoser -lrb- photo -rrb- , the president of german soccer club tsv 1860 munich , was arrested on suspicion of taking bribes from a company that won the bid to build the new allianz arena , one of the showcase stadiums for the 2006 world cup finals in germany . wildmoser , his son and two others were accused of involvement in a shadowy exchange of sealed bids for the construction contract for the new arena and of participating in illegal payments for the information .
wildmoser was released on bail on friday and resigned from his position as club president on monday . the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , dr. hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , told dw-world that the latest developments were unsurprising .
" nobody knows if germany is becoming more corrupt because -lrb- these scandals -rrb- are quite normal .
nobody thinks there are problems until major scandals break and grab everyone 's attention , " he said .

germany is facing yet another corruption scandal .
after a spectacular munich soccer stadium bribery affair , news that rail company deutsche bahn is under investigation is adding to the country 's tarnished reputation . once upon a time , germany was regarded as a country whose government officials and companies operated with fairness and competence , and whose post-war economy was founded on principles of quality and honesty . until a few years ago , the country 's media had little to say about political or industrial scandals . now , however , the german newspapers are increasingly filled with stories on bribery and corruption . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly no longer has its squeaky clean image of old .
two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club and the nation 's railway company are the latest to make unwanted headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn .
for deutsche bahn , the state-backed rail operator , the trouble stems from alleged illegal payments possibly involving the company 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn , who is currently being investigated for possible corruption by prosecutors in the german city of neuruppin .
according to media reports , deutsche bahn offices across the country , including the company 's headquarters in berlin , were raided by police and officials from the prosecutor 's office on tuesday .
the raids were part of an investigation into a contract between deutsche bahn and the german state of brandenburg signed in 2002 which gives deutsche bahn control of the most lucrative rail lines in the state until 2012 .
the ten-year contract , worth € 1.92 billion -lrb- $ 2.35 billion -rrb- , handed deutsche bahn subsidized passenger services on between 70 and 75 percent of rail lines in the state .
the contract was negotiated by mehdorn and hartmut meyer , who was the transport minister of brandenburg at the time .
less than a year after the contract was signed , meyer surprisingly quit his job at the ministry in september , 2003 after ten years in office .
he has since become an adviser to deutsche bahn . investigators from the public prosecutor 's office are looking into the possibility that the contract was not open to competitive bidding and whether illegal financial incentives were involved in the sealing of the deal .
meyer himself is now under investigation and his home and the office of his consulting firm " short cut " were also included in the sweep on tuesday .
deutsche bahn spokesman werner klingberg rejected the possibility of corruption and said the company was cooperating with the investigation , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on wednesday .
munich soccer corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsv 1860 münich president karl heinz wildmoser resigns .
the deutsche bahn scandal comes hot on the heels of the munich soccer stadium affair .
last week , karl-heinz wildmoser -lrb- photo -rrb- , the president of german soccer club tsv 1860 munich , was arrested on suspicion of taking bribes from a company that won the bid to build the new allianz arena , one of the showcase stadiums for the 2006 world cup finals in germany . wildmoser , his son and two others were accused of involvement in a shadowy exchange of sealed bids for the construction contract for the new arena and of participating in illegal payments for the information .
wildmoser was released on bail on friday and resigned from his position as club president on monday . the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , dr. hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , told dw-world that the latest developments were unsurprising .
" nobody knows if germany is becoming more corrupt because -lrb- these scandals -rrb- are quite normal .
nobody thinks there are problems until major scandals break and grab everyone 's attention , " he said .

in the wake of the madrid bombings , germany 's gerhard schröder and france 's jacques chirac have vowed to increase anti-terror measures and pledged to stamp out the root causes - including poverty and underdevelopment . meeting at paris ' elysée palace just five days after the deadliest terrorist attacks on european soil in years , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac pledged tuesday to step up security measures without neglecting what causes terror , including inequality in third world countries .
chirac said his country was " not immune from terrorist attacks " and that citizens must remain vigilant and ready to work with partners in the international community " against terrorism in every form . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies next to a destroyed train car after a bomb , exploded in the atocha railway station in madrid .
the leaders called for increased cooperation between police and security agencies in france and germany to defend against the threat of terrorism like thursday 's railroad attacks in madrid that killed more than 200 and injured close to 1,500 .
eliminating the foundations of terror in addition to increased vigilance at the national level and greater cooperation at the international level , schröder and chirac said the roots of terrorism , including poverty in developing nations , must also be fought .
" terrorism can not only be fought with arms and police , " schröder said .
" we must also combat the roots of terrorism . "
conflicts that feed terrorism and the frustration of some peoples must be ended , chirac said , pleading for a " dialogue of cultures . "
he also said he expected anti-terror measures to play an important role at a european union summit planned for next week in brussels .
both berlin and paris have called for a unified european plan against terrorism .
" in the face of the threat , respecting liberties and states based on law and order , europe will protect its citizens , " chirac said .
" this obligation will be at the heart of the work of the next european council . "
the first eu-level talks on terrorism are expected friday at a special meeting in brussels of interior ministers , who are expected to do preparatory work for a meeting of foreign ministers the following week .

-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- on a separate issue , the two leaders discussed the stalled negotiations over the draft of an eu constitution .
schröder said he viewed statements from spanish prime-minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero that his country would drop its objections over the double majority voting outlined in the draft constitution as a sign of hope that a deal is near .
a shift in the spanish position would leave poland alone in its opposition of the current constitution text .

with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n. with one short speech on monday , spanish prime-minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero made official that his country , long one of washington 's staunchest supporters in the war , is considering withdrawing its forces from iraq .
the prospect of losing a close ally is disquieting for the bush administration , and on monday , u.s. state department spokesman adam ereli said the united states would consider drafting a new united nations resolution aimed at providing the international body with a mandate to send troops to iraq and assuage fears of the incoming spanish government .
" the new -lrb- spanish -rrb- government is just forming .
they 're formulating their policies .
they 'll be taking actions over the next couple of months .
simultaneously , there will be things happening in iraq and in new york , " he said .
but ereli also questioned the need for a new resolution , arguing that the u.n. already has an iraq mandate under a previously approved resolution .
" it has been said that there needs to be a u.n. mandate for those troops , " ereli told reporters .
" we believe there is such a mandate in -lrb- u.n. resolution -rrb- 1511 .
at the same time , we 've also said that , in the context of a transfer of sovereignty on june 30th , a new resolution is possible . "
" the war in iraq was a disaster " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party leader jose rodriguez zapatero on monday , zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- criticized the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , describing the war and occupation as a " disaster , " and threatened to withdraw his troops by june 30 if a multinational u.n. force is not sent to the country .
" the spanish troops in iraq will come home , " zapatero told a spanish radio station .
zapatero 's position represents a 180-degree turn for spain , whose outgoing conservative prime minister , jose maria aznar , and his people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- served as loyal backers of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , even though the majority of spaniards opposed the war .
though zapatero ran his campaign on pledges to withdraw troops , the issue has taken on more urgency in spain this week , with major public outrage following terrorist bombings of commuter trains in madrid that killed 200 and wounded 1,500 .
initially , aznar 's -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar government insisted the basque terrorist organization eta was responsible for the bombings , but recent evidence and arrests have shifted the focus of investigators to islam extremists .
with evidence suggesting eta may not have been part of the attacks after all and that aznar 's government may have manipulated information with an eye on the polls , spaniards turned their backs on the people 's party , instead voting in zapatero and his anti-war platform .
allies : we 're staying put even as spain appears to be preparing to exit iraq , other members of the so-called " coalition of the willing , " have come out quickly with statements offering their steadfast support for the occupation .
great britain , bulgaria , denmark , the czech republic , the ukraine and japan have all said they would maintain their troops in iraq .
if spain pulled out its troops , polish prime minister leszek miller warned , it " would amount to an admission that the terrorists are right and that they are stronger than the whole civilized world . "
the spanish pullout could have serious consequences for poland .
currently , warsaw is in charge of a 9,000-strong military contingent comprising 24 nations in south-central iraq , including spain 's troops .
spain was expected to take control of the contingent in july , but those plans are now in question .
although poland has said it could continue to command the troops , it would create an additional strain for the country .
a domino effect ?
spain 's dramatic shift comes as a major setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq policies .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
observers , including ted galen carpenter of the conservative cato institute in washington , d.c. , said if washington is unable to keep spain from removing its troops , it could lead to a " domino effect " in other countries where governments have supported the war but popular opinion has stood against it . dw staff -lrb- dsl / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain to withdraw troops from iraq fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq .

with the depressed labor market showing no signs of an upturn , jobless germans are now taking matters into their hands - by seeking their fortunes overseas and turning to self-employment . according to germany 's federal statistical office , around 110,000 germans yearly pack up their bags to work abroad , at least for some time . much of that is a reaction to the country 's persistently high unemployment rate , which hovers around the 11 percent mark .
it 's not just highly-qualified germans , but increasingly also casual laborers and seasonal workers who are looking abroad for jobs . monika varnhagen , director of the bonn-based international employment agency -lrb- zav -rrb- , which helps german construction workers among others to find jobs for limited periods abroad , says that interest among germans in overseas jobs has been on the rise in the past few years .
" on the one hand it certainly has to do with the state of the labor market , but increasingly , many young people want to acquire additional qualifications by having worked abroad , " varnhagen told deutsche welle . she added that the flexibility of the european union had facilitated the rise of the phenomenon .
" the european labor market is open and thus offers chances to gain qualifications for those interested , " varnhagen said . looking for jobs beyond europe but jobseekers are n't stopping at the eu 's borders in their quest for work .
in the past 10 years , the zav has helped around 60,000 germans find employment all over the world . zav spokeswoman sabine seidler said that the agency started special programs in the face of increased willingness among germans to try their luck further away from the european continent .
" for instance we find jobs for teachers in specific subjects , like in the u.s. state of texas , where they have a great demand for teachers of german or other subjects , but ca n't fulfill that need locally , " seidler explained . canada , too , is a coveted destination for german jobseekers according to seidler , in particular for recent university graduates interested in an internship overseas . the zav 's initiatives like the " young workers exchange program " has sparked much interest in regions where high unemployment prevails , so much so that local job centers in smaller towns and cities have also begun to finance language courses in addition to helping german jobseekers with the move to a foreign country . being your own boss looking overseas for work is n't the only way germany 's long-term unemployed have found of dragging themselves out of the job market misery .
a study released by the german state-owned credit bank kfw in frankfurt on monday concluded that an increasing number of jobless germans are taking the plunge into self-employment and setting up their own businesses . every fourth person opting for self-employment last year , from a total of 1.6 million germans , was registered as jobless prior to the move , according to the study .
in former communist east germany , where unemployment is highest , every second entrepreneur was unemployed . the kfw study also pointed out that the number of people who decided to go it alone with the help of the " ich-ag " -lrb- me incorporated -rrb- scheme - a labor market reform introduced by the government which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own businesses - had doubled within a year to 249,800 . the trend has led to a lowering of the start-up capital , the study said .
about 40 percent of the newly self-employed needed a maximum of € 1,000 to start their business , while every tenth person who set up shop required more than € 50,000 . " an interesting alternative " most independent start-ups are in the service industry , followed by the retail and car-repair sectors . hans reich , head of kfw 's supervisory board told a press conference that the numbers prove people are learning to make the best out of a dire situation .
" despite the difficult economic situation , independence is still an interesting alternative for many people , " reich remarked . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans debate introducing national minimum wage germany is one of the few european countries which does not have a minimum wage .

" for instance we find jobs for teachers in specific subjects , like in the u.s. state of texas , where they have a great demand for teachers of german or other subjects , but ca n't fulfill that need locally , " seidler explained . canada , too , is a coveted destination for german jobseekers according to seidler , in particular for recent university graduates interested in an internship overseas . the zav 's initiatives like the " young workers exchange program " has sparked much interest in regions where high unemployment prevails , so much so that local job centers in smaller towns and cities have also begun to finance language courses in addition to helping german jobseekers with the move to a foreign country . being your own boss looking overseas for work is n't the only way germany 's long-term unemployed have found of dragging themselves out of the job market misery .
a study released by the german state-owned credit bank kfw in frankfurt on monday concluded that an increasing number of jobless germans are taking the plunge into self-employment and setting up their own businesses . every fourth person opting for self-employment last year , from a total of 1.6 million germans , was registered as jobless prior to the move , according to the study .
in former communist east germany , where unemployment is highest , every second entrepreneur was unemployed . the kfw study also pointed out that the number of people who decided to go it alone with the help of the " ich-ag " -lrb- me incorporated -rrb- scheme - a labor market reform introduced by the government which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own businesses - had doubled within a year to 249,800 . the trend has led to a lowering of the start-up capital , the study said .

with the depressed labor market showing no signs of an upturn , jobless germans are now taking matters into their hands - by seeking their fortunes overseas and turning to self-employment . according to germany 's federal statistical office , around 110,000 germans yearly pack up their bags to work abroad , at least for some time . much of that is a reaction to the country 's persistently high unemployment rate , which hovers around the 11 percent mark .
it 's not just highly-qualified germans , but increasingly also casual laborers and seasonal workers who are looking abroad for jobs . monika varnhagen , director of the bonn-based international employment agency -lrb- zav -rrb- , which helps german construction workers among others to find jobs for limited periods abroad , says that interest among germans in overseas jobs has been on the rise in the past few years .
" on the one hand it certainly has to do with the state of the labor market , but increasingly , many young people want to acquire additional qualifications by having worked abroad , " varnhagen told deutsche welle . she added that the flexibility of the european union had facilitated the rise of the phenomenon .
" the european labor market is open and thus offers chances to gain qualifications for those interested , " varnhagen said . looking for jobs beyond europe but jobseekers are n't stopping at the eu 's borders in their quest for work .
in the past 10 years , the zav has helped around 60,000 germans find employment all over the world . zav spokeswoman sabine seidler said that the agency started special programs in the face of increased willingness among germans to try their luck further away from the european continent .

until march 11 europe 's fight against terror was mainly theoretical .
but since the madrid attacks , anti-terrorism measures have risen to the top of the political agenda as more and more security lapses are revealed . after sept .
11 , 2001 , leaders across europe held up their hands in solidarity and vowed to join forces and fight terrorism .
but two and a half years later , there is little to show from that battle .
" there are european instruments , but they have been poorly utilized ; the ratification of the agreement is slow ; the measures have been inadequately applied or have been misunderstood by security forces and justice offices in the member states . "
the wording is taken from a confidential report on the european union 's anti-terror policy presented just two days before the deadly bombings in madrid , and the conclusion drawn is a frighteningly realistic depiction of the sorry state of the eu 's fight against terror .
especially unsatisfactory is the exchange of information and data between the various european intelligence agencies and among the national police organizations .
although europol serves as a european go-between for cross-border investigations , its responsibilities in the fight against terror have been limited : it is primarily an observer in the fight against terror .
although there are plans for strengthening europol , they will not go into effect until a few years down the road ; and the eu commission will not start researching anti-terror measures and begin examining ways to develop new techniques until 2007 .
in the meantime the calls are getting louder for establishing a definitive european anti-terror authority along the lines of the american homeland security ministry .
during a recent meeting of eu justice ministers , austria proposed creating a european intelligence office similar to the u.s. central intelligence agency .
the initiative fell on deaf ears .
despite the rhetoric , it seems no country is really prepared to give up its sovereignty in the area of security for the sake of a europe-wide anti-terror initiative .
creating central anti-terror organization no one can really say for certain whether or not a central intelligence organization could have prevented the bombings in madrid .
but europe 's own experience with regional terror groups in the 1970s and 1980s lends support to the creation of a cross-border , anti-terror commando .
in order to successfully combat the ira , eta , raf and the red brigade , great britain , spain , germany and italy each developed special units to focus exclusively on the terror threat when the national police force was incapable of doing so .
such a model could be applied to the eu level , especially since the national justice departments with their police offices all too often end their pursuit of criminals at the border .
that should at least change soon .
by june europe will have introduced the eu arrest warrant , allowing police to pursue suspects across national borders .
much more crucial , however , is the development of forge-resistant passports and the ascertaining of biometric data for all visa applicants .
these measures are still in the testing phase .
in terms of infrastructure , the eu must do more to protect its road and rail networks .
the continent 's highways and railroads present an ideal target for terrorists and allow for easy transport of weapons and suspects across borders .
more than a silent tribute recent surveys show that eu citizens expect their political leaders to achieve an 80 percent success rate in the fight against terror .
terrorism and security issues are high on their list of priorities .
the eu , however , is far from such concrete goals .
only after lengthy debate was the bloc able to agree on a common definition of what terrorism actually is .
nonetheless , europe 's leaders have made anti-terror measures and the fight against terror their priority for the next summit .
if one were a cynic , one could say , it 's unfortunate that it took a catastrophe such as the one in madrid to shake the eu out of its stupor and open its eyes to reality .
djerba , casablanca , bali , mombasa , istanbul : the list of warnings was long .

with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n. with one short speech on monday , spanish prime-minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero made official that his country , long one of washington 's staunchest supporters in the war , is considering withdrawing its forces from iraq .
the prospect of losing a close ally is disquieting for the bush administration , and on monday , u.s. state department spokesman adam ereli said the united states would consider drafting a new united nations resolution aimed at providing the international body with a mandate to send troops to iraq and assuage fears of the incoming spanish government .
" the new -lrb- spanish -rrb- government is just forming .
they 're formulating their policies .
they 'll be taking actions over the next couple of months .
simultaneously , there will be things happening in iraq and in new york , " he said .
but ereli also questioned the need for a new resolution , arguing that the u.n. already has an iraq mandate under a previously approved resolution .
" it has been said that there needs to be a u.n. mandate for those troops , " ereli told reporters .
" we believe there is such a mandate in -lrb- u.n. resolution -rrb- 1511 .
at the same time , we 've also said that , in the context of a transfer of sovereignty on june 30th , a new resolution is possible . "
" the war in iraq was a disaster " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party leader jose rodriguez zapatero on monday , zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- criticized the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , describing the war and occupation as a " disaster , " and threatened to withdraw his troops by june 30 if a multinational u.n. force is not sent to the country .
" the spanish troops in iraq will come home , " zapatero told a spanish radio station .
zapatero 's position represents a 180-degree turn for spain , whose outgoing conservative prime minister , jose maria aznar , and his people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- served as loyal backers of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , even though the majority of spaniards opposed the war .
though zapatero ran his campaign on pledges to withdraw troops , the issue has taken on more urgency in spain this week , with major public outrage following terrorist bombings of commuter trains in madrid that killed 200 and wounded 1,500 .
initially , aznar 's -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar government insisted the basque terrorist organization eta was responsible for the bombings , but recent evidence and arrests have shifted the focus of investigators to islam extremists .
with evidence suggesting eta may not have been part of the attacks after all and that aznar 's government may have manipulated information with an eye on the polls , spaniards turned their backs on the people 's party , instead voting in zapatero and his anti-war platform .
allies : we 're staying put even as spain appears to be preparing to exit iraq , other members of the so-called " coalition of the willing , " have come out quickly with statements offering their steadfast support for the occupation .
great britain , bulgaria , denmark , the czech republic , the ukraine and japan have all said they would maintain their troops in iraq .
if spain pulled out its troops , polish prime minister leszek miller warned , it " would amount to an admission that the terrorists are right and that they are stronger than the whole civilized world . "
the spanish pullout could have serious consequences for poland .
currently , warsaw is in charge of a 9,000-strong military contingent comprising 24 nations in south-central iraq , including spain 's troops .
spain was expected to take control of the contingent in july , but those plans are now in question .
although poland has said it could continue to command the troops , it would create an additional strain for the country .
a domino effect ?
spain 's dramatic shift comes as a major setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq policies .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
observers , including ted galen carpenter of the conservative cato institute in washington , d.c. , said if washington is unable to keep spain from removing its troops , it could lead to a " domino effect " in other countries where governments have supported the war but popular opinion has stood against it . dw staff -lrb- dsl / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain to withdraw troops from iraq fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq .

until march 11 europe 's fight against terror was mainly theoretical .
but since the madrid attacks , anti-terrorism measures have risen to the top of the political agenda as more and more security lapses are revealed . after sept .
11 , 2001 , leaders across europe held up their hands in solidarity and vowed to join forces and fight terrorism .
but two and a half years later , there is little to show from that battle .
" there are european instruments , but they have been poorly utilized ; the ratification of the agreement is slow ; the measures have been inadequately applied or have been misunderstood by security forces and justice offices in the member states . "
the wording is taken from a confidential report on the european union 's anti-terror policy presented just two days before the deadly bombings in madrid , and the conclusion drawn is a frighteningly realistic depiction of the sorry state of the eu 's fight against terror .
especially unsatisfactory is the exchange of information and data between the various european intelligence agencies and among the national police organizations .
although europol serves as a european go-between for cross-border investigations , its responsibilities in the fight against terror have been limited : it is primarily an observer in the fight against terror .
although there are plans for strengthening europol , they will not go into effect until a few years down the road ; and the eu commission will not start researching anti-terror measures and begin examining ways to develop new techniques until 2007 .
in the meantime the calls are getting louder for establishing a definitive european anti-terror authority along the lines of the american homeland security ministry .
during a recent meeting of eu justice ministers , austria proposed creating a european intelligence office similar to the u.s. central intelligence agency .
the initiative fell on deaf ears .
despite the rhetoric , it seems no country is really prepared to give up its sovereignty in the area of security for the sake of a europe-wide anti-terror initiative .
creating central anti-terror organization no one can really say for certain whether or not a central intelligence organization could have prevented the bombings in madrid .
but europe 's own experience with regional terror groups in the 1970s and 1980s lends support to the creation of a cross-border , anti-terror commando .
in order to successfully combat the ira , eta , raf and the red brigade , great britain , spain , germany and italy each developed special units to focus exclusively on the terror threat when the national police force was incapable of doing so .
such a model could be applied to the eu level , especially since the national justice departments with their police offices all too often end their pursuit of criminals at the border .
that should at least change soon .
by june europe will have introduced the eu arrest warrant , allowing police to pursue suspects across national borders .
much more crucial , however , is the development of forge-resistant passports and the ascertaining of biometric data for all visa applicants .
these measures are still in the testing phase .
in terms of infrastructure , the eu must do more to protect its road and rail networks .
the continent 's highways and railroads present an ideal target for terrorists and allow for easy transport of weapons and suspects across borders .
more than a silent tribute recent surveys show that eu citizens expect their political leaders to achieve an 80 percent success rate in the fight against terror .
terrorism and security issues are high on their list of priorities .
the eu , however , is far from such concrete goals .
only after lengthy debate was the bloc able to agree on a common definition of what terrorism actually is .
nonetheless , europe 's leaders have made anti-terror measures and the fight against terror their priority for the next summit .
if one were a cynic , one could say , it 's unfortunate that it took a catastrophe such as the one in madrid to shake the eu out of its stupor and open its eyes to reality .
djerba , casablanca , bali , mombasa , istanbul : the list of warnings was long .
now terror has arrived in europe and this is the last chance to join forces and react , not just with moments of silence , but with real concrete actions . bernd riegert -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security discussions rage across europe european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil .

with the depressed labor market showing no signs of an upturn , jobless germans are now taking matters into their hands - by seeking their fortunes overseas and turning to self-employment . according to germany 's federal statistical office , around 110,000 germans yearly pack up their bags to work abroad , at least for some time . much of that is a reaction to the country 's persistently high unemployment rate , which hovers around the 11 percent mark .
it 's not just highly-qualified germans , but increasingly also casual laborers and seasonal workers who are looking abroad for jobs . monika varnhagen , director of the bonn-based international employment agency -lrb- zav -rrb- , which helps german construction workers among others to find jobs for limited periods abroad , says that interest among germans in overseas jobs has been on the rise in the past few years .
" on the one hand it certainly has to do with the state of the labor market , but increasingly , many young people want to acquire additional qualifications by having worked abroad , " varnhagen told deutsche welle . she added that the flexibility of the european union had facilitated the rise of the phenomenon .

in the past 10 years , the zav has helped around 60,000 germans find employment all over the world . zav spokeswoman sabine seidler said that the agency started special programs in the face of increased willingness among germans to try their luck further away from the european continent .
" for instance we find jobs for teachers in specific subjects , like in the u.s. state of texas , where they have a great demand for teachers of german or other subjects , but ca n't fulfill that need locally , " seidler explained . canada , too , is a coveted destination for german jobseekers according to seidler , in particular for recent university graduates interested in an internship overseas . the zav 's initiatives like the " young workers exchange program " has sparked much interest in regions where high unemployment prevails , so much so that local job centers in smaller towns and cities have also begun to finance language courses in addition to helping german jobseekers with the move to a foreign country . being your own boss looking overseas for work is n't the only way germany 's long-term unemployed have found of dragging themselves out of the job market misery .
a study released by the german state-owned credit bank kfw in frankfurt on monday concluded that an increasing number of jobless germans are taking the plunge into self-employment and setting up their own businesses . every fourth person opting for self-employment last year , from a total of 1.6 million germans , was registered as jobless prior to the move , according to the study .
in former communist east germany , where unemployment is highest , every second entrepreneur was unemployed . the kfw study also pointed out that the number of people who decided to go it alone with the help of the " ich-ag " -lrb- me incorporated -rrb- scheme - a labor market reform introduced by the government which gives financial incentives to unemployed people to start their own businesses - had doubled within a year to 249,800 . the trend has led to a lowering of the start-up capital , the study said .
about 40 percent of the newly self-employed needed a maximum of € 1,000 to start their business , while every tenth person who set up shop required more than € 50,000 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.03.2004 opinion : while brussels slept großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe needs more than moments of silence for the victims of terror .
until march 11 europe 's fight against terror was mainly theoretical .
but since the madrid attacks , anti-terrorism measures have risen to the top of the political agenda as more and more security lapses are revealed . after sept .
11 , 2001 , leaders across europe held up their hands in solidarity and vowed to join forces and fight terrorism .
but two and a half years later , there is little to show from that battle .
" there are european instruments , but they have been poorly utilized ; the ratification of the agreement is slow ; the measures have been inadequately applied or have been misunderstood by security forces and justice offices in the member states . "
the wording is taken from a confidential report on the european union 's anti-terror policy presented just two days before the deadly bombings in madrid , and the conclusion drawn is a frighteningly realistic depiction of the sorry state of the eu 's fight against terror .
especially unsatisfactory is the exchange of information and data between the various european intelligence agencies and among the national police organizations .
although europol serves as a european go-between for cross-border investigations , its responsibilities in the fight against terror have been limited : it is primarily an observer in the fight against terror .
although there are plans for strengthening europol , they will not go into effect until a few years down the road ; and the eu commission will not start researching anti-terror measures and begin examining ways to develop new techniques until 2007 .
in the meantime the calls are getting louder for establishing a definitive european anti-terror authority along the lines of the american homeland security ministry .
during a recent meeting of eu justice ministers , austria proposed creating a european intelligence office similar to the u.s. central intelligence agency .
the initiative fell on deaf ears .
despite the rhetoric , it seems no country is really prepared to give up its sovereignty in the area of security for the sake of a europe-wide anti-terror initiative .
creating central anti-terror organization no one can really say for certain whether or not a central intelligence organization could have prevented the bombings in madrid .
but europe 's own experience with regional terror groups in the 1970s and 1980s lends support to the creation of a cross-border , anti-terror commando .
in order to successfully combat the ira , eta , raf and the red brigade , great britain , spain , germany and italy each developed special units to focus exclusively on the terror threat when the national police force was incapable of doing so .
such a model could be applied to the eu level , especially since the national justice departments with their police offices all too often end their pursuit of criminals at the border .
that should at least change soon .
by june europe will have introduced the eu arrest warrant , allowing police to pursue suspects across national borders .
much more crucial , however , is the development of forge-resistant passports and the ascertaining of biometric data for all visa applicants .
these measures are still in the testing phase .
in terms of infrastructure , the eu must do more to protect its road and rail networks .
the continent 's highways and railroads present an ideal target for terrorists and allow for easy transport of weapons and suspects across borders .
more than a silent tribute recent surveys show that eu citizens expect their political leaders to achieve an 80 percent success rate in the fight against terror .
terrorism and security issues are high on their list of priorities .
the eu , however , is far from such concrete goals .
only after lengthy debate was the bloc able to agree on a common definition of what terrorism actually is .
nonetheless , europe 's leaders have made anti-terror measures and the fight against terror their priority for the next summit .
if one were a cynic , one could say , it 's unfortunate that it took a catastrophe such as the one in madrid to shake the eu out of its stupor and open its eyes to reality .
djerba , casablanca , bali , mombasa , istanbul : the list of warnings was long .
now terror has arrived in europe and this is the last chance to join forces and react , not just with moments of silence , but with real concrete actions . bernd riegert -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security discussions rage across europe european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil .
-lrb- march 15 , k 2004 -rrb- terror " getting closer " to germany german politicians have called for increased security at the nation 's train stations in the wake of thursday 's attacks in madrid .
government officials meanwhile rejected this , saying enough security was already in place .

with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n. with one short speech on monday , spanish prime-minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero made official that his country , long one of washington 's staunchest supporters in the war , is considering withdrawing its forces from iraq .
the prospect of losing a close ally is disquieting for the bush administration , and on monday , u.s. state department spokesman adam ereli said the united states would consider drafting a new united nations resolution aimed at providing the international body with a mandate to send troops to iraq and assuage fears of the incoming spanish government .
" the new -lrb- spanish -rrb- government is just forming .
they 're formulating their policies .
they 'll be taking actions over the next couple of months .
simultaneously , there will be things happening in iraq and in new york , " he said .
but ereli also questioned the need for a new resolution , arguing that the u.n. already has an iraq mandate under a previously approved resolution .
" it has been said that there needs to be a u.n. mandate for those troops , " ereli told reporters .
" we believe there is such a mandate in -lrb- u.n. resolution -rrb- 1511 .
at the same time , we 've also said that , in the context of a transfer of sovereignty on june 30th , a new resolution is possible . "
" the war in iraq was a disaster " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party leader jose rodriguez zapatero on monday , zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- criticized the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , describing the war and occupation as a " disaster , " and threatened to withdraw his troops by june 30 if a multinational u.n. force is not sent to the country .
" the spanish troops in iraq will come home , " zapatero told a spanish radio station .
zapatero 's position represents a 180-degree turn for spain , whose outgoing conservative prime minister , jose maria aznar , and his people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- served as loyal backers of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , even though the majority of spaniards opposed the war .
though zapatero ran his campaign on pledges to withdraw troops , the issue has taken on more urgency in spain this week , with major public outrage following terrorist bombings of commuter trains in madrid that killed 200 and wounded 1,500 .
initially , aznar 's -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar government insisted the basque terrorist organization eta was responsible for the bombings , but recent evidence and arrests have shifted the focus of investigators to islam extremists .
with evidence suggesting eta may not have been part of the attacks after all and that aznar 's government may have manipulated information with an eye on the polls , spaniards turned their backs on the people 's party , instead voting in zapatero and his anti-war platform .
allies : we 're staying put even as spain appears to be preparing to exit iraq , other members of the so-called " coalition of the willing , " have come out quickly with statements offering their steadfast support for the occupation .
great britain , bulgaria , denmark , the czech republic , the ukraine and japan have all said they would maintain their troops in iraq .
if spain pulled out its troops , polish prime minister leszek miller warned , it " would amount to an admission that the terrorists are right and that they are stronger than the whole civilized world . "
the spanish pullout could have serious consequences for poland .
currently , warsaw is in charge of a 9,000-strong military contingent comprising 24 nations in south-central iraq , including spain 's troops .
spain was expected to take control of the contingent in july , but those plans are now in question .
although poland has said it could continue to command the troops , it would create an additional strain for the country .
a domino effect ?
spain 's dramatic shift comes as a major setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq policies .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
observers , including ted galen carpenter of the conservative cato institute in washington , d.c. , said if washington is unable to keep spain from removing its troops , it could lead to a " domino effect " in other countries where governments have supported the war but popular opinion has stood against it . dw staff -lrb- dsl / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain to withdraw troops from iraq fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq .

in the wake of the madrid bombings , germany 's gerhard schröder and france 's jacques chirac have vowed to increase anti-terror measures and pledged to stamp out the root causes - including poverty and underdevelopment . meeting at paris ' elysée palace just five days after the deadliest terrorist attacks on european soil in years , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac pledged tuesday to step up security measures without neglecting what causes terror , including inequality in third world countries .
chirac said his country was " not immune from terrorist attacks " and that citizens must remain vigilant and ready to work with partners in the international community " against terrorism in every form . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies next to a destroyed train car after a bomb , exploded in the atocha railway station in madrid .
the leaders called for increased cooperation between police and security agencies in france and germany to defend against the threat of terrorism like thursday 's railroad attacks in madrid that killed more than 200 and injured close to 1,500 .
eliminating the foundations of terror in addition to increased vigilance at the national level and greater cooperation at the international level , schröder and chirac said the roots of terrorism , including poverty in developing nations , must also be fought .
" terrorism can not only be fought with arms and police , " schröder said .
" we must also combat the roots of terrorism . "
conflicts that feed terrorism and the frustration of some peoples must be ended , chirac said , pleading for a " dialogue of cultures . "
he also said he expected anti-terror measures to play an important role at a european union summit planned for next week in brussels .
both berlin and paris have called for a unified european plan against terrorism .
" in the face of the threat , respecting liberties and states based on law and order , europe will protect its citizens , " chirac said .
" this obligation will be at the heart of the work of the next european council . "
the first eu-level talks on terrorism are expected friday at a special meeting in brussels of interior ministers , who are expected to do preparatory work for a meeting of foreign ministers the following week .

eu leaders will discuss friday a draft of a constitution that aims to streamline decision making and create a post of european president and foreign minister .
-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- on a separate issue , the two leaders discussed the stalled negotiations over the draft of an eu constitution .
schröder said he viewed statements from spanish prime-minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero that his country would drop its objections over the double majority voting outlined in the draft constitution as a sign of hope that a deal is near .
a shift in the spanish position would leave poland alone in its opposition of the current constitution text .
chirac said negotiations would likely be completed by the end of the year , with schröder suggesting a deal could be reached before the irish eu presidency ends its term in june . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. hopes u.n. resolution will keep spain in iraq with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n.

with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n. with one short speech on monday , spanish prime-minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero made official that his country , long one of washington 's staunchest supporters in the war , is considering withdrawing its forces from iraq .
the prospect of losing a close ally is disquieting for the bush administration , and on monday , u.s. state department spokesman adam ereli said the united states would consider drafting a new united nations resolution aimed at providing the international body with a mandate to send troops to iraq and assuage fears of the incoming spanish government .
" the new -lrb- spanish -rrb- government is just forming .
they 're formulating their policies .
they 'll be taking actions over the next couple of months .
simultaneously , there will be things happening in iraq and in new york , " he said .
but ereli also questioned the need for a new resolution , arguing that the u.n. already has an iraq mandate under a previously approved resolution .
" it has been said that there needs to be a u.n. mandate for those troops , " ereli told reporters .
" we believe there is such a mandate in -lrb- u.n. resolution -rrb- 1511 .
at the same time , we 've also said that , in the context of a transfer of sovereignty on june 30th , a new resolution is possible . "
" the war in iraq was a disaster " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist party leader jose rodriguez zapatero on monday , zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- criticized the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , describing the war and occupation as a " disaster , " and threatened to withdraw his troops by june 30 if a multinational u.n. force is not sent to the country .
" the spanish troops in iraq will come home , " zapatero told a spanish radio station .
zapatero 's position represents a 180-degree turn for spain , whose outgoing conservative prime minister , jose maria aznar , and his people 's party -lrb- pp -rrb- served as loyal backers of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , even though the majority of spaniards opposed the war .
though zapatero ran his campaign on pledges to withdraw troops , the issue has taken on more urgency in spain this week , with major public outrage following terrorist bombings of commuter trains in madrid that killed 200 and wounded 1,500 .
initially , aznar 's -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar government insisted the basque terrorist organization eta was responsible for the bombings , but recent evidence and arrests have shifted the focus of investigators to islam extremists .
with evidence suggesting eta may not have been part of the attacks after all and that aznar 's government may have manipulated information with an eye on the polls , spaniards turned their backs on the people 's party , instead voting in zapatero and his anti-war platform .
allies : we 're staying put even as spain appears to be preparing to exit iraq , other members of the so-called " coalition of the willing , " have come out quickly with statements offering their steadfast support for the occupation .
great britain , bulgaria , denmark , the czech republic , the ukraine and japan have all said they would maintain their troops in iraq .
if spain pulled out its troops , polish prime minister leszek miller warned , it " would amount to an admission that the terrorists are right and that they are stronger than the whole civilized world . "
the spanish pullout could have serious consequences for poland .
currently , warsaw is in charge of a 9,000-strong military contingent comprising 24 nations in south-central iraq , including spain 's troops .
spain was expected to take control of the contingent in july , but those plans are now in question .
although poland has said it could continue to command the troops , it would create an additional strain for the country .
a domino effect ?
spain 's dramatic shift comes as a major setback to u.s. president george w. bush 's efforts to shore up support for his iraq policies .
the conservative pp is the first of bush 's allies to be ousted at the ballot box , and could leave other european leaders contemplating their next move in iraq .
observers , including ted galen carpenter of the conservative cato institute in washington , d.c. , said if washington is unable to keep spain from removing its troops , it could lead to a " domino effect " in other countries where governments have supported the war but popular opinion has stood against it . dw staff -lrb- dsl / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain to withdraw troops from iraq fresh off his surprise electoral victory , spain 's prime minister-elect jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced on monday he would withdraw the country 's troops from iraq .

germany is facing yet another corruption scandal .
after a spectacular munich soccer stadium bribery affair , news that rail company deutsche bahn is under investigation is adding to the country 's tarnished reputation . once upon a time , germany was regarded as a country whose government officials and companies operated with fairness and competence , and whose post-war economy was founded on principles of quality and honesty . until a few years ago , the country 's media had little to say about political or industrial scandals . now , however , the german newspapers are increasingly filled with stories on bribery and corruption . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly no longer has its squeaky clean image of old .
two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club and the nation 's railway company are the latest to make unwanted headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn .
for deutsche bahn , the state-backed rail operator , the trouble stems from alleged illegal payments possibly involving the company 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn , who is currently being investigated for possible corruption by prosecutors in the german city of neuruppin .
according to media reports , deutsche bahn offices across the country , including the company 's headquarters in berlin , were raided by police and officials from the prosecutor 's office on tuesday .
the raids were part of an investigation into a contract between deutsche bahn and the german state of brandenburg signed in 2002 which gives deutsche bahn control of the most lucrative rail lines in the state until 2012 .
the ten-year contract , worth € 1.92 billion -lrb- $ 2.35 billion -rrb- , handed deutsche bahn subsidized passenger services on between 70 and 75 percent of rail lines in the state .
the contract was negotiated by mehdorn and hartmut meyer , who was the transport minister of brandenburg at the time .
less than a year after the contract was signed , meyer surprisingly quit his job at the ministry in september , 2003 after ten years in office .
he has since become an adviser to deutsche bahn . investigators from the public prosecutor 's office are looking into the possibility that the contract was not open to competitive bidding and whether illegal financial incentives were involved in the sealing of the deal .
meyer himself is now under investigation and his home and the office of his consulting firm " short cut " were also included in the sweep on tuesday .
deutsche bahn spokesman werner klingberg rejected the possibility of corruption and said the company was cooperating with the investigation , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on wednesday .
munich soccer corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsv 1860 münich president karl heinz wildmoser resigns .
the deutsche bahn scandal comes hot on the heels of the munich soccer stadium affair .
last week , karl-heinz wildmoser -lrb- photo -rrb- , the president of german soccer club tsv 1860 munich , was arrested on suspicion of taking bribes from a company that won the bid to build the new allianz arena , one of the showcase stadiums for the 2006 world cup finals in germany . wildmoser , his son and two others were accused of involvement in a shadowy exchange of sealed bids for the construction contract for the new arena and of participating in illegal payments for the information .
wildmoser was released on bail on friday and resigned from his position as club president on monday . the recent spate of corruption scandals in germany might surprise many who still think of the country as a clean and fair place to do business .
however , dr. hansjörg elshorst , the chairman of the german chapter of global watchdog transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , told dw-world that the latest developments were unsurprising .
" nobody knows if germany is becoming more corrupt because -lrb- these scandals -rrb- are quite normal .
nobody thinks there are problems until major scandals break and grab everyone 's attention , " he said .
middle of the table transparency international 's own corruption perceptions table for 2003 actually shows that germany is not particularly bad by international standards .
the country occupies a middle ranking in the berlin-based watchdog 's rankings , however , the 2004 table may look a little different .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , chairman of transparency international and hansjörg elshorst , chairman transparency international germany .
elshorst -lrb- photo , right , with ti chairman peter eigen -rrb- explained that the exposure of cases like the munich affair showed that infrastructure was in place to combat corruption . " we now have more tools to investigate corruption and more people to carry out investigations , " he said . " on one particular day in the munich investigation , there were 100 people working on the case .
a few years back , there were n't even 100 investigators in germany . " however , he added there was more to be done : " we 've seen an increase in corruption between companies in germany as firms find themselves under more pressure in sectors where there is less business .
to stop this , we need more legislation , heavier punishments and fines to stop this.transparency international will continue to push for these measures .

germany is facing yet another corruption scandal .
after a spectacular munich soccer stadium bribery affair , news that rail company deutsche bahn is under investigation is adding to the country 's tarnished reputation . once upon a time , germany was regarded as a country whose government officials and companies operated with fairness and competence , and whose post-war economy was founded on principles of quality and honesty . until a few years ago , the country 's media had little to say about political or industrial scandals . now , however , the german newspapers are increasingly filled with stories on bribery and corruption . although few would consider germany one of the world 's most corrupt nations , it certainly no longer has its squeaky clean image of old .
two german institutions , a top-flight soccer club and the nation 's railway company are the latest to make unwanted headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn .
for deutsche bahn , the state-backed rail operator , the trouble stems from alleged illegal payments possibly involving the company 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn , who is currently being investigated for possible corruption by prosecutors in the german city of neuruppin .
according to media reports , deutsche bahn offices across the country , including the company 's headquarters in berlin , were raided by police and officials from the prosecutor 's office on tuesday .
the raids were part of an investigation into a contract between deutsche bahn and the german state of brandenburg signed in 2002 which gives deutsche bahn control of the most lucrative rail lines in the state until 2012 .
the ten-year contract , worth € 1.92 billion -lrb- $ 2.35 billion -rrb- , handed deutsche bahn subsidized passenger services on between 70 and 75 percent of rail lines in the state .
the contract was negotiated by mehdorn and hartmut meyer , who was the transport minister of brandenburg at the time .
less than a year after the contract was signed , meyer surprisingly quit his job at the ministry in september , 2003 after ten years in office .
he has since become an adviser to deutsche bahn . investigators from the public prosecutor 's office are looking into the possibility that the contract was not open to competitive bidding and whether illegal financial incentives were involved in the sealing of the deal .
meyer himself is now under investigation and his home and the office of his consulting firm " short cut " were also included in the sweep on tuesday .
deutsche bahn spokesman werner klingberg rejected the possibility of corruption and said the company was cooperating with the investigation , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper on wednesday .

the statistic is revealed in a report highlighting links between domestic violence and crimes outside the home .
of those committing domestic assaults 49 % had a previous criminal conviction , 9 % of victims were children and 5 % of those affected were pregnant .
but the findings show the more contact offenders have with the criminal justice system , the better they get at getting away with offences .
offender profile at least 49 % had a previous criminal conviction and tended to be for offences other than domestic violence 5 % had either just been released from prison , had broken a court order , injunction or bail conditions by going around to the victim 's home and committing the offence one in 30 were investigated by operation trident the report , which shows the force receives more than 104,000 calls each year on domestic abuse , will be discussed at a two day conference on violence in the home .
the research profiled all reported sexual offences in a domestic situation for the first four months of 2001 .
additionally all attacks , kidnappings , attempted murders and murders identified as occurring in the home between january and february 2001 were analysed .
this totalled just less than 400 offences , with all the perpetrators individually profiled .
four cases resulted in the victim being murdered by the suspect .
victim profile 5 % were pregnant at the time of a sexual assault in 31 % of offences children were recorded as present in the house in 10 % of cases a child witnessed a rape 57 % were repeat victims and there was a long and protracted history of abuse and 24 offenders had previously received a sentence for domestic violence .
the research also found that one in four of the suspects studied were female .

several demolition workers narrowly escaped when the demolition machine collapsed in plymouth last week .
a caterpillar track on the £ 250,000 cat crusher sunk into rubble at the site in old town street .
since the crane was righted , work has been going on under restrictions set by the health and safety executive .
a 300-tonne crane had to be brought in from london to raise the toppled crusher , which was thought to have broken through into an undetected void below ground .
health and safety executive representatives will meet contractors for further discussions as to how the work is going .
it was a bad start to the £ 170m drake circus shopping redevelopment .
however , the overall scheme is being widened fast , with contractors now working on the drake circus roundabout .
within days , demolition is due to start on the adjacent early-1970s office block .

the commission for health improvement said the services provided by pembrokeshire and derwen nhs trust were " threadbare " and " failing " .
the trust said the comments were " unbalanced " but said it was making improvements .
the trust serves in pembrokeshire , carmarthenshire and ceredigion .
the commission -lrb- chi -rrb- began its report after receiving information during a routine review of the trust 's standards .
it feared that the nhs organisation may not have learnt lessons from two serious incidents during 2001 , including the suicide of rebecca hill .
ms hill , 20 , of lamphey , pembrokeshire , was found hanged , with an electrical cord around her neck , in a bathroom at st david 's hospital in carmarthen , in december that year .
she was under five-minute observations at the time .
we believe this gives an unbalanced picture of the standard of our services frank o 'sullivan in may 2003 , an inquest jury found her death was due to suicide while the balance of her mind was disturbed , contributed to by neglect .
during its investigation , the chi found that some ligature points , from which people could hang themselves , still existed in some parts of the trust , though this issue would be addressed by april this year , the report said .
ms hill 's father , granville , said the investigation highlighted extreme staff shortages .
" when rebecca died there was only one trained nurse to look after two wards , " he said .
" i think that nurse would have been overwhelmed .
no one would be able to cope with that . "
her mother ruth said the system " killed " her daughter .
" she was safer at home with us than in a secure unit , " she added .
also , the chi said it found that the trust 's mental health services across the three counties were " threadbare and often unable to help service users with urgent needs " .
chronic staff shortages , the lack of action on known risk areas and confused lines of accountability were all contributing to a " failing " service , the report went on .
' demotiving effect of report ' chi 's acting chief executive jocelyn cornwell said : " the trust provides a service in a challenging environment , but it needs to respond to incidents with appropriate thoroughness , and address the staffing problems more innovatively and with more imagination . "
trust chief executive frank o 'sullivan said he feared the report would have a " demotivating effect " on otherwise hard-working trust staff .
he said : " we believe this gives an unbalanced picture of the standard of our services but , at the same time , we acknowledge that there are some inconsistencies in our service provision and we will be addressing these in a more systematic way in future . "
health minister jane hutt said : " i am confident that the trust will be able to fully implement the recommendations quickly and i know that much progress has already been made in key areas of concern . "

in this week 's top 10 , katie melua , jamie cullum and norah jones have charmed cd buyers while middle-of-the-road giants daniel o 'donnell , engelbert humperdinck and harry connick jr have lumbered back into view .
of the few pop acts that remain in the top 10 , the mellow zero 7 and newly-soulful will young sound distinctly adult .
so how did every day come to sound like a dinner party ?
" people like melody and quality in music , and there are a lot of good songs around right now , " says colin martin , executive music producer for bbc radio 2 .
" during the 90s , the chart was dominated by high-energy tracks with little to appeal to a broad range of album buyers .
it 's been like a bolt from the blue stephen graham jazzwise magazine " now there is hardly anybody who will not enjoy the current albums by katie melua , jamie cullum or lionel richie . "
jazzwise magazine co-editor stephen graham traces the current jazz and middle-of-the-road -lrb- mor -rrb- revival to pianist diana krall , whose album when i look in your eyes was a global hit in 1999 .
" diana krall tapped into the lucrative adult market and paved the way for norah jones , " he says .
" people liked the fact that norah jones was a young singer-songwriter and she had phenomenal success . "
norah jones sold 19 million copies of her debut album come away with me , including two million in the uk .
this is all about lengthy careers , rather than just making music for today colin martin bbc radio 2 " that success has continued with her new album , by which time she had in turn paved the way for jamie cullum 's £ 1m record deal , " mr graham says .
industry magazine music week attributes the rise in easy listening to " des and mel , -lsb- michael -rsb- parkinson and beer adverts " .
exposure on tv and radio has dramatically boosted sales , but radio 2 's colin martin believes the new accessibility of albums is another vital factor .
" in the past , some people may not have wanted to go to record shops to search out these artists , but now they can just pop them in their basket at a supermarket , " he says .
jamie cullum has won a place in both the album and singles charts whatever the reason , people aged between 40 and 49 have been inspired to buy more albums - accounting for 19.1 % of total album sales in 2002 compared with 16.5 % in 2000 , according to british phonographic industry figures .
the popularity of mor and jazz has led to a sharp contrast between music formats , with the albums chart topped by artists who find it difficult to conquer the youth-dominated singles chart and vice versa .
the fact that katie melua and jamie cullum have already enjoyed top 20 hits may bridge that divide , however .
" even a widely-respected jazz artist such as courtney pine never made it into the singles chart , " says stephen graham .
" it 's been like a bolt from the blue . "
everything in music is cyclical - i can already detect a backlash stephen graham jazzwise magazine will the appeal of mellow jazz and mor artists continue to broaden ?
colin martin believes so .
" we continue to champion artists such as amy winehouse , damien rice and sarah mclachlan because we believe strongly in artistic development , " he says .
" they have the potential to keep getting better and better .
this is all about lengthy careers , rather than just making music for today . "
stephen graham is not so sure .
" it 's the flavour of the month right now , but everything in music is cyclical , " he says .

mci announced on monday it had agreed to sell the embratel stake to mexico 's biggest phone firm , telmex , for $ 360m -lrb- £ 198m -rrb- .
but disappointed brazilian bidders said they had offered $ 200m more , and may challenge the sale in the us courts .
mci sold the embratel stake as part of its efforts to emerge from bankruptcy .
it is trying to cut debt so it can put forward a convincing case to the bankruptcy court .
worldcom went bust two years ago with an $ 11bn hole in its accounts , setting a record for a us firm .
' unfair ' a consortium of three brazilian firms have said they bid $ 550m for mci 's stake in the brazilian long-distance phone firm embratel .
the consortium has not issued an official response to mci 's decision , but people linked to it have told reporters it may well protest to the us bankruptcy court .
mci might then find itself having to justify taking a lesser bid which could be seen as short-changing its creditors .
" it is not the kind of competition that a us court would be able to consider fair , " a person linked to the brazilian bidders told the reuters news agency .
the defeated consortium was made up of three mobile phone companies - brasil telecom participacoes , telemar , and the brazilian branch of spanish firm telefonicia .
defence mci has defended its decision to accept the bid from telmex , owned by entrepreneur carlos slim .
the firm said : " the telemex bid was assessed by factors including valuation , likelihood of regulatory approval and anticipated time of close . "
it added it " continues to act in the best interests of its creditors " .
mci owns a 19.3 % stake in embratel which confers control of the company through 51 % of the voting rights .
the firm is believed to be aiming to emerge from bankruptcy as soon as next month .

but keeping control of one 's legacy after death is n't always easy .
dr barnes made his fortune in the pharmaceutical industry in a small suburb of philadelphia stands a great monument to the marvellous eccentricity of a businessman .
dr albert barnes was born in poverty and made a fortune out of pharmaceuticals .
he turned his money into what is now the greatest private collection of art in the world : 800 pictures and sculptures including 181 renoirs -lrb- the national gallery in london has a dozen -rrb- , 55 cézannes -lrb- many more than they 've got in paris -rrb- plus vaults of works by matisse , picasso , and el greco .
but dr barnes ' legacy is both boon and blight .
on the one hand , he created a gallery that any curator anywhere would die for .
on the other , the strict rules he set before he died in 1951 have constricted its finance and led it to the verge of bankruptcy .
limited numbers only twelve-hundred people are allowed to visit - and only on fridays , saturdays and sundays and by appointment .
the collection contains famous paintings by seurat and matisse you ca n't buy tickets on the door no matter how grand you are .
the pictures can not be moved from the rooms in the gallery he built at his home nor re-arranged within them .
his purpose was educational .
he would lecture to small groups of enthusiasts in front of walls of paintings which he 'd grouped by theme , perhaps colour or subject or style or even more arcane similarities like paintings featuring elbows .
one room had - and has - african masks alongside pictures by modigliani and picasso where faces mirror the shapes .
but the difficulty for the trustees now is that walls full of art worth billions of dollars do n't pay the bills .
you ca n't spend a cezanne in a gallery .
court case so , the trustees have now gone to court .
they want the collection moved to a purpose-built gallery in downtown philadelphia .
benefactors have promised $ 150 million if that 's done .
to try to stay faithful to dr barnes ' will , they would build a gallery of exactly the same size and configuration as the original and hang the pictures in the same positions .
that , according to kimberly camp , the chief executive of the barnes foundation , would not change : " this is not an attempt to pull this apart and make it a museum but we would not be subject to the kind of restrictions which we are here so we could let more people in " .
furthermore , at the moment you need to apply well in advance for a ticket for a particular day and time so the flow of people can be regulated .
that , too , would not change : " if the petition is approved and the barnes moves , you would still have to have a timed ticket so you 're not talking about rooms being jammed with hundreds of people .
that 's not what 's going to happen , " they say .
opposition but opponents are sceptical .
they say there 's only one gallery like it in the world and true art lovers will search it out .
and they argue that it might be possible to rebuild rooms of the same dimensions as the existing one in the suburbs , but you would lose the relaxed environment of the original twelve acre site .
and , since the aim would be to have more people , the ambience would be destroyed .
part of the barnes foundation 's difficulty is that it 's not always got on with its neighbours who want the collection to stay in the town of merion yet oppose change that would mean disruption to their peaceful township .
they seem to want the pictures but not the people who might view them .
one solution might have been for a corporate donor to give the foundation the $ 50 million it needs to stay where it is , but that has n't happened .
so now a judge has a tough choice : keep dr barnes ' vision pure but the finances shaky or threaten the vision but secure the finances .
it 's an impossible dilemma .

jackson has been lined up to appear on good morning america on 31 march , but will be subject to a five second delay , according to trade newspaper variety .
abc television said they were imposing the delay to prevent any possible repeat performance .
jackson caused national outrage by exposing her breast during a televised duet at the super bowl on 1 february .
she blamed the incident - which happened when pop star justin timberlake ripped off her bustier - on a " wardrobe malfunction " , but it lead to a widespread clampdown on indecency .
freedom of speech abc has signed the 37-year-old to appear on good morning america , saying it was time to put the incident behind her .
" at some point , freedom of speech needs to be remembered , " an abc executive told variety .
jackson will be interviewed on the programme prior to performing her new single just a little while in an outdoor concert from battery park , in new york , which will also be screened .
her breast-bearing prompted organisers of the grammy awards to retract her invitation from appearing and broadcasters to slap an unprecedented five-minute broadcast delay on the screening of the show .
an investigation by us media watchdog the federal communications commission , led to a decision by politicians to increase fines against broadcasters who air " indecent " material to $ 500,000 -lrb- £ 273,000 -rrb- .
jackson is also due to host tv comedy show saturday night live on the 10 april edition of the nbc show , broadcast live from new york .

but local artists complain that they are not able to reap the rewards from the tourist boom .
they say that most of the art on sale is mass produced and has little relevance to the island 's culture .
the so-called " tourist art " is ruining their livelihood , they claim .
' commercial artist ' saidi omary , 24 , paints up to 15 pieces of " tourist art " a week .
" i am a commercial artist , i paint what is marketable , " he said .
" i do create original works but they do n't sell quickly which is bad because i need the money . "
despite the thriving tourism industry , the island is still very poor .
the average wage is just 60 us cents a day and it is not surprising that artists are turning out effortless reproductions that they can sell for a few dollars .
awareness but some artists working in zanzibar deplore this commercial approach to art .
for me tourist art is boring ... if you are an artist , you have a dream and creativity hamza ausiy zanzibar artist artist hamza ausiy is dismissive of " tourist art " and says it is ruining his business .
" for me tourist art is boring and confusing , because if you are an artist , you have a dream and creativity but if you do this sort of work you are always looking for bread , " he said .
he says his canvases - which cost $ 200 or more - are all original artworks and feature exclusively zanzibari scenes .
artists selling the original works have now got together to form an association to promote their work .
musa ramadhan is secretary of the zanzibar young artists association .
he says artists should be selling to the local market , even if their volumes are small .
" we need to create awareness among the local people to make them like our art and even hang our works in their homes , " mr ramadhan said .
he says artists in zanzibar need to change and create ideas from their culture .
" people on this island like religion we should put religion in our pictures , " mr ramadhan recommends .
for the time being though , the art market in zanzibar is driven by the hoards of artists selling mass-produced art .

so says john caudwell , boss of the caudwell group that owns phones4u and a slew of other companies involved in the mobile phone market .
mr caudwell believes the price war will come about because of the efforts of the uk 's 3 to win people over to its third-generation network .
recently 3 announced a pay-as-you-go option for its network that it hopes will interest the 70 % of british phone users that currently pay for their phone that way .
troubled times " 3 have got incredibly aggressive on normal tariffs and they have some very nice handsets coming into the range , " he told bbc news online .
" they are pushing it on the back of low cost voice calls . " 3 has a chance to cause trouble for rivals because so many british people have a phone .
" the problem operators face is that market is virtually saturated now , " said mr caudwell .
with 3 willing to spend money to recruit users away from other networks , the reaction from those networks will likely be price cuts and special offers to keep customers loyal .
games are popular but not lucrative but , he said , it remains to be seen whether cheaper phones means people make more phone calls and offset the lower call costs .
" it could take revenue out of the marketplace faster than revenue that can be replaced by new features , " said mr caudwell .
certainly , he said , there was little evidence that customers who buy phones via phones4u want all the latest extras on a phone .
" the vast majority of people want superb value for money and superb service , " he said , " it 's the minority that want bells and whistles . "
" at the end of the day no customer is interested in the technology , " he said , " they are interested in the benefits .
" that 's all they want to know , " he said .
mr caudwell said the revenues from extras such as wallpaper , ringtones and games were , so far , proving negligible compared to the amount of revenue phone firms made from voice calls .
caudwell group companies 20:20 logistics dextra phones 4u discovery store caudwell communications mobile phone repair company cornerstone wizcom " data revenues are relatively small in the scheme of things , " he said , " and it 's difficult for operators to get excited about wallpaper . "
" revenues are increasing slowly as a result of new services , " he said , " but the price war is threatening the overall revenue as the whole thing is cheaper . "
with an imminent price war and slow revenue growth on data services , mr caudwell said britain 's phone market was ripe for change .
" over the next five years we 're going to see consolidation of networks , service providers and retailers , " he said .
" the challenge for the networks is to create the services that customers really do want , " he said , " that people can not live without . "

mr caudwell believes the price war will come about because of the efforts of the uk 's 3 to win people over to its third-generation network .
recently 3 announced a pay-as-you-go option for its network that it hopes will interest the 70 % of british phone users that currently pay for their phone that way .
troubled times " 3 have got incredibly aggressive on normal tariffs and they have some very nice handsets coming into the range , " he told bbc news online .
" they are pushing it on the back of low cost voice calls . " 3 has a chance to cause trouble for rivals because so many british people have a phone .
" the problem operators face is that market is virtually saturated now , " said mr caudwell .
with 3 willing to spend money to recruit users away from other networks , the reaction from those networks will likely be price cuts and special offers to keep customers loyal .
games are popular but not lucrative but , he said , it remains to be seen whether cheaper phones means people make more phone calls and offset the lower call costs .
" it could take revenue out of the marketplace faster than revenue that can be replaced by new features , " said mr caudwell .
certainly , he said , there was little evidence that customers who buy phones via phones4u want all the latest extras on a phone .
" the vast majority of people want superb value for money and superb service , " he said , " it 's the minority that want bells and whistles . "
" at the end of the day no customer is interested in the technology , " he said , " they are interested in the benefits .
" that 's all they want to know , " he said .
mr caudwell said the revenues from extras such as wallpaper , ringtones and games were , so far , proving negligible compared to the amount of revenue phone firms made from voice calls .
caudwell group companies 20:20 logistics dextra phones 4u discovery store caudwell communications mobile phone repair company cornerstone wizcom " data revenues are relatively small in the scheme of things , " he said , " and it 's difficult for operators to get excited about wallpaper . "
" revenues are increasing slowly as a result of new services , " he said , " but the price war is threatening the overall revenue as the whole thing is cheaper . "
with an imminent price war and slow revenue growth on data services , mr caudwell said britain 's phone market was ripe for change .
" over the next five years we 're going to see consolidation of networks , service providers and retailers , " he said .
" the challenge for the networks is to create the services that customers really do want , " he said , " that people can not live without . "

so says john caudwell , boss of the caudwell group that owns phones4u and a slew of other companies involved in the mobile phone market .
mr caudwell believes the price war will come about because of the efforts of the uk 's 3 to win people over to its third-generation network .
recently 3 announced a pay-as-you-go option for its network that it hopes will interest the 70 % of british phone users that currently pay for their phone that way .
troubled times " 3 have got incredibly aggressive on normal tariffs and they have some very nice handsets coming into the range , " he told bbc news online .
" they are pushing it on the back of low cost voice calls . " 3 has a chance to cause trouble for rivals because so many british people have a phone .
" the problem operators face is that market is virtually saturated now , " said mr caudwell .
with 3 willing to spend money to recruit users away from other networks , the reaction from those networks will likely be price cuts and special offers to keep customers loyal .
games are popular but not lucrative but , he said , it remains to be seen whether cheaper phones means people make more phone calls and offset the lower call costs .
" it could take revenue out of the marketplace faster than revenue that can be replaced by new features , " said mr caudwell .
certainly , he said , there was little evidence that customers who buy phones via phones4u want all the latest extras on a phone .
" the vast majority of people want superb value for money and superb service , " he said , " it 's the minority that want bells and whistles . "
" at the end of the day no customer is interested in the technology , " he said , " they are interested in the benefits .
" that 's all they want to know , " he said .

prices in alnwick have risen by almost 65 % in the past three years , making the average property £ 140,000 compared to a regional average of £ 87,000 .
however , the average wage in the area is around £ 60 a week less than the regional figure .
the housing problem is being raised at a meeting of alnwick district councillors on tuesday evening .
government limits the town is home to alnwick castle , featured in the harry potter films , and was voted the best place in the uk to live in a 2002 magazine poll .
councillor gordon castle said the whole district had been affected by rising house prices but alnwick had seen the biggest increase .
he said : " we really do have a problem for young people , young families and local people hoping to buy a house for themselves in the place in which they were brought up .
" the problem is getting worse .
there is a move away by many young people and its is urban commuters and retired people who can afford the houses . "
mr castle said government limits on the number of houses that can be built made the problem difficult to tackle .
he said : " we can not just build our way out of it by putting up houses to meet perceived demand .
" we are prevented by the county plan and , at present , we are permitted to build around 112 houses a year .
" that figure has been limited by the new county structure plan to 65 a year until 2006 , and then 75 a year until 2016 .
" this , in my opinion , is ludicrously inadequate and will put even more pressure on house prices and we need to fight this . "

prices in alnwick have risen by almost 65 % in the past three years , making the average property £ 140,000 compared to a regional average of £ 87,000 .
however , the average wage in the area is around £ 60 a week less than the regional figure .
the housing problem is being raised at a meeting of alnwick district councillors on tuesday evening .
government limits the town is home to alnwick castle , featured in the harry potter films , and was voted the best place in the uk to live in a 2002 magazine poll .
councillor gordon castle said the whole district had been affected by rising house prices but alnwick had seen the biggest increase .
he said : " we really do have a problem for young people , young families and local people hoping to buy a house for themselves in the place in which they were brought up .
" the problem is getting worse .
there is a move away by many young people and its is urban commuters and retired people who can afford the houses . "
mr castle said government limits on the number of houses that can be built made the problem difficult to tackle .
he said : " we can not just build our way out of it by putting up houses to meet perceived demand .
" we are prevented by the county plan and , at present , we are permitted to build around 112 houses a year .
" that figure has been limited by the new county structure plan to 65 a year until 2006 , and then 75 a year until 2016 .
" this , in my opinion , is ludicrously inadequate and will put even more pressure on house prices and we need to fight this . "

the survey of 3,000 mothers , commissioned by evriwoman.co.uk , found almost half of women with unplanned pregnancies were using contraception .
of these , 62 % blamed problems with the pill , 19 % said it was due to a split condom , and 3 % were too carried away to use contraception .
one in five women said they regretted the pregnancy .
the survey showed it is not just teenagers who are being complacent about contraception , but older women too .
almost all the women surveyed were in their twenties and thirties .
almost 70 % of women on the pill said they forget to take it at least once a month , 10 % forgetting to take it four times or more .
rethinking contraception dr rosemary leonard , a gp in london , said many women do n't realise that missing one or more pills per cycle can double their chances of becoming pregnant .
" often in my surgery i see the very real emotional and financial costs of an unplanned pregnancy and it can be frustrating to know that often it 's because people have taken one too many risks with contraception . "
she said women who have had unplanned pregnancies need to review their contraceptive methods and look at options such as hormonal implants , injections and patches , and ius 's -lrb- intrauterine systems -rrb- .
" many women might benefit from considering a method that does not need to be thought about every day , like the pill does , or at the time of intercourse , like condoms . "
some 45 % of survey respondents said they are considering a new method of contraception , of these 38 % said they would choose the pill , 28 % said condoms , and 15 % considering a contraceptive patch or injection .
having a baby also affected the sex drive of many women , with half of those questioned saying they had " gone off sex " due to no longer feeling attractive , being too tired , or fear that sex after a birth could be painful .
the survey was hosted on the website bounty , an online community for mothers .
toni belfield , director of information at the family planning association said the statistics come as no surprise .
" they reflect the realities of the issues facing couples trying to plan pregnancies and the consequences when pregnancy happens unexpectedly , " she told bbc news online .
" our national helpline receives calls every day from women needing help and advice about this subject .
" this really highlights the need for both women and men to be supported in the choices that they make regarding their contraception and also supported if they are faced with an unplanned pregnancy . "

they have turned out in their thousands at this police academy in the northern iraqi town of mosul .
they are former baathists ready to denounce the old order and pledge fealty to the new .
many are also sunni muslims , reflecting their privileged position under saddam hussein .
they have been forced to surrender that under their new american rulers .
brigadier general frank helmick addresses the throng .
" all of you have gathered voluntarily , and your only benefit from these actions will be the sense of personal closure that comes from disavowing links to the former regime and supporting those who want to build the new iraq . "
in unison the men stand to their feet , raise their right hands and cement his statement with an oath . "
i was running a very good school , and i think those who kicked me out found it difficult to have someone in charge who belonged to a different sect " former headteacher the americans believe this is the way to give iraq a new start .
it is part of the de-baathification policy that dissolved the army , costing 400,000 iraqis their jobs .
thousands were also purged from professions like teaching , many of them sunnis .
the decision has caused resentment and a sense of humiliation .
tough times " i have n't received my salary because i was a baath party member , " says one man after the oath ceremony .
" life is difficult , i have a family and children .
i came hoping they would give us salaries .
so far i got nothing . "
in a small flat in baghdad a former headmistress also remembers better times .
once her work was praised .
now she is afraid to show her face . "
sunnis should not be approached as sunnis , they should be approached as arabs and citizens of iraq . "
analyst wamid nathmi she says she had to join the baath party to keep her job .
she lost it after the old regime fell and the education ministry was taken over by shiite religious parties .
" i think the main reason i was fired is because i am sunni , " she says .
" i was running a very good school , and i think those who kicked me out found it difficult to have someone in charge who belonged to a different sect .
i do n't know how many other sunnis have lost their jobs , but two of my friends did . "
sectarian struggle it is a sense of persecution widely held by sunnis .
they believe that de-baathification is not just about punishing the guilty .
they say it is also about power in the new iraq , a struggle expressed in increasingly sectarian terms .
some have turned to fighting the occupiers .
sunni areas have been the stronghold of the iraqi resistance .
at first us forces responded with mass arrests .
it was a strategy that only further alienated the sunni community , an error the americans seem to have recognized .
" now i think they have started to understand that was a mistaken policy , so they are having rapprochement with sunni society , " says iraqi analyst wamid nathmi .
" but i think they are doing it also in a wrong way , because the sunnis should not be approached as sunnis , they should be approached as arabs and citizens of iraq .
" this is a short sighted policy which might calm certain sections of the sunni population , but it would not put an end to the attempt to divide the country into ethnic and sectarian groups . "
political solutions others are turning to sheikhs to solve their political problems .
in january , sunni clerics set up a religious council .
it is an attempt to communicate with an occupation they feel has spurned them .
" we wanted a gathering that has executive power and political representation which will help preserve the rights of the sunni people , " says council member sheikh sabah nur al qaisi .
" we needed to unite all sunnis in the country and avoid problems and conflicts that may emerge . "
secular iraqis say the american policies of de-baathification and repression have done much to encourage this sectarian identity .
and they warn that as long as sunnis feel excluded , they will continue to resist in the name of the nation or the mosque , mostly likely a violent fusion of both .
