the court is not expected to rule on this for several years .

" microsoft has not demonstrated specifically that it might suffer serious and irreparable damage , " the court said in a document obtained by reuters . the president of the court , bo vesterdorf , said that " a number of questions of principle were raised " but that " the requirement relating to urgency is not satisfied . " the eu commission argued that the sanctions would be rendered meaningless if delayed , because the market would have moved on by the time they were implemented . either side can appeal wednesday 's decision to the eu 's highest court , the european court of justice . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft slapped with biggest fine in eu history the european union on wednesday levied the largest fine against any company in the bloc 's history , ruling that microsoft must pay a half billion euros for abusing its " near monopoly " status .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.12.2004 doing away with discrimination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : covered , among others : age , sex and disability the german government plans to introduce a law banning discrimination in a wide range of areas .
but critics say the bill will simply create even more red tape for the private sector . a disabled person wanting to enter a stylish disco , a turkish family or homosexual couple looking for an apartment , women earning less than their male counterparts for the same work : all of these are groups facing discrimination in germany on a daily basis .
but this is going to change . the european union requires all of its member states to give people legal mechanisms to battle discrimination on the basis of sex , racial or ethnic origin , age , disability , religion and sexual orientation .
germany ’ s ruling red-green coalition government has now introduced a planned anti-discrimination law to implement these eu directives . “ people discriminated against are no longer just victims , ” said irmingard schewe-gerigk , the women ’ s affairs spokeswoman for the greens .
“ they can now demand their rights with confidence . ” putting an end to “ no jews or disabled people ” the new legislation will be submitted to parliament ’ s lower house , the bundestag , next month .
it will prohibit discrimination in a wide range of areas , including jobs , working conditions , pay , education , as well as access to goods and services . in practical terms , the proposed legislation will mean that landlords can ’ t turn away a potential tenant because he is a muslim , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned anti-discrimination law also helps gay people “ newspaper ads saying things such as ‘ no jews or disabled people ’ will be banned , ” said volker beck , the general secretary of the greens ’ parliamentary group . the legislation would also require insurance companies to justify why their policies differ according to a person ’ s sex or sexual orientation . “ it will no longer be possible for health insurers to refuse cover to homosexuals on the grounds that they belong to a group at high risk of hiv , ” beck said . an unnecessary burden for the german economy but both germany ’ s conservative opposition cdu / csu and the private sector are unhappy with the bill .
although all welcome the moves to fight discrimination , they criticize that it will generate over-regulation . “ it will create a new bureaucracy monster instead of reducing red tape and saving costs , ” the cdu / csu parliamentary faction said in a statement . dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ' associations bda said the german economy would be unnecessarily burdened with such a law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt is not in favor of the new legislation “ the draft law is bureaucratic , incalculable , completely overdrawn and incompatible with the basic principles of our civil law and our labor relations , ” hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- said . the federal justice ministry dismissed these claims .
spokesman ulf gerder said the anti-discrimination law would not affect 95 percent of the population . “ most people are sufficiently informed about article 3 of the german constitution , which forbids discrimination , ” he said . but there were 5 percent of the population who neglected to follow these principles of equality . “ in these cases , there is every reason for the law and it is necessary , ” gerder said . no american conditions so will the country be facing a surge of legal battles in the future ?
ursula engelen-kefer , deputy head of the trade union confederation dgb , said no . “ opponents are presenting a horror scenario of compensation payments or a wave of lawsuits as in the united states , but this is utterly unfounded , ” engelen-kefer said . the law does have its problematic aspects , though , beck of the greens party said .
the burden of proof lies with the party being discriminated , he said .
so landlords , employers or nightclub owners remain innocent until proven guilty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law will not require uni-sex saunas however , the elderly will continue to be able to enjoy those senior citizen portions in restaurants .
and women who prefer visiting the sauna on female-only days can breathe a sigh of relief .
these forms of “ discrimination ” will continue to exist . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working women face upward battle germany is lagging far behind when it comes to women in top managerial positions .

but critics say the bill will simply create even more red tape for the private sector . a disabled person wanting to enter a stylish disco , a turkish family or homosexual couple looking for an apartment , women earning less than their male counterparts for the same work : all of these are groups facing discrimination in germany on a daily basis .
but this is going to change . the european union requires all of its member states to give people legal mechanisms to battle discrimination on the basis of sex , racial or ethnic origin , age , disability , religion and sexual orientation .
germany ’ s ruling red-green coalition government has now introduced a planned anti-discrimination law to implement these eu directives . “ people discriminated against are no longer just victims , ” said irmingard schewe-gerigk , the women ’ s affairs spokeswoman for the greens .
“ they can now demand their rights with confidence . ” putting an end to “ no jews or disabled people ” the new legislation will be submitted to parliament ’ s lower house , the bundestag , next month .
it will prohibit discrimination in a wide range of areas , including jobs , working conditions , pay , education , as well as access to goods and services . in practical terms , the proposed legislation will mean that landlords can ’ t turn away a potential tenant because he is a muslim , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned anti-discrimination law also helps gay people “ newspaper ads saying things such as ‘ no jews or disabled people ’ will be banned , ” said volker beck , the general secretary of the greens ’ parliamentary group . the legislation would also require insurance companies to justify why their policies differ according to a person ’ s sex or sexual orientation . “ it will no longer be possible for health insurers to refuse cover to homosexuals on the grounds that they belong to a group at high risk of hiv , ” beck said . an unnecessary burden for the german economy but both germany ’ s conservative opposition cdu / csu and the private sector are unhappy with the bill .
although all welcome the moves to fight discrimination , they criticize that it will generate over-regulation . “ it will create a new bureaucracy monster instead of reducing red tape and saving costs , ” the cdu / csu parliamentary faction said in a statement . dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ' associations bda said the german economy would be unnecessarily burdened with such a law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt is not in favor of the new legislation “ the draft law is bureaucratic , incalculable , completely overdrawn and incompatible with the basic principles of our civil law and our labor relations , ” hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- said . the federal justice ministry dismissed these claims .
spokesman ulf gerder said the anti-discrimination law would not affect 95 percent of the population . “ most people are sufficiently informed about article 3 of the german constitution , which forbids discrimination , ” he said . but there were 5 percent of the population who neglected to follow these principles of equality . “ in these cases , there is every reason for the law and it is necessary , ” gerder said . no american conditions so will the country be facing a surge of legal battles in the future ?
ursula engelen-kefer , deputy head of the trade union confederation dgb , said no . “ opponents are presenting a horror scenario of compensation payments or a wave of lawsuits as in the united states , but this is utterly unfounded , ” engelen-kefer said . the law does have its problematic aspects , though , beck of the greens party said .
the burden of proof lies with the party being discriminated , he said .

but critics say the bill will simply create even more red tape for the private sector . a disabled person wanting to enter a stylish disco , a turkish family or homosexual couple looking for an apartment , women earning less than their male counterparts for the same work : all of these are groups facing discrimination in germany on a daily basis .
but this is going to change . the european union requires all of its member states to give people legal mechanisms to battle discrimination on the basis of sex , racial or ethnic origin , age , disability , religion and sexual orientation .
germany ’ s ruling red-green coalition government has now introduced a planned anti-discrimination law to implement these eu directives . “ people discriminated against are no longer just victims , ” said irmingard schewe-gerigk , the women ’ s affairs spokeswoman for the greens .
“ they can now demand their rights with confidence . ” putting an end to “ no jews or disabled people ” the new legislation will be submitted to parliament ’ s lower house , the bundestag , next month .

britain 's highest court recently ruled that tony blair 's answer exceeds the acceptable . prime minister blair is well-known for his hard-line approach to fighting terrorism , both at home and abroad .
in the wake of the world trade center attacks in new york , he quickly forced through a far-reaching anti-terror law , under which suspicious foreigners can be locked away without charge of trial , for an indefinite period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair now , britain 's highest court , the house of lords , has deemed the legislation a fundamental violation of democratic norms and the european human rights convention .
although not binding , the verdict could change the fate of the nine foreign prisoners who have been serving time in british prisons without legal proceedings for the past three years .
it puts the onus on parliament to amend the law and bring it in line with the european charter . " the real threat to the life of the nation , in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values , comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these , " lord leonard hoffmann wrote . the civilian case governments across europe responded to the sept .
11 attacks by restricting their citizens ' basic civil liberties .
conor gearty , a legal expert for terrorism and civil rights at the london school of economics , believes england was particularly hard hit .
" liberal freedom in our country is slowly but surely being undermined by unscrupulous bugging and surveillance methods , " gearty said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storing of biometric data could become standard in britain unlike germany , britain does n't currently have a system of national identity cards , although tony blair sees their reintroduction into uk society as a key weapon in his anti-terror campaign .
on monday , the prime minister won resounding support for his plans when 385 members of parliament voted in favor , compared to 93 against , of resurrecting the cards , which were abolished under winston churchill more than fifty years ago . but the plans , which opponents in the parliamentary ranks say would lead to the creation of a " big brother " state , go further than national id cards .
from 2007 , the government also wants to implement a system of storing biometric data , such as fingerprints and photographic images of the iris , on all british citizens . holes in security such a data bank is but a distant dream for wolfgang speck , head of the german police union .
" compared to england , we are at the start of the fight against terrorism , and we have a lot of catching up to do , " speck said .
he added that an anti-terror law such as britian 's controversial offering would be inconceivable in germany , where it is impossible to hold a suspected terrorist for longer than 48 hours without a judicial ruling . speck said he believes that germans underestimate the threat of terror , adding that there is currently no legal basis for data exchange between regional criminal investigation departments or the federal criminal investigators and public prosecutors .
" with regards to easy terrorist targets , we do n't have the situation under control at the moment , " speck said . as for london , some argue that the tough measures currently in place are precisely what has spared the city the horrors of a terrorist attack , but legal expert gearty sees it differently . " the prophecies of the police and the secret service have been proved wrong , which is why the judges are speaking out against the way in which terrorism is being fought at the expense of civil liberty , " gearty said .
he believes that if there had been a wave of terrorist violence , the decision at the house of lords would have been different . georg matthes , dw.world.de -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany creates new terror center german interior minister otto schily has opened a new center for combating terrorism in berlin .

the german government is going on a new offensive against smoking , asking the nation 's restaurants to provide more space for non-smokers and pushing for a ban on lighting up in hospitals . if berlin has its way , 40 percent of seats in german restaurants will be reserved for non-smokers .
marion caspers-merk , the federal government 's drug commissioner , announced on tuesday that the government is stepping up its anti-smoking campaign , hoping to get not only restaurants , but german hospitals to limit or eliminate smoking on their premises .
the government plans to meet with germany 's restaurant and hotel association to ask them to voluntarily enlarge the non-smoking areas in their establishments .
caspers-merk said germany is looking at austria for its model and hopes to convince the hospitality sector to impose limits on smoking step by step . " non-smoking should be the norm in germany , " caspers-merk told reporters . trend toward not lighting up there are signs that the trend is heading in that direction , particularly among young people .
for the first time in years , the number of smokers between the ages of 12 and 17 has decreased .
in 1997 , 28 percent of this age group smoked ; by 2004 , that number had gone down to 23 percent .
a current study carried out by the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- shows that 65 percent of 12- to 25-year-olds are non-smokers , up from 56 percent in 1979 . caspers-merk said part of the reason for the declining numbers of young smokers has to do with tobacco taxes which have been continually raised for several years , most recently on dec .

" all important questions will be decided within the group and not in public , " enders told daily die welt in an interview .
forgeard and enders have both been nominated to take over the running of eads next july when the current co-chairmen , rainer hertrich and philippe camus , step down .
but forgeard , currently head of eads ' airbus unit , has been very vocal in arguing for the current system of dual leadership to be abolished and for eads to be headed by a single chairman .

britain 's highest court recently ruled that tony blair 's answer exceeds the acceptable . prime minister blair is well-known for his hard-line approach to fighting terrorism , both at home and abroad .
in the wake of the world trade center attacks in new york , he quickly forced through a far-reaching anti-terror law , under which suspicious foreigners can be locked away without charge of trial , for an indefinite period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair now , britain 's highest court , the house of lords , has deemed the legislation a fundamental violation of democratic norms and the european human rights convention .
although not binding , the verdict could change the fate of the nine foreign prisoners who have been serving time in british prisons without legal proceedings for the past three years .
it puts the onus on parliament to amend the law and bring it in line with the european charter . " the real threat to the life of the nation , in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values , comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these , " lord leonard hoffmann wrote . the civilian case governments across europe responded to the sept .
11 attacks by restricting their citizens ' basic civil liberties .
conor gearty , a legal expert for terrorism and civil rights at the london school of economics , believes england was particularly hard hit .
" liberal freedom in our country is slowly but surely being undermined by unscrupulous bugging and surveillance methods , " gearty said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storing of biometric data could become standard in britain unlike germany , britain does n't currently have a system of national identity cards , although tony blair sees their reintroduction into uk society as a key weapon in his anti-terror campaign .
on monday , the prime minister won resounding support for his plans when 385 members of parliament voted in favor , compared to 93 against , of resurrecting the cards , which were abolished under winston churchill more than fifty years ago . but the plans , which opponents in the parliamentary ranks say would lead to the creation of a " big brother " state , go further than national id cards .
from 2007 , the government also wants to implement a system of storing biometric data , such as fingerprints and photographic images of the iris , on all british citizens . holes in security such a data bank is but a distant dream for wolfgang speck , head of the german police union .
" compared to england , we are at the start of the fight against terrorism , and we have a lot of catching up to do , " speck said .
he added that an anti-terror law such as britian 's controversial offering would be inconceivable in germany , where it is impossible to hold a suspected terrorist for longer than 48 hours without a judicial ruling . speck said he believes that germans underestimate the threat of terror , adding that there is currently no legal basis for data exchange between regional criminal investigation departments or the federal criminal investigators and public prosecutors .
" with regards to easy terrorist targets , we do n't have the situation under control at the moment , " speck said . as for london , some argue that the tough measures currently in place are precisely what has spared the city the horrors of a terrorist attack , but legal expert gearty sees it differently . " the prophecies of the police and the secret service have been proved wrong , which is why the judges are speaking out against the way in which terrorism is being fought at the expense of civil liberty , " gearty said .
he believes that if there had been a wave of terrorist violence , the decision at the house of lords would have been different . georg matthes , dw.world.de -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany creates new terror center german interior minister otto schily has opened a new center for combating terrorism in berlin .

in the wake of the world trade center attacks in new york , he quickly forced through a far-reaching anti-terror law , under which suspicious foreigners can be locked away without charge of trial , for an indefinite period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair now , britain 's highest court , the house of lords , has deemed the legislation a fundamental violation of democratic norms and the european human rights convention .
although not binding , the verdict could change the fate of the nine foreign prisoners who have been serving time in british prisons without legal proceedings for the past three years .
it puts the onus on parliament to amend the law and bring it in line with the european charter . " the real threat to the life of the nation , in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values , comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these , " lord leonard hoffmann wrote . the civilian case governments across europe responded to the sept .
11 attacks by restricting their citizens ' basic civil liberties .
conor gearty , a legal expert for terrorism and civil rights at the london school of economics , believes england was particularly hard hit .
" liberal freedom in our country is slowly but surely being undermined by unscrupulous bugging and surveillance methods , " gearty said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storing of biometric data could become standard in britain unlike germany , britain does n't currently have a system of national identity cards , although tony blair sees their reintroduction into uk society as a key weapon in his anti-terror campaign .
on monday , the prime minister won resounding support for his plans when 385 members of parliament voted in favor , compared to 93 against , of resurrecting the cards , which were abolished under winston churchill more than fifty years ago . but the plans , which opponents in the parliamentary ranks say would lead to the creation of a " big brother " state , go further than national id cards .
from 2007 , the government also wants to implement a system of storing biometric data , such as fingerprints and photographic images of the iris , on all british citizens . holes in security such a data bank is but a distant dream for wolfgang speck , head of the german police union .
" compared to england , we are at the start of the fight against terrorism , and we have a lot of catching up to do , " speck said .
he added that an anti-terror law such as britian 's controversial offering would be inconceivable in germany , where it is impossible to hold a suspected terrorist for longer than 48 hours without a judicial ruling . speck said he believes that germans underestimate the threat of terror , adding that there is currently no legal basis for data exchange between regional criminal investigation departments or the federal criminal investigators and public prosecutors .
" with regards to easy terrorist targets , we do n't have the situation under control at the moment , " speck said . as for london , some argue that the tough measures currently in place are precisely what has spared the city the horrors of a terrorist attack , but legal expert gearty sees it differently . " the prophecies of the police and the secret service have been proved wrong , which is why the judges are speaking out against the way in which terrorism is being fought at the expense of civil liberty , " gearty said .
he believes that if there had been a wave of terrorist violence , the decision at the house of lords would have been different . georg matthes , dw.world.de -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany creates new terror center german interior minister otto schily has opened a new center for combating terrorism in berlin .

britain 's highest court recently ruled that tony blair 's answer exceeds the acceptable . prime minister blair is well-known for his hard-line approach to fighting terrorism , both at home and abroad .
in the wake of the world trade center attacks in new york , he quickly forced through a far-reaching anti-terror law , under which suspicious foreigners can be locked away without charge of trial , for an indefinite period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair now , britain 's highest court , the house of lords , has deemed the legislation a fundamental violation of democratic norms and the european human rights convention .
although not binding , the verdict could change the fate of the nine foreign prisoners who have been serving time in british prisons without legal proceedings for the past three years .
it puts the onus on parliament to amend the law and bring it in line with the european charter . " the real threat to the life of the nation , in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values , comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these , " lord leonard hoffmann wrote . the civilian case governments across europe responded to the sept .
11 attacks by restricting their citizens ' basic civil liberties .
conor gearty , a legal expert for terrorism and civil rights at the london school of economics , believes england was particularly hard hit .
" liberal freedom in our country is slowly but surely being undermined by unscrupulous bugging and surveillance methods , " gearty said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storing of biometric data could become standard in britain unlike germany , britain does n't currently have a system of national identity cards , although tony blair sees their reintroduction into uk society as a key weapon in his anti-terror campaign .
on monday , the prime minister won resounding support for his plans when 385 members of parliament voted in favor , compared to 93 against , of resurrecting the cards , which were abolished under winston churchill more than fifty years ago . but the plans , which opponents in the parliamentary ranks say would lead to the creation of a " big brother " state , go further than national id cards .
from 2007 , the government also wants to implement a system of storing biometric data , such as fingerprints and photographic images of the iris , on all british citizens . holes in security such a data bank is but a distant dream for wolfgang speck , head of the german police union .
" compared to england , we are at the start of the fight against terrorism , and we have a lot of catching up to do , " speck said .
he added that an anti-terror law such as britian 's controversial offering would be inconceivable in germany , where it is impossible to hold a suspected terrorist for longer than 48 hours without a judicial ruling . speck said he believes that germans underestimate the threat of terror , adding that there is currently no legal basis for data exchange between regional criminal investigation departments or the federal criminal investigators and public prosecutors .
" with regards to easy terrorist targets , we do n't have the situation under control at the moment , " speck said . as for london , some argue that the tough measures currently in place are precisely what has spared the city the horrors of a terrorist attack , but legal expert gearty sees it differently . " the prophecies of the police and the secret service have been proved wrong , which is why the judges are speaking out against the way in which terrorism is being fought at the expense of civil liberty , " gearty said .

" setback for merkel meyer 's departure is a new setback to merkel 's hopes of running successfully against gerhard schröder for chancellor in the 2006 general elections . merkel has also been hurt by the recent departure of her finance policy expert friedrich merz and health policy expert horst seehofer .

the german government is going on a new offensive against smoking , asking the nation 's restaurants to provide more space for non-smokers and pushing for a ban on lighting up in hospitals . if berlin has its way , 40 percent of seats in german restaurants will be reserved for non-smokers .
marion caspers-merk , the federal government 's drug commissioner , announced on tuesday that the government is stepping up its anti-smoking campaign , hoping to get not only restaurants , but german hospitals to limit or eliminate smoking on their premises .
the government plans to meet with germany 's restaurant and hotel association to ask them to voluntarily enlarge the non-smoking areas in their establishments .
caspers-merk said germany is looking at austria for its model and hopes to convince the hospitality sector to impose limits on smoking step by step . " non-smoking should be the norm in germany , " caspers-merk told reporters . trend toward not lighting up there are signs that the trend is heading in that direction , particularly among young people .
for the first time in years , the number of smokers between the ages of 12 and 17 has decreased .
in 1997 , 28 percent of this age group smoked ; by 2004 , that number had gone down to 23 percent .
a current study carried out by the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- shows that 65 percent of 12- to 25-year-olds are non-smokers , up from 56 percent in 1979 . caspers-merk said part of the reason for the declining numbers of young smokers has to do with tobacco taxes which have been continually raised for several years , most recently on dec .

while she said smoking among young people was increasingly being seen as " uncool , " she admitted that in eastern germany , the number of youth taking up the habit continued to increase .
for that reason , she wants to expand the smoking ban in german schools .
several states already have strict prohibitions against smoking on school grounds . to encourage more people to stub out their cigarettes , the bzga has begun offering a special " start packet " for those wanting to make their lives smoke free . the director of the bzga , elisabeth pott , complained that there is still too much " hidden " advertising of cigarettes , especially in films , where cool characters often light up .

the german government is going on a new offensive against smoking , asking the nation 's restaurants to provide more space for non-smokers and pushing for a ban on lighting up in hospitals . if berlin has its way , 40 percent of seats in german restaurants will be reserved for non-smokers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.12.2004 doing away with discrimination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : covered , among others : age , sex and disability the german government plans to introduce a law banning discrimination in a wide range of areas .
but critics say the bill will simply create even more red tape for the private sector . a disabled person wanting to enter a stylish disco , a turkish family or homosexual couple looking for an apartment , women earning less than their male counterparts for the same work : all of these are groups facing discrimination in germany on a daily basis .
but this is going to change . the european union requires all of its member states to give people legal mechanisms to battle discrimination on the basis of sex , racial or ethnic origin , age , disability , religion and sexual orientation .
germany ’ s ruling red-green coalition government has now introduced a planned anti-discrimination law to implement these eu directives . “ people discriminated against are no longer just victims , ” said irmingard schewe-gerigk , the women ’ s affairs spokeswoman for the greens .
“ they can now demand their rights with confidence . ” putting an end to “ no jews or disabled people ” the new legislation will be submitted to parliament ’ s lower house , the bundestag , next month .
it will prohibit discrimination in a wide range of areas , including jobs , working conditions , pay , education , as well as access to goods and services . in practical terms , the proposed legislation will mean that landlords can ’ t turn away a potential tenant because he is a muslim , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned anti-discrimination law also helps gay people “ newspaper ads saying things such as ‘ no jews or disabled people ’ will be banned , ” said volker beck , the general secretary of the greens ’ parliamentary group . the legislation would also require insurance companies to justify why their policies differ according to a person ’ s sex or sexual orientation . “ it will no longer be possible for health insurers to refuse cover to homosexuals on the grounds that they belong to a group at high risk of hiv , ” beck said . an unnecessary burden for the german economy but both germany ’ s conservative opposition cdu / csu and the private sector are unhappy with the bill .
although all welcome the moves to fight discrimination , they criticize that it will generate over-regulation . “ it will create a new bureaucracy monster instead of reducing red tape and saving costs , ” the cdu / csu parliamentary faction said in a statement . dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ' associations bda said the german economy would be unnecessarily burdened with such a law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt is not in favor of the new legislation “ the draft law is bureaucratic , incalculable , completely overdrawn and incompatible with the basic principles of our civil law and our labor relations , ” hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- said . the federal justice ministry dismissed these claims .
spokesman ulf gerder said the anti-discrimination law would not affect 95 percent of the population . “ most people are sufficiently informed about article 3 of the german constitution , which forbids discrimination , ” he said . but there were 5 percent of the population who neglected to follow these principles of equality . “ in these cases , there is every reason for the law and it is necessary , ” gerder said . no american conditions so will the country be facing a surge of legal battles in the future ?
ursula engelen-kefer , deputy head of the trade union confederation dgb , said no . “ opponents are presenting a horror scenario of compensation payments or a wave of lawsuits as in the united states , but this is utterly unfounded , ” engelen-kefer said . the law does have its problematic aspects , though , beck of the greens party said .
the burden of proof lies with the party being discriminated , he said .
so landlords , employers or nightclub owners remain innocent until proven guilty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law will not require uni-sex saunas however , the elderly will continue to be able to enjoy those senior citizen portions in restaurants .
and women who prefer visiting the sauna on female-only days can breathe a sigh of relief .

some tradition-loving americans have got into a bit of a pickle over their christmas facts .
the word on the festive us grapevine is that come dec .
24 , germans hide an ornamental glass gherkin on their trees . an amusing legend has apparently found a place in the collective imagination of the american people - and into the cash registers of american retailers .
the story goes a little like this : on christmas eve , german mommies and daddies send their children to play in the snow or to snuggle up by the fireside reading books and eating lebkuchen , whilst they unpack the box of glittering glass ornaments to hang from the freshly felled tree .
they cover the tree in ribbons , bows , apples , nuts and shiny decorations before turning their attention to the pickle .
so special is its place in the sparkling ranks of glass ornaments , that it 's hidden among its lesser contemporaries for the gleeful wee ones to find .
the finder is rewarded with the ultimate yuletide thrill of being allowed to open the first gift . cash registers ring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among candles and angels , there must be room for a pickle it 's a quaint and wholesome tale , but as tall as the average german tannenbaum .
in germany at least .
at the far side of the atlantic , americans are blissfully ignorant that the tradition in which they so believe and delight is not a slice of imported magic but of pure fabrication .

britain 's highest court recently ruled that tony blair 's answer exceeds the acceptable . prime minister blair is well-known for his hard-line approach to fighting terrorism , both at home and abroad .
in the wake of the world trade center attacks in new york , he quickly forced through a far-reaching anti-terror law , under which suspicious foreigners can be locked away without charge of trial , for an indefinite period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair now , britain 's highest court , the house of lords , has deemed the legislation a fundamental violation of democratic norms and the european human rights convention .
although not binding , the verdict could change the fate of the nine foreign prisoners who have been serving time in british prisons without legal proceedings for the past three years .
it puts the onus on parliament to amend the law and bring it in line with the european charter . " the real threat to the life of the nation , in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values , comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these , " lord leonard hoffmann wrote . the civilian case governments across europe responded to the sept .

on monday , the prime minister won resounding support for his plans when 385 members of parliament voted in favor , compared to 93 against , of resurrecting the cards , which were abolished under winston churchill more than fifty years ago . but the plans , which opponents in the parliamentary ranks say would lead to the creation of a " big brother " state , go further than national id cards .
from 2007 , the government also wants to implement a system of storing biometric data , such as fingerprints and photographic images of the iris , on all british citizens . holes in security such a data bank is but a distant dream for wolfgang speck , head of the german police union .
" compared to england , we are at the start of the fight against terrorism , and we have a lot of catching up to do , " speck said .
he added that an anti-terror law such as britian 's controversial offering would be inconceivable in germany , where it is impossible to hold a suspected terrorist for longer than 48 hours without a judicial ruling . speck said he believes that germans underestimate the threat of terror , adding that there is currently no legal basis for data exchange between regional criminal investigation departments or the federal criminal investigators and public prosecutors .
" with regards to easy terrorist targets , we do n't have the situation under control at the moment , " speck said . as for london , some argue that the tough measures currently in place are precisely what has spared the city the horrors of a terrorist attack , but legal expert gearty sees it differently .

britain 's highest court recently ruled that tony blair 's answer exceeds the acceptable . prime minister blair is well-known for his hard-line approach to fighting terrorism , both at home and abroad .
in the wake of the world trade center attacks in new york , he quickly forced through a far-reaching anti-terror law , under which suspicious foreigners can be locked away without charge of trial , for an indefinite period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair now , britain 's highest court , the house of lords , has deemed the legislation a fundamental violation of democratic norms and the european human rights convention .
although not binding , the verdict could change the fate of the nine foreign prisoners who have been serving time in british prisons without legal proceedings for the past three years .
it puts the onus on parliament to amend the law and bring it in line with the european charter . " the real threat to the life of the nation , in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values , comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these , " lord leonard hoffmann wrote . the civilian case governments across europe responded to the sept .
11 attacks by restricting their citizens ' basic civil liberties .
conor gearty , a legal expert for terrorism and civil rights at the london school of economics , believes england was particularly hard hit .
" liberal freedom in our country is slowly but surely being undermined by unscrupulous bugging and surveillance methods , " gearty said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storing of biometric data could become standard in britain unlike germany , britain does n't currently have a system of national identity cards , although tony blair sees their reintroduction into uk society as a key weapon in his anti-terror campaign .
on monday , the prime minister won resounding support for his plans when 385 members of parliament voted in favor , compared to 93 against , of resurrecting the cards , which were abolished under winston churchill more than fifty years ago . but the plans , which opponents in the parliamentary ranks say would lead to the creation of a " big brother " state , go further than national id cards .
from 2007 , the government also wants to implement a system of storing biometric data , such as fingerprints and photographic images of the iris , on all british citizens . holes in security such a data bank is but a distant dream for wolfgang speck , head of the german police union .
" compared to england , we are at the start of the fight against terrorism , and we have a lot of catching up to do , " speck said .

but critics say the bill will simply create even more red tape for the private sector . a disabled person wanting to enter a stylish disco , a turkish family or homosexual couple looking for an apartment , women earning less than their male counterparts for the same work : all of these are groups facing discrimination in germany on a daily basis .
but this is going to change . the european union requires all of its member states to give people legal mechanisms to battle discrimination on the basis of sex , racial or ethnic origin , age , disability , religion and sexual orientation .

some tradition-loving americans have got into a bit of a pickle over their christmas facts .
the word on the festive us grapevine is that come dec .
24 , germans hide an ornamental glass gherkin on their trees . an amusing legend has apparently found a place in the collective imagination of the american people - and into the cash registers of american retailers .
the story goes a little like this : on christmas eve , german mommies and daddies send their children to play in the snow or to snuggle up by the fireside reading books and eating lebkuchen , whilst they unpack the box of glittering glass ornaments to hang from the freshly felled tree .
they cover the tree in ribbons , bows , apples , nuts and shiny decorations before turning their attention to the pickle .
so special is its place in the sparkling ranks of glass ornaments , that it 's hidden among its lesser contemporaries for the gleeful wee ones to find .
the finder is rewarded with the ultimate yuletide thrill of being allowed to open the first gift . cash registers ring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among candles and angels , there must be room for a pickle it 's a quaint and wholesome tale , but as tall as the average german tannenbaum .
in germany at least .
at the far side of the atlantic , americans are blissfully ignorant that the tradition in which they so believe and delight is not a slice of imported magic but of pure fabrication .
and there is no consensus about where or how the story was born , although the range of possible explanations include the idea that the spherical shape of truly traditional hand-blown glass ornaments gradually become elongated and acquired a pimpled surface .
a more obscure version of events has st. nikolaus rescuing two helpless young spanish boys who were locked in a pickle barrel by a wicked old thief .
if nothing else , this tale of teutonic tradition has fairytale financial implications for all those involved in what has become a seasonally booming business . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " take a look at a collection of our best " and finally " stories .
targeting santa groups in germany and austria have launched campaigns protesting the commercialization of christmas .
the target of their ire is santa , an american import who they say does n't represent what the holiday is all about .

but this is going to change . the european union requires all of its member states to give people legal mechanisms to battle discrimination on the basis of sex , racial or ethnic origin , age , disability , religion and sexual orientation .
germany ’ s ruling red-green coalition government has now introduced a planned anti-discrimination law to implement these eu directives . “ people discriminated against are no longer just victims , ” said irmingard schewe-gerigk , the women ’ s affairs spokeswoman for the greens .

the german government is going on a new offensive against smoking , asking the nation 's restaurants to provide more space for non-smokers and pushing for a ban on lighting up in hospitals . if berlin has its way , 40 percent of seats in german restaurants will be reserved for non-smokers .
marion caspers-merk , the federal government 's drug commissioner , announced on tuesday that the government is stepping up its anti-smoking campaign , hoping to get not only restaurants , but german hospitals to limit or eliminate smoking on their premises .
the government plans to meet with germany 's restaurant and hotel association to ask them to voluntarily enlarge the non-smoking areas in their establishments .
caspers-merk said germany is looking at austria for its model and hopes to convince the hospitality sector to impose limits on smoking step by step . " non-smoking should be the norm in germany , " caspers-merk told reporters . trend toward not lighting up there are signs that the trend is heading in that direction , particularly among young people .
for the first time in years , the number of smokers between the ages of 12 and 17 has decreased .
in 1997 , 28 percent of this age group smoked ; by 2004 , that number had gone down to 23 percent .
a current study carried out by the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- shows that 65 percent of 12- to 25-year-olds are non-smokers , up from 56 percent in 1979 . caspers-merk said part of the reason for the declining numbers of young smokers has to do with tobacco taxes which have been continually raised for several years , most recently on dec .

while she said smoking among young people was increasingly being seen as " uncool , " she admitted that in eastern germany , the number of youth taking up the habit continued to increase .
for that reason , she wants to expand the smoking ban in german schools .
several states already have strict prohibitions against smoking on school grounds . to encourage more people to stub out their cigarettes , the bzga has begun offering a special " start packet " for those wanting to make their lives smoke free . the director of the bzga , elisabeth pott , complained that there is still too much " hidden " advertising of cigarettes , especially in films , where cool characters often light up .
she said young people are especially susceptible to those kinds of messages . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tobacco tax hike hits smokers ' wallets the cost of cigarettes jumped in germany this week as a result of increased taxes .

the german government is going on a new offensive against smoking , asking the nation 's restaurants to provide more space for non-smokers and pushing for a ban on lighting up in hospitals . if berlin has its way , 40 percent of seats in german restaurants will be reserved for non-smokers .
marion caspers-merk , the federal government 's drug commissioner , announced on tuesday that the government is stepping up its anti-smoking campaign , hoping to get not only restaurants , but german hospitals to limit or eliminate smoking on their premises .
the government plans to meet with germany 's restaurant and hotel association to ask them to voluntarily enlarge the non-smoking areas in their establishments .
caspers-merk said germany is looking at austria for its model and hopes to convince the hospitality sector to impose limits on smoking step by step . " non-smoking should be the norm in germany , " caspers-merk told reporters . trend toward not lighting up there are signs that the trend is heading in that direction , particularly among young people .
for the first time in years , the number of smokers between the ages of 12 and 17 has decreased .
in 1997 , 28 percent of this age group smoked ; by 2004 , that number had gone down to 23 percent .
a current study carried out by the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- shows that 65 percent of 12- to 25-year-olds are non-smokers , up from 56 percent in 1979 . caspers-merk said part of the reason for the declining numbers of young smokers has to do with tobacco taxes which have been continually raised for several years , most recently on dec .

while she said smoking among young people was increasingly being seen as " uncool , " she admitted that in eastern germany , the number of youth taking up the habit continued to increase .
for that reason , she wants to expand the smoking ban in german schools .
several states already have strict prohibitions against smoking on school grounds . to encourage more people to stub out their cigarettes , the bzga has begun offering a special " start packet " for those wanting to make their lives smoke free . the director of the bzga , elisabeth pott , complained that there is still too much " hidden " advertising of cigarettes , especially in films , where cool characters often light up .

the german government is going on a new offensive against smoking , asking the nation 's restaurants to provide more space for non-smokers and pushing for a ban on lighting up in hospitals . if berlin has its way , 40 percent of seats in german restaurants will be reserved for non-smokers .
marion caspers-merk , the federal government 's drug commissioner , announced on tuesday that the government is stepping up its anti-smoking campaign , hoping to get not only restaurants , but german hospitals to limit or eliminate smoking on their premises .
the government plans to meet with germany 's restaurant and hotel association to ask them to voluntarily enlarge the non-smoking areas in their establishments .
caspers-merk said germany is looking at austria for its model and hopes to convince the hospitality sector to impose limits on smoking step by step . " non-smoking should be the norm in germany , " caspers-merk told reporters . trend toward not lighting up there are signs that the trend is heading in that direction , particularly among young people .
for the first time in years , the number of smokers between the ages of 12 and 17 has decreased .
in 1997 , 28 percent of this age group smoked ; by 2004 , that number had gone down to 23 percent .
a current study carried out by the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- shows that 65 percent of 12- to 25-year-olds are non-smokers , up from 56 percent in 1979 . caspers-merk said part of the reason for the declining numbers of young smokers has to do with tobacco taxes which have been continually raised for several years , most recently on dec .

while she said smoking among young people was increasingly being seen as " uncool , " she admitted that in eastern germany , the number of youth taking up the habit continued to increase .
for that reason , she wants to expand the smoking ban in german schools .
several states already have strict prohibitions against smoking on school grounds . to encourage more people to stub out their cigarettes , the bzga has begun offering a special " start packet " for those wanting to make their lives smoke free . the director of the bzga , elisabeth pott , complained that there is still too much " hidden " advertising of cigarettes , especially in films , where cool characters often light up .
she said young people are especially susceptible to those kinds of messages . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tobacco tax hike hits smokers ' wallets the cost of cigarettes jumped in germany this week as a result of increased taxes .

britain 's highest court recently ruled that tony blair 's answer exceeds the acceptable . prime minister blair is well-known for his hard-line approach to fighting terrorism , both at home and abroad .
in the wake of the world trade center attacks in new york , he quickly forced through a far-reaching anti-terror law , under which suspicious foreigners can be locked away without charge of trial , for an indefinite period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair now , britain 's highest court , the house of lords , has deemed the legislation a fundamental violation of democratic norms and the european human rights convention .
although not binding , the verdict could change the fate of the nine foreign prisoners who have been serving time in british prisons without legal proceedings for the past three years .
it puts the onus on parliament to amend the law and bring it in line with the european charter . " the real threat to the life of the nation , in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values , comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these , " lord leonard hoffmann wrote . the civilian case governments across europe responded to the sept .
11 attacks by restricting their citizens ' basic civil liberties .
conor gearty , a legal expert for terrorism and civil rights at the london school of economics , believes england was particularly hard hit .
" liberal freedom in our country is slowly but surely being undermined by unscrupulous bugging and surveillance methods , " gearty said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storing of biometric data could become standard in britain unlike germany , britain does n't currently have a system of national identity cards , although tony blair sees their reintroduction into uk society as a key weapon in his anti-terror campaign .
on monday , the prime minister won resounding support for his plans when 385 members of parliament voted in favor , compared to 93 against , of resurrecting the cards , which were abolished under winston churchill more than fifty years ago . but the plans , which opponents in the parliamentary ranks say would lead to the creation of a " big brother " state , go further than national id cards .
from 2007 , the government also wants to implement a system of storing biometric data , such as fingerprints and photographic images of the iris , on all british citizens . holes in security such a data bank is but a distant dream for wolfgang speck , head of the german police union .
" compared to england , we are at the start of the fight against terrorism , and we have a lot of catching up to do , " speck said .
he added that an anti-terror law such as britian 's controversial offering would be inconceivable in germany , where it is impossible to hold a suspected terrorist for longer than 48 hours without a judicial ruling . speck said he believes that germans underestimate the threat of terror , adding that there is currently no legal basis for data exchange between regional criminal investigation departments or the federal criminal investigators and public prosecutors .
" with regards to easy terrorist targets , we do n't have the situation under control at the moment , " speck said . as for london , some argue that the tough measures currently in place are precisely what has spared the city the horrors of a terrorist attack , but legal expert gearty sees it differently . " the prophecies of the police and the secret service have been proved wrong , which is why the judges are speaking out against the way in which terrorism is being fought at the expense of civil liberty , " gearty said .
he believes that if there had been a wave of terrorist violence , the decision at the house of lords would have been different . georg matthes , dw.world.de -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany creates new terror center german interior minister otto schily has opened a new center for combating terrorism in berlin .

" all important questions will be decided within the group and not in public , " enders told daily die welt in an interview .
forgeard and enders have both been nominated to take over the running of eads next july when the current co-chairmen , rainer hertrich and philippe camus , step down .
but forgeard , currently head of eads ' airbus unit , has been very vocal in arguing for the current system of dual leadership to be abolished and for eads to be headed by a single chairman .
enders is seen as representing germany 's interests within eads , because he is a close ally of juergen schrempp , the head of german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler which holds a 30.07-percent stake in eads .
enders told die welt that the success of eads lay in its " european cultural diversity . " dw-world.de less turbulence for airbus , boeing eu trade commissioner peter mandelson and his us counterpart , robert zoellick , have decided to allow more time for talks to settle a transatlantic row over government aid for aviation rivals boeing and airbus .

forgeard and enders have both been nominated to take over the running of eads next july when the current co-chairmen , rainer hertrich and philippe camus , step down .
but forgeard , currently head of eads ' airbus unit , has been very vocal in arguing for the current system of dual leadership to be abolished and for eads to be headed by a single chairman .
enders is seen as representing germany 's interests within eads , because he is a close ally of juergen schrempp , the head of german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler which holds a 30.07-percent stake in eads .
enders told die welt that the success of eads lay in its " european cultural diversity . " dw-world.de less turbulence for airbus , boeing eu trade commissioner peter mandelson and his us counterpart , robert zoellick , have decided to allow more time for talks to settle a transatlantic row over government aid for aviation rivals boeing and airbus .

" all important questions will be decided within the group and not in public , " enders told daily die welt in an interview .
forgeard and enders have both been nominated to take over the running of eads next july when the current co-chairmen , rainer hertrich and philippe camus , step down .
but forgeard , currently head of eads ' airbus unit , has been very vocal in arguing for the current system of dual leadership to be abolished and for eads to be headed by a single chairman .
enders is seen as representing germany 's interests within eads , because he is a close ally of juergen schrempp , the head of german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler which holds a 30.07-percent stake in eads .
enders told die welt that the success of eads lay in its " european cultural diversity . " dw-world.de less turbulence for airbus , boeing eu trade commissioner peter mandelson and his us counterpart , robert zoellick , have decided to allow more time for talks to settle a transatlantic row over government aid for aviation rivals boeing and airbus .

forgeard and enders have both been nominated to take over the running of eads next july when the current co-chairmen , rainer hertrich and philippe camus , step down .
but forgeard , currently head of eads ' airbus unit , has been very vocal in arguing for the current system of dual leadership to be abolished and for eads to be headed by a single chairman .
enders is seen as representing germany 's interests within eads , because he is a close ally of juergen schrempp , the head of german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler which holds a 30.07-percent stake in eads .
enders told die welt that the success of eads lay in its " european cultural diversity . " dw-world.de less turbulence for airbus , boeing eu trade commissioner peter mandelson and his us counterpart , robert zoellick , have decided to allow more time for talks to settle a transatlantic row over government aid for aviation rivals boeing and airbus .

but critics say the bill will simply create even more red tape for the private sector . a disabled person wanting to enter a stylish disco , a turkish family or homosexual couple looking for an apartment , women earning less than their male counterparts for the same work : all of these are groups facing discrimination in germany on a daily basis .
but this is going to change . the european union requires all of its member states to give people legal mechanisms to battle discrimination on the basis of sex , racial or ethnic origin , age , disability , religion and sexual orientation .
germany ’ s ruling red-green coalition government has now introduced a planned anti-discrimination law to implement these eu directives . “ people discriminated against are no longer just victims , ” said irmingard schewe-gerigk , the women ’ s affairs spokeswoman for the greens .
“ they can now demand their rights with confidence . ” putting an end to “ no jews or disabled people ” the new legislation will be submitted to parliament ’ s lower house , the bundestag , next month .
it will prohibit discrimination in a wide range of areas , including jobs , working conditions , pay , education , as well as access to goods and services . in practical terms , the proposed legislation will mean that landlords can ’ t turn away a potential tenant because he is a muslim , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned anti-discrimination law also helps gay people “ newspaper ads saying things such as ‘ no jews or disabled people ’ will be banned , ” said volker beck , the general secretary of the greens ’ parliamentary group . the legislation would also require insurance companies to justify why their policies differ according to a person ’ s sex or sexual orientation . “ it will no longer be possible for health insurers to refuse cover to homosexuals on the grounds that they belong to a group at high risk of hiv , ” beck said . an unnecessary burden for the german economy but both germany ’ s conservative opposition cdu / csu and the private sector are unhappy with the bill .
although all welcome the moves to fight discrimination , they criticize that it will generate over-regulation . “ it will create a new bureaucracy monster instead of reducing red tape and saving costs , ” the cdu / csu parliamentary faction said in a statement . dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ' associations bda said the german economy would be unnecessarily burdened with such a law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt is not in favor of the new legislation “ the draft law is bureaucratic , incalculable , completely overdrawn and incompatible with the basic principles of our civil law and our labor relations , ” hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- said . the federal justice ministry dismissed these claims .
spokesman ulf gerder said the anti-discrimination law would not affect 95 percent of the population . “ most people are sufficiently informed about article 3 of the german constitution , which forbids discrimination , ” he said . but there were 5 percent of the population who neglected to follow these principles of equality . “ in these cases , there is every reason for the law and it is necessary , ” gerder said . no american conditions so will the country be facing a surge of legal battles in the future ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.12.2004 doing away with discrimination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : covered , among others : age , sex and disability the german government plans to introduce a law banning discrimination in a wide range of areas .
but critics say the bill will simply create even more red tape for the private sector . a disabled person wanting to enter a stylish disco , a turkish family or homosexual couple looking for an apartment , women earning less than their male counterparts for the same work : all of these are groups facing discrimination in germany on a daily basis .
but this is going to change . the european union requires all of its member states to give people legal mechanisms to battle discrimination on the basis of sex , racial or ethnic origin , age , disability , religion and sexual orientation .
germany ’ s ruling red-green coalition government has now introduced a planned anti-discrimination law to implement these eu directives . “ people discriminated against are no longer just victims , ” said irmingard schewe-gerigk , the women ’ s affairs spokeswoman for the greens .
“ they can now demand their rights with confidence . ” putting an end to “ no jews or disabled people ” the new legislation will be submitted to parliament ’ s lower house , the bundestag , next month .
it will prohibit discrimination in a wide range of areas , including jobs , working conditions , pay , education , as well as access to goods and services . in practical terms , the proposed legislation will mean that landlords can ’ t turn away a potential tenant because he is a muslim , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned anti-discrimination law also helps gay people “ newspaper ads saying things such as ‘ no jews or disabled people ’ will be banned , ” said volker beck , the general secretary of the greens ’ parliamentary group . the legislation would also require insurance companies to justify why their policies differ according to a person ’ s sex or sexual orientation . “ it will no longer be possible for health insurers to refuse cover to homosexuals on the grounds that they belong to a group at high risk of hiv , ” beck said . an unnecessary burden for the german economy but both germany ’ s conservative opposition cdu / csu and the private sector are unhappy with the bill .
although all welcome the moves to fight discrimination , they criticize that it will generate over-regulation . “ it will create a new bureaucracy monster instead of reducing red tape and saving costs , ” the cdu / csu parliamentary faction said in a statement . dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ' associations bda said the german economy would be unnecessarily burdened with such a law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt is not in favor of the new legislation “ the draft law is bureaucratic , incalculable , completely overdrawn and incompatible with the basic principles of our civil law and our labor relations , ” hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- said . the federal justice ministry dismissed these claims .
spokesman ulf gerder said the anti-discrimination law would not affect 95 percent of the population . “ most people are sufficiently informed about article 3 of the german constitution , which forbids discrimination , ” he said . but there were 5 percent of the population who neglected to follow these principles of equality . “ in these cases , there is every reason for the law and it is necessary , ” gerder said . no american conditions so will the country be facing a surge of legal battles in the future ?
ursula engelen-kefer , deputy head of the trade union confederation dgb , said no . “ opponents are presenting a horror scenario of compensation payments or a wave of lawsuits as in the united states , but this is utterly unfounded , ” engelen-kefer said . the law does have its problematic aspects , though , beck of the greens party said .
the burden of proof lies with the party being discriminated , he said .
so landlords , employers or nightclub owners remain innocent until proven guilty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law will not require uni-sex saunas however , the elderly will continue to be able to enjoy those senior citizen portions in restaurants .
and women who prefer visiting the sauna on female-only days can breathe a sigh of relief .
these forms of “ discrimination ” will continue to exist . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working women face upward battle germany is lagging far behind when it comes to women in top managerial positions .

some tradition-loving americans have got into a bit of a pickle over their christmas facts .
the word on the festive us grapevine is that come dec .
24 , germans hide an ornamental glass gherkin on their trees . an amusing legend has apparently found a place in the collective imagination of the american people - and into the cash registers of american retailers .
the story goes a little like this : on christmas eve , german mommies and daddies send their children to play in the snow or to snuggle up by the fireside reading books and eating lebkuchen , whilst they unpack the box of glittering glass ornaments to hang from the freshly felled tree .
they cover the tree in ribbons , bows , apples , nuts and shiny decorations before turning their attention to the pickle .
so special is its place in the sparkling ranks of glass ornaments , that it 's hidden among its lesser contemporaries for the gleeful wee ones to find .
the finder is rewarded with the ultimate yuletide thrill of being allowed to open the first gift . cash registers ring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among candles and angels , there must be room for a pickle it 's a quaint and wholesome tale , but as tall as the average german tannenbaum .
in germany at least .
at the far side of the atlantic , americans are blissfully ignorant that the tradition in which they so believe and delight is not a slice of imported magic but of pure fabrication .
and there is no consensus about where or how the story was born , although the range of possible explanations include the idea that the spherical shape of truly traditional hand-blown glass ornaments gradually become elongated and acquired a pimpled surface .
a more obscure version of events has st. nikolaus rescuing two helpless young spanish boys who were locked in a pickle barrel by a wicked old thief .
if nothing else , this tale of teutonic tradition has fairytale financial implications for all those involved in what has become a seasonally booming business . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " take a look at a collection of our best " and finally " stories .
targeting santa groups in germany and austria have launched campaigns protesting the commercialization of christmas .
the target of their ire is santa , an american import who they say does n't represent what the holiday is all about .

britain 's highest court recently ruled that tony blair 's answer exceeds the acceptable . prime minister blair is well-known for his hard-line approach to fighting terrorism , both at home and abroad .
in the wake of the world trade center attacks in new york , he quickly forced through a far-reaching anti-terror law , under which suspicious foreigners can be locked away without charge of trial , for an indefinite period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair now , britain 's highest court , the house of lords , has deemed the legislation a fundamental violation of democratic norms and the european human rights convention .
although not binding , the verdict could change the fate of the nine foreign prisoners who have been serving time in british prisons without legal proceedings for the past three years .
it puts the onus on parliament to amend the law and bring it in line with the european charter .

on monday , the prime minister won resounding support for his plans when 385 members of parliament voted in favor , compared to 93 against , of resurrecting the cards , which were abolished under winston churchill more than fifty years ago . but the plans , which opponents in the parliamentary ranks say would lead to the creation of a " big brother " state , go further than national id cards .
from 2007 , the government also wants to implement a system of storing biometric data , such as fingerprints and photographic images of the iris , on all british citizens . holes in security such a data bank is but a distant dream for wolfgang speck , head of the german police union .
" compared to england , we are at the start of the fight against terrorism , and we have a lot of catching up to do , " speck said .
he added that an anti-terror law such as britian 's controversial offering would be inconceivable in germany , where it is impossible to hold a suspected terrorist for longer than 48 hours without a judicial ruling . speck said he believes that germans underestimate the threat of terror , adding that there is currently no legal basis for data exchange between regional criminal investigation departments or the federal criminal investigators and public prosecutors .
" with regards to easy terrorist targets , we do n't have the situation under control at the moment , " speck said . as for london , some argue that the tough measures currently in place are precisely what has spared the city the horrors of a terrorist attack , but legal expert gearty sees it differently .

britain 's highest court recently ruled that tony blair 's answer exceeds the acceptable . prime minister blair is well-known for his hard-line approach to fighting terrorism , both at home and abroad .
in the wake of the world trade center attacks in new york , he quickly forced through a far-reaching anti-terror law , under which suspicious foreigners can be locked away without charge of trial , for an indefinite period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair now , britain 's highest court , the house of lords , has deemed the legislation a fundamental violation of democratic norms and the european human rights convention .
although not binding , the verdict could change the fate of the nine foreign prisoners who have been serving time in british prisons without legal proceedings for the past three years .
it puts the onus on parliament to amend the law and bring it in line with the european charter . " the real threat to the life of the nation , in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values , comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these , " lord leonard hoffmann wrote . the civilian case governments across europe responded to the sept .
11 attacks by restricting their citizens ' basic civil liberties .
conor gearty , a legal expert for terrorism and civil rights at the london school of economics , believes england was particularly hard hit .
" liberal freedom in our country is slowly but surely being undermined by unscrupulous bugging and surveillance methods , " gearty said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storing of biometric data could become standard in britain unlike germany , britain does n't currently have a system of national identity cards , although tony blair sees their reintroduction into uk society as a key weapon in his anti-terror campaign .
on monday , the prime minister won resounding support for his plans when 385 members of parliament voted in favor , compared to 93 against , of resurrecting the cards , which were abolished under winston churchill more than fifty years ago . but the plans , which opponents in the parliamentary ranks say would lead to the creation of a " big brother " state , go further than national id cards .
from 2007 , the government also wants to implement a system of storing biometric data , such as fingerprints and photographic images of the iris , on all british citizens . holes in security such a data bank is but a distant dream for wolfgang speck , head of the german police union .
" compared to england , we are at the start of the fight against terrorism , and we have a lot of catching up to do , " speck said .
he added that an anti-terror law such as britian 's controversial offering would be inconceivable in germany , where it is impossible to hold a suspected terrorist for longer than 48 hours without a judicial ruling . speck said he believes that germans underestimate the threat of terror , adding that there is currently no legal basis for data exchange between regional criminal investigation departments or the federal criminal investigators and public prosecutors .
" with regards to easy terrorist targets , we do n't have the situation under control at the moment , " speck said . as for london , some argue that the tough measures currently in place are precisely what has spared the city the horrors of a terrorist attack , but legal expert gearty sees it differently . " the prophecies of the police and the secret service have been proved wrong , which is why the judges are speaking out against the way in which terrorism is being fought at the expense of civil liberty , " gearty said .
he believes that if there had been a wave of terrorist violence , the decision at the house of lords would have been different . georg matthes , dw.world.de -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany creates new terror center german interior minister otto schily has opened a new center for combating terrorism in berlin .

britain 's highest court recently ruled that tony blair 's answer exceeds the acceptable . prime minister blair is well-known for his hard-line approach to fighting terrorism , both at home and abroad .
in the wake of the world trade center attacks in new york , he quickly forced through a far-reaching anti-terror law , under which suspicious foreigners can be locked away without charge of trial , for an indefinite period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair now , britain 's highest court , the house of lords , has deemed the legislation a fundamental violation of democratic norms and the european human rights convention .
although not binding , the verdict could change the fate of the nine foreign prisoners who have been serving time in british prisons without legal proceedings for the past three years .
it puts the onus on parliament to amend the law and bring it in line with the european charter . " the real threat to the life of the nation , in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values , comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these , " lord leonard hoffmann wrote . the civilian case governments across europe responded to the sept .
11 attacks by restricting their citizens ' basic civil liberties .
conor gearty , a legal expert for terrorism and civil rights at the london school of economics , believes england was particularly hard hit .
" liberal freedom in our country is slowly but surely being undermined by unscrupulous bugging and surveillance methods , " gearty said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storing of biometric data could become standard in britain unlike germany , britain does n't currently have a system of national identity cards , although tony blair sees their reintroduction into uk society as a key weapon in his anti-terror campaign .
on monday , the prime minister won resounding support for his plans when 385 members of parliament voted in favor , compared to 93 against , of resurrecting the cards , which were abolished under winston churchill more than fifty years ago . but the plans , which opponents in the parliamentary ranks say would lead to the creation of a " big brother " state , go further than national id cards .
from 2007 , the government also wants to implement a system of storing biometric data , such as fingerprints and photographic images of the iris , on all british citizens . holes in security such a data bank is but a distant dream for wolfgang speck , head of the german police union .
" compared to england , we are at the start of the fight against terrorism , and we have a lot of catching up to do , " speck said .
he added that an anti-terror law such as britian 's controversial offering would be inconceivable in germany , where it is impossible to hold a suspected terrorist for longer than 48 hours without a judicial ruling . speck said he believes that germans underestimate the threat of terror , adding that there is currently no legal basis for data exchange between regional criminal investigation departments or the federal criminal investigators and public prosecutors .
" with regards to easy terrorist targets , we do n't have the situation under control at the moment , " speck said . as for london , some argue that the tough measures currently in place are precisely what has spared the city the horrors of a terrorist attack , but legal expert gearty sees it differently . " the prophecies of the police and the secret service have been proved wrong , which is why the judges are speaking out against the way in which terrorism is being fought at the expense of civil liberty , " gearty said .

britain 's highest court recently ruled that tony blair 's answer exceeds the acceptable . prime minister blair is well-known for his hard-line approach to fighting terrorism , both at home and abroad .
in the wake of the world trade center attacks in new york , he quickly forced through a far-reaching anti-terror law , under which suspicious foreigners can be locked away without charge of trial , for an indefinite period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair now , britain 's highest court , the house of lords , has deemed the legislation a fundamental violation of democratic norms and the european human rights convention .
although not binding , the verdict could change the fate of the nine foreign prisoners who have been serving time in british prisons without legal proceedings for the past three years .
it puts the onus on parliament to amend the law and bring it in line with the european charter . " the real threat to the life of the nation , in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values , comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these , " lord leonard hoffmann wrote . the civilian case governments across europe responded to the sept .
11 attacks by restricting their citizens ' basic civil liberties .
conor gearty , a legal expert for terrorism and civil rights at the london school of economics , believes england was particularly hard hit .
" liberal freedom in our country is slowly but surely being undermined by unscrupulous bugging and surveillance methods , " gearty said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storing of biometric data could become standard in britain unlike germany , britain does n't currently have a system of national identity cards , although tony blair sees their reintroduction into uk society as a key weapon in his anti-terror campaign .
on monday , the prime minister won resounding support for his plans when 385 members of parliament voted in favor , compared to 93 against , of resurrecting the cards , which were abolished under winston churchill more than fifty years ago . but the plans , which opponents in the parliamentary ranks say would lead to the creation of a " big brother " state , go further than national id cards .
from 2007 , the government also wants to implement a system of storing biometric data , such as fingerprints and photographic images of the iris , on all british citizens . holes in security such a data bank is but a distant dream for wolfgang speck , head of the german police union .
" compared to england , we are at the start of the fight against terrorism , and we have a lot of catching up to do , " speck said .
he added that an anti-terror law such as britian 's controversial offering would be inconceivable in germany , where it is impossible to hold a suspected terrorist for longer than 48 hours without a judicial ruling . speck said he believes that germans underestimate the threat of terror , adding that there is currently no legal basis for data exchange between regional criminal investigation departments or the federal criminal investigators and public prosecutors .
" with regards to easy terrorist targets , we do n't have the situation under control at the moment , " speck said . as for london , some argue that the tough measures currently in place are precisely what has spared the city the horrors of a terrorist attack , but legal expert gearty sees it differently . " the prophecies of the police and the secret service have been proved wrong , which is why the judges are speaking out against the way in which terrorism is being fought at the expense of civil liberty , " gearty said .
he believes that if there had been a wave of terrorist violence , the decision at the house of lords would have been different . georg matthes , dw.world.de -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany creates new terror center german interior minister otto schily has opened a new center for combating terrorism in berlin .

so special is its place in the sparkling ranks of glass ornaments , that it 's hidden among its lesser contemporaries for the gleeful wee ones to find .
the finder is rewarded with the ultimate yuletide thrill of being allowed to open the first gift . cash registers ring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among candles and angels , there must be room for a pickle it 's a quaint and wholesome tale , but as tall as the average german tannenbaum .
in germany at least .
at the far side of the atlantic , americans are blissfully ignorant that the tradition in which they so believe and delight is not a slice of imported magic but of pure fabrication .
and there is no consensus about where or how the story was born , although the range of possible explanations include the idea that the spherical shape of truly traditional hand-blown glass ornaments gradually become elongated and acquired a pimpled surface .
a more obscure version of events has st. nikolaus rescuing two helpless young spanish boys who were locked in a pickle barrel by a wicked old thief .
if nothing else , this tale of teutonic tradition has fairytale financial implications for all those involved in what has become a seasonally booming business . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " take a look at a collection of our best " and finally " stories .
targeting santa groups in germany and austria have launched campaigns protesting the commercialization of christmas .
the target of their ire is santa , an american import who they say does n't represent what the holiday is all about .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.12.2004 doing away with discrimination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : covered , among others : age , sex and disability the german government plans to introduce a law banning discrimination in a wide range of areas .
but critics say the bill will simply create even more red tape for the private sector . a disabled person wanting to enter a stylish disco , a turkish family or homosexual couple looking for an apartment , women earning less than their male counterparts for the same work : all of these are groups facing discrimination in germany on a daily basis .
but this is going to change . the european union requires all of its member states to give people legal mechanisms to battle discrimination on the basis of sex , racial or ethnic origin , age , disability , religion and sexual orientation .
germany ’ s ruling red-green coalition government has now introduced a planned anti-discrimination law to implement these eu directives . “ people discriminated against are no longer just victims , ” said irmingard schewe-gerigk , the women ’ s affairs spokeswoman for the greens .
“ they can now demand their rights with confidence . ” putting an end to “ no jews or disabled people ” the new legislation will be submitted to parliament ’ s lower house , the bundestag , next month .
it will prohibit discrimination in a wide range of areas , including jobs , working conditions , pay , education , as well as access to goods and services . in practical terms , the proposed legislation will mean that landlords can ’ t turn away a potential tenant because he is a muslim , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned anti-discrimination law also helps gay people “ newspaper ads saying things such as ‘ no jews or disabled people ’ will be banned , ” said volker beck , the general secretary of the greens ’ parliamentary group . the legislation would also require insurance companies to justify why their policies differ according to a person ’ s sex or sexual orientation . “ it will no longer be possible for health insurers to refuse cover to homosexuals on the grounds that they belong to a group at high risk of hiv , ” beck said . an unnecessary burden for the german economy but both germany ’ s conservative opposition cdu / csu and the private sector are unhappy with the bill .
although all welcome the moves to fight discrimination , they criticize that it will generate over-regulation . “ it will create a new bureaucracy monster instead of reducing red tape and saving costs , ” the cdu / csu parliamentary faction said in a statement . dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ' associations bda said the german economy would be unnecessarily burdened with such a law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt is not in favor of the new legislation “ the draft law is bureaucratic , incalculable , completely overdrawn and incompatible with the basic principles of our civil law and our labor relations , ” hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- said . the federal justice ministry dismissed these claims .
spokesman ulf gerder said the anti-discrimination law would not affect 95 percent of the population . “ most people are sufficiently informed about article 3 of the german constitution , which forbids discrimination , ” he said . but there were 5 percent of the population who neglected to follow these principles of equality . “ in these cases , there is every reason for the law and it is necessary , ” gerder said . no american conditions so will the country be facing a surge of legal battles in the future ?
ursula engelen-kefer , deputy head of the trade union confederation dgb , said no . “ opponents are presenting a horror scenario of compensation payments or a wave of lawsuits as in the united states , but this is utterly unfounded , ” engelen-kefer said . the law does have its problematic aspects , though , beck of the greens party said .
the burden of proof lies with the party being discriminated , he said .
so landlords , employers or nightclub owners remain innocent until proven guilty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law will not require uni-sex saunas however , the elderly will continue to be able to enjoy those senior citizen portions in restaurants .
and women who prefer visiting the sauna on female-only days can breathe a sigh of relief .

“ they can now demand their rights with confidence . ” putting an end to “ no jews or disabled people ” the new legislation will be submitted to parliament ’ s lower house , the bundestag , next month .

spokesman ulf gerder said the anti-discrimination law would not affect 95 percent of the population . “ most people are sufficiently informed about article 3 of the german constitution , which forbids discrimination , ” he said . but there were 5 percent of the population who neglected to follow these principles of equality . “ in these cases , there is every reason for the law and it is necessary , ” gerder said . no american conditions so will the country be facing a surge of legal battles in the future ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.12.2004 doing away with discrimination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : covered , among others : age , sex and disability the german government plans to introduce a law banning discrimination in a wide range of areas .
but critics say the bill will simply create even more red tape for the private sector . a disabled person wanting to enter a stylish disco , a turkish family or homosexual couple looking for an apartment , women earning less than their male counterparts for the same work : all of these are groups facing discrimination in germany on a daily basis .
but this is going to change . the european union requires all of its member states to give people legal mechanisms to battle discrimination on the basis of sex , racial or ethnic origin , age , disability , religion and sexual orientation .
germany ’ s ruling red-green coalition government has now introduced a planned anti-discrimination law to implement these eu directives . “ people discriminated against are no longer just victims , ” said irmingard schewe-gerigk , the women ’ s affairs spokeswoman for the greens .
“ they can now demand their rights with confidence . ” putting an end to “ no jews or disabled people ” the new legislation will be submitted to parliament ’ s lower house , the bundestag , next month .
it will prohibit discrimination in a wide range of areas , including jobs , working conditions , pay , education , as well as access to goods and services . in practical terms , the proposed legislation will mean that landlords can ’ t turn away a potential tenant because he is a muslim , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned anti-discrimination law also helps gay people “ newspaper ads saying things such as ‘ no jews or disabled people ’ will be banned , ” said volker beck , the general secretary of the greens ’ parliamentary group . the legislation would also require insurance companies to justify why their policies differ according to a person ’ s sex or sexual orientation . “ it will no longer be possible for health insurers to refuse cover to homosexuals on the grounds that they belong to a group at high risk of hiv , ” beck said . an unnecessary burden for the german economy but both germany ’ s conservative opposition cdu / csu and the private sector are unhappy with the bill .
although all welcome the moves to fight discrimination , they criticize that it will generate over-regulation . “ it will create a new bureaucracy monster instead of reducing red tape and saving costs , ” the cdu / csu parliamentary faction said in a statement . dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ' associations bda said the german economy would be unnecessarily burdened with such a law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt is not in favor of the new legislation “ the draft law is bureaucratic , incalculable , completely overdrawn and incompatible with the basic principles of our civil law and our labor relations , ” hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- said . the federal justice ministry dismissed these claims .
spokesman ulf gerder said the anti-discrimination law would not affect 95 percent of the population . “ most people are sufficiently informed about article 3 of the german constitution , which forbids discrimination , ” he said . but there were 5 percent of the population who neglected to follow these principles of equality . “ in these cases , there is every reason for the law and it is necessary , ” gerder said . no american conditions so will the country be facing a surge of legal battles in the future ?
ursula engelen-kefer , deputy head of the trade union confederation dgb , said no . “ opponents are presenting a horror scenario of compensation payments or a wave of lawsuits as in the united states , but this is utterly unfounded , ” engelen-kefer said . the law does have its problematic aspects , though , beck of the greens party said .
the burden of proof lies with the party being discriminated , he said .
so landlords , employers or nightclub owners remain innocent until proven guilty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law will not require uni-sex saunas however , the elderly will continue to be able to enjoy those senior citizen portions in restaurants .

the court is not expected to rule on this for several years .
the second appeal - the subject of wednesday 's verdict - sought suspension of the measures imposed by the commission until the first appeal had been completed . data protection main concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft is based in the us microsoft has already paid the eu-imposed fine , but the company has fiercely opposed any measures that could affect its core strategy , which is based on the integration of new features into the windows operating system . the company argued it would suffer " irreparable damage " if it were forced to pass on confidential programming information to competitors in compliance with the eu order . but microsoft failed to convince the court that it had a reasonable case , that it urgently needed relief , and that the balance of interests between it and the public weighed in its favor . " microsoft has not demonstrated specifically that it might suffer serious and irreparable damage , " the court said in a document obtained by reuters . the president of the court , bo vesterdorf , said that " a number of questions of principle were raised " but that " the requirement relating to urgency is not satisfied . " the eu commission argued that the sanctions would be rendered meaningless if delayed , because the market would have moved on by the time they were implemented . either side can appeal wednesday 's decision to the eu 's highest court , the european court of justice . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft slapped with biggest fine in eu history the european union on wednesday levied the largest fine against any company in the bloc 's history , ruling that microsoft must pay a half billion euros for abusing its " near monopoly " status .

the german government is going on a new offensive against smoking , asking the nation 's restaurants to provide more space for non-smokers and pushing for a ban on lighting up in hospitals . if berlin has its way , 40 percent of seats in german restaurants will be reserved for non-smokers .
marion caspers-merk , the federal government 's drug commissioner , announced on tuesday that the government is stepping up its anti-smoking campaign , hoping to get not only restaurants , but german hospitals to limit or eliminate smoking on their premises .
the government plans to meet with germany 's restaurant and hotel association to ask them to voluntarily enlarge the non-smoking areas in their establishments .
caspers-merk said germany is looking at austria for its model and hopes to convince the hospitality sector to impose limits on smoking step by step . " non-smoking should be the norm in germany , " caspers-merk told reporters . trend toward not lighting up there are signs that the trend is heading in that direction , particularly among young people .

in 1997 , 28 percent of this age group smoked ; by 2004 , that number had gone down to 23 percent .
a current study carried out by the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- shows that 65 percent of 12- to 25-year-olds are non-smokers , up from 56 percent in 1979 . caspers-merk said part of the reason for the declining numbers of young smokers has to do with tobacco taxes which have been continually raised for several years , most recently on dec .

the court is not expected to rule on this for several years .
the second appeal - the subject of wednesday 's verdict - sought suspension of the measures imposed by the commission until the first appeal had been completed . data protection main concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft is based in the us microsoft has already paid the eu-imposed fine , but the company has fiercely opposed any measures that could affect its core strategy , which is based on the integration of new features into the windows operating system . the company argued it would suffer " irreparable damage " if it were forced to pass on confidential programming information to competitors in compliance with the eu order . but microsoft failed to convince the court that it had a reasonable case , that it urgently needed relief , and that the balance of interests between it and the public weighed in its favor . " microsoft has not demonstrated specifically that it might suffer serious and irreparable damage , " the court said in a document obtained by reuters . the president of the court , bo vesterdorf , said that " a number of questions of principle were raised " but that " the requirement relating to urgency is not satisfied . " the eu commission argued that the sanctions would be rendered meaningless if delayed , because the market would have moved on by the time they were implemented . either side can appeal wednesday 's decision to the eu 's highest court , the european court of justice . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft slapped with biggest fine in eu history the european union on wednesday levied the largest fine against any company in the bloc 's history , ruling that microsoft must pay a half billion euros for abusing its " near monopoly " status .

but critics say the bill will simply create even more red tape for the private sector . a disabled person wanting to enter a stylish disco , a turkish family or homosexual couple looking for an apartment , women earning less than their male counterparts for the same work : all of these are groups facing discrimination in germany on a daily basis .
but this is going to change . the european union requires all of its member states to give people legal mechanisms to battle discrimination on the basis of sex , racial or ethnic origin , age , disability , religion and sexual orientation .
germany ’ s ruling red-green coalition government has now introduced a planned anti-discrimination law to implement these eu directives . “ people discriminated against are no longer just victims , ” said irmingard schewe-gerigk , the women ’ s affairs spokeswoman for the greens .
“ they can now demand their rights with confidence . ” putting an end to “ no jews or disabled people ” the new legislation will be submitted to parliament ’ s lower house , the bundestag , next month .
it will prohibit discrimination in a wide range of areas , including jobs , working conditions , pay , education , as well as access to goods and services . in practical terms , the proposed legislation will mean that landlords can ’ t turn away a potential tenant because he is a muslim , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned anti-discrimination law also helps gay people “ newspaper ads saying things such as ‘ no jews or disabled people ’ will be banned , ” said volker beck , the general secretary of the greens ’ parliamentary group . the legislation would also require insurance companies to justify why their policies differ according to a person ’ s sex or sexual orientation . “ it will no longer be possible for health insurers to refuse cover to homosexuals on the grounds that they belong to a group at high risk of hiv , ” beck said . an unnecessary burden for the german economy but both germany ’ s conservative opposition cdu / csu and the private sector are unhappy with the bill .
although all welcome the moves to fight discrimination , they criticize that it will generate over-regulation . “ it will create a new bureaucracy monster instead of reducing red tape and saving costs , ” the cdu / csu parliamentary faction said in a statement . dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ' associations bda said the german economy would be unnecessarily burdened with such a law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt is not in favor of the new legislation “ the draft law is bureaucratic , incalculable , completely overdrawn and incompatible with the basic principles of our civil law and our labor relations , ” hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- said . the federal justice ministry dismissed these claims .
spokesman ulf gerder said the anti-discrimination law would not affect 95 percent of the population . “ most people are sufficiently informed about article 3 of the german constitution , which forbids discrimination , ” he said . but there were 5 percent of the population who neglected to follow these principles of equality . “ in these cases , there is every reason for the law and it is necessary , ” gerder said . no american conditions so will the country be facing a surge of legal battles in the future ?
ursula engelen-kefer , deputy head of the trade union confederation dgb , said no . “ opponents are presenting a horror scenario of compensation payments or a wave of lawsuits as in the united states , but this is utterly unfounded , ” engelen-kefer said . the law does have its problematic aspects , though , beck of the greens party said .

but critics say the bill will simply create even more red tape for the private sector . a disabled person wanting to enter a stylish disco , a turkish family or homosexual couple looking for an apartment , women earning less than their male counterparts for the same work : all of these are groups facing discrimination in germany on a daily basis .
but this is going to change . the european union requires all of its member states to give people legal mechanisms to battle discrimination on the basis of sex , racial or ethnic origin , age , disability , religion and sexual orientation .
germany ’ s ruling red-green coalition government has now introduced a planned anti-discrimination law to implement these eu directives . “ people discriminated against are no longer just victims , ” said irmingard schewe-gerigk , the women ’ s affairs spokeswoman for the greens .
“ they can now demand their rights with confidence . ” putting an end to “ no jews or disabled people ” the new legislation will be submitted to parliament ’ s lower house , the bundestag , next month .
it will prohibit discrimination in a wide range of areas , including jobs , working conditions , pay , education , as well as access to goods and services . in practical terms , the proposed legislation will mean that landlords can ’ t turn away a potential tenant because he is a muslim , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planned anti-discrimination law also helps gay people “ newspaper ads saying things such as ‘ no jews or disabled people ’ will be banned , ” said volker beck , the general secretary of the greens ’ parliamentary group . the legislation would also require insurance companies to justify why their policies differ according to a person ’ s sex or sexual orientation . “ it will no longer be possible for health insurers to refuse cover to homosexuals on the grounds that they belong to a group at high risk of hiv , ” beck said . an unnecessary burden for the german economy but both germany ’ s conservative opposition cdu / csu and the private sector are unhappy with the bill .
although all welcome the moves to fight discrimination , they criticize that it will generate over-regulation . “ it will create a new bureaucracy monster instead of reducing red tape and saving costs , ” the cdu / csu parliamentary faction said in a statement . dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ' associations bda said the german economy would be unnecessarily burdened with such a law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt is not in favor of the new legislation “ the draft law is bureaucratic , incalculable , completely overdrawn and incompatible with the basic principles of our civil law and our labor relations , ” hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- said . the federal justice ministry dismissed these claims .
spokesman ulf gerder said the anti-discrimination law would not affect 95 percent of the population . “ most people are sufficiently informed about article 3 of the german constitution , which forbids discrimination , ” he said . but there were 5 percent of the population who neglected to follow these principles of equality . “ in these cases , there is every reason for the law and it is necessary , ” gerder said . no american conditions so will the country be facing a surge of legal battles in the future ?
ursula engelen-kefer , deputy head of the trade union confederation dgb , said no . “ opponents are presenting a horror scenario of compensation payments or a wave of lawsuits as in the united states , but this is utterly unfounded , ” engelen-kefer said . the law does have its problematic aspects , though , beck of the greens party said .
the burden of proof lies with the party being discriminated , he said .
so landlords , employers or nightclub owners remain innocent until proven guilty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law will not require uni-sex saunas however , the elderly will continue to be able to enjoy those senior citizen portions in restaurants .

forgeard and enders have both been nominated to take over the running of eads next july when the current co-chairmen , rainer hertrich and philippe camus , step down .

enders is seen as representing germany 's interests within eads , because he is a close ally of juergen schrempp , the head of german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler which holds a 30.07-percent stake in eads .

britain 's highest court recently ruled that tony blair 's answer exceeds the acceptable . prime minister blair is well-known for his hard-line approach to fighting terrorism , both at home and abroad .
in the wake of the world trade center attacks in new york , he quickly forced through a far-reaching anti-terror law , under which suspicious foreigners can be locked away without charge of trial , for an indefinite period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair now , britain 's highest court , the house of lords , has deemed the legislation a fundamental violation of democratic norms and the european human rights convention .
although not binding , the verdict could change the fate of the nine foreign prisoners who have been serving time in british prisons without legal proceedings for the past three years .
it puts the onus on parliament to amend the law and bring it in line with the european charter . " the real threat to the life of the nation , in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values , comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these , " lord leonard hoffmann wrote . the civilian case governments across europe responded to the sept .
11 attacks by restricting their citizens ' basic civil liberties .
conor gearty , a legal expert for terrorism and civil rights at the london school of economics , believes england was particularly hard hit .
" liberal freedom in our country is slowly but surely being undermined by unscrupulous bugging and surveillance methods , " gearty said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storing of biometric data could become standard in britain unlike germany , britain does n't currently have a system of national identity cards , although tony blair sees their reintroduction into uk society as a key weapon in his anti-terror campaign .
on monday , the prime minister won resounding support for his plans when 385 members of parliament voted in favor , compared to 93 against , of resurrecting the cards , which were abolished under winston churchill more than fifty years ago . but the plans , which opponents in the parliamentary ranks say would lead to the creation of a " big brother " state , go further than national id cards .
from 2007 , the government also wants to implement a system of storing biometric data , such as fingerprints and photographic images of the iris , on all british citizens . holes in security such a data bank is but a distant dream for wolfgang speck , head of the german police union .
" compared to england , we are at the start of the fight against terrorism , and we have a lot of catching up to do , " speck said .
he added that an anti-terror law such as britian 's controversial offering would be inconceivable in germany , where it is impossible to hold a suspected terrorist for longer than 48 hours without a judicial ruling . speck said he believes that germans underestimate the threat of terror , adding that there is currently no legal basis for data exchange between regional criminal investigation departments or the federal criminal investigators and public prosecutors .
" with regards to easy terrorist targets , we do n't have the situation under control at the moment , " speck said . as for london , some argue that the tough measures currently in place are precisely what has spared the city the horrors of a terrorist attack , but legal expert gearty sees it differently . " the prophecies of the police and the secret service have been proved wrong , which is why the judges are speaking out against the way in which terrorism is being fought at the expense of civil liberty , " gearty said .

britain 's highest court recently ruled that tony blair 's answer exceeds the acceptable . prime minister blair is well-known for his hard-line approach to fighting terrorism , both at home and abroad .
in the wake of the world trade center attacks in new york , he quickly forced through a far-reaching anti-terror law , under which suspicious foreigners can be locked away without charge of trial , for an indefinite period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair now , britain 's highest court , the house of lords , has deemed the legislation a fundamental violation of democratic norms and the european human rights convention .
although not binding , the verdict could change the fate of the nine foreign prisoners who have been serving time in british prisons without legal proceedings for the past three years .
it puts the onus on parliament to amend the law and bring it in line with the european charter . " the real threat to the life of the nation , in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values , comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these , " lord leonard hoffmann wrote . the civilian case governments across europe responded to the sept .
11 attacks by restricting their citizens ' basic civil liberties .
conor gearty , a legal expert for terrorism and civil rights at the london school of economics , believes england was particularly hard hit .
" liberal freedom in our country is slowly but surely being undermined by unscrupulous bugging and surveillance methods , " gearty said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storing of biometric data could become standard in britain unlike germany , britain does n't currently have a system of national identity cards , although tony blair sees their reintroduction into uk society as a key weapon in his anti-terror campaign .
on monday , the prime minister won resounding support for his plans when 385 members of parliament voted in favor , compared to 93 against , of resurrecting the cards , which were abolished under winston churchill more than fifty years ago . but the plans , which opponents in the parliamentary ranks say would lead to the creation of a " big brother " state , go further than national id cards .
from 2007 , the government also wants to implement a system of storing biometric data , such as fingerprints and photographic images of the iris , on all british citizens . holes in security such a data bank is but a distant dream for wolfgang speck , head of the german police union .
" compared to england , we are at the start of the fight against terrorism , and we have a lot of catching up to do , " speck said .
he added that an anti-terror law such as britian 's controversial offering would be inconceivable in germany , where it is impossible to hold a suspected terrorist for longer than 48 hours without a judicial ruling . speck said he believes that germans underestimate the threat of terror , adding that there is currently no legal basis for data exchange between regional criminal investigation departments or the federal criminal investigators and public prosecutors .
" with regards to easy terrorist targets , we do n't have the situation under control at the moment , " speck said . as for london , some argue that the tough measures currently in place are precisely what has spared the city the horrors of a terrorist attack , but legal expert gearty sees it differently . " the prophecies of the police and the secret service have been proved wrong , which is why the judges are speaking out against the way in which terrorism is being fought at the expense of civil liberty , " gearty said .
he believes that if there had been a wave of terrorist violence , the decision at the house of lords would have been different . georg matthes , dw.world.de -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany creates new terror center german interior minister otto schily has opened a new center for combating terrorism in berlin .

britain 's highest court recently ruled that tony blair 's answer exceeds the acceptable . prime minister blair is well-known for his hard-line approach to fighting terrorism , both at home and abroad .
in the wake of the world trade center attacks in new york , he quickly forced through a far-reaching anti-terror law , under which suspicious foreigners can be locked away without charge of trial , for an indefinite period of time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair now , britain 's highest court , the house of lords , has deemed the legislation a fundamental violation of democratic norms and the european human rights convention .
although not binding , the verdict could change the fate of the nine foreign prisoners who have been serving time in british prisons without legal proceedings for the past three years .
it puts the onus on parliament to amend the law and bring it in line with the european charter . " the real threat to the life of the nation , in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values , comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these , " lord leonard hoffmann wrote . the civilian case governments across europe responded to the sept .

on monday , the prime minister won resounding support for his plans when 385 members of parliament voted in favor , compared to 93 against , of resurrecting the cards , which were abolished under winston churchill more than fifty years ago . but the plans , which opponents in the parliamentary ranks say would lead to the creation of a " big brother " state , go further than national id cards .

" compared to england , we are at the start of the fight against terrorism , and we have a lot of catching up to do , " speck said .
he added that an anti-terror law such as britian 's controversial offering would be inconceivable in germany , where it is impossible to hold a suspected terrorist for longer than 48 hours without a judicial ruling . speck said he believes that germans underestimate the threat of terror , adding that there is currently no legal basis for data exchange between regional criminal investigation departments or the federal criminal investigators and public prosecutors .
" with regards to easy terrorist targets , we do n't have the situation under control at the moment , " speck said . as for london , some argue that the tough measures currently in place are precisely what has spared the city the horrors of a terrorist attack , but legal expert gearty sees it differently . " the prophecies of the police and the secret service have been proved wrong , which is why the judges are speaking out against the way in which terrorism is being fought at the expense of civil liberty , " gearty said .

the court is not expected to rule on this for several years .
the second appeal - the subject of wednesday 's verdict - sought suspension of the measures imposed by the commission until the first appeal had been completed . data protection main concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft is based in the us microsoft has already paid the eu-imposed fine , but the company has fiercely opposed any measures that could affect its core strategy , which is based on the integration of new features into the windows operating system . the company argued it would suffer " irreparable damage " if it were forced to pass on confidential programming information to competitors in compliance with the eu order . but microsoft failed to convince the court that it had a reasonable case , that it urgently needed relief , and that the balance of interests between it and the public weighed in its favor . " microsoft has not demonstrated specifically that it might suffer serious and irreparable damage , " the court said in a document obtained by reuters . the president of the court , bo vesterdorf , said that " a number of questions of principle were raised " but that " the requirement relating to urgency is not satisfied . " the eu commission argued that the sanctions would be rendered meaningless if delayed , because the market would have moved on by the time they were implemented . either side can appeal wednesday 's decision to the eu 's highest court , the european court of justice . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft slapped with biggest fine in eu history the european union on wednesday levied the largest fine against any company in the bloc 's history , ruling that microsoft must pay a half billion euros for abusing its " near monopoly " status .
-lrb- march 24 , 2004 -rrb- microsoft 's long road to brussels this week 's ruling should come as no surprise to microsoft .
already in 2001 the european commission began gathering evidence against the u.s. software giant .
back then it looked like a quick resolution was in sight .
-lrb- march 23 , 2004 -rrb- eu closes in on microsoft european union member states unanimously backed a draft commission ruling on slapping sanctions on software giant microsoft for abusing its dominant market position .

it levied a record fine of € 497 million and forced microsoft to open up its operating systems to allow more competition . the company responded by filing a case to repeal the penalties at the european court of justice in luxemburg .
but the court upheld the commission ’ s decision , arguing that microsoft had not “ damaged specifically that it might suffer serious and irreparable damage demonstrated . ” the court ’ s verdict is the latest in a long line of disputes the american company has had with brussels over the past several years .

the court is not expected to rule on this for several years .
the second appeal - the subject of wednesday 's verdict - sought suspension of the measures imposed by the commission until the first appeal had been completed . data protection main concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft is based in the us microsoft has already paid the eu-imposed fine , but the company has fiercely opposed any measures that could affect its core strategy , which is based on the integration of new features into the windows operating system . the company argued it would suffer " irreparable damage " if it were forced to pass on confidential programming information to competitors in compliance with the eu order . but microsoft failed to convince the court that it had a reasonable case , that it urgently needed relief , and that the balance of interests between it and the public weighed in its favor . " microsoft has not demonstrated specifically that it might suffer serious and irreparable damage , " the court said in a document obtained by reuters . the president of the court , bo vesterdorf , said that " a number of questions of principle were raised " but that " the requirement relating to urgency is not satisfied . " the eu commission argued that the sanctions would be rendered meaningless if delayed , because the market would have moved on by the time they were implemented . either side can appeal wednesday 's decision to the eu 's highest court , the european court of justice . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft slapped with biggest fine in eu history the european union on wednesday levied the largest fine against any company in the bloc 's history , ruling that microsoft must pay a half billion euros for abusing its " near monopoly " status .

the german government is going on a new offensive against smoking , asking the nation 's restaurants to provide more space for non-smokers and pushing for a ban on lighting up in hospitals . if berlin has its way , 40 percent of seats in german restaurants will be reserved for non-smokers .
marion caspers-merk , the federal government 's drug commissioner , announced on tuesday that the government is stepping up its anti-smoking campaign , hoping to get not only restaurants , but german hospitals to limit or eliminate smoking on their premises .
the government plans to meet with germany 's restaurant and hotel association to ask them to voluntarily enlarge the non-smoking areas in their establishments .
caspers-merk said germany is looking at austria for its model and hopes to convince the hospitality sector to impose limits on smoking step by step . " non-smoking should be the norm in germany , " caspers-merk told reporters . trend toward not lighting up there are signs that the trend is heading in that direction , particularly among young people .
for the first time in years , the number of smokers between the ages of 12 and 17 has decreased .
in 1997 , 28 percent of this age group smoked ; by 2004 , that number had gone down to 23 percent .
a current study carried out by the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- shows that 65 percent of 12- to 25-year-olds are non-smokers , up from 56 percent in 1979 . caspers-merk said part of the reason for the declining numbers of young smokers has to do with tobacco taxes which have been continually raised for several years , most recently on dec .

while she said smoking among young people was increasingly being seen as " uncool , " she admitted that in eastern germany , the number of youth taking up the habit continued to increase .
for that reason , she wants to expand the smoking ban in german schools .
several states already have strict prohibitions against smoking on school grounds . to encourage more people to stub out their cigarettes , the bzga has begun offering a special " start packet " for those wanting to make their lives smoke free . the director of the bzga , elisabeth pott , complained that there is still too much " hidden " advertising of cigarettes , especially in films , where cool characters often light up .

but critics say the bill will simply create even more red tape for the private sector . a disabled person wanting to enter a stylish disco , a turkish family or homosexual couple looking for an apartment , women earning less than their male counterparts for the same work : all of these are groups facing discrimination in germany on a daily basis .
but this is going to change . the european union requires all of its member states to give people legal mechanisms to battle discrimination on the basis of sex , racial or ethnic origin , age , disability , religion and sexual orientation .
germany ’ s ruling red-green coalition government has now introduced a planned anti-discrimination law to implement these eu directives . “ people discriminated against are no longer just victims , ” said irmingard schewe-gerigk , the women ’ s affairs spokeswoman for the greens .
“ they can now demand their rights with confidence . ” putting an end to “ no jews or disabled people ” the new legislation will be submitted to parliament ’ s lower house , the bundestag , next month .

spokesman ulf gerder said the anti-discrimination law would not affect 95 percent of the population . “ most people are sufficiently informed about article 3 of the german constitution , which forbids discrimination , ” he said . but there were 5 percent of the population who neglected to follow these principles of equality . “ in these cases , there is every reason for the law and it is necessary , ” gerder said . no american conditions so will the country be facing a surge of legal battles in the future ?
ursula engelen-kefer , deputy head of the trade union confederation dgb , said no . “ opponents are presenting a horror scenario of compensation payments or a wave of lawsuits as in the united states , but this is utterly unfounded , ” engelen-kefer said . the law does have its problematic aspects , though , beck of the greens party said .

the german government is going on a new offensive against smoking , asking the nation 's restaurants to provide more space for non-smokers and pushing for a ban on lighting up in hospitals . if berlin has its way , 40 percent of seats in german restaurants will be reserved for non-smokers .
marion caspers-merk , the federal government 's drug commissioner , announced on tuesday that the government is stepping up its anti-smoking campaign , hoping to get not only restaurants , but german hospitals to limit or eliminate smoking on their premises .
the government plans to meet with germany 's restaurant and hotel association to ask them to voluntarily enlarge the non-smoking areas in their establishments .
caspers-merk said germany is looking at austria for its model and hopes to convince the hospitality sector to impose limits on smoking step by step . " non-smoking should be the norm in germany , " caspers-merk told reporters . trend toward not lighting up there are signs that the trend is heading in that direction , particularly among young people .
for the first time in years , the number of smokers between the ages of 12 and 17 has decreased .
in 1997 , 28 percent of this age group smoked ; by 2004 , that number had gone down to 23 percent .
a current study carried out by the federal center for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- shows that 65 percent of 12- to 25-year-olds are non-smokers , up from 56 percent in 1979 . caspers-merk said part of the reason for the declining numbers of young smokers has to do with tobacco taxes which have been continually raised for several years , most recently on dec .

while she said smoking among young people was increasingly being seen as " uncool , " she admitted that in eastern germany , the number of youth taking up the habit continued to increase .
for that reason , she wants to expand the smoking ban in german schools .
several states already have strict prohibitions against smoking on school grounds . to encourage more people to stub out their cigarettes , the bzga has begun offering a special " start packet " for those wanting to make their lives smoke free . the director of the bzga , elisabeth pott , complained that there is still too much " hidden " advertising of cigarettes , especially in films , where cool characters often light up .
she said young people are especially susceptible to those kinds of messages . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tobacco tax hike hits smokers ' wallets the cost of cigarettes jumped in germany this week as a result of increased taxes .

the court is not expected to rule on this for several years .
the second appeal - the subject of wednesday 's verdict - sought suspension of the measures imposed by the commission until the first appeal had been completed . data protection main concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft is based in the us microsoft has already paid the eu-imposed fine , but the company has fiercely opposed any measures that could affect its core strategy , which is based on the integration of new features into the windows operating system . the company argued it would suffer " irreparable damage " if it were forced to pass on confidential programming information to competitors in compliance with the eu order . but microsoft failed to convince the court that it had a reasonable case , that it urgently needed relief , and that the balance of interests between it and the public weighed in its favor . " microsoft has not demonstrated specifically that it might suffer serious and irreparable damage , " the court said in a document obtained by reuters . the president of the court , bo vesterdorf , said that " a number of questions of principle were raised " but that " the requirement relating to urgency is not satisfied .

" all important questions will be decided within the group and not in public , " enders told daily die welt in an interview .
forgeard and enders have both been nominated to take over the running of eads next july when the current co-chairmen , rainer hertrich and philippe camus , step down .
but forgeard , currently head of eads ' airbus unit , has been very vocal in arguing for the current system of dual leadership to be abolished and for eads to be headed by a single chairman .
enders is seen as representing germany 's interests within eads , because he is a close ally of juergen schrempp , the head of german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler which holds a 30.07-percent stake in eads .
enders told die welt that the success of eads lay in its " european cultural diversity . " dw-world.de less turbulence for airbus , boeing eu trade commissioner peter mandelson and his us counterpart , robert zoellick , have decided to allow more time for talks to settle a transatlantic row over government aid for aviation rivals boeing and airbus .

under the compromise deal , the commission agreed to allow more fish to be caught by fishing fleets next year than it had originally envisaged .
the ec had already dropped proposals to close depleted cod grounds in parts of the north sea , irish sea , the west of scotland , the baltic and the channel .
the uk and other eu members with a north sea coast had opposed the plan .
the ministers agreed to gentler quota cuts provided the reductions continue for several years , reuters reported .
the compromise deal , reached after talks that stretched through the night , was adopted almost unanimously .
only lithuania voted against , while britain and france voiced reservations .
greece abstained after the 20-hour negotiations .
eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said the new package would " rebuild depleted stocks without economically crippling the fleets concerned " .
at stake is the future not only of the dwindling stocks of cod and other species but also the livelihoods of traditional fishing communities across europe .
' poor reflection ' environmentalists say the agreed measures , such as reducing the numbers of days fishing boats can spend at sea every month , do not go far enough to prevent irreversible destruction of cod in europe .
charlotte mogensen , eu fisheries policy officer for wwf , said the deal " reflects poorly on the member states and their unwillingness to adopt such key measures in the name of fish stock recovery " .
the fishing industry doubts the scientists ' advice greenpeace spokesman thilo maack said the decisions would " contribute nothing " next year toward the " urgent " protection of cod , plaice and sole .
the creation of no-fishing zones to let threatened cod stocks recover had been a key part of the european commission 's proposals , and dr borg said he was disappointed the eu members did not follow his lead .
" the commission would have liked to go further on a number of points , but i believe that the agreement that we have reached is a step in the right direction , " he said .
dr borg stressed that eu members would impose tougher monitoring restrictions to make sure fishermen do not exceed quotas .
tough restrictions the restrictions include a four-and-a-half-month summer ban on cod fishing in the baltic sea , while boats catching more than one tonne of cod in the north sea must have their hauls inspected .
spanish and portuguese boats will be limited to 22 days of fishing for squid and octopus per month and 20 days per month for sole fishing in the atlantic .
the ec 's original proposals had already declined to take on recommendations made by independent experts .
in its report released in october , the international council for the exploration of the sea -lrb- ices -rrb- advised a complete halt to cod fishing in the north sea , the irish sea and west of scotland .
scientists said north sea stocks had shrunk to about one tenth of 1970 levels , and warned of depletion on the scale of eastern canadian waters where cod disappeared in the 1990s and stocks have yet to recover .
fishermen complain that drastic cuts in allowable catches , by up to 80 % in britain , have not yet had enough time to show their positive impact before stricter quotas are imposed .
fishermen closed off two french ports on monday to protest at the plans .

the ec had already dropped proposals to close depleted cod grounds in parts of the north sea , irish sea , the west of scotland , the baltic and the channel .
the uk and other eu members with a north sea coast had opposed the plan .
the ministers agreed to gentler quota cuts provided the reductions continue for several years , reuters reported .
the compromise deal , reached after talks that stretched through the night , was adopted almost unanimously .
only lithuania voted against , while britain and france voiced reservations .
greece abstained after the 20-hour negotiations .
eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said the new package would " rebuild depleted stocks without economically crippling the fleets concerned " .
at stake is the future not only of the dwindling stocks of cod and other species but also the livelihoods of traditional fishing communities across europe .
' poor reflection ' environmentalists say the agreed measures , such as reducing the numbers of days fishing boats can spend at sea every month , do not go far enough to prevent irreversible destruction of cod in europe .
charlotte mogensen , eu fisheries policy officer for wwf , said the deal " reflects poorly on the member states and their unwillingness to adopt such key measures in the name of fish stock recovery " .
the fishing industry doubts the scientists ' advice greenpeace spokesman thilo maack said the decisions would " contribute nothing " next year toward the " urgent " protection of cod , plaice and sole .
the creation of no-fishing zones to let threatened cod stocks recover had been a key part of the european commission 's proposals , and dr borg said he was disappointed the eu members did not follow his lead .
" the commission would have liked to go further on a number of points , but i believe that the agreement that we have reached is a step in the right direction , " he said .
dr borg stressed that eu members would impose tougher monitoring restrictions to make sure fishermen do not exceed quotas .
tough restrictions the restrictions include a four-and-a-half-month summer ban on cod fishing in the baltic sea , while boats catching more than one tonne of cod in the north sea must have their hauls inspected .
spanish and portuguese boats will be limited to 22 days of fishing for squid and octopus per month and 20 days per month for sole fishing in the atlantic .
the ec 's original proposals had already declined to take on recommendations made by independent experts .
in its report released in october , the international council for the exploration of the sea -lrb- ices -rrb- advised a complete halt to cod fishing in the north sea , the irish sea and west of scotland .
scientists said north sea stocks had shrunk to about one tenth of 1970 levels , and warned of depletion on the scale of eastern canadian waters where cod disappeared in the 1990s and stocks have yet to recover .
fishermen complain that drastic cuts in allowable catches , by up to 80 % in britain , have not yet had enough time to show their positive impact before stricter quotas are imposed .
fishermen closed off two french ports on monday to protest at the plans .

fishermen complain that drastic cuts in allowable catches , by up to 80 % in britain , have not yet had enough time to show their positive impact before stricter quotas are imposed .
fishermen closed off two french ports on monday to protest at the plans .

covenants are used by south hams council to save accommodation for local people and to ease pressure on the housing system .
about 1,500 properties already have covenants attached , mainly on former local authority housing sold off under the right to buy directive .
the council says more covenants will be made next year .
the first new covenants will be on two new properties built in kingsbridge with the housing association tor homes .
the lack of affordable housing has become a major issue in the low-wage area .
south hams district and devon county council have together released about £ 2m of additional council tax income , raised by the reduction in discount available to second home and holiday home owners , to fund affordable housing projects .

adam dunning , 26 , was shot twice in the back while on patrol in the solomons capital honiara .
the incident occurred in an area that was controlled by armed gangs before the arrival of an australian-led peacekeeping force in summer 2003 .
the force , once more than 2,000 strong , has been scaled back to about 300 .
australian federal police commissioner mick keelty said the shooting , by an automatic weapon at about 0300 local time -lrb- 1600 gmt tuesday -rrb- , bore " the hallmarks " of a sniper attack .
prime minister john howard said the incident would not deter the remaining peacekeepers from their task .
the message for the solomon islands people who have carried out this murder is we will not be put off australian federal police commissioner mick keelty " it is a reminder that although the intervention has been remarkably successful , it is still dangerous , " he told reporters .
" the mission goes on , undeterred , unrestrained , unaffected by what 's happened . "
his counterpart in the solomons , allan kemakeza , condemned the killing .
" my government and people condemn this barbaric act by a person who can only be described at best as inhumane and sick in the mind , " he said in a statement .
mr keelty said the attack was obviously targeted at australia 's regional assistance mission to the solomon islands -lrb- ramsi -rrb- , because mr dunning was travelling in a clearly marked vehicle .
" clearly the shooting would be in retaliation to the work of ramsi , which has been extraordinarily successful until today , " he said .
" the message for the solomon islands people who have carried out this murder is we will not be put off . "
some 2,225 troops and police from australia , new zealand , fiji , papua new guinea and tonga arrived in the solomons in july 2003 to restore order and disarm ethnic gangs .
they succeeded in clearing the streets of thousands of weapons and remanding key militant commanders in custody .
a smaller contingent of police and troops have stayed on to ensure the stability continues .

adam dunning , 26 , was shot twice in the back while on patrol in the solomons capital honiara .
the incident occurred in an area that was controlled by armed gangs before the arrival of an australian-led peacekeeping force in summer 2003 .
the force , once more than 2,000 strong , has been scaled back to about 300 .
australian federal police commissioner mick keelty said the shooting , by an automatic weapon at about 0300 local time -lrb- 1600 gmt tuesday -rrb- , bore " the hallmarks " of a sniper attack .
prime minister john howard said the incident would not deter the remaining peacekeepers from their task .
the message for the solomon islands people who have carried out this murder is we will not be put off australian federal police commissioner mick keelty " it is a reminder that although the intervention has been remarkably successful , it is still dangerous , " he told reporters .
" the mission goes on , undeterred , unrestrained , unaffected by what 's happened . "
his counterpart in the solomons , allan kemakeza , condemned the killing .
" my government and people condemn this barbaric act by a person who can only be described at best as inhumane and sick in the mind , " he said in a statement .
mr keelty said the attack was obviously targeted at australia 's regional assistance mission to the solomon islands -lrb- ramsi -rrb- , because mr dunning was travelling in a clearly marked vehicle .
" clearly the shooting would be in retaliation to the work of ramsi , which has been extraordinarily successful until today , " he said .
" the message for the solomon islands people who have carried out this murder is we will not be put off . "
some 2,225 troops and police from australia , new zealand , fiji , papua new guinea and tonga arrived in the solomons in july 2003 to restore order and disarm ethnic gangs .
they succeeded in clearing the streets of thousands of weapons and remanding key militant commanders in custody .
a smaller contingent of police and troops have stayed on to ensure the stability continues .
as part of australia 's new-found role as peacekeeper in the south pacific , the country has also begun sending police officers and bureaucrats to papua new guinea .
it will send 210 police and more than 60 other officials in total .

researchers found suicide rates among poorer communities had increased dramatically since 1980 .
the general register office for scotland found suicides for 15-44-year-olds went up from 15.38 to 24.32 per 100,000 between 1980 and 2001 .
the study suggested drug abuse , divorce and unemployment could be to blame as they are more common in poorer areas .
the results , published in the british medical journal -lrb- bmj -rrb- , found men in the most deprived communities were four times more at risk of taking their own lives than those in more affluent areas .
we need to get across a message of hope for people gregor henderson scottish executive across all parts of scotland , the risk of suicide for males rose from 22.13 to 38.65 per 100,000 .
the suicide rate for all women increased from 8.62 to 10.55 per 100,000 over the same timescale .
however , the figures noticed a sharp increase in female suicides between 1999 and 2001 when almost six times more women took their own lives while living in poorer postcodes .
the researchers also noticed suicide rates dropped for those aged 45 and over , dropping from 22.99 per 100,000 in 1980-82 to 16.73 in 1999-2001 .
despite the findings , the scottish executive , which has set a target to reduce suicides by 15 % for 10-24-year-olds in the most deprived communities by 2009 , said the rate had already fallen since the end of the bmj study in 2001 .

" we need to get across a message of hope for people .
" the vast majority of people who experience mental or emotional ill-health and difficulties can and do recover with the right support and help .
