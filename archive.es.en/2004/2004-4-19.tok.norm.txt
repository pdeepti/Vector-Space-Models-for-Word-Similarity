in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .
france and norway have programs that counsel women facing or fleeing forced marriages .
britain boasts a special desk in the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- that helps citizens who are forced into marriage overseas .
last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .
lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
storr 's office is responsible for drafting a bill that would jail those involved in arranging marriages .
" maybe it will be a signal to these families , that we are aware of -lsb- the problem -rsb- , and maybe it will stop some from doing it . "
such a law is long overdue , says seyran ates , a berlin lawyer whose lobbying on the issue together with the german women 's organization terre des femmes brought forced marriages to the attention of german politicians last year .
german courts continue to tiptoe around the problem , labeling it as a something best taken care within the community .
judges have invoked " religion " or " tradition " in explaining why they were reducing the punishment for men who abused their wives in forced marriages , she says .
" they do n't see it as a human rights violation , " says ates , who fled her traditional turkish home at the age of 18 .
neither did öztürk .
the eldest sister in a family of three sons and two daughters , she was used to obeying her father and older brothers .
she learned early on to serve them first at meals and clean up afterward .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : integration in germany living next to , not with each other europe 's integration challenge europe -pipe- 19.04.2004 a wife bound by shame 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bound by honor and shame , victims of forced marriage often live lives of isolation and abuse .
in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .
france and norway have programs that counsel women facing or fleeing forced marriages .
britain boasts a special desk in the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- that helps citizens who are forced into marriage overseas .
last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .
lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
storr 's office is responsible for drafting a bill that would jail those involved in arranging marriages .
" maybe it will be a signal to these families , that we are aware of -lsb- the problem -rsb- , and maybe it will stop some from doing it . "
such a law is long overdue , says seyran ates , a berlin lawyer whose lobbying on the issue together with the german women 's organization terre des femmes brought forced marriages to the attention of german politicians last year .
german courts continue to tiptoe around the problem , labeling it as a something best taken care within the community .
judges have invoked " religion " or " tradition " in explaining why they were reducing the punishment for men who abused their wives in forced marriages , she says .
" they do n't see it as a human rights violation , " says ates , who fled her traditional turkish home at the age of 18 .
neither did öztürk .
the eldest sister in a family of three sons and two daughters , she was used to obeying her father and older brothers .
she learned early on to serve them first at meals and clean up afterward .

in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .
france and norway have programs that counsel women facing or fleeing forced marriages .
britain boasts a special desk in the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- that helps citizens who are forced into marriage overseas .
last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .
lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
storr 's office is responsible for drafting a bill that would jail those involved in arranging marriages .
" maybe it will be a signal to these families , that we are aware of -lsb- the problem -rsb- , and maybe it will stop some from doing it . "
such a law is long overdue , says seyran ates , a berlin lawyer whose lobbying on the issue together with the german women 's organization terre des femmes brought forced marriages to the attention of german politicians last year .
german courts continue to tiptoe around the problem , labeling it as a something best taken care within the community .
judges have invoked " religion " or " tradition " in explaining why they were reducing the punishment for men who abused their wives in forced marriages , she says .
" they do n't see it as a human rights violation , " says ates , who fled her traditional turkish home at the age of 18 .
neither did öztürk .
the eldest sister in a family of three sons and two daughters , she was used to obeying her father and older brothers .
she learned early on to serve them first at meals and clean up afterward .

in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .
france and norway have programs that counsel women facing or fleeing forced marriages .
britain boasts a special desk in the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- that helps citizens who are forced into marriage overseas .
last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .
lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
storr 's office is responsible for drafting a bill that would jail those involved in arranging marriages .
" maybe it will be a signal to these families , that we are aware of -lsb- the problem -rsb- , and maybe it will stop some from doing it . "
such a law is long overdue , says seyran ates , a berlin lawyer whose lobbying on the issue together with the german women 's organization terre des femmes brought forced marriages to the attention of german politicians last year .
german courts continue to tiptoe around the problem , labeling it as a something best taken care within the community .
judges have invoked " religion " or " tradition " in explaining why they were reducing the punishment for men who abused their wives in forced marriages , she says .
" they do n't see it as a human rights violation , " says ates , who fled her traditional turkish home at the age of 18 .
neither did öztürk .

in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .
france and norway have programs that counsel women facing or fleeing forced marriages .
britain boasts a special desk in the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- that helps citizens who are forced into marriage overseas .
last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .
lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
storr 's office is responsible for drafting a bill that would jail those involved in arranging marriages .
" maybe it will be a signal to these families , that we are aware of -lsb- the problem -rsb- , and maybe it will stop some from doing it . "

" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .
france and norway have programs that counsel women facing or fleeing forced marriages .
britain boasts a special desk in the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- that helps citizens who are forced into marriage overseas .
last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .
lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
storr 's office is responsible for drafting a bill that would jail those involved in arranging marriages .
" maybe it will be a signal to these families , that we are aware of -lsb- the problem -rsb- , and maybe it will stop some from doing it . "
such a law is long overdue , says seyran ates , a berlin lawyer whose lobbying on the issue together with the german women 's organization terre des femmes brought forced marriages to the attention of german politicians last year .
german courts continue to tiptoe around the problem , labeling it as a something best taken care within the community .
judges have invoked " religion " or " tradition " in explaining why they were reducing the punishment for men who abused their wives in forced marriages , she says .
" they do n't see it as a human rights violation , " says ates , who fled her traditional turkish home at the age of 18 .
neither did öztürk .
the eldest sister in a family of three sons and two daughters , she was used to obeying her father and older brothers .
she learned early on to serve them first at meals and clean up afterward .

" if we reject it -lrb- turkey -rrb- , if we slam the door in its face as some would like to do quite quickly , there is a risk that it will turn to another model " , said the former commissioner .
this follows recent comments by the leader of jacques chirac 's ruling centre-right ump party who said that countries like turkey " had no business in the eu . "
however , despite this more conciliatory tone , barnier stressed that any possible accession was a distant prospect .
" there is no question of turkey 's accession in the current circumstances or in the short-term " , he said .
" accession negotiations have not begun .
they have never begun .
we will decide together whether they should begin .
i can not say how long they will last - probably a very long time . "
france 's tough line on turkey is not universally shared in the eu .
both the uk and germany have spoken out in favour of ankara beginning membership negotiations if it meets the political criteria for joining .
member states will decide at the end of the this year whether turkey is ready for accession negotiations based on a report by the european commission , which will be published in october .

" the candidacy is well thought out , " said jacques rogge , praising the closeness of the proposed olympic atheltic sites and the consideration given to athletes .
leipzig is the smallest of the candidate cities , which include havanna as well as world metropolises rio de janeiro , new york , moscow , paris , london , madrid and istanbul .
the east german city is considered an underdog in the race to win the olympics , both because of its size and recent scandals involving local olympic officials .
but a telephone conversation with chancellor gerhard schröder and a visit with interior minister otto schily were enough to convince rogge that leipzig will make a serious and competitive bid , he said . more briefs 19.04.2004 -pipe- no warning prior to german convoy ambush in iraq 16.04.2004 -pipe- schröder rejects newest israeli peace plan 15.04.2004 -pipe- germans more anxious than ever says study 15.04.2004 -pipe- schröder superstar 15.04.2004 -pipe- german defense minister plans to close army hospitals 13.04.2004 -pipe- germans favor smoking ban 13.04.2004 -pipe- environmental group praises new eu labels on gm food 13.04.2004 -pipe- greens calls for tax hike on gas , energy radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

nearly two months into the trial of accused child abductor and murderer marc dutroux , two of his surviving victims - now young women - are scheduled to testify this week . europeans glued to the trial of belgium 's most infamous criminal anxiously awaited the testimony of two of his victims , the first time they will speak before a jury . sabine dardenne , 20 , testified for about one hour on monday and 22-year-old laetitia delhez is expected to take the stand on tuesday . " he always said that i had a character like a pig , " dardenne said at the end of her testimony , turning directly to the defendant .
" why did n't he kill me then ? " dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has admitted raping dardenne , responded : " i never thought about killing her . "
his defense lawyer declined to ask dardenne questions .
" we have the utmost respect for you and , even though this comes much to late , the greatest compassion , " xavier magnee told the witness . judge stephane goux had previously asked dardenne questions about her abduction on may 28 , 1996 , but spared the young woman from having to recount her ordeal in captivity as letter she had written during her incarceration in dutroux 's cellar had already been read during the trial .
but dardenne indirectly confirmed that dutroux had raped her , adding that she had to clean the house when not locked in the cellar .

nearly two months into the trial of accused child abductor and murderer marc dutroux , two of his surviving victims - now young women - are scheduled to testify this week . europeans glued to the trial of belgium 's most infamous criminal anxiously awaited the testimony of two of his victims , the first time they will speak before a jury . sabine dardenne , 20 , testified for about one hour on monday and 22-year-old laetitia delhez is expected to take the stand on tuesday . " he always said that i had a character like a pig , " dardenne said at the end of her testimony , turning directly to the defendant .
" why did n't he kill me then ? " dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has admitted raping dardenne , responded : " i never thought about killing her . "
his defense lawyer declined to ask dardenne questions .
" we have the utmost respect for you and , even though this comes much to late , the greatest compassion , " xavier magnee told the witness . judge stephane goux had previously asked dardenne questions about her abduction on may 28 , 1996 , but spared the young woman from having to recount her ordeal in captivity as letter she had written during her incarceration in dutroux 's cellar had already been read during the trial .
but dardenne indirectly confirmed that dutroux had raped her , adding that she had to clean the house when not locked in the cellar .
" i was his little maid , " she said . testimony crucial for outcome of trial the two women 's evidence is seen as vital to an ongoing debate in belgium over whether the defendant acted on his own in committing the crimes he is accused of , or was part of a pedophilia network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laetitia delhez , left , arrives with her lawyer , georges-henri beauthier , at the palace of justice in arlon , belgium , monday april 19 , 2004 .
dardenne and delhez -lrb- photo -rrb- were 12 and 14 years old respectively in the summer of 1996 when they were abducted .
dardenne was in captivity for 80 days , while delhez was held for eight days before being freed by police . dutroux , now 47 years old , is charged altogether with kidnapping and rape of six girls during the mid-1990s , and with the deaths of four of them .
two girls starved in a cellar , while two others were buried alive . dutroux denies having killed any of the children , and admits only the abduction of four of the girls . on the eve of the trial , dutroux sparked further controversy by sending a letter to belgian media saying he was only a small part of a criminal network that had links to belgian law enforcement . but to the frustration of belgians , who have reacted to the scandal with mass outpourings of outrage and horror , the trial - involving numerous witnesses often with conflicting testimony - has n't clarified the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- is being tried along with three accomplices : his now-estranged wife michelle martin , a drug-addicted drifter michel lelievre , and a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , michel nihoul .
each of the defendants claim the others are guilty . seeking justice in her one television interview , given in belgium , dardenne said she hopes her testimony will help bring about justice .
she also said she hopes to show dutroux that he did n't destroy her , and that despite her ordeal she is able to lead a normal life . despite the insistence of the victims ' parents and of dutroux 's lawyers that dutroux was acting as part of a larger pedophilia ring , the trial has yet to offer up any hard proof .
to date there is no evidence that nihoul was part of the kidnappings , although many believe he represents the link between dutroux and the alleged child pornography ring . however , there has been an increasing spate of evidence showing disastrous omissions on the part of the investigators . the search methods of police and the judicial system has been a key issue in the trial ; this has lead to further widespread conspiracy theories that there people from the highest political circles have tried to obstruct progress in prosecuting the case . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium 's shame goes global as dutroux trial opens the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media .

" nothing 's going to change for the time being , " peter traumann , the head of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- , told daily berliner zeitung , adding that it would be too risky for companies to market gm products as most people reject the idea of eating such food .
" producers have prepared themselves and only use non-gm ingredients , " traumann said . in the long term , gm foods are likely to become more prevalent , however , as other products using non-gm ingredients would get too expensive , traumann predicted .
the german environmentalist organization bund expects oil made out of genetically modified soy or rape , ketchup made from gm tomatoes and cornflakes of popcorn made from gm corn to hit the shelves . according to the new eu directive , any product in stores or restaurants that has come in contact with genetically modified ingredients will have to be marked as such .
however the same does n't apply to products such as meat , milk and eggs from animals that have been fed gm crops , causing environmentalists to criticize the regulation . it 's up to the consumer now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast while agreeing that the exemption of animal products was problematic , german consumer minister renate künast -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the new requirement and said people should vote with their shopping carts whether they wanted to see more gm products on the shelves . künast added that consumers would have to be careful and read the small print on products to find out whether they contained gm ingredients .
she also expressed her anger over the opposition christian democrats , who blocked künast 's plan in germany 's parliament 's upper house to impose a € 50,000 -lrb- $ 60,200 -rrb- fine on offenders .
as a result , no penalties currently exist in germany for those who do not comply with the directive . products likely to get more expensive consumer rights advocates meanwhile warned that the new regulation would likely lead to an increase in prices by about 10 percent as companies would have to submit their products for additional tests .

as a result , no penalties currently exist in germany for those who do not comply with the directive . products likely to get more expensive consumer rights advocates meanwhile warned that the new regulation would likely lead to an increase in prices by about 10 percent as companies would have to submit their products for additional tests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.04.2004 survivors take stand at dutroux trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine dardenne arriving at the courthouse on monday .
nearly two months into the trial of accused child abductor and murderer marc dutroux , two of his surviving victims - now young women - are scheduled to testify this week . europeans glued to the trial of belgium 's most infamous criminal anxiously awaited the testimony of two of his victims , the first time they will speak before a jury . sabine dardenne , 20 , testified for about one hour on monday and 22-year-old laetitia delhez is expected to take the stand on tuesday . " he always said that i had a character like a pig , " dardenne said at the end of her testimony , turning directly to the defendant .
" why did n't he kill me then ? " dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has admitted raping dardenne , responded : " i never thought about killing her . "
his defense lawyer declined to ask dardenne questions .
" we have the utmost respect for you and , even though this comes much to late , the greatest compassion , " xavier magnee told the witness . judge stephane goux had previously asked dardenne questions about her abduction on may 28 , 1996 , but spared the young woman from having to recount her ordeal in captivity as letter she had written during her incarceration in dutroux 's cellar had already been read during the trial .
but dardenne indirectly confirmed that dutroux had raped her , adding that she had to clean the house when not locked in the cellar .
" i was his little maid , " she said . testimony crucial for outcome of trial the two women 's evidence is seen as vital to an ongoing debate in belgium over whether the defendant acted on his own in committing the crimes he is accused of , or was part of a pedophilia network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laetitia delhez , left , arrives with her lawyer , georges-henri beauthier , at the palace of justice in arlon , belgium , monday april 19 , 2004 .
dardenne and delhez -lrb- photo -rrb- were 12 and 14 years old respectively in the summer of 1996 when they were abducted .
dardenne was in captivity for 80 days , while delhez was held for eight days before being freed by police . dutroux , now 47 years old , is charged altogether with kidnapping and rape of six girls during the mid-1990s , and with the deaths of four of them .
two girls starved in a cellar , while two others were buried alive . dutroux denies having killed any of the children , and admits only the abduction of four of the girls . on the eve of the trial , dutroux sparked further controversy by sending a letter to belgian media saying he was only a small part of a criminal network that had links to belgian law enforcement . but to the frustration of belgians , who have reacted to the scandal with mass outpourings of outrage and horror , the trial - involving numerous witnesses often with conflicting testimony - has n't clarified the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- is being tried along with three accomplices : his now-estranged wife michelle martin , a drug-addicted drifter michel lelievre , and a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , michel nihoul .
each of the defendants claim the others are guilty . seeking justice in her one television interview , given in belgium , dardenne said she hopes her testimony will help bring about justice .
she also said she hopes to show dutroux that he did n't destroy her , and that despite her ordeal she is able to lead a normal life . despite the insistence of the victims ' parents and of dutroux 's lawyers that dutroux was acting as part of a larger pedophilia ring , the trial has yet to offer up any hard proof .
to date there is no evidence that nihoul was part of the kidnappings , although many believe he represents the link between dutroux and the alleged child pornography ring . however , there has been an increasing spate of evidence showing disastrous omissions on the part of the investigators . the search methods of police and the judicial system has been a key issue in the trial ; this has lead to further widespread conspiracy theories that there people from the highest political circles have tried to obstruct progress in prosecuting the case . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium 's shame goes global as dutroux trial opens the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media .

speaking during the opening ceremony , schröder said he was optimistic about a clear economic recovery in germany this year and said the hanover fair confirmed it .
schröder explained it was n't just german exports that were performing well , but also the overall investment climate as well as consumer spending .
however the chancellor 's optimism was rejected by the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- , which lowered its growth forecast for the current year .
michael rogowski , head of the federation said on monday at the hanover fair that the bdi reckoned with gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth of between just 1.5 and 1.7 percent .
earlier the bdi had predicted 2 percent growth for 2004 . more briefs 19.04.2004 -pipe- welteke wo n't keep full salary 16.04.2004 -pipe- deutsche post signs deal to deliver british mail 16.04.2004 -pipe- think tank predicts eu expansion will help german economy 16.04.2004 -pipe- licorice addict sues german confectioner 15.04.2004 -pipe- financial concerns raised over germany 's world cup infrastructure 15.04.2004 -pipe- basf and bayer clash over insecticide deal 14.04.2004 -pipe- vw recalls 30,000 transporters 14.04.2004 -pipe- axel springer moves into russian market radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

want to throw back a nice bavarian brew while watching a world cup match in germany in 2006 ?
sorry , you 'll have to make due with american suds .
u.s. brewer anheuser-busch has the exclusive contract for beer there . world cup 2006 might be taking place in germany , but the beer flowing from the taps at the concession stands is going to be american , thanks to a sponsoring agreement between fifa , soccer 's governing body and anheuser-busch , the world 's largest brewery .
in the stadiums across germany where world cup matches are being played , local firms are only allowed to do business if they , according to the contract stipulations , are " not competition for the sponsor . "
therefore , locals brews are taboo ; they can only sell their pilsners and ales outside a specific area around the stadium premises .
" that ca n't be , " complained hermann winkler , president of the state of saxony sports federation , to the sächsische zeitung newspaper .
" a lot of breweries support sports in saxony , but the minute there 's a little money to be earned , they 're left standing out in the cold . "
however , anheuser-busch , maker of budweiser and michelob beers , appears to have scored a winning goal with this business deal .

but since that name is already taken in europe by the original czech budweiser brand , the americans have repeatedly hit a brick wall .
that wall looks set to crumble in two years ' time .
reinhard zwanzig , who heads saxony 's brewers ' federation , said the decision was regrettable , but he does n't think the american budweiser is going to find many of its own fans among the soccer ones .
besides , he said aficionados should be concentrating on the game in the stadium , not the sudsy stuff .

want to throw back a nice bavarian brew while watching a world cup match in germany in 2006 ?
sorry , you 'll have to make due with american suds .
u.s. brewer anheuser-busch has the exclusive contract for beer there . world cup 2006 might be taking place in germany , but the beer flowing from the taps at the concession stands is going to be american , thanks to a sponsoring agreement between fifa , soccer 's governing body and anheuser-busch , the world 's largest brewery .
in the stadiums across germany where world cup matches are being played , local firms are only allowed to do business if they , according to the contract stipulations , are " not competition for the sponsor . "
therefore , locals brews are taboo ; they can only sell their pilsners and ales outside a specific area around the stadium premises .
" that ca n't be , " complained hermann winkler , president of the state of saxony sports federation , to the sächsische zeitung newspaper .
" a lot of breweries support sports in saxony , but the minute there 's a little money to be earned , they 're left standing out in the cold . "
however , anheuser-busch , maker of budweiser and michelob beers , appears to have scored a winning goal with this business deal .
the u.s. multinational has tried for years to get a foothold in germany , particularly with its budweiser brand .
but since that name is already taken in europe by the original czech budweiser brand , the americans have repeatedly hit a brick wall .
that wall looks set to crumble in two years ' time .
reinhard zwanzig , who heads saxony 's brewers ' federation , said the decision was regrettable , but he does n't think the american budweiser is going to find many of its own fans among the soccer ones .
besides , he said aficionados should be concentrating on the game in the stadium , not the sudsy stuff .

social democrat chancellor gerhard schröder said that it was out of the question that " germany as the biggest net payer of the eu has to finance unfair tax competition against itself . "
stoiber , bavaria 's prime minister and schröder 's challenger in the last elections , agreed .
" what we do not accept is furthering the relocation of jobs mainly financed by german tax measures , " he said .
the german politicians echoed earlier comments from swedish prime minister göran persson during a recent visit to berlin .
persson argued that sweden is not prepared to pay for new member states via eu contributions when the people earning most in these countries are not taxed or taxed at a very low rate .

want to throw back a nice bavarian brew while watching a world cup match in germany in 2006 ?
sorry , you 'll have to make due with american suds .
u.s. brewer anheuser-busch has the exclusive contract for beer there . world cup 2006 might be taking place in germany , but the beer flowing from the taps at the concession stands is going to be american , thanks to a sponsoring agreement between fifa , soccer 's governing body and anheuser-busch , the world 's largest brewery .
in the stadiums across germany where world cup matches are being played , local firms are only allowed to do business if they , according to the contract stipulations , are " not competition for the sponsor . "
therefore , locals brews are taboo ; they can only sell their pilsners and ales outside a specific area around the stadium premises .
" that ca n't be , " complained hermann winkler , president of the state of saxony sports federation , to the sächsische zeitung newspaper .
" a lot of breweries support sports in saxony , but the minute there 's a little money to be earned , they 're left standing out in the cold . "
however , anheuser-busch , maker of budweiser and michelob beers , appears to have scored a winning goal with this business deal .
the u.s. multinational has tried for years to get a foothold in germany , particularly with its budweiser brand .
but since that name is already taken in europe by the original czech budweiser brand , the americans have repeatedly hit a brick wall .
that wall looks set to crumble in two years ' time .
reinhard zwanzig , who heads saxony 's brewers ' federation , said the decision was regrettable , but he does n't think the american budweiser is going to find many of its own fans among the soccer ones .
besides , he said aficionados should be concentrating on the game in the stadium , not the sudsy stuff .
" afterwards , they 'll all go into town and toast the victors with the regional beer , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beer frenzy in munich beer galore , germans in lederhosen and the umpah-beat of traditional bavarian music - the annual oktoberfest , attracting visitors to munich from all over the world each year , kicks off this weekend .

u.s. brewer anheuser-busch has the exclusive contract for beer there . world cup 2006 might be taking place in germany , but the beer flowing from the taps at the concession stands is going to be american , thanks to a sponsoring agreement between fifa , soccer 's governing body and anheuser-busch , the world 's largest brewery .
in the stadiums across germany where world cup matches are being played , local firms are only allowed to do business if they , according to the contract stipulations , are " not competition for the sponsor . "
therefore , locals brews are taboo ; they can only sell their pilsners and ales outside a specific area around the stadium premises .
" that ca n't be , " complained hermann winkler , president of the state of saxony sports federation , to the sächsische zeitung newspaper .
" a lot of breweries support sports in saxony , but the minute there 's a little money to be earned , they 're left standing out in the cold . "
however , anheuser-busch , maker of budweiser and michelob beers , appears to have scored a winning goal with this business deal .
the u.s. multinational has tried for years to get a foothold in germany , particularly with its budweiser brand .
but since that name is already taken in europe by the original czech budweiser brand , the americans have repeatedly hit a brick wall .
that wall looks set to crumble in two years ' time .
reinhard zwanzig , who heads saxony 's brewers ' federation , said the decision was regrettable , but he does n't think the american budweiser is going to find many of its own fans among the soccer ones .
besides , he said aficionados should be concentrating on the game in the stadium , not the sudsy stuff .

" nothing 's going to change for the time being , " peter traumann , the head of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- , told daily berliner zeitung , adding that it would be too risky for companies to market gm products as most people reject the idea of eating such food .

as a result , no penalties currently exist in germany for those who do not comply with the directive . products likely to get more expensive consumer rights advocates meanwhile warned that the new regulation would likely lead to an increase in prices by about 10 percent as companies would have to submit their products for additional tests .

nearly two months into the trial of accused child abductor and murderer marc dutroux , two of his surviving victims - now young women - are scheduled to testify this week . europeans glued to the trial of belgium 's most infamous criminal anxiously awaited the testimony of two of his victims , the first time they will speak before a jury . sabine dardenne , 20 , testified for about one hour on monday and 22-year-old laetitia delhez is expected to take the stand on tuesday . " he always said that i had a character like a pig , " dardenne said at the end of her testimony , turning directly to the defendant .
" why did n't he kill me then ? " dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has admitted raping dardenne , responded : " i never thought about killing her . "
his defense lawyer declined to ask dardenne questions .
" we have the utmost respect for you and , even though this comes much to late , the greatest compassion , " xavier magnee told the witness . judge stephane goux had previously asked dardenne questions about her abduction on may 28 , 1996 , but spared the young woman from having to recount her ordeal in captivity as letter she had written during her incarceration in dutroux 's cellar had already been read during the trial .
but dardenne indirectly confirmed that dutroux had raped her , adding that she had to clean the house when not locked in the cellar .
" i was his little maid , " she said . testimony crucial for outcome of trial the two women 's evidence is seen as vital to an ongoing debate in belgium over whether the defendant acted on his own in committing the crimes he is accused of , or was part of a pedophilia network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laetitia delhez , left , arrives with her lawyer , georges-henri beauthier , at the palace of justice in arlon , belgium , monday april 19 , 2004 .

dardenne was in captivity for 80 days , while delhez was held for eight days before being freed by police . dutroux , now 47 years old , is charged altogether with kidnapping and rape of six girls during the mid-1990s , and with the deaths of four of them .
two girls starved in a cellar , while two others were buried alive . dutroux denies having killed any of the children , and admits only the abduction of four of the girls . on the eve of the trial , dutroux sparked further controversy by sending a letter to belgian media saying he was only a small part of a criminal network that had links to belgian law enforcement . but to the frustration of belgians , who have reacted to the scandal with mass outpourings of outrage and horror , the trial - involving numerous witnesses often with conflicting testimony - has n't clarified the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- is being tried along with three accomplices : his now-estranged wife michelle martin , a drug-addicted drifter michel lelievre , and a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , michel nihoul .

she also said she hopes to show dutroux that he did n't destroy her , and that despite her ordeal she is able to lead a normal life . despite the insistence of the victims ' parents and of dutroux 's lawyers that dutroux was acting as part of a larger pedophilia ring , the trial has yet to offer up any hard proof .
to date there is no evidence that nihoul was part of the kidnappings , although many believe he represents the link between dutroux and the alleged child pornography ring . however , there has been an increasing spate of evidence showing disastrous omissions on the part of the investigators . the search methods of police and the judicial system has been a key issue in the trial ; this has lead to further widespread conspiracy theories that there people from the highest political circles have tried to obstruct progress in prosecuting the case . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium 's shame goes global as dutroux trial opens the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media .

nearly two months into the trial of accused child abductor and murderer marc dutroux , two of his surviving victims - now young women - are scheduled to testify this week . europeans glued to the trial of belgium 's most infamous criminal anxiously awaited the testimony of two of his victims , the first time they will speak before a jury . sabine dardenne , 20 , testified for about one hour on monday and 22-year-old laetitia delhez is expected to take the stand on tuesday . " he always said that i had a character like a pig , " dardenne said at the end of her testimony , turning directly to the defendant .
" why did n't he kill me then ? " dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has admitted raping dardenne , responded : " i never thought about killing her . "
his defense lawyer declined to ask dardenne questions .
" we have the utmost respect for you and , even though this comes much to late , the greatest compassion , " xavier magnee told the witness . judge stephane goux had previously asked dardenne questions about her abduction on may 28 , 1996 , but spared the young woman from having to recount her ordeal in captivity as letter she had written during her incarceration in dutroux 's cellar had already been read during the trial .

nearly two months into the trial of accused child abductor and murderer marc dutroux , two of his surviving victims - now young women - are scheduled to testify this week . europeans glued to the trial of belgium 's most infamous criminal anxiously awaited the testimony of two of his victims , the first time they will speak before a jury . sabine dardenne , 20 , testified for about one hour on monday and 22-year-old laetitia delhez is expected to take the stand on tuesday . " he always said that i had a character like a pig , " dardenne said at the end of her testimony , turning directly to the defendant .
" why did n't he kill me then ? " dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has admitted raping dardenne , responded : " i never thought about killing her . "
his defense lawyer declined to ask dardenne questions .
" we have the utmost respect for you and , even though this comes much to late , the greatest compassion , " xavier magnee told the witness . judge stephane goux had previously asked dardenne questions about her abduction on may 28 , 1996 , but spared the young woman from having to recount her ordeal in captivity as letter she had written during her incarceration in dutroux 's cellar had already been read during the trial .
but dardenne indirectly confirmed that dutroux had raped her , adding that she had to clean the house when not locked in the cellar .

dardenne and delhez -lrb- photo -rrb- were 12 and 14 years old respectively in the summer of 1996 when they were abducted .
dardenne was in captivity for 80 days , while delhez was held for eight days before being freed by police . dutroux , now 47 years old , is charged altogether with kidnapping and rape of six girls during the mid-1990s , and with the deaths of four of them .
two girls starved in a cellar , while two others were buried alive . dutroux denies having killed any of the children , and admits only the abduction of four of the girls . on the eve of the trial , dutroux sparked further controversy by sending a letter to belgian media saying he was only a small part of a criminal network that had links to belgian law enforcement . but to the frustration of belgians , who have reacted to the scandal with mass outpourings of outrage and horror , the trial - involving numerous witnesses often with conflicting testimony - has n't clarified the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- is being tried along with three accomplices : his now-estranged wife michelle martin , a drug-addicted drifter michel lelievre , and a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , michel nihoul .

to date there is no evidence that nihoul was part of the kidnappings , although many believe he represents the link between dutroux and the alleged child pornography ring . however , there has been an increasing spate of evidence showing disastrous omissions on the part of the investigators . the search methods of police and the judicial system has been a key issue in the trial ; this has lead to further widespread conspiracy theories that there people from the highest political circles have tried to obstruct progress in prosecuting the case . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium 's shame goes global as dutroux trial opens the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media .

want to throw back a nice bavarian brew while watching a world cup match in germany in 2006 ?
sorry , you 'll have to make due with american suds .
u.s. brewer anheuser-busch has the exclusive contract for beer there . world cup 2006 might be taking place in germany , but the beer flowing from the taps at the concession stands is going to be american , thanks to a sponsoring agreement between fifa , soccer 's governing body and anheuser-busch , the world 's largest brewery .
in the stadiums across germany where world cup matches are being played , local firms are only allowed to do business if they , according to the contract stipulations , are " not competition for the sponsor . "
therefore , locals brews are taboo ; they can only sell their pilsners and ales outside a specific area around the stadium premises .
" that ca n't be , " complained hermann winkler , president of the state of saxony sports federation , to the sächsische zeitung newspaper .
" a lot of breweries support sports in saxony , but the minute there 's a little money to be earned , they 're left standing out in the cold . "
however , anheuser-busch , maker of budweiser and michelob beers , appears to have scored a winning goal with this business deal .
the u.s. multinational has tried for years to get a foothold in germany , particularly with its budweiser brand .
but since that name is already taken in europe by the original czech budweiser brand , the americans have repeatedly hit a brick wall .
that wall looks set to crumble in two years ' time .
reinhard zwanzig , who heads saxony 's brewers ' federation , said the decision was regrettable , but he does n't think the american budweiser is going to find many of its own fans among the soccer ones .
besides , he said aficionados should be concentrating on the game in the stadium , not the sudsy stuff .
" afterwards , they 'll all go into town and toast the victors with the regional beer , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beer frenzy in munich beer galore , germans in lederhosen and the umpah-beat of traditional bavarian music - the annual oktoberfest , attracting visitors to munich from all over the world each year , kicks off this weekend .

" nothing 's going to change for the time being , " peter traumann , the head of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- , told daily berliner zeitung , adding that it would be too risky for companies to market gm products as most people reject the idea of eating such food .

she also expressed her anger over the opposition christian democrats , who blocked künast 's plan in germany 's parliament 's upper house to impose a € 50,000 -lrb- $ 60,200 -rrb- fine on offenders .
as a result , no penalties currently exist in germany for those who do not comply with the directive . products likely to get more expensive consumer rights advocates meanwhile warned that the new regulation would likely lead to an increase in prices by about 10 percent as companies would have to submit their products for additional tests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : integration in germany living next to , not with each other europe 's integration challenge europe -pipe- 19.04.2004 a wife bound by shame 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bound by honor and shame , victims of forced marriage often live lives of isolation and abuse .
in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .
france and norway have programs that counsel women facing or fleeing forced marriages .
britain boasts a special desk in the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- that helps citizens who are forced into marriage overseas .
last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .
lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
storr 's office is responsible for drafting a bill that would jail those involved in arranging marriages .
" maybe it will be a signal to these families , that we are aware of -lsb- the problem -rsb- , and maybe it will stop some from doing it . "
such a law is long overdue , says seyran ates , a berlin lawyer whose lobbying on the issue together with the german women 's organization terre des femmes brought forced marriages to the attention of german politicians last year .
german courts continue to tiptoe around the problem , labeling it as a something best taken care within the community .
judges have invoked " religion " or " tradition " in explaining why they were reducing the punishment for men who abused their wives in forced marriages , she says .
" they do n't see it as a human rights violation , " says ates , who fled her traditional turkish home at the age of 18 .
neither did öztürk .
the eldest sister in a family of three sons and two daughters , she was used to obeying her father and older brothers .
she learned early on to serve them first at meals and clean up afterward .

in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .
france and norway have programs that counsel women facing or fleeing forced marriages .
britain boasts a special desk in the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- that helps citizens who are forced into marriage overseas .
last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .
lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
storr 's office is responsible for drafting a bill that would jail those involved in arranging marriages .
" maybe it will be a signal to these families , that we are aware of -lsb- the problem -rsb- , and maybe it will stop some from doing it . "
such a law is long overdue , says seyran ates , a berlin lawyer whose lobbying on the issue together with the german women 's organization terre des femmes brought forced marriages to the attention of german politicians last year .
german courts continue to tiptoe around the problem , labeling it as a something best taken care within the community .
judges have invoked " religion " or " tradition " in explaining why they were reducing the punishment for men who abused their wives in forced marriages , she says .
" they do n't see it as a human rights violation , " says ates , who fled her traditional turkish home at the age of 18 .
neither did öztürk .
the eldest sister in a family of three sons and two daughters , she was used to obeying her father and older brothers .
she learned early on to serve them first at meals and clean up afterward .

in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .
france and norway have programs that counsel women facing or fleeing forced marriages .
britain boasts a special desk in the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- that helps citizens who are forced into marriage overseas .
last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .
lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
storr 's office is responsible for drafting a bill that would jail those involved in arranging marriages .
" maybe it will be a signal to these families , that we are aware of -lsb- the problem -rsb- , and maybe it will stop some from doing it . "
such a law is long overdue , says seyran ates , a berlin lawyer whose lobbying on the issue together with the german women 's organization terre des femmes brought forced marriages to the attention of german politicians last year .
german courts continue to tiptoe around the problem , labeling it as a something best taken care within the community .
judges have invoked " religion " or " tradition " in explaining why they were reducing the punishment for men who abused their wives in forced marriages , she says .
" they do n't see it as a human rights violation , " says ates , who fled her traditional turkish home at the age of 18 .
neither did öztürk .
the eldest sister in a family of three sons and two daughters , she was used to obeying her father and older brothers .
she learned early on to serve them first at meals and clean up afterward .

in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .
france and norway have programs that counsel women facing or fleeing forced marriages .
britain boasts a special desk in the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- that helps citizens who are forced into marriage overseas .
last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .
lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
storr 's office is responsible for drafting a bill that would jail those involved in arranging marriages .
" maybe it will be a signal to these families , that we are aware of -lsb- the problem -rsb- , and maybe it will stop some from doing it . "
such a law is long overdue , says seyran ates , a berlin lawyer whose lobbying on the issue together with the german women 's organization terre des femmes brought forced marriages to the attention of german politicians last year .
german courts continue to tiptoe around the problem , labeling it as a something best taken care within the community .
judges have invoked " religion " or " tradition " in explaining why they were reducing the punishment for men who abused their wives in forced marriages , she says .
" they do n't see it as a human rights violation , " says ates , who fled her traditional turkish home at the age of 18 .
neither did öztürk .
the eldest sister in a family of three sons and two daughters , she was used to obeying her father and older brothers .
she learned early on to serve them first at meals and clean up afterward .

when he felt she was getting too independent , he looked around for a suitable husband .
she was working a shift at the hospital one night when a young man , the son of someone who had grown up in the same village as her father , came to ask for her hand in marriage .
shocked , she politely declined .
she soon found out it was n't her decision to make .
before she knew it , wedding invitations were being sent out .
her pleas fell on deaf ears .
" they did n't understand why i did n't want to marry him , " she says .
refusal would have meant shame many parents do n't know the pain they put their children through , says rahel volz , who heads terre des femmes , which is based in tübingen , germany .
" they were married the same way , and never asked why , " she says .
victims do n't say no early enough , so the parents just assume they accept , she adds .
öztürk knew refusal would have meant shame for her family , so she went along , saying goodbye to the brief taste of life outside her traditional upbringing .
her husband terrorized her , even physically abusing her on occasion , she says , adding that his mother and sister barred contact between öztürk and her family .
" i did n't feel anything or want anything , " she says , recalling that period of her life .
" i would walk the streets without a destination . "
uncle intervenes to save her she sneaked away to visit a psychologist , but could n't muster the courage to do what the doctor told her : leave .
when she told her parents she wanted out , they turned her away at their doorstep - twice .
as a last resort , she appealed to her uncle , the more liberal-minded brother in her father 's family .
after an intense family discussion , her father relented and allowed her to divorce .
öztürk shakes her head and falls silent when telling this part of the story .
though she continues to stay in contact with her parents , she told them she could never forgive them .
" it 's a closed chapter in my life , " says öztürk , who is now married - to a man of her choosing - and has a three-month-old baby .
" but there are still wounds .

" nothing 's going to change for the time being , " peter traumann , the head of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- , told daily berliner zeitung , adding that it would be too risky for companies to market gm products as most people reject the idea of eating such food .
" producers have prepared themselves and only use non-gm ingredients , " traumann said . in the long term , gm foods are likely to become more prevalent , however , as other products using non-gm ingredients would get too expensive , traumann predicted .
the german environmentalist organization bund expects oil made out of genetically modified soy or rape , ketchup made from gm tomatoes and cornflakes of popcorn made from gm corn to hit the shelves . according to the new eu directive , any product in stores or restaurants that has come in contact with genetically modified ingredients will have to be marked as such .

she also expressed her anger over the opposition christian democrats , who blocked künast 's plan in germany 's parliament 's upper house to impose a € 50,000 -lrb- $ 60,200 -rrb- fine on offenders .
as a result , no penalties currently exist in germany for those who do not comply with the directive . products likely to get more expensive consumer rights advocates meanwhile warned that the new regulation would likely lead to an increase in prices by about 10 percent as companies would have to submit their products for additional tests .

want to throw back a nice bavarian brew while watching a world cup match in germany in 2006 ?
sorry , you 'll have to make due with american suds .
u.s. brewer anheuser-busch has the exclusive contract for beer there . world cup 2006 might be taking place in germany , but the beer flowing from the taps at the concession stands is going to be american , thanks to a sponsoring agreement between fifa , soccer 's governing body and anheuser-busch , the world 's largest brewery .
in the stadiums across germany where world cup matches are being played , local firms are only allowed to do business if they , according to the contract stipulations , are " not competition for the sponsor . "
therefore , locals brews are taboo ; they can only sell their pilsners and ales outside a specific area around the stadium premises .
" that ca n't be , " complained hermann winkler , president of the state of saxony sports federation , to the sächsische zeitung newspaper .
" a lot of breweries support sports in saxony , but the minute there 's a little money to be earned , they 're left standing out in the cold . "
however , anheuser-busch , maker of budweiser and michelob beers , appears to have scored a winning goal with this business deal .
the u.s. multinational has tried for years to get a foothold in germany , particularly with its budweiser brand .
but since that name is already taken in europe by the original czech budweiser brand , the americans have repeatedly hit a brick wall .
that wall looks set to crumble in two years ' time .
reinhard zwanzig , who heads saxony 's brewers ' federation , said the decision was regrettable , but he does n't think the american budweiser is going to find many of its own fans among the soccer ones .
besides , he said aficionados should be concentrating on the game in the stadium , not the sudsy stuff .
" afterwards , they 'll all go into town and toast the victors with the regional beer , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beer frenzy in munich beer galore , germans in lederhosen and the umpah-beat of traditional bavarian music - the annual oktoberfest , attracting visitors to munich from all over the world each year , kicks off this weekend .

dw-world 's sabina casagrande visits a cemetery where all graves face mecca . rows and rows of neat graves line the paths of cologne ’ s westfriedhof .
then , all of a sudden , a field catches the eye .
here , all of the graves are slanted .
the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .
the graves are dug so that a corpse lying on its right side faces mecca .
some plots at the westfriedhof bear ornate tombstones shaped like mosques or engraved with decorative inscriptions .
others are marked by a simple wooden plaque .
“ burial culture , like every form of culture , is constantly changing , ” said kerstin gernig , director of the board of german undertakers .
“ we are not a homogenous society , but rather an intercultural , a multicultural one , where various needs must be responded to accordingly . ”
decades after the first muslim guest workers began arriving in germany from turkey and north africa , where and how they bury their dead has forced germans to re-evaluate the laws and traditions involved in the country 's burial culture .
reunited in death with the home they left behind until now , muslim burials have actually been more the exception than the rule in germany .
many first generation muslims , who came here in the 1960s , still have strong family and emotional ties to their home countries .
they live here in the knowledge that though they may not return home during their lifetime , but at least be reunited in death .
in addition , the prohibitive cost of burial in germany , the small number of muslim cemeteries and legal disagreements over the method of muslim burial have made burial abroad more attractive for most muslim families , says mustapha el-founti , who owns al-rahma in essen , one of germany ’ s largest funeral homes for muslims .
according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .
but as the muslim population in germany becomes more entrenched , the desire to be buried elsewhere has begun to recede .
" most muslims have decided to remain in germany permanently , " nadeem elyas , chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , told dw-world .
" returning the dead to their home countries doesn ’ t make sense because the family ties are here in germany . ”
a resistance to muslim cemeteries but where to bury the dead ?
the only islamic cemetery in germany is in berlin and was opened in 1866 .
but it is long since filled and attempts by muslim groups to set up new graveyards have failed , said el-founti .
" we made the city of essen a proposal that we would buy the land ourselves and manage the cemetery .
and we were told : ' absolutely not ! '
a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .
the administrative hitch is hard for elyas to understand .

according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .

a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .

it would relieve the municipalities , " said elyas -lrb- photo -rrb- .
though municipalities have reached a compromise by setting up muslim burial grounds like the one in cologne , the islamic burial procedure remains a further obstacle for muslims .
burial without a coffin in the islamic faith , the deceased are buried without a coffin , wrapped only in linen cloths .
but across germany a coffin is required and only a few town councils were willing to make exceptions to the rule .
in north rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state , this law was recently changed .
individual communities can now decide for themselves whether to allow the coffin-free burial - much to the dismay of germany ’ s funeral industry .
" you have to consider that a funeral is a very dignified and solemn act , and the burial process is part of it , " says gernig , the head of the undertakers board . she points out how strange it would look if a family carried a body wrapped only in cloth to the gravesite .
" of course , you also have to consider the hygienic aspects .
the corpse can still discharge body fluids .
so the coffin also fulfils a specific function , ” she said .
a solution for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim burial ground in cologne city authorities in cologne , where the burial ground is located -lrb- photo -rrb- , have a similar position .
helmut strack , who heads the city ’ s cemetery department , says he can not expect his personnel to carry a corpse , which has maybe been dead for a few days , wrapped in only linen cloths .
but he wants to find a solution that will make everyone happy .
one possibility would be having the deceased in a coffin until it reaches the gravesite and then bedding it without the coffin .
some other cities , such as essen and aachen , already make such concessions .
" we have to find an arrangement that is just for everyone and the procedure has to take place so that no one is offended , " strack said .
" we ’ re talking about different cultures here . "
re-evaluating burial culture in an effort to improve cultural sensitivity , undertakers are already being taught the entire spectrum of religions , rituals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young german burial trainee and customs during their vocational training in order to keep up with the changing needs of their future clients , said gernig .
“ we have fellow citizens from many different cultures and religions and we have to satisfy them , too , ” she said .
the growing sensitivity , as well as legislative changes like the one made in north-rhine westphalia are encouraging signs for elyas . " the government and the parties that have introduced these laws have tied them to their goal of integration , " he says .
" and this is a sign that politicians have recognized the signs of the times .
it will certainly give muslims a feeling of security and belonging .

integration for germany ’ s growing muslim population does not stop at death ’ s door as undertakers and city officials are learning .
dw-world 's sabina casagrande visits a cemetery where all graves face mecca . rows and rows of neat graves line the paths of cologne ’ s westfriedhof .
then , all of a sudden , a field catches the eye .
here , all of the graves are slanted .
the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .
the graves are dug so that a corpse lying on its right side faces mecca .
some plots at the westfriedhof bear ornate tombstones shaped like mosques or engraved with decorative inscriptions .
others are marked by a simple wooden plaque .
“ burial culture , like every form of culture , is constantly changing , ” said kerstin gernig , director of the board of german undertakers .
“ we are not a homogenous society , but rather an intercultural , a multicultural one , where various needs must be responded to accordingly . ”
decades after the first muslim guest workers began arriving in germany from turkey and north africa , where and how they bury their dead has forced germans to re-evaluate the laws and traditions involved in the country 's burial culture .
reunited in death with the home they left behind until now , muslim burials have actually been more the exception than the rule in germany .
many first generation muslims , who came here in the 1960s , still have strong family and emotional ties to their home countries .
they live here in the knowledge that though they may not return home during their lifetime , but at least be reunited in death .
in addition , the prohibitive cost of burial in germany , the small number of muslim cemeteries and legal disagreements over the method of muslim burial have made burial abroad more attractive for most muslim families , says mustapha el-founti , who owns al-rahma in essen , one of germany ’ s largest funeral homes for muslims .
according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .
but as the muslim population in germany becomes more entrenched , the desire to be buried elsewhere has begun to recede .
" most muslims have decided to remain in germany permanently , " nadeem elyas , chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , told dw-world .
" returning the dead to their home countries doesn ’ t make sense because the family ties are here in germany . ”
a resistance to muslim cemeteries but where to bury the dead ?
the only islamic cemetery in germany is in berlin and was opened in 1866 .
but it is long since filled and attempts by muslim groups to set up new graveyards have failed , said el-founti .
" we made the city of essen a proposal that we would buy the land ourselves and manage the cemetery .
and we were told : ' absolutely not ! '
a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .
the administrative hitch is hard for elyas to understand .

integration for germany ’ s growing muslim population does not stop at death ’ s door as undertakers and city officials are learning .
dw-world 's sabina casagrande visits a cemetery where all graves face mecca . rows and rows of neat graves line the paths of cologne ’ s westfriedhof .
then , all of a sudden , a field catches the eye .
here , all of the graves are slanted .
the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .
the graves are dug so that a corpse lying on its right side faces mecca .
some plots at the westfriedhof bear ornate tombstones shaped like mosques or engraved with decorative inscriptions .
others are marked by a simple wooden plaque .
“ burial culture , like every form of culture , is constantly changing , ” said kerstin gernig , director of the board of german undertakers .
“ we are not a homogenous society , but rather an intercultural , a multicultural one , where various needs must be responded to accordingly . ”
decades after the first muslim guest workers began arriving in germany from turkey and north africa , where and how they bury their dead has forced germans to re-evaluate the laws and traditions involved in the country 's burial culture .
reunited in death with the home they left behind until now , muslim burials have actually been more the exception than the rule in germany .
many first generation muslims , who came here in the 1960s , still have strong family and emotional ties to their home countries .
they live here in the knowledge that though they may not return home during their lifetime , but at least be reunited in death .
in addition , the prohibitive cost of burial in germany , the small number of muslim cemeteries and legal disagreements over the method of muslim burial have made burial abroad more attractive for most muslim families , says mustapha el-founti , who owns al-rahma in essen , one of germany ’ s largest funeral homes for muslims .
according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .
but as the muslim population in germany becomes more entrenched , the desire to be buried elsewhere has begun to recede .
" most muslims have decided to remain in germany permanently , " nadeem elyas , chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , told dw-world .
" returning the dead to their home countries doesn ’ t make sense because the family ties are here in germany . ”
a resistance to muslim cemeteries but where to bury the dead ?
the only islamic cemetery in germany is in berlin and was opened in 1866 .
but it is long since filled and attempts by muslim groups to set up new graveyards have failed , said el-founti .
" we made the city of essen a proposal that we would buy the land ourselves and manage the cemetery .
and we were told : ' absolutely not ! '
a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .
the administrative hitch is hard for elyas to understand .

burial without a coffin in the islamic faith , the deceased are buried without a coffin , wrapped only in linen cloths .

in north rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state , this law was recently changed .
individual communities can now decide for themselves whether to allow the coffin-free burial - much to the dismay of germany ’ s funeral industry .
" you have to consider that a funeral is a very dignified and solemn act , and the burial process is part of it , " says gernig , the head of the undertakers board . she points out how strange it would look if a family carried a body wrapped only in cloth to the gravesite .

one possibility would be having the deceased in a coffin until it reaches the gravesite and then bedding it without the coffin .

it would relieve the municipalities , " said elyas -lrb- photo -rrb- .
though municipalities have reached a compromise by setting up muslim burial grounds like the one in cologne , the islamic burial procedure remains a further obstacle for muslims .
burial without a coffin in the islamic faith , the deceased are buried without a coffin , wrapped only in linen cloths .
but across germany a coffin is required and only a few town councils were willing to make exceptions to the rule .
in north rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state , this law was recently changed .
individual communities can now decide for themselves whether to allow the coffin-free burial - much to the dismay of germany ’ s funeral industry .
" you have to consider that a funeral is a very dignified and solemn act , and the burial process is part of it , " says gernig , the head of the undertakers board . she points out how strange it would look if a family carried a body wrapped only in cloth to the gravesite .
" of course , you also have to consider the hygienic aspects .
the corpse can still discharge body fluids .
so the coffin also fulfils a specific function , ” she said .
a solution for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim burial ground in cologne city authorities in cologne , where the burial ground is located -lrb- photo -rrb- , have a similar position .
helmut strack , who heads the city ’ s cemetery department , says he can not expect his personnel to carry a corpse , which has maybe been dead for a few days , wrapped in only linen cloths .
but he wants to find a solution that will make everyone happy .
one possibility would be having the deceased in a coffin until it reaches the gravesite and then bedding it without the coffin .
some other cities , such as essen and aachen , already make such concessions .
" we have to find an arrangement that is just for everyone and the procedure has to take place so that no one is offended , " strack said .
" we ’ re talking about different cultures here . "
re-evaluating burial culture in an effort to improve cultural sensitivity , undertakers are already being taught the entire spectrum of religions , rituals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young german burial trainee and customs during their vocational training in order to keep up with the changing needs of their future clients , said gernig .
“ we have fellow citizens from many different cultures and religions and we have to satisfy them , too , ” she said .
the growing sensitivity , as well as legislative changes like the one made in north-rhine westphalia are encouraging signs for elyas . " the government and the parties that have introduced these laws have tied them to their goal of integration , " he says .
" and this is a sign that politicians have recognized the signs of the times .
it will certainly give muslims a feeling of security and belonging .

dw-world 's sabina casagrande visits a cemetery where all graves face mecca . rows and rows of neat graves line the paths of cologne ’ s westfriedhof .
then , all of a sudden , a field catches the eye .
here , all of the graves are slanted .
the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .
the graves are dug so that a corpse lying on its right side faces mecca .
some plots at the westfriedhof bear ornate tombstones shaped like mosques or engraved with decorative inscriptions .
others are marked by a simple wooden plaque .
“ burial culture , like every form of culture , is constantly changing , ” said kerstin gernig , director of the board of german undertakers .
“ we are not a homogenous society , but rather an intercultural , a multicultural one , where various needs must be responded to accordingly . ”
decades after the first muslim guest workers began arriving in germany from turkey and north africa , where and how they bury their dead has forced germans to re-evaluate the laws and traditions involved in the country 's burial culture .
reunited in death with the home they left behind until now , muslim burials have actually been more the exception than the rule in germany .
many first generation muslims , who came here in the 1960s , still have strong family and emotional ties to their home countries .
they live here in the knowledge that though they may not return home during their lifetime , but at least be reunited in death .
in addition , the prohibitive cost of burial in germany , the small number of muslim cemeteries and legal disagreements over the method of muslim burial have made burial abroad more attractive for most muslim families , says mustapha el-founti , who owns al-rahma in essen , one of germany ’ s largest funeral homes for muslims .
according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .
but as the muslim population in germany becomes more entrenched , the desire to be buried elsewhere has begun to recede .
" most muslims have decided to remain in germany permanently , " nadeem elyas , chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , told dw-world .
" returning the dead to their home countries doesn ’ t make sense because the family ties are here in germany . ”
a resistance to muslim cemeteries but where to bury the dead ?
the only islamic cemetery in germany is in berlin and was opened in 1866 .
but it is long since filled and attempts by muslim groups to set up new graveyards have failed , said el-founti .
" we made the city of essen a proposal that we would buy the land ourselves and manage the cemetery .
and we were told : ' absolutely not ! '
a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .
the administrative hitch is hard for elyas to understand .

it would relieve the municipalities , " said elyas -lrb- photo -rrb- .
though municipalities have reached a compromise by setting up muslim burial grounds like the one in cologne , the islamic burial procedure remains a further obstacle for muslims .
burial without a coffin in the islamic faith , the deceased are buried without a coffin , wrapped only in linen cloths .
but across germany a coffin is required and only a few town councils were willing to make exceptions to the rule .
in north rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state , this law was recently changed .
individual communities can now decide for themselves whether to allow the coffin-free burial - much to the dismay of germany ’ s funeral industry .
" you have to consider that a funeral is a very dignified and solemn act , and the burial process is part of it , " says gernig , the head of the undertakers board . she points out how strange it would look if a family carried a body wrapped only in cloth to the gravesite .
" of course , you also have to consider the hygienic aspects .
the corpse can still discharge body fluids .
so the coffin also fulfils a specific function , ” she said .
a solution for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim burial ground in cologne city authorities in cologne , where the burial ground is located -lrb- photo -rrb- , have a similar position .
helmut strack , who heads the city ’ s cemetery department , says he can not expect his personnel to carry a corpse , which has maybe been dead for a few days , wrapped in only linen cloths .
but he wants to find a solution that will make everyone happy .
one possibility would be having the deceased in a coffin until it reaches the gravesite and then bedding it without the coffin .
some other cities , such as essen and aachen , already make such concessions .
" we have to find an arrangement that is just for everyone and the procedure has to take place so that no one is offended , " strack said .
" we ’ re talking about different cultures here . "
re-evaluating burial culture in an effort to improve cultural sensitivity , undertakers are already being taught the entire spectrum of religions , rituals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young german burial trainee and customs during their vocational training in order to keep up with the changing needs of their future clients , said gernig .
“ we have fellow citizens from many different cultures and religions and we have to satisfy them , too , ” she said .
the growing sensitivity , as well as legislative changes like the one made in north-rhine westphalia are encouraging signs for elyas . " the government and the parties that have introduced these laws have tied them to their goal of integration , " he says .
" and this is a sign that politicians have recognized the signs of the times .
it will certainly give muslims a feeling of security and belonging .

integration for germany ’ s growing muslim population does not stop at death ’ s door as undertakers and city officials are learning .
dw-world 's sabina casagrande visits a cemetery where all graves face mecca . rows and rows of neat graves line the paths of cologne ’ s westfriedhof .
then , all of a sudden , a field catches the eye .
here , all of the graves are slanted .
the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .
the graves are dug so that a corpse lying on its right side faces mecca .
some plots at the westfriedhof bear ornate tombstones shaped like mosques or engraved with decorative inscriptions .
others are marked by a simple wooden plaque .
“ burial culture , like every form of culture , is constantly changing , ” said kerstin gernig , director of the board of german undertakers .
“ we are not a homogenous society , but rather an intercultural , a multicultural one , where various needs must be responded to accordingly . ”
decades after the first muslim guest workers began arriving in germany from turkey and north africa , where and how they bury their dead has forced germans to re-evaluate the laws and traditions involved in the country 's burial culture .
reunited in death with the home they left behind until now , muslim burials have actually been more the exception than the rule in germany .
many first generation muslims , who came here in the 1960s , still have strong family and emotional ties to their home countries .
they live here in the knowledge that though they may not return home during their lifetime , but at least be reunited in death .
in addition , the prohibitive cost of burial in germany , the small number of muslim cemeteries and legal disagreements over the method of muslim burial have made burial abroad more attractive for most muslim families , says mustapha el-founti , who owns al-rahma in essen , one of germany ’ s largest funeral homes for muslims .
according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .
but as the muslim population in germany becomes more entrenched , the desire to be buried elsewhere has begun to recede .
" most muslims have decided to remain in germany permanently , " nadeem elyas , chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , told dw-world .
" returning the dead to their home countries doesn ’ t make sense because the family ties are here in germany . ”
a resistance to muslim cemeteries but where to bury the dead ?
the only islamic cemetery in germany is in berlin and was opened in 1866 .
but it is long since filled and attempts by muslim groups to set up new graveyards have failed , said el-founti .
" we made the city of essen a proposal that we would buy the land ourselves and manage the cemetery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : integration in germany living next to , not with each other europe 's integration challenge europe -pipe- 19.04.2004 a wife bound by shame 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bound by honor and shame , victims of forced marriage often live lives of isolation and abuse .
in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .
france and norway have programs that counsel women facing or fleeing forced marriages .
britain boasts a special desk in the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- that helps citizens who are forced into marriage overseas .
last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .
lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
storr 's office is responsible for drafting a bill that would jail those involved in arranging marriages .
" maybe it will be a signal to these families , that we are aware of -lsb- the problem -rsb- , and maybe it will stop some from doing it . "
such a law is long overdue , says seyran ates , a berlin lawyer whose lobbying on the issue together with the german women 's organization terre des femmes brought forced marriages to the attention of german politicians last year .
german courts continue to tiptoe around the problem , labeling it as a something best taken care within the community .
judges have invoked " religion " or " tradition " in explaining why they were reducing the punishment for men who abused their wives in forced marriages , she says .
" they do n't see it as a human rights violation , " says ates , who fled her traditional turkish home at the age of 18 .
neither did öztürk .

in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .
france and norway have programs that counsel women facing or fleeing forced marriages .
britain boasts a special desk in the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- that helps citizens who are forced into marriage overseas .
last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .
lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
storr 's office is responsible for drafting a bill that would jail those involved in arranging marriages .
" maybe it will be a signal to these families , that we are aware of -lsb- the problem -rsb- , and maybe it will stop some from doing it . "
such a law is long overdue , says seyran ates , a berlin lawyer whose lobbying on the issue together with the german women 's organization terre des femmes brought forced marriages to the attention of german politicians last year .
german courts continue to tiptoe around the problem , labeling it as a something best taken care within the community .
judges have invoked " religion " or " tradition " in explaining why they were reducing the punishment for men who abused their wives in forced marriages , she says .
" they do n't see it as a human rights violation , " says ates , who fled her traditional turkish home at the age of 18 .

in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .
france and norway have programs that counsel women facing or fleeing forced marriages .
britain boasts a special desk in the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- that helps citizens who are forced into marriage overseas .
last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .

" we need to do more to integrate the immigrants here , " he says .

when he felt she was getting too independent , he looked around for a suitable husband .
she was working a shift at the hospital one night when a young man , the son of someone who had grown up in the same village as her father , came to ask for her hand in marriage .
shocked , she politely declined .
she soon found out it was n't her decision to make .
before she knew it , wedding invitations were being sent out .
her pleas fell on deaf ears .
" they did n't understand why i did n't want to marry him , " she says .
refusal would have meant shame many parents do n't know the pain they put their children through , says rahel volz , who heads terre des femmes , which is based in tübingen , germany .
" they were married the same way , and never asked why , " she says .
victims do n't say no early enough , so the parents just assume they accept , she adds .
öztürk knew refusal would have meant shame for her family , so she went along , saying goodbye to the brief taste of life outside her traditional upbringing .
her husband terrorized her , even physically abusing her on occasion , she says , adding that his mother and sister barred contact between öztürk and her family .

after an intense family discussion , her father relented and allowed her to divorce .
öztürk shakes her head and falls silent when telling this part of the story .
though she continues to stay in contact with her parents , she told them she could never forgive them .

in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .
france and norway have programs that counsel women facing or fleeing forced marriages .
britain boasts a special desk in the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- that helps citizens who are forced into marriage overseas .
last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .
lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
storr 's office is responsible for drafting a bill that would jail those involved in arranging marriages .
" maybe it will be a signal to these families , that we are aware of -lsb- the problem -rsb- , and maybe it will stop some from doing it . "
such a law is long overdue , says seyran ates , a berlin lawyer whose lobbying on the issue together with the german women 's organization terre des femmes brought forced marriages to the attention of german politicians last year .
german courts continue to tiptoe around the problem , labeling it as a something best taken care within the community .
judges have invoked " religion " or " tradition " in explaining why they were reducing the punishment for men who abused their wives in forced marriages , she says .
" they do n't see it as a human rights violation , " says ates , who fled her traditional turkish home at the age of 18 .
neither did öztürk .
the eldest sister in a family of three sons and two daughters , she was used to obeying her father and older brothers .
she learned early on to serve them first at meals and clean up afterward .

the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .
the graves are dug so that a corpse lying on its right side faces mecca .

“ burial culture , like every form of culture , is constantly changing , ” said kerstin gernig , director of the board of german undertakers .
“ we are not a homogenous society , but rather an intercultural , a multicultural one , where various needs must be responded to accordingly . ”
decades after the first muslim guest workers began arriving in germany from turkey and north africa , where and how they bury their dead has forced germans to re-evaluate the laws and traditions involved in the country 's burial culture .
reunited in death with the home they left behind until now , muslim burials have actually been more the exception than the rule in germany .
many first generation muslims , who came here in the 1960s , still have strong family and emotional ties to their home countries .
they live here in the knowledge that though they may not return home during their lifetime , but at least be reunited in death .
in addition , the prohibitive cost of burial in germany , the small number of muslim cemeteries and legal disagreements over the method of muslim burial have made burial abroad more attractive for most muslim families , says mustapha el-founti , who owns al-rahma in essen , one of germany ’ s largest funeral homes for muslims .
according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .

" returning the dead to their home countries doesn ’ t make sense because the family ties are here in germany . ”
a resistance to muslim cemeteries but where to bury the dead ?
the only islamic cemetery in germany is in berlin and was opened in 1866 .
but it is long since filled and attempts by muslim groups to set up new graveyards have failed , said el-founti .
" we made the city of essen a proposal that we would buy the land ourselves and manage the cemetery .
and we were told : ' absolutely not ! '
a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .
the administrative hitch is hard for elyas to understand .

but it is long since filled and attempts by muslim groups to set up new graveyards have failed , said el-founti .
" we made the city of essen a proposal that we would buy the land ourselves and manage the cemetery .
and we were told : ' absolutely not ! '
a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .
the administrative hitch is hard for elyas to understand .

integration for germany ’ s growing muslim population does not stop at death ’ s door as undertakers and city officials are learning .
dw-world 's sabina casagrande visits a cemetery where all graves face mecca . rows and rows of neat graves line the paths of cologne ’ s westfriedhof .
then , all of a sudden , a field catches the eye .
here , all of the graves are slanted .
the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .
the graves are dug so that a corpse lying on its right side faces mecca .
some plots at the westfriedhof bear ornate tombstones shaped like mosques or engraved with decorative inscriptions .
others are marked by a simple wooden plaque .
“ burial culture , like every form of culture , is constantly changing , ” said kerstin gernig , director of the board of german undertakers .
“ we are not a homogenous society , but rather an intercultural , a multicultural one , where various needs must be responded to accordingly . ”
decades after the first muslim guest workers began arriving in germany from turkey and north africa , where and how they bury their dead has forced germans to re-evaluate the laws and traditions involved in the country 's burial culture .
reunited in death with the home they left behind until now , muslim burials have actually been more the exception than the rule in germany .
many first generation muslims , who came here in the 1960s , still have strong family and emotional ties to their home countries .
they live here in the knowledge that though they may not return home during their lifetime , but at least be reunited in death .
in addition , the prohibitive cost of burial in germany , the small number of muslim cemeteries and legal disagreements over the method of muslim burial have made burial abroad more attractive for most muslim families , says mustapha el-founti , who owns al-rahma in essen , one of germany ’ s largest funeral homes for muslims .
according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .
but as the muslim population in germany becomes more entrenched , the desire to be buried elsewhere has begun to recede .
" most muslims have decided to remain in germany permanently , " nadeem elyas , chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , told dw-world .
" returning the dead to their home countries doesn ’ t make sense because the family ties are here in germany . ”

though municipalities have reached a compromise by setting up muslim burial grounds like the one in cologne , the islamic burial procedure remains a further obstacle for muslims .
burial without a coffin in the islamic faith , the deceased are buried without a coffin , wrapped only in linen cloths .

in north rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state , this law was recently changed .
individual communities can now decide for themselves whether to allow the coffin-free burial - much to the dismay of germany ’ s funeral industry .
" you have to consider that a funeral is a very dignified and solemn act , and the burial process is part of it , " says gernig , the head of the undertakers board . she points out how strange it would look if a family carried a body wrapped only in cloth to the gravesite .

helmut strack , who heads the city ’ s cemetery department , says he can not expect his personnel to carry a corpse , which has maybe been dead for a few days , wrapped in only linen cloths .
but he wants to find a solution that will make everyone happy .
one possibility would be having the deceased in a coffin until it reaches the gravesite and then bedding it without the coffin .
some other cities , such as essen and aachen , already make such concessions .
" we have to find an arrangement that is just for everyone and the procedure has to take place so that no one is offended , " strack said .
" we ’ re talking about different cultures here . "

here , all of the graves are slanted .
the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .
the graves are dug so that a corpse lying on its right side faces mecca .
some plots at the westfriedhof bear ornate tombstones shaped like mosques or engraved with decorative inscriptions .
others are marked by a simple wooden plaque .
“ burial culture , like every form of culture , is constantly changing , ” said kerstin gernig , director of the board of german undertakers .
“ we are not a homogenous society , but rather an intercultural , a multicultural one , where various needs must be responded to accordingly . ”
decades after the first muslim guest workers began arriving in germany from turkey and north africa , where and how they bury their dead has forced germans to re-evaluate the laws and traditions involved in the country 's burial culture .
reunited in death with the home they left behind until now , muslim burials have actually been more the exception than the rule in germany .
many first generation muslims , who came here in the 1960s , still have strong family and emotional ties to their home countries .
they live here in the knowledge that though they may not return home during their lifetime , but at least be reunited in death .
in addition , the prohibitive cost of burial in germany , the small number of muslim cemeteries and legal disagreements over the method of muslim burial have made burial abroad more attractive for most muslim families , says mustapha el-founti , who owns al-rahma in essen , one of germany ’ s largest funeral homes for muslims .
according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .
but as the muslim population in germany becomes more entrenched , the desire to be buried elsewhere has begun to recede .
" most muslims have decided to remain in germany permanently , " nadeem elyas , chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , told dw-world .
" returning the dead to their home countries doesn ’ t make sense because the family ties are here in germany . ”
a resistance to muslim cemeteries but where to bury the dead ?
the only islamic cemetery in germany is in berlin and was opened in 1866 .
but it is long since filled and attempts by muslim groups to set up new graveyards have failed , said el-founti .
" we made the city of essen a proposal that we would buy the land ourselves and manage the cemetery .
and we were told : ' absolutely not ! '
a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .
the administrative hitch is hard for elyas to understand .

a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .

nearly two months into the trial of accused child abductor and murderer marc dutroux , two of his surviving victims - now young women - are scheduled to testify this week . europeans glued to the trial of belgium 's most infamous criminal anxiously awaited the testimony of two of his victims , the first time they will speak before a jury . sabine dardenne , 20 , testified for about one hour on monday and 22-year-old laetitia delhez is expected to take the stand on tuesday . " he always said that i had a character like a pig , " dardenne said at the end of her testimony , turning directly to the defendant .
" why did n't he kill me then ? " dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has admitted raping dardenne , responded : " i never thought about killing her . "
his defense lawyer declined to ask dardenne questions .
" we have the utmost respect for you and , even though this comes much to late , the greatest compassion , " xavier magnee told the witness . judge stephane goux had previously asked dardenne questions about her abduction on may 28 , 1996 , but spared the young woman from having to recount her ordeal in captivity as letter she had written during her incarceration in dutroux 's cellar had already been read during the trial .
but dardenne indirectly confirmed that dutroux had raped her , adding that she had to clean the house when not locked in the cellar .
" i was his little maid , " she said . testimony crucial for outcome of trial the two women 's evidence is seen as vital to an ongoing debate in belgium over whether the defendant acted on his own in committing the crimes he is accused of , or was part of a pedophilia network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laetitia delhez , left , arrives with her lawyer , georges-henri beauthier , at the palace of justice in arlon , belgium , monday april 19 , 2004 .
dardenne and delhez -lrb- photo -rrb- were 12 and 14 years old respectively in the summer of 1996 when they were abducted .
dardenne was in captivity for 80 days , while delhez was held for eight days before being freed by police . dutroux , now 47 years old , is charged altogether with kidnapping and rape of six girls during the mid-1990s , and with the deaths of four of them .
two girls starved in a cellar , while two others were buried alive . dutroux denies having killed any of the children , and admits only the abduction of four of the girls . on the eve of the trial , dutroux sparked further controversy by sending a letter to belgian media saying he was only a small part of a criminal network that had links to belgian law enforcement . but to the frustration of belgians , who have reacted to the scandal with mass outpourings of outrage and horror , the trial - involving numerous witnesses often with conflicting testimony - has n't clarified the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- is being tried along with three accomplices : his now-estranged wife michelle martin , a drug-addicted drifter michel lelievre , and a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , michel nihoul .
each of the defendants claim the others are guilty . seeking justice in her one television interview , given in belgium , dardenne said she hopes her testimony will help bring about justice .
she also said she hopes to show dutroux that he did n't destroy her , and that despite her ordeal she is able to lead a normal life . despite the insistence of the victims ' parents and of dutroux 's lawyers that dutroux was acting as part of a larger pedophilia ring , the trial has yet to offer up any hard proof .
to date there is no evidence that nihoul was part of the kidnappings , although many believe he represents the link between dutroux and the alleged child pornography ring . however , there has been an increasing spate of evidence showing disastrous omissions on the part of the investigators . the search methods of police and the judicial system has been a key issue in the trial ; this has lead to further widespread conspiracy theories that there people from the highest political circles have tried to obstruct progress in prosecuting the case . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium 's shame goes global as dutroux trial opens the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media .

want to throw back a nice bavarian brew while watching a world cup match in germany in 2006 ?
sorry , you 'll have to make due with american suds .
u.s. brewer anheuser-busch has the exclusive contract for beer there . world cup 2006 might be taking place in germany , but the beer flowing from the taps at the concession stands is going to be american , thanks to a sponsoring agreement between fifa , soccer 's governing body and anheuser-busch , the world 's largest brewery .
in the stadiums across germany where world cup matches are being played , local firms are only allowed to do business if they , according to the contract stipulations , are " not competition for the sponsor . "
therefore , locals brews are taboo ; they can only sell their pilsners and ales outside a specific area around the stadium premises .
" that ca n't be , " complained hermann winkler , president of the state of saxony sports federation , to the sächsische zeitung newspaper .
" a lot of breweries support sports in saxony , but the minute there 's a little money to be earned , they 're left standing out in the cold . "
however , anheuser-busch , maker of budweiser and michelob beers , appears to have scored a winning goal with this business deal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.04.2004 survivors take stand at dutroux trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine dardenne arriving at the courthouse on monday .
nearly two months into the trial of accused child abductor and murderer marc dutroux , two of his surviving victims - now young women - are scheduled to testify this week . europeans glued to the trial of belgium 's most infamous criminal anxiously awaited the testimony of two of his victims , the first time they will speak before a jury . sabine dardenne , 20 , testified for about one hour on monday and 22-year-old laetitia delhez is expected to take the stand on tuesday . " he always said that i had a character like a pig , " dardenne said at the end of her testimony , turning directly to the defendant .
" why did n't he kill me then ? " dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has admitted raping dardenne , responded : " i never thought about killing her . "
his defense lawyer declined to ask dardenne questions .
" we have the utmost respect for you and , even though this comes much to late , the greatest compassion , " xavier magnee told the witness . judge stephane goux had previously asked dardenne questions about her abduction on may 28 , 1996 , but spared the young woman from having to recount her ordeal in captivity as letter she had written during her incarceration in dutroux 's cellar had already been read during the trial .
but dardenne indirectly confirmed that dutroux had raped her , adding that she had to clean the house when not locked in the cellar .
" i was his little maid , " she said . testimony crucial for outcome of trial the two women 's evidence is seen as vital to an ongoing debate in belgium over whether the defendant acted on his own in committing the crimes he is accused of , or was part of a pedophilia network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laetitia delhez , left , arrives with her lawyer , georges-henri beauthier , at the palace of justice in arlon , belgium , monday april 19 , 2004 .
dardenne and delhez -lrb- photo -rrb- were 12 and 14 years old respectively in the summer of 1996 when they were abducted .
dardenne was in captivity for 80 days , while delhez was held for eight days before being freed by police . dutroux , now 47 years old , is charged altogether with kidnapping and rape of six girls during the mid-1990s , and with the deaths of four of them .
two girls starved in a cellar , while two others were buried alive . dutroux denies having killed any of the children , and admits only the abduction of four of the girls . on the eve of the trial , dutroux sparked further controversy by sending a letter to belgian media saying he was only a small part of a criminal network that had links to belgian law enforcement . but to the frustration of belgians , who have reacted to the scandal with mass outpourings of outrage and horror , the trial - involving numerous witnesses often with conflicting testimony - has n't clarified the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- is being tried along with three accomplices : his now-estranged wife michelle martin , a drug-addicted drifter michel lelievre , and a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , michel nihoul .
each of the defendants claim the others are guilty . seeking justice in her one television interview , given in belgium , dardenne said she hopes her testimony will help bring about justice .
she also said she hopes to show dutroux that he did n't destroy her , and that despite her ordeal she is able to lead a normal life . despite the insistence of the victims ' parents and of dutroux 's lawyers that dutroux was acting as part of a larger pedophilia ring , the trial has yet to offer up any hard proof .
to date there is no evidence that nihoul was part of the kidnappings , although many believe he represents the link between dutroux and the alleged child pornography ring . however , there has been an increasing spate of evidence showing disastrous omissions on the part of the investigators . the search methods of police and the judicial system has been a key issue in the trial ; this has lead to further widespread conspiracy theories that there people from the highest political circles have tried to obstruct progress in prosecuting the case . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium 's shame goes global as dutroux trial opens the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media .

she was working a shift at the hospital one night when a young man , the son of someone who had grown up in the same village as her father , came to ask for her hand in marriage .
shocked , she politely declined .
she soon found out it was n't her decision to make .

roth , 48 , is the german green party 's expert on human rights and a sought-after partner on questions of integration and immigration .
the former manager of a rock band , roth entered politics in 1985 and has profiled herself both nationally and in europe as a tireless advocate for minority groups , homosexuals and refugees .
she was appointed the government 's commissioner of human rights and humanitarian aid in march 2003 .
bosbach , the domestic affairs expert in the german parliament for the conservative christian democratic union , has been a reliable and steadfast critic of the schröder government 's integration and immigration policy .
in recent negotiations over a proposed immigration law , the 51-year-old politician lead the charge against what he felt was a government law that encouraged immigrants to come to germany .
" we need to do more to integrate the immigrants here , " he says .

when he felt she was getting too independent , he looked around for a suitable husband .
she was working a shift at the hospital one night when a young man , the son of someone who had grown up in the same village as her father , came to ask for her hand in marriage .
shocked , she politely declined .
she soon found out it was n't her decision to make .
before she knew it , wedding invitations were being sent out .
her pleas fell on deaf ears .
" they did n't understand why i did n't want to marry him , " she says .
refusal would have meant shame many parents do n't know the pain they put their children through , says rahel volz , who heads terre des femmes , which is based in tübingen , germany .
" they were married the same way , and never asked why , " she says .
victims do n't say no early enough , so the parents just assume they accept , she adds .
öztürk knew refusal would have meant shame for her family , so she went along , saying goodbye to the brief taste of life outside her traditional upbringing .
her husband terrorized her , even physically abusing her on occasion , she says , adding that his mother and sister barred contact between öztürk and her family .
" i did n't feel anything or want anything , " she says , recalling that period of her life .
" i would walk the streets without a destination . "
uncle intervenes to save her she sneaked away to visit a psychologist , but could n't muster the courage to do what the doctor told her : leave .
when she told her parents she wanted out , they turned her away at their doorstep - twice .
as a last resort , she appealed to her uncle , the more liberal-minded brother in her father 's family .
after an intense family discussion , her father relented and allowed her to divorce .
öztürk shakes her head and falls silent when telling this part of the story .
though she continues to stay in contact with her parents , she told them she could never forgive them .
" it 's a closed chapter in my life , " says öztürk , who is now married - to a man of her choosing - and has a three-month-old baby .
" but there are still wounds .

in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .
france and norway have programs that counsel women facing or fleeing forced marriages .
britain boasts a special desk in the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- that helps citizens who are forced into marriage overseas .
last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .
lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
storr 's office is responsible for drafting a bill that would jail those involved in arranging marriages .
" maybe it will be a signal to these families , that we are aware of -lsb- the problem -rsb- , and maybe it will stop some from doing it . "
such a law is long overdue , says seyran ates , a berlin lawyer whose lobbying on the issue together with the german women 's organization terre des femmes brought forced marriages to the attention of german politicians last year .
german courts continue to tiptoe around the problem , labeling it as a something best taken care within the community .
judges have invoked " religion " or " tradition " in explaining why they were reducing the punishment for men who abused their wives in forced marriages , she says .
" they do n't see it as a human rights violation , " says ates , who fled her traditional turkish home at the age of 18 .
neither did öztürk .
the eldest sister in a family of three sons and two daughters , she was used to obeying her father and older brothers .
she learned early on to serve them first at meals and clean up afterward .

lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .

in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .

" nothing 's going to change for the time being , " peter traumann , the head of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- , told daily berliner zeitung , adding that it would be too risky for companies to market gm products as most people reject the idea of eating such food .

as a result , no penalties currently exist in germany for those who do not comply with the directive . products likely to get more expensive consumer rights advocates meanwhile warned that the new regulation would likely lead to an increase in prices by about 10 percent as companies would have to submit their products for additional tests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.04.2004 survivors take stand at dutroux trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine dardenne arriving at the courthouse on monday .
nearly two months into the trial of accused child abductor and murderer marc dutroux , two of his surviving victims - now young women - are scheduled to testify this week . europeans glued to the trial of belgium 's most infamous criminal anxiously awaited the testimony of two of his victims , the first time they will speak before a jury . sabine dardenne , 20 , testified for about one hour on monday and 22-year-old laetitia delhez is expected to take the stand on tuesday . " he always said that i had a character like a pig , " dardenne said at the end of her testimony , turning directly to the defendant .
" why did n't he kill me then ? " dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has admitted raping dardenne , responded : " i never thought about killing her . "
his defense lawyer declined to ask dardenne questions .
" we have the utmost respect for you and , even though this comes much to late , the greatest compassion , " xavier magnee told the witness . judge stephane goux had previously asked dardenne questions about her abduction on may 28 , 1996 , but spared the young woman from having to recount her ordeal in captivity as letter she had written during her incarceration in dutroux 's cellar had already been read during the trial .
but dardenne indirectly confirmed that dutroux had raped her , adding that she had to clean the house when not locked in the cellar .
" i was his little maid , " she said . testimony crucial for outcome of trial the two women 's evidence is seen as vital to an ongoing debate in belgium over whether the defendant acted on his own in committing the crimes he is accused of , or was part of a pedophilia network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laetitia delhez , left , arrives with her lawyer , georges-henri beauthier , at the palace of justice in arlon , belgium , monday april 19 , 2004 .
dardenne and delhez -lrb- photo -rrb- were 12 and 14 years old respectively in the summer of 1996 when they were abducted .
dardenne was in captivity for 80 days , while delhez was held for eight days before being freed by police . dutroux , now 47 years old , is charged altogether with kidnapping and rape of six girls during the mid-1990s , and with the deaths of four of them .
two girls starved in a cellar , while two others were buried alive . dutroux denies having killed any of the children , and admits only the abduction of four of the girls . on the eve of the trial , dutroux sparked further controversy by sending a letter to belgian media saying he was only a small part of a criminal network that had links to belgian law enforcement . but to the frustration of belgians , who have reacted to the scandal with mass outpourings of outrage and horror , the trial - involving numerous witnesses often with conflicting testimony - has n't clarified the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- is being tried along with three accomplices : his now-estranged wife michelle martin , a drug-addicted drifter michel lelievre , and a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , michel nihoul .
each of the defendants claim the others are guilty . seeking justice in her one television interview , given in belgium , dardenne said she hopes her testimony will help bring about justice .
she also said she hopes to show dutroux that he did n't destroy her , and that despite her ordeal she is able to lead a normal life . despite the insistence of the victims ' parents and of dutroux 's lawyers that dutroux was acting as part of a larger pedophilia ring , the trial has yet to offer up any hard proof .
to date there is no evidence that nihoul was part of the kidnappings , although many believe he represents the link between dutroux and the alleged child pornography ring . however , there has been an increasing spate of evidence showing disastrous omissions on the part of the investigators . the search methods of police and the judicial system has been a key issue in the trial ; this has lead to further widespread conspiracy theories that there people from the highest political circles have tried to obstruct progress in prosecuting the case . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium 's shame goes global as dutroux trial opens the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media .

it would relieve the municipalities , " said elyas -lrb- photo -rrb- .
though municipalities have reached a compromise by setting up muslim burial grounds like the one in cologne , the islamic burial procedure remains a further obstacle for muslims .
burial without a coffin in the islamic faith , the deceased are buried without a coffin , wrapped only in linen cloths .
but across germany a coffin is required and only a few town councils were willing to make exceptions to the rule .
in north rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state , this law was recently changed .
individual communities can now decide for themselves whether to allow the coffin-free burial - much to the dismay of germany ’ s funeral industry .
" you have to consider that a funeral is a very dignified and solemn act , and the burial process is part of it , " says gernig , the head of the undertakers board . she points out how strange it would look if a family carried a body wrapped only in cloth to the gravesite .
" of course , you also have to consider the hygienic aspects .
the corpse can still discharge body fluids .
so the coffin also fulfils a specific function , ” she said .
a solution for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim burial ground in cologne city authorities in cologne , where the burial ground is located -lrb- photo -rrb- , have a similar position .
helmut strack , who heads the city ’ s cemetery department , says he can not expect his personnel to carry a corpse , which has maybe been dead for a few days , wrapped in only linen cloths .
but he wants to find a solution that will make everyone happy .
one possibility would be having the deceased in a coffin until it reaches the gravesite and then bedding it without the coffin .
some other cities , such as essen and aachen , already make such concessions .
" we have to find an arrangement that is just for everyone and the procedure has to take place so that no one is offended , " strack said .
" we ’ re talking about different cultures here . "
re-evaluating burial culture in an effort to improve cultural sensitivity , undertakers are already being taught the entire spectrum of religions , rituals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young german burial trainee and customs during their vocational training in order to keep up with the changing needs of their future clients , said gernig .
“ we have fellow citizens from many different cultures and religions and we have to satisfy them , too , ” she said .
the growing sensitivity , as well as legislative changes like the one made in north-rhine westphalia are encouraging signs for elyas . " the government and the parties that have introduced these laws have tied them to their goal of integration , " he says .
" and this is a sign that politicians have recognized the signs of the times .
it will certainly give muslims a feeling of security and belonging .

integration for germany ’ s growing muslim population does not stop at death ’ s door as undertakers and city officials are learning .
dw-world 's sabina casagrande visits a cemetery where all graves face mecca . rows and rows of neat graves line the paths of cologne ’ s westfriedhof .
then , all of a sudden , a field catches the eye .
here , all of the graves are slanted .
the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .
the graves are dug so that a corpse lying on its right side faces mecca .
some plots at the westfriedhof bear ornate tombstones shaped like mosques or engraved with decorative inscriptions .
others are marked by a simple wooden plaque .
“ burial culture , like every form of culture , is constantly changing , ” said kerstin gernig , director of the board of german undertakers .
“ we are not a homogenous society , but rather an intercultural , a multicultural one , where various needs must be responded to accordingly . ”
decades after the first muslim guest workers began arriving in germany from turkey and north africa , where and how they bury their dead has forced germans to re-evaluate the laws and traditions involved in the country 's burial culture .
reunited in death with the home they left behind until now , muslim burials have actually been more the exception than the rule in germany .
many first generation muslims , who came here in the 1960s , still have strong family and emotional ties to their home countries .
they live here in the knowledge that though they may not return home during their lifetime , but at least be reunited in death .
in addition , the prohibitive cost of burial in germany , the small number of muslim cemeteries and legal disagreements over the method of muslim burial have made burial abroad more attractive for most muslim families , says mustapha el-founti , who owns al-rahma in essen , one of germany ’ s largest funeral homes for muslims .
according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .
but as the muslim population in germany becomes more entrenched , the desire to be buried elsewhere has begun to recede .
" most muslims have decided to remain in germany permanently , " nadeem elyas , chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , told dw-world .
" returning the dead to their home countries doesn ’ t make sense because the family ties are here in germany . ”
a resistance to muslim cemeteries but where to bury the dead ?
the only islamic cemetery in germany is in berlin and was opened in 1866 .
but it is long since filled and attempts by muslim groups to set up new graveyards have failed , said el-founti .
" we made the city of essen a proposal that we would buy the land ourselves and manage the cemetery .
and we were told : ' absolutely not ! '
a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .
the administrative hitch is hard for elyas to understand .

dw-world 's sabina casagrande visits a cemetery where all graves face mecca . rows and rows of neat graves line the paths of cologne ’ s westfriedhof .
then , all of a sudden , a field catches the eye .
here , all of the graves are slanted .
the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .
the graves are dug so that a corpse lying on its right side faces mecca .
some plots at the westfriedhof bear ornate tombstones shaped like mosques or engraved with decorative inscriptions .
others are marked by a simple wooden plaque .
“ burial culture , like every form of culture , is constantly changing , ” said kerstin gernig , director of the board of german undertakers .
“ we are not a homogenous society , but rather an intercultural , a multicultural one , where various needs must be responded to accordingly . ”
decades after the first muslim guest workers began arriving in germany from turkey and north africa , where and how they bury their dead has forced germans to re-evaluate the laws and traditions involved in the country 's burial culture .
reunited in death with the home they left behind until now , muslim burials have actually been more the exception than the rule in germany .
many first generation muslims , who came here in the 1960s , still have strong family and emotional ties to their home countries .
they live here in the knowledge that though they may not return home during their lifetime , but at least be reunited in death .
in addition , the prohibitive cost of burial in germany , the small number of muslim cemeteries and legal disagreements over the method of muslim burial have made burial abroad more attractive for most muslim families , says mustapha el-founti , who owns al-rahma in essen , one of germany ’ s largest funeral homes for muslims .
according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .
but as the muslim population in germany becomes more entrenched , the desire to be buried elsewhere has begun to recede .
" most muslims have decided to remain in germany permanently , " nadeem elyas , chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , told dw-world .
" returning the dead to their home countries doesn ’ t make sense because the family ties are here in germany . ”
a resistance to muslim cemeteries but where to bury the dead ?
the only islamic cemetery in germany is in berlin and was opened in 1866 .
but it is long since filled and attempts by muslim groups to set up new graveyards have failed , said el-founti .
" we made the city of essen a proposal that we would buy the land ourselves and manage the cemetery .
and we were told : ' absolutely not ! '
a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .
the administrative hitch is hard for elyas to understand .

it would relieve the municipalities , " said elyas -lrb- photo -rrb- .
though municipalities have reached a compromise by setting up muslim burial grounds like the one in cologne , the islamic burial procedure remains a further obstacle for muslims .
burial without a coffin in the islamic faith , the deceased are buried without a coffin , wrapped only in linen cloths .
but across germany a coffin is required and only a few town councils were willing to make exceptions to the rule .
in north rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state , this law was recently changed .
individual communities can now decide for themselves whether to allow the coffin-free burial - much to the dismay of germany ’ s funeral industry .
" you have to consider that a funeral is a very dignified and solemn act , and the burial process is part of it , " says gernig , the head of the undertakers board . she points out how strange it would look if a family carried a body wrapped only in cloth to the gravesite .
" of course , you also have to consider the hygienic aspects .
the corpse can still discharge body fluids .
so the coffin also fulfils a specific function , ” she said .
a solution for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim burial ground in cologne city authorities in cologne , where the burial ground is located -lrb- photo -rrb- , have a similar position .
helmut strack , who heads the city ’ s cemetery department , says he can not expect his personnel to carry a corpse , which has maybe been dead for a few days , wrapped in only linen cloths .
but he wants to find a solution that will make everyone happy .
one possibility would be having the deceased in a coffin until it reaches the gravesite and then bedding it without the coffin .
some other cities , such as essen and aachen , already make such concessions .
" we have to find an arrangement that is just for everyone and the procedure has to take place so that no one is offended , " strack said .
" we ’ re talking about different cultures here . "
re-evaluating burial culture in an effort to improve cultural sensitivity , undertakers are already being taught the entire spectrum of religions , rituals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young german burial trainee and customs during their vocational training in order to keep up with the changing needs of their future clients , said gernig .
“ we have fellow citizens from many different cultures and religions and we have to satisfy them , too , ” she said .
the growing sensitivity , as well as legislative changes like the one made in north-rhine westphalia are encouraging signs for elyas . " the government and the parties that have introduced these laws have tied them to their goal of integration , " he says .
" and this is a sign that politicians have recognized the signs of the times .
it will certainly give muslims a feeling of security and belonging .

in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .
france and norway have programs that counsel women facing or fleeing forced marriages .
britain boasts a special desk in the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- that helps citizens who are forced into marriage overseas .
last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .
lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
storr 's office is responsible for drafting a bill that would jail those involved in arranging marriages .
" maybe it will be a signal to these families , that we are aware of -lsb- the problem -rsb- , and maybe it will stop some from doing it . "
such a law is long overdue , says seyran ates , a berlin lawyer whose lobbying on the issue together with the german women 's organization terre des femmes brought forced marriages to the attention of german politicians last year .
german courts continue to tiptoe around the problem , labeling it as a something best taken care within the community .
judges have invoked " religion " or " tradition " in explaining why they were reducing the punishment for men who abused their wives in forced marriages , she says .
" they do n't see it as a human rights violation , " says ates , who fled her traditional turkish home at the age of 18 .
neither did öztürk .
the eldest sister in a family of three sons and two daughters , she was used to obeying her father and older brothers .
she learned early on to serve them first at meals and clean up afterward .

in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .

" my friends all had goose bumps .

shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .

in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .

nearly two months into the trial of accused child abductor and murderer marc dutroux , two of his surviving victims - now young women - are scheduled to testify this week . europeans glued to the trial of belgium 's most infamous criminal anxiously awaited the testimony of two of his victims , the first time they will speak before a jury . sabine dardenne , 20 , testified for about one hour on monday and 22-year-old laetitia delhez is expected to take the stand on tuesday . " he always said that i had a character like a pig , " dardenne said at the end of her testimony , turning directly to the defendant .
" why did n't he kill me then ? " dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has admitted raping dardenne , responded : " i never thought about killing her . "
his defense lawyer declined to ask dardenne questions .
" we have the utmost respect for you and , even though this comes much to late , the greatest compassion , " xavier magnee told the witness . judge stephane goux had previously asked dardenne questions about her abduction on may 28 , 1996 , but spared the young woman from having to recount her ordeal in captivity as letter she had written during her incarceration in dutroux 's cellar had already been read during the trial .
but dardenne indirectly confirmed that dutroux had raped her , adding that she had to clean the house when not locked in the cellar .
" i was his little maid , " she said . testimony crucial for outcome of trial the two women 's evidence is seen as vital to an ongoing debate in belgium over whether the defendant acted on his own in committing the crimes he is accused of , or was part of a pedophilia network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laetitia delhez , left , arrives with her lawyer , georges-henri beauthier , at the palace of justice in arlon , belgium , monday april 19 , 2004 .
dardenne and delhez -lrb- photo -rrb- were 12 and 14 years old respectively in the summer of 1996 when they were abducted .
dardenne was in captivity for 80 days , while delhez was held for eight days before being freed by police . dutroux , now 47 years old , is charged altogether with kidnapping and rape of six girls during the mid-1990s , and with the deaths of four of them .
two girls starved in a cellar , while two others were buried alive . dutroux denies having killed any of the children , and admits only the abduction of four of the girls . on the eve of the trial , dutroux sparked further controversy by sending a letter to belgian media saying he was only a small part of a criminal network that had links to belgian law enforcement . but to the frustration of belgians , who have reacted to the scandal with mass outpourings of outrage and horror , the trial - involving numerous witnesses often with conflicting testimony - has n't clarified the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- is being tried along with three accomplices : his now-estranged wife michelle martin , a drug-addicted drifter michel lelievre , and a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , michel nihoul .
each of the defendants claim the others are guilty . seeking justice in her one television interview , given in belgium , dardenne said she hopes her testimony will help bring about justice .
she also said she hopes to show dutroux that he did n't destroy her , and that despite her ordeal she is able to lead a normal life . despite the insistence of the victims ' parents and of dutroux 's lawyers that dutroux was acting as part of a larger pedophilia ring , the trial has yet to offer up any hard proof .
to date there is no evidence that nihoul was part of the kidnappings , although many believe he represents the link between dutroux and the alleged child pornography ring . however , there has been an increasing spate of evidence showing disastrous omissions on the part of the investigators . the search methods of police and the judicial system has been a key issue in the trial ; this has lead to further widespread conspiracy theories that there people from the highest political circles have tried to obstruct progress in prosecuting the case . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium 's shame goes global as dutroux trial opens the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media .

want to throw back a nice bavarian brew while watching a world cup match in germany in 2006 ?
sorry , you 'll have to make due with american suds .
u.s. brewer anheuser-busch has the exclusive contract for beer there . world cup 2006 might be taking place in germany , but the beer flowing from the taps at the concession stands is going to be american , thanks to a sponsoring agreement between fifa , soccer 's governing body and anheuser-busch , the world 's largest brewery .
in the stadiums across germany where world cup matches are being played , local firms are only allowed to do business if they , according to the contract stipulations , are " not competition for the sponsor . "
therefore , locals brews are taboo ; they can only sell their pilsners and ales outside a specific area around the stadium premises .
" that ca n't be , " complained hermann winkler , president of the state of saxony sports federation , to the sächsische zeitung newspaper .
" a lot of breweries support sports in saxony , but the minute there 's a little money to be earned , they 're left standing out in the cold . "
however , anheuser-busch , maker of budweiser and michelob beers , appears to have scored a winning goal with this business deal .
the u.s. multinational has tried for years to get a foothold in germany , particularly with its budweiser brand .
but since that name is already taken in europe by the original czech budweiser brand , the americans have repeatedly hit a brick wall .
that wall looks set to crumble in two years ' time .
reinhard zwanzig , who heads saxony 's brewers ' federation , said the decision was regrettable , but he does n't think the american budweiser is going to find many of its own fans among the soccer ones .

in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .
france and norway have programs that counsel women facing or fleeing forced marriages .
britain boasts a special desk in the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- that helps citizens who are forced into marriage overseas .
last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .
lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
storr 's office is responsible for drafting a bill that would jail those involved in arranging marriages .
" maybe it will be a signal to these families , that we are aware of -lsb- the problem -rsb- , and maybe it will stop some from doing it . "
such a law is long overdue , says seyran ates , a berlin lawyer whose lobbying on the issue together with the german women 's organization terre des femmes brought forced marriages to the attention of german politicians last year .
german courts continue to tiptoe around the problem , labeling it as a something best taken care within the community .
judges have invoked " religion " or " tradition " in explaining why they were reducing the punishment for men who abused their wives in forced marriages , she says .
" they do n't see it as a human rights violation , " says ates , who fled her traditional turkish home at the age of 18 .
neither did öztürk .
the eldest sister in a family of three sons and two daughters , she was used to obeying her father and older brothers .
she learned early on to serve them first at meals and clean up afterward .

nearly two months into the trial of accused child abductor and murderer marc dutroux , two of his surviving victims - now young women - are scheduled to testify this week . europeans glued to the trial of belgium 's most infamous criminal anxiously awaited the testimony of two of his victims , the first time they will speak before a jury . sabine dardenne , 20 , testified for about one hour on monday and 22-year-old laetitia delhez is expected to take the stand on tuesday . " he always said that i had a character like a pig , " dardenne said at the end of her testimony , turning directly to the defendant .
" why did n't he kill me then ? " dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has admitted raping dardenne , responded : " i never thought about killing her . "
his defense lawyer declined to ask dardenne questions .
" we have the utmost respect for you and , even though this comes much to late , the greatest compassion , " xavier magnee told the witness . judge stephane goux had previously asked dardenne questions about her abduction on may 28 , 1996 , but spared the young woman from having to recount her ordeal in captivity as letter she had written during her incarceration in dutroux 's cellar had already been read during the trial .
but dardenne indirectly confirmed that dutroux had raped her , adding that she had to clean the house when not locked in the cellar .
" i was his little maid , " she said . testimony crucial for outcome of trial the two women 's evidence is seen as vital to an ongoing debate in belgium over whether the defendant acted on his own in committing the crimes he is accused of , or was part of a pedophilia network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laetitia delhez , left , arrives with her lawyer , georges-henri beauthier , at the palace of justice in arlon , belgium , monday april 19 , 2004 .
dardenne and delhez -lrb- photo -rrb- were 12 and 14 years old respectively in the summer of 1996 when they were abducted .
dardenne was in captivity for 80 days , while delhez was held for eight days before being freed by police . dutroux , now 47 years old , is charged altogether with kidnapping and rape of six girls during the mid-1990s , and with the deaths of four of them .
two girls starved in a cellar , while two others were buried alive . dutroux denies having killed any of the children , and admits only the abduction of four of the girls . on the eve of the trial , dutroux sparked further controversy by sending a letter to belgian media saying he was only a small part of a criminal network that had links to belgian law enforcement . but to the frustration of belgians , who have reacted to the scandal with mass outpourings of outrage and horror , the trial - involving numerous witnesses often with conflicting testimony - has n't clarified the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- is being tried along with three accomplices : his now-estranged wife michelle martin , a drug-addicted drifter michel lelievre , and a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , michel nihoul .
each of the defendants claim the others are guilty . seeking justice in her one television interview , given in belgium , dardenne said she hopes her testimony will help bring about justice .
she also said she hopes to show dutroux that he did n't destroy her , and that despite her ordeal she is able to lead a normal life . despite the insistence of the victims ' parents and of dutroux 's lawyers that dutroux was acting as part of a larger pedophilia ring , the trial has yet to offer up any hard proof .
to date there is no evidence that nihoul was part of the kidnappings , although many believe he represents the link between dutroux and the alleged child pornography ring . however , there has been an increasing spate of evidence showing disastrous omissions on the part of the investigators . the search methods of police and the judicial system has been a key issue in the trial ; this has lead to further widespread conspiracy theories that there people from the highest political circles have tried to obstruct progress in prosecuting the case . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium 's shame goes global as dutroux trial opens the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media .

nearly two months into the trial of accused child abductor and murderer marc dutroux , two of his surviving victims - now young women - are scheduled to testify this week . europeans glued to the trial of belgium 's most infamous criminal anxiously awaited the testimony of two of his victims , the first time they will speak before a jury . sabine dardenne , 20 , testified for about one hour on monday and 22-year-old laetitia delhez is expected to take the stand on tuesday . " he always said that i had a character like a pig , " dardenne said at the end of her testimony , turning directly to the defendant .
" why did n't he kill me then ? " dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has admitted raping dardenne , responded : " i never thought about killing her . "
his defense lawyer declined to ask dardenne questions .
" we have the utmost respect for you and , even though this comes much to late , the greatest compassion , " xavier magnee told the witness . judge stephane goux had previously asked dardenne questions about her abduction on may 28 , 1996 , but spared the young woman from having to recount her ordeal in captivity as letter she had written during her incarceration in dutroux 's cellar had already been read during the trial .
but dardenne indirectly confirmed that dutroux had raped her , adding that she had to clean the house when not locked in the cellar .
" i was his little maid , " she said . testimony crucial for outcome of trial the two women 's evidence is seen as vital to an ongoing debate in belgium over whether the defendant acted on his own in committing the crimes he is accused of , or was part of a pedophilia network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laetitia delhez , left , arrives with her lawyer , georges-henri beauthier , at the palace of justice in arlon , belgium , monday april 19 , 2004 .
dardenne and delhez -lrb- photo -rrb- were 12 and 14 years old respectively in the summer of 1996 when they were abducted .
dardenne was in captivity for 80 days , while delhez was held for eight days before being freed by police . dutroux , now 47 years old , is charged altogether with kidnapping and rape of six girls during the mid-1990s , and with the deaths of four of them .
two girls starved in a cellar , while two others were buried alive . dutroux denies having killed any of the children , and admits only the abduction of four of the girls . on the eve of the trial , dutroux sparked further controversy by sending a letter to belgian media saying he was only a small part of a criminal network that had links to belgian law enforcement . but to the frustration of belgians , who have reacted to the scandal with mass outpourings of outrage and horror , the trial - involving numerous witnesses often with conflicting testimony - has n't clarified the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- is being tried along with three accomplices : his now-estranged wife michelle martin , a drug-addicted drifter michel lelievre , and a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , michel nihoul .
each of the defendants claim the others are guilty . seeking justice in her one television interview , given in belgium , dardenne said she hopes her testimony will help bring about justice .
she also said she hopes to show dutroux that he did n't destroy her , and that despite her ordeal she is able to lead a normal life . despite the insistence of the victims ' parents and of dutroux 's lawyers that dutroux was acting as part of a larger pedophilia ring , the trial has yet to offer up any hard proof .

in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .
france and norway have programs that counsel women facing or fleeing forced marriages .
britain boasts a special desk in the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- that helps citizens who are forced into marriage overseas .
last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .
lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
storr 's office is responsible for drafting a bill that would jail those involved in arranging marriages .
" maybe it will be a signal to these families , that we are aware of -lsb- the problem -rsb- , and maybe it will stop some from doing it . "
such a law is long overdue , says seyran ates , a berlin lawyer whose lobbying on the issue together with the german women 's organization terre des femmes brought forced marriages to the attention of german politicians last year .
german courts continue to tiptoe around the problem , labeling it as a something best taken care within the community .
judges have invoked " religion " or " tradition " in explaining why they were reducing the punishment for men who abused their wives in forced marriages , she says .

want to throw back a nice bavarian brew while watching a world cup match in germany in 2006 ?
sorry , you 'll have to make due with american suds .
u.s. brewer anheuser-busch has the exclusive contract for beer there . world cup 2006 might be taking place in germany , but the beer flowing from the taps at the concession stands is going to be american , thanks to a sponsoring agreement between fifa , soccer 's governing body and anheuser-busch , the world 's largest brewery .
in the stadiums across germany where world cup matches are being played , local firms are only allowed to do business if they , according to the contract stipulations , are " not competition for the sponsor . "
therefore , locals brews are taboo ; they can only sell their pilsners and ales outside a specific area around the stadium premises .
" that ca n't be , " complained hermann winkler , president of the state of saxony sports federation , to the sächsische zeitung newspaper .
" a lot of breweries support sports in saxony , but the minute there 's a little money to be earned , they 're left standing out in the cold . "
however , anheuser-busch , maker of budweiser and michelob beers , appears to have scored a winning goal with this business deal .
the u.s. multinational has tried for years to get a foothold in germany , particularly with its budweiser brand .
but since that name is already taken in europe by the original czech budweiser brand , the americans have repeatedly hit a brick wall .
that wall looks set to crumble in two years ' time .
reinhard zwanzig , who heads saxony 's brewers ' federation , said the decision was regrettable , but he does n't think the american budweiser is going to find many of its own fans among the soccer ones .
besides , he said aficionados should be concentrating on the game in the stadium , not the sudsy stuff .
" afterwards , they 'll all go into town and toast the victors with the regional beer , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beer frenzy in munich beer galore , germans in lederhosen and the umpah-beat of traditional bavarian music - the annual oktoberfest , attracting visitors to munich from all over the world each year , kicks off this weekend .

" nothing 's going to change for the time being , " peter traumann , the head of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- , told daily berliner zeitung , adding that it would be too risky for companies to market gm products as most people reject the idea of eating such food .
" producers have prepared themselves and only use non-gm ingredients , " traumann said . in the long term , gm foods are likely to become more prevalent , however , as other products using non-gm ingredients would get too expensive , traumann predicted .
the german environmentalist organization bund expects oil made out of genetically modified soy or rape , ketchup made from gm tomatoes and cornflakes of popcorn made from gm corn to hit the shelves . according to the new eu directive , any product in stores or restaurants that has come in contact with genetically modified ingredients will have to be marked as such .
however the same does n't apply to products such as meat , milk and eggs from animals that have been fed gm crops , causing environmentalists to criticize the regulation . it 's up to the consumer now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast while agreeing that the exemption of animal products was problematic , german consumer minister renate künast -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the new requirement and said people should vote with their shopping carts whether they wanted to see more gm products on the shelves . künast added that consumers would have to be careful and read the small print on products to find out whether they contained gm ingredients .
she also expressed her anger over the opposition christian democrats , who blocked künast 's plan in germany 's parliament 's upper house to impose a € 50,000 -lrb- $ 60,200 -rrb- fine on offenders .
as a result , no penalties currently exist in germany for those who do not comply with the directive . products likely to get more expensive consumer rights advocates meanwhile warned that the new regulation would likely lead to an increase in prices by about 10 percent as companies would have to submit their products for additional tests .

" nothing 's going to change for the time being , " peter traumann , the head of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- , told daily berliner zeitung , adding that it would be too risky for companies to market gm products as most people reject the idea of eating such food .
" producers have prepared themselves and only use non-gm ingredients , " traumann said . in the long term , gm foods are likely to become more prevalent , however , as other products using non-gm ingredients would get too expensive , traumann predicted .
the german environmentalist organization bund expects oil made out of genetically modified soy or rape , ketchup made from gm tomatoes and cornflakes of popcorn made from gm corn to hit the shelves . according to the new eu directive , any product in stores or restaurants that has come in contact with genetically modified ingredients will have to be marked as such .
however the same does n't apply to products such as meat , milk and eggs from animals that have been fed gm crops , causing environmentalists to criticize the regulation . it 's up to the consumer now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast while agreeing that the exemption of animal products was problematic , german consumer minister renate künast -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the new requirement and said people should vote with their shopping carts whether they wanted to see more gm products on the shelves . künast added that consumers would have to be careful and read the small print on products to find out whether they contained gm ingredients .
she also expressed her anger over the opposition christian democrats , who blocked künast 's plan in germany 's parliament 's upper house to impose a € 50,000 -lrb- $ 60,200 -rrb- fine on offenders .
as a result , no penalties currently exist in germany for those who do not comply with the directive . products likely to get more expensive consumer rights advocates meanwhile warned that the new regulation would likely lead to an increase in prices by about 10 percent as companies would have to submit their products for additional tests . " who other than the consumer is supposed to pay for this , " asked ralf alsfeld , a spokesman for ecological agriculture association bioland , in an interview with der tagesspiegel newspaper . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's reluctant cabinet to allow gmo foods german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday approved a bill regulating the cultivation of genetically modified organisms .

nearly two months into the trial of accused child abductor and murderer marc dutroux , two of his surviving victims - now young women - are scheduled to testify this week . europeans glued to the trial of belgium 's most infamous criminal anxiously awaited the testimony of two of his victims , the first time they will speak before a jury . sabine dardenne , 20 , testified for about one hour on monday and 22-year-old laetitia delhez is expected to take the stand on tuesday . " he always said that i had a character like a pig , " dardenne said at the end of her testimony , turning directly to the defendant .
" why did n't he kill me then ? " dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has admitted raping dardenne , responded : " i never thought about killing her . "
his defense lawyer declined to ask dardenne questions .
" we have the utmost respect for you and , even though this comes much to late , the greatest compassion , " xavier magnee told the witness . judge stephane goux had previously asked dardenne questions about her abduction on may 28 , 1996 , but spared the young woman from having to recount her ordeal in captivity as letter she had written during her incarceration in dutroux 's cellar had already been read during the trial .
but dardenne indirectly confirmed that dutroux had raped her , adding that she had to clean the house when not locked in the cellar .
" i was his little maid , " she said . testimony crucial for outcome of trial the two women 's evidence is seen as vital to an ongoing debate in belgium over whether the defendant acted on his own in committing the crimes he is accused of , or was part of a pedophilia network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laetitia delhez , left , arrives with her lawyer , georges-henri beauthier , at the palace of justice in arlon , belgium , monday april 19 , 2004 .
dardenne and delhez -lrb- photo -rrb- were 12 and 14 years old respectively in the summer of 1996 when they were abducted .
dardenne was in captivity for 80 days , while delhez was held for eight days before being freed by police . dutroux , now 47 years old , is charged altogether with kidnapping and rape of six girls during the mid-1990s , and with the deaths of four of them .
two girls starved in a cellar , while two others were buried alive . dutroux denies having killed any of the children , and admits only the abduction of four of the girls . on the eve of the trial , dutroux sparked further controversy by sending a letter to belgian media saying he was only a small part of a criminal network that had links to belgian law enforcement . but to the frustration of belgians , who have reacted to the scandal with mass outpourings of outrage and horror , the trial - involving numerous witnesses often with conflicting testimony - has n't clarified the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- is being tried along with three accomplices : his now-estranged wife michelle martin , a drug-addicted drifter michel lelievre , and a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , michel nihoul .
each of the defendants claim the others are guilty . seeking justice in her one television interview , given in belgium , dardenne said she hopes her testimony will help bring about justice .
she also said she hopes to show dutroux that he did n't destroy her , and that despite her ordeal she is able to lead a normal life . despite the insistence of the victims ' parents and of dutroux 's lawyers that dutroux was acting as part of a larger pedophilia ring , the trial has yet to offer up any hard proof .
to date there is no evidence that nihoul was part of the kidnappings , although many believe he represents the link between dutroux and the alleged child pornography ring . however , there has been an increasing spate of evidence showing disastrous omissions on the part of the investigators . the search methods of police and the judicial system has been a key issue in the trial ; this has lead to further widespread conspiracy theories that there people from the highest political circles have tried to obstruct progress in prosecuting the case . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium 's shame goes global as dutroux trial opens the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media .

integration for germany ’ s growing muslim population does not stop at death ’ s door as undertakers and city officials are learning .
dw-world 's sabina casagrande visits a cemetery where all graves face mecca . rows and rows of neat graves line the paths of cologne ’ s westfriedhof .
then , all of a sudden , a field catches the eye .
here , all of the graves are slanted .
the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .
the graves are dug so that a corpse lying on its right side faces mecca .
some plots at the westfriedhof bear ornate tombstones shaped like mosques or engraved with decorative inscriptions .
others are marked by a simple wooden plaque .
“ burial culture , like every form of culture , is constantly changing , ” said kerstin gernig , director of the board of german undertakers .
“ we are not a homogenous society , but rather an intercultural , a multicultural one , where various needs must be responded to accordingly . ”
decades after the first muslim guest workers began arriving in germany from turkey and north africa , where and how they bury their dead has forced germans to re-evaluate the laws and traditions involved in the country 's burial culture .
reunited in death with the home they left behind until now , muslim burials have actually been more the exception than the rule in germany .
many first generation muslims , who came here in the 1960s , still have strong family and emotional ties to their home countries .
they live here in the knowledge that though they may not return home during their lifetime , but at least be reunited in death .
in addition , the prohibitive cost of burial in germany , the small number of muslim cemeteries and legal disagreements over the method of muslim burial have made burial abroad more attractive for most muslim families , says mustapha el-founti , who owns al-rahma in essen , one of germany ’ s largest funeral homes for muslims .
according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .
but as the muslim population in germany becomes more entrenched , the desire to be buried elsewhere has begun to recede .
" most muslims have decided to remain in germany permanently , " nadeem elyas , chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , told dw-world .
" returning the dead to their home countries doesn ’ t make sense because the family ties are here in germany . ”
a resistance to muslim cemeteries but where to bury the dead ?
the only islamic cemetery in germany is in berlin and was opened in 1866 .
but it is long since filled and attempts by muslim groups to set up new graveyards have failed , said el-founti .
" we made the city of essen a proposal that we would buy the land ourselves and manage the cemetery .
and we were told : ' absolutely not ! '
a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .
the administrative hitch is hard for elyas to understand .

then , all of a sudden , a field catches the eye .
here , all of the graves are slanted .
the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .
the graves are dug so that a corpse lying on its right side faces mecca .
some plots at the westfriedhof bear ornate tombstones shaped like mosques or engraved with decorative inscriptions .

“ burial culture , like every form of culture , is constantly changing , ” said kerstin gernig , director of the board of german undertakers .
“ we are not a homogenous society , but rather an intercultural , a multicultural one , where various needs must be responded to accordingly . ”
decades after the first muslim guest workers began arriving in germany from turkey and north africa , where and how they bury their dead has forced germans to re-evaluate the laws and traditions involved in the country 's burial culture .
reunited in death with the home they left behind until now , muslim burials have actually been more the exception than the rule in germany .
many first generation muslims , who came here in the 1960s , still have strong family and emotional ties to their home countries .
they live here in the knowledge that though they may not return home during their lifetime , but at least be reunited in death .
in addition , the prohibitive cost of burial in germany , the small number of muslim cemeteries and legal disagreements over the method of muslim burial have made burial abroad more attractive for most muslim families , says mustapha el-founti , who owns al-rahma in essen , one of germany ’ s largest funeral homes for muslims .
according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .

" returning the dead to their home countries doesn ’ t make sense because the family ties are here in germany . ”
a resistance to muslim cemeteries but where to bury the dead ?
the only islamic cemetery in germany is in berlin and was opened in 1866 .
but it is long since filled and attempts by muslim groups to set up new graveyards have failed , said el-founti .
" we made the city of essen a proposal that we would buy the land ourselves and manage the cemetery .
and we were told : ' absolutely not ! '
a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .
the administrative hitch is hard for elyas to understand .

the only islamic cemetery in germany is in berlin and was opened in 1866 .

" we made the city of essen a proposal that we would buy the land ourselves and manage the cemetery .
and we were told : ' absolutely not ! '
a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .
the administrative hitch is hard for elyas to understand .

integration for germany ’ s growing muslim population does not stop at death ’ s door as undertakers and city officials are learning .
dw-world 's sabina casagrande visits a cemetery where all graves face mecca . rows and rows of neat graves line the paths of cologne ’ s westfriedhof .
then , all of a sudden , a field catches the eye .
here , all of the graves are slanted .
the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .
the graves are dug so that a corpse lying on its right side faces mecca .
some plots at the westfriedhof bear ornate tombstones shaped like mosques or engraved with decorative inscriptions .
others are marked by a simple wooden plaque .
“ burial culture , like every form of culture , is constantly changing , ” said kerstin gernig , director of the board of german undertakers .
“ we are not a homogenous society , but rather an intercultural , a multicultural one , where various needs must be responded to accordingly . ”
decades after the first muslim guest workers began arriving in germany from turkey and north africa , where and how they bury their dead has forced germans to re-evaluate the laws and traditions involved in the country 's burial culture .
reunited in death with the home they left behind until now , muslim burials have actually been more the exception than the rule in germany .
many first generation muslims , who came here in the 1960s , still have strong family and emotional ties to their home countries .
they live here in the knowledge that though they may not return home during their lifetime , but at least be reunited in death .
in addition , the prohibitive cost of burial in germany , the small number of muslim cemeteries and legal disagreements over the method of muslim burial have made burial abroad more attractive for most muslim families , says mustapha el-founti , who owns al-rahma in essen , one of germany ’ s largest funeral homes for muslims .
according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .

integration for germany ’ s growing muslim population does not stop at death ’ s door as undertakers and city officials are learning .
dw-world 's sabina casagrande visits a cemetery where all graves face mecca . rows and rows of neat graves line the paths of cologne ’ s westfriedhof .
then , all of a sudden , a field catches the eye .
here , all of the graves are slanted .
the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .
the graves are dug so that a corpse lying on its right side faces mecca .
some plots at the westfriedhof bear ornate tombstones shaped like mosques or engraved with decorative inscriptions .
others are marked by a simple wooden plaque .
“ burial culture , like every form of culture , is constantly changing , ” said kerstin gernig , director of the board of german undertakers .
“ we are not a homogenous society , but rather an intercultural , a multicultural one , where various needs must be responded to accordingly . ”
decades after the first muslim guest workers began arriving in germany from turkey and north africa , where and how they bury their dead has forced germans to re-evaluate the laws and traditions involved in the country 's burial culture .
reunited in death with the home they left behind until now , muslim burials have actually been more the exception than the rule in germany .
many first generation muslims , who came here in the 1960s , still have strong family and emotional ties to their home countries .
they live here in the knowledge that though they may not return home during their lifetime , but at least be reunited in death .
in addition , the prohibitive cost of burial in germany , the small number of muslim cemeteries and legal disagreements over the method of muslim burial have made burial abroad more attractive for most muslim families , says mustapha el-founti , who owns al-rahma in essen , one of germany ’ s largest funeral homes for muslims .
according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .
but as the muslim population in germany becomes more entrenched , the desire to be buried elsewhere has begun to recede .
" most muslims have decided to remain in germany permanently , " nadeem elyas , chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , told dw-world .
" returning the dead to their home countries doesn ’ t make sense because the family ties are here in germany . ”
a resistance to muslim cemeteries but where to bury the dead ?
the only islamic cemetery in germany is in berlin and was opened in 1866 .
but it is long since filled and attempts by muslim groups to set up new graveyards have failed , said el-founti .
" we made the city of essen a proposal that we would buy the land ourselves and manage the cemetery .
and we were told : ' absolutely not ! '
a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .
the administrative hitch is hard for elyas to understand .

" nothing 's going to change for the time being , " peter traumann , the head of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- , told daily berliner zeitung , adding that it would be too risky for companies to market gm products as most people reject the idea of eating such food .
" producers have prepared themselves and only use non-gm ingredients , " traumann said . in the long term , gm foods are likely to become more prevalent , however , as other products using non-gm ingredients would get too expensive , traumann predicted .
the german environmentalist organization bund expects oil made out of genetically modified soy or rape , ketchup made from gm tomatoes and cornflakes of popcorn made from gm corn to hit the shelves . according to the new eu directive , any product in stores or restaurants that has come in contact with genetically modified ingredients will have to be marked as such .
however the same does n't apply to products such as meat , milk and eggs from animals that have been fed gm crops , causing environmentalists to criticize the regulation . it 's up to the consumer now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast while agreeing that the exemption of animal products was problematic , german consumer minister renate künast -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the new requirement and said people should vote with their shopping carts whether they wanted to see more gm products on the shelves . künast added that consumers would have to be careful and read the small print on products to find out whether they contained gm ingredients .
she also expressed her anger over the opposition christian democrats , who blocked künast 's plan in germany 's parliament 's upper house to impose a € 50,000 -lrb- $ 60,200 -rrb- fine on offenders .
as a result , no penalties currently exist in germany for those who do not comply with the directive . products likely to get more expensive consumer rights advocates meanwhile warned that the new regulation would likely lead to an increase in prices by about 10 percent as companies would have to submit their products for additional tests . " who other than the consumer is supposed to pay for this , " asked ralf alsfeld , a spokesman for ecological agriculture association bioland , in an interview with der tagesspiegel newspaper . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's reluctant cabinet to allow gmo foods german chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday approved a bill regulating the cultivation of genetically modified organisms .

the german environmentalist organization bund expects oil made out of genetically modified soy or rape , ketchup made from gm tomatoes and cornflakes of popcorn made from gm corn to hit the shelves . according to the new eu directive , any product in stores or restaurants that has come in contact with genetically modified ingredients will have to be marked as such .
however the same does n't apply to products such as meat , milk and eggs from animals that have been fed gm crops , causing environmentalists to criticize the regulation . it 's up to the consumer now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast while agreeing that the exemption of animal products was problematic , german consumer minister renate künast -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed the new requirement and said people should vote with their shopping carts whether they wanted to see more gm products on the shelves . künast added that consumers would have to be careful and read the small print on products to find out whether they contained gm ingredients .
she also expressed her anger over the opposition christian democrats , who blocked künast 's plan in germany 's parliament 's upper house to impose a € 50,000 -lrb- $ 60,200 -rrb- fine on offenders .
as a result , no penalties currently exist in germany for those who do not comply with the directive . products likely to get more expensive consumer rights advocates meanwhile warned that the new regulation would likely lead to an increase in prices by about 10 percent as companies would have to submit their products for additional tests .

sorry , you 'll have to make due with american suds .
u.s. brewer anheuser-busch has the exclusive contract for beer there . world cup 2006 might be taking place in germany , but the beer flowing from the taps at the concession stands is going to be american , thanks to a sponsoring agreement between fifa , soccer 's governing body and anheuser-busch , the world 's largest brewery .
in the stadiums across germany where world cup matches are being played , local firms are only allowed to do business if they , according to the contract stipulations , are " not competition for the sponsor . "
therefore , locals brews are taboo ; they can only sell their pilsners and ales outside a specific area around the stadium premises .

" a lot of breweries support sports in saxony , but the minute there 's a little money to be earned , they 're left standing out in the cold . "

u.s. brewer anheuser-busch has the exclusive contract for beer there . world cup 2006 might be taking place in germany , but the beer flowing from the taps at the concession stands is going to be american , thanks to a sponsoring agreement between fifa , soccer 's governing body and anheuser-busch , the world 's largest brewery .
in the stadiums across germany where world cup matches are being played , local firms are only allowed to do business if they , according to the contract stipulations , are " not competition for the sponsor . "
therefore , locals brews are taboo ; they can only sell their pilsners and ales outside a specific area around the stadium premises .
" that ca n't be , " complained hermann winkler , president of the state of saxony sports federation , to the sächsische zeitung newspaper .
" a lot of breweries support sports in saxony , but the minute there 's a little money to be earned , they 're left standing out in the cold . "
however , anheuser-busch , maker of budweiser and michelob beers , appears to have scored a winning goal with this business deal .
the u.s. multinational has tried for years to get a foothold in germany , particularly with its budweiser brand .
but since that name is already taken in europe by the original czech budweiser brand , the americans have repeatedly hit a brick wall .
that wall looks set to crumble in two years ' time .
reinhard zwanzig , who heads saxony 's brewers ' federation , said the decision was regrettable , but he does n't think the american budweiser is going to find many of its own fans among the soccer ones .
besides , he said aficionados should be concentrating on the game in the stadium , not the sudsy stuff .
" afterwards , they 'll all go into town and toast the victors with the regional beer , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beer frenzy in munich beer galore , germans in lederhosen and the umpah-beat of traditional bavarian music - the annual oktoberfest , attracting visitors to munich from all over the world each year , kicks off this weekend .

nearly two months into the trial of accused child abductor and murderer marc dutroux , two of his surviving victims - now young women - are scheduled to testify this week . europeans glued to the trial of belgium 's most infamous criminal anxiously awaited the testimony of two of his victims , the first time they will speak before a jury . sabine dardenne , 20 , testified for about one hour on monday and 22-year-old laetitia delhez is expected to take the stand on tuesday . " he always said that i had a character like a pig , " dardenne said at the end of her testimony , turning directly to the defendant .
" why did n't he kill me then ? " dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has admitted raping dardenne , responded : " i never thought about killing her . "
his defense lawyer declined to ask dardenne questions .
" we have the utmost respect for you and , even though this comes much to late , the greatest compassion , " xavier magnee told the witness . judge stephane goux had previously asked dardenne questions about her abduction on may 28 , 1996 , but spared the young woman from having to recount her ordeal in captivity as letter she had written during her incarceration in dutroux 's cellar had already been read during the trial .
but dardenne indirectly confirmed that dutroux had raped her , adding that she had to clean the house when not locked in the cellar .
" i was his little maid , " she said . testimony crucial for outcome of trial the two women 's evidence is seen as vital to an ongoing debate in belgium over whether the defendant acted on his own in committing the crimes he is accused of , or was part of a pedophilia network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laetitia delhez , left , arrives with her lawyer , georges-henri beauthier , at the palace of justice in arlon , belgium , monday april 19 , 2004 .
dardenne and delhez -lrb- photo -rrb- were 12 and 14 years old respectively in the summer of 1996 when they were abducted .
dardenne was in captivity for 80 days , while delhez was held for eight days before being freed by police . dutroux , now 47 years old , is charged altogether with kidnapping and rape of six girls during the mid-1990s , and with the deaths of four of them .
two girls starved in a cellar , while two others were buried alive . dutroux denies having killed any of the children , and admits only the abduction of four of the girls . on the eve of the trial , dutroux sparked further controversy by sending a letter to belgian media saying he was only a small part of a criminal network that had links to belgian law enforcement . but to the frustration of belgians , who have reacted to the scandal with mass outpourings of outrage and horror , the trial - involving numerous witnesses often with conflicting testimony - has n't clarified the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- is being tried along with three accomplices : his now-estranged wife michelle martin , a drug-addicted drifter michel lelievre , and a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , michel nihoul .
each of the defendants claim the others are guilty . seeking justice in her one television interview , given in belgium , dardenne said she hopes her testimony will help bring about justice .
she also said she hopes to show dutroux that he did n't destroy her , and that despite her ordeal she is able to lead a normal life . despite the insistence of the victims ' parents and of dutroux 's lawyers that dutroux was acting as part of a larger pedophilia ring , the trial has yet to offer up any hard proof .
to date there is no evidence that nihoul was part of the kidnappings , although many believe he represents the link between dutroux and the alleged child pornography ring . however , there has been an increasing spate of evidence showing disastrous omissions on the part of the investigators . the search methods of police and the judicial system has been a key issue in the trial ; this has lead to further widespread conspiracy theories that there people from the highest political circles have tried to obstruct progress in prosecuting the case . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium 's shame goes global as dutroux trial opens the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media .

" why did n't he kill me then ? " dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has admitted raping dardenne , responded : " i never thought about killing her . "
his defense lawyer declined to ask dardenne questions .
" we have the utmost respect for you and , even though this comes much to late , the greatest compassion , " xavier magnee told the witness . judge stephane goux had previously asked dardenne questions about her abduction on may 28 , 1996 , but spared the young woman from having to recount her ordeal in captivity as letter she had written during her incarceration in dutroux 's cellar had already been read during the trial .
but dardenne indirectly confirmed that dutroux had raped her , adding that she had to clean the house when not locked in the cellar .

dardenne and delhez -lrb- photo -rrb- were 12 and 14 years old respectively in the summer of 1996 when they were abducted .
dardenne was in captivity for 80 days , while delhez was held for eight days before being freed by police . dutroux , now 47 years old , is charged altogether with kidnapping and rape of six girls during the mid-1990s , and with the deaths of four of them .
two girls starved in a cellar , while two others were buried alive . dutroux denies having killed any of the children , and admits only the abduction of four of the girls . on the eve of the trial , dutroux sparked further controversy by sending a letter to belgian media saying he was only a small part of a criminal network that had links to belgian law enforcement . but to the frustration of belgians , who have reacted to the scandal with mass outpourings of outrage and horror , the trial - involving numerous witnesses often with conflicting testimony - has n't clarified the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- is being tried along with three accomplices : his now-estranged wife michelle martin , a drug-addicted drifter michel lelievre , and a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , michel nihoul .

she also said she hopes to show dutroux that he did n't destroy her , and that despite her ordeal she is able to lead a normal life . despite the insistence of the victims ' parents and of dutroux 's lawyers that dutroux was acting as part of a larger pedophilia ring , the trial has yet to offer up any hard proof .
to date there is no evidence that nihoul was part of the kidnappings , although many believe he represents the link between dutroux and the alleged child pornography ring . however , there has been an increasing spate of evidence showing disastrous omissions on the part of the investigators . the search methods of police and the judicial system has been a key issue in the trial ; this has lead to further widespread conspiracy theories that there people from the highest political circles have tried to obstruct progress in prosecuting the case . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium 's shame goes global as dutroux trial opens the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media .

want to throw back a nice bavarian brew while watching a world cup match in germany in 2006 ?
sorry , you 'll have to make due with american suds .
u.s. brewer anheuser-busch has the exclusive contract for beer there . world cup 2006 might be taking place in germany , but the beer flowing from the taps at the concession stands is going to be american , thanks to a sponsoring agreement between fifa , soccer 's governing body and anheuser-busch , the world 's largest brewery .
in the stadiums across germany where world cup matches are being played , local firms are only allowed to do business if they , according to the contract stipulations , are " not competition for the sponsor . "
therefore , locals brews are taboo ; they can only sell their pilsners and ales outside a specific area around the stadium premises .
" that ca n't be , " complained hermann winkler , president of the state of saxony sports federation , to the sächsische zeitung newspaper .
" a lot of breweries support sports in saxony , but the minute there 's a little money to be earned , they 're left standing out in the cold . "
however , anheuser-busch , maker of budweiser and michelob beers , appears to have scored a winning goal with this business deal .
the u.s. multinational has tried for years to get a foothold in germany , particularly with its budweiser brand .
but since that name is already taken in europe by the original czech budweiser brand , the americans have repeatedly hit a brick wall .
that wall looks set to crumble in two years ' time .
reinhard zwanzig , who heads saxony 's brewers ' federation , said the decision was regrettable , but he does n't think the american budweiser is going to find many of its own fans among the soccer ones .
besides , he said aficionados should be concentrating on the game in the stadium , not the sudsy stuff .
" afterwards , they 'll all go into town and toast the victors with the regional beer , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beer frenzy in munich beer galore , germans in lederhosen and the umpah-beat of traditional bavarian music - the annual oktoberfest , attracting visitors to munich from all over the world each year , kicks off this weekend .

" nothing 's going to change for the time being , " peter traumann , the head of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- , told daily berliner zeitung , adding that it would be too risky for companies to market gm products as most people reject the idea of eating such food .
" producers have prepared themselves and only use non-gm ingredients , " traumann said . in the long term , gm foods are likely to become more prevalent , however , as other products using non-gm ingredients would get too expensive , traumann predicted .
the german environmentalist organization bund expects oil made out of genetically modified soy or rape , ketchup made from gm tomatoes and cornflakes of popcorn made from gm corn to hit the shelves . according to the new eu directive , any product in stores or restaurants that has come in contact with genetically modified ingredients will have to be marked as such .

she also expressed her anger over the opposition christian democrats , who blocked künast 's plan in germany 's parliament 's upper house to impose a € 50,000 -lrb- $ 60,200 -rrb- fine on offenders .
as a result , no penalties currently exist in germany for those who do not comply with the directive . products likely to get more expensive consumer rights advocates meanwhile warned that the new regulation would likely lead to an increase in prices by about 10 percent as companies would have to submit their products for additional tests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : islam in germany when faith is more important than school europe 's integration challenge multicultural symbol or gateway to fundamentalism ? current affairs -pipe- 19.04.2004 the integration of death 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the muslim burial ground in cologne .
integration for germany ’ s growing muslim population does not stop at death ’ s door as undertakers and city officials are learning .
dw-world 's sabina casagrande visits a cemetery where all graves face mecca . rows and rows of neat graves line the paths of cologne ’ s westfriedhof .
then , all of a sudden , a field catches the eye .
here , all of the graves are slanted .
the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .
the graves are dug so that a corpse lying on its right side faces mecca .
some plots at the westfriedhof bear ornate tombstones shaped like mosques or engraved with decorative inscriptions .
others are marked by a simple wooden plaque .
“ burial culture , like every form of culture , is constantly changing , ” said kerstin gernig , director of the board of german undertakers .
“ we are not a homogenous society , but rather an intercultural , a multicultural one , where various needs must be responded to accordingly . ”
decades after the first muslim guest workers began arriving in germany from turkey and north africa , where and how they bury their dead has forced germans to re-evaluate the laws and traditions involved in the country 's burial culture .
reunited in death with the home they left behind until now , muslim burials have actually been more the exception than the rule in germany .
many first generation muslims , who came here in the 1960s , still have strong family and emotional ties to their home countries .
they live here in the knowledge that though they may not return home during their lifetime , but at least be reunited in death .
in addition , the prohibitive cost of burial in germany , the small number of muslim cemeteries and legal disagreements over the method of muslim burial have made burial abroad more attractive for most muslim families , says mustapha el-founti , who owns al-rahma in essen , one of germany ’ s largest funeral homes for muslims .
according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .
but as the muslim population in germany becomes more entrenched , the desire to be buried elsewhere has begun to recede .

" returning the dead to their home countries doesn ’ t make sense because the family ties are here in germany . ”
a resistance to muslim cemeteries but where to bury the dead ?
the only islamic cemetery in germany is in berlin and was opened in 1866 .
but it is long since filled and attempts by muslim groups to set up new graveyards have failed , said el-founti .
" we made the city of essen a proposal that we would buy the land ourselves and manage the cemetery .
and we were told : ' absolutely not ! '
a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .
the administrative hitch is hard for elyas to understand .

it would relieve the municipalities , " said elyas -lrb- photo -rrb- .
though municipalities have reached a compromise by setting up muslim burial grounds like the one in cologne , the islamic burial procedure remains a further obstacle for muslims .
burial without a coffin in the islamic faith , the deceased are buried without a coffin , wrapped only in linen cloths .
but across germany a coffin is required and only a few town councils were willing to make exceptions to the rule .
in north rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state , this law was recently changed .
individual communities can now decide for themselves whether to allow the coffin-free burial - much to the dismay of germany ’ s funeral industry .
" you have to consider that a funeral is a very dignified and solemn act , and the burial process is part of it , " says gernig , the head of the undertakers board . she points out how strange it would look if a family carried a body wrapped only in cloth to the gravesite .
" of course , you also have to consider the hygienic aspects .
the corpse can still discharge body fluids .
so the coffin also fulfils a specific function , ” she said .
a solution for everyone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim burial ground in cologne city authorities in cologne , where the burial ground is located -lrb- photo -rrb- , have a similar position .
helmut strack , who heads the city ’ s cemetery department , says he can not expect his personnel to carry a corpse , which has maybe been dead for a few days , wrapped in only linen cloths .
but he wants to find a solution that will make everyone happy .
one possibility would be having the deceased in a coffin until it reaches the gravesite and then bedding it without the coffin .
some other cities , such as essen and aachen , already make such concessions .
" we have to find an arrangement that is just for everyone and the procedure has to take place so that no one is offended , " strack said .
" we ’ re talking about different cultures here . "
re-evaluating burial culture in an effort to improve cultural sensitivity , undertakers are already being taught the entire spectrum of religions , rituals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young german burial trainee and customs during their vocational training in order to keep up with the changing needs of their future clients , said gernig .
“ we have fellow citizens from many different cultures and religions and we have to satisfy them , too , ” she said .
the growing sensitivity , as well as legislative changes like the one made in north-rhine westphalia are encouraging signs for elyas . " the government and the parties that have introduced these laws have tied them to their goal of integration , " he says .
" and this is a sign that politicians have recognized the signs of the times .
it will certainly give muslims a feeling of security and belonging .

integration for germany ’ s growing muslim population does not stop at death ’ s door as undertakers and city officials are learning .
dw-world 's sabina casagrande visits a cemetery where all graves face mecca . rows and rows of neat graves line the paths of cologne ’ s westfriedhof .
then , all of a sudden , a field catches the eye .
here , all of the graves are slanted .
the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .
the graves are dug so that a corpse lying on its right side faces mecca .
some plots at the westfriedhof bear ornate tombstones shaped like mosques or engraved with decorative inscriptions .
others are marked by a simple wooden plaque .
“ burial culture , like every form of culture , is constantly changing , ” said kerstin gernig , director of the board of german undertakers .
“ we are not a homogenous society , but rather an intercultural , a multicultural one , where various needs must be responded to accordingly . ”
decades after the first muslim guest workers began arriving in germany from turkey and north africa , where and how they bury their dead has forced germans to re-evaluate the laws and traditions involved in the country 's burial culture .
reunited in death with the home they left behind until now , muslim burials have actually been more the exception than the rule in germany .
many first generation muslims , who came here in the 1960s , still have strong family and emotional ties to their home countries .
they live here in the knowledge that though they may not return home during their lifetime , but at least be reunited in death .
in addition , the prohibitive cost of burial in germany , the small number of muslim cemeteries and legal disagreements over the method of muslim burial have made burial abroad more attractive for most muslim families , says mustapha el-founti , who owns al-rahma in essen , one of germany ’ s largest funeral homes for muslims .
according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .
but as the muslim population in germany becomes more entrenched , the desire to be buried elsewhere has begun to recede .
" most muslims have decided to remain in germany permanently , " nadeem elyas , chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , told dw-world .
" returning the dead to their home countries doesn ’ t make sense because the family ties are here in germany . ”
a resistance to muslim cemeteries but where to bury the dead ?
the only islamic cemetery in germany is in berlin and was opened in 1866 .
but it is long since filled and attempts by muslim groups to set up new graveyards have failed , said el-founti .
" we made the city of essen a proposal that we would buy the land ourselves and manage the cemetery .
and we were told : ' absolutely not ! '
a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .
the administrative hitch is hard for elyas to understand .

the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .

“ burial culture , like every form of culture , is constantly changing , ” said kerstin gernig , director of the board of german undertakers .
“ we are not a homogenous society , but rather an intercultural , a multicultural one , where various needs must be responded to accordingly . ”
decades after the first muslim guest workers began arriving in germany from turkey and north africa , where and how they bury their dead has forced germans to re-evaluate the laws and traditions involved in the country 's burial culture .
reunited in death with the home they left behind until now , muslim burials have actually been more the exception than the rule in germany .
many first generation muslims , who came here in the 1960s , still have strong family and emotional ties to their home countries .
they live here in the knowledge that though they may not return home during their lifetime , but at least be reunited in death .
in addition , the prohibitive cost of burial in germany , the small number of muslim cemeteries and legal disagreements over the method of muslim burial have made burial abroad more attractive for most muslim families , says mustapha el-founti , who owns al-rahma in essen , one of germany ’ s largest funeral homes for muslims .
according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .

" returning the dead to their home countries doesn ’ t make sense because the family ties are here in germany . ”
a resistance to muslim cemeteries but where to bury the dead ?
the only islamic cemetery in germany is in berlin and was opened in 1866 .
but it is long since filled and attempts by muslim groups to set up new graveyards have failed , said el-founti .
" we made the city of essen a proposal that we would buy the land ourselves and manage the cemetery .
and we were told : ' absolutely not ! '
a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .
the administrative hitch is hard for elyas to understand .

a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .
the administrative hitch is hard for elyas to understand .

in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .

last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .
lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
storr 's office is responsible for drafting a bill that would jail those involved in arranging marriages .
" maybe it will be a signal to these families , that we are aware of -lsb- the problem -rsb- , and maybe it will stop some from doing it . "
such a law is long overdue , says seyran ates , a berlin lawyer whose lobbying on the issue together with the german women 's organization terre des femmes brought forced marriages to the attention of german politicians last year .
german courts continue to tiptoe around the problem , labeling it as a something best taken care within the community .
judges have invoked " religion " or " tradition " in explaining why they were reducing the punishment for men who abused their wives in forced marriages , she says .

in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .
france and norway have programs that counsel women facing or fleeing forced marriages .
britain boasts a special desk in the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- that helps citizens who are forced into marriage overseas .
last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .
lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
storr 's office is responsible for drafting a bill that would jail those involved in arranging marriages .
" maybe it will be a signal to these families , that we are aware of -lsb- the problem -rsb- , and maybe it will stop some from doing it . "
such a law is long overdue , says seyran ates , a berlin lawyer whose lobbying on the issue together with the german women 's organization terre des femmes brought forced marriages to the attention of german politicians last year .
german courts continue to tiptoe around the problem , labeling it as a something best taken care within the community .
judges have invoked " religion " or " tradition " in explaining why they were reducing the punishment for men who abused their wives in forced marriages , she says .
" they do n't see it as a human rights violation , " says ates , who fled her traditional turkish home at the age of 18 .

wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .
france and norway have programs that counsel women facing or fleeing forced marriages .
britain boasts a special desk in the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- that helps citizens who are forced into marriage overseas .
last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .
lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
storr 's office is responsible for drafting a bill that would jail those involved in arranging marriages .
" maybe it will be a signal to these families , that we are aware of -lsb- the problem -rsb- , and maybe it will stop some from doing it . "
such a law is long overdue , says seyran ates , a berlin lawyer whose lobbying on the issue together with the german women 's organization terre des femmes brought forced marriages to the attention of german politicians last year .
german courts continue to tiptoe around the problem , labeling it as a something best taken care within the community .
judges have invoked " religion " or " tradition " in explaining why they were reducing the punishment for men who abused their wives in forced marriages , she says .
" they do n't see it as a human rights violation , " says ates , who fled her traditional turkish home at the age of 18 .
neither did öztürk .
the eldest sister in a family of three sons and two daughters , she was used to obeying her father and older brothers .
she learned early on to serve them first at meals and clean up afterward .

integration for germany ’ s growing muslim population does not stop at death ’ s door as undertakers and city officials are learning .
dw-world 's sabina casagrande visits a cemetery where all graves face mecca . rows and rows of neat graves line the paths of cologne ’ s westfriedhof .
then , all of a sudden , a field catches the eye .
here , all of the graves are slanted .
the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .
the graves are dug so that a corpse lying on its right side faces mecca .
some plots at the westfriedhof bear ornate tombstones shaped like mosques or engraved with decorative inscriptions .
others are marked by a simple wooden plaque .
“ burial culture , like every form of culture , is constantly changing , ” said kerstin gernig , director of the board of german undertakers .
“ we are not a homogenous society , but rather an intercultural , a multicultural one , where various needs must be responded to accordingly . ”
decades after the first muslim guest workers began arriving in germany from turkey and north africa , where and how they bury their dead has forced germans to re-evaluate the laws and traditions involved in the country 's burial culture .
reunited in death with the home they left behind until now , muslim burials have actually been more the exception than the rule in germany .
many first generation muslims , who came here in the 1960s , still have strong family and emotional ties to their home countries .
they live here in the knowledge that though they may not return home during their lifetime , but at least be reunited in death .
in addition , the prohibitive cost of burial in germany , the small number of muslim cemeteries and legal disagreements over the method of muslim burial have made burial abroad more attractive for most muslim families , says mustapha el-founti , who owns al-rahma in essen , one of germany ’ s largest funeral homes for muslims .
according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .
but as the muslim population in germany becomes more entrenched , the desire to be buried elsewhere has begun to recede .
" most muslims have decided to remain in germany permanently , " nadeem elyas , chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , told dw-world .
" returning the dead to their home countries doesn ’ t make sense because the family ties are here in germany . ”
a resistance to muslim cemeteries but where to bury the dead ?
the only islamic cemetery in germany is in berlin and was opened in 1866 .
but it is long since filled and attempts by muslim groups to set up new graveyards have failed , said el-founti .
" we made the city of essen a proposal that we would buy the land ourselves and manage the cemetery .
and we were told : ' absolutely not ! '
a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .
the administrative hitch is hard for elyas to understand .

here , all of the graves are slanted .
the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .
the graves are dug so that a corpse lying on its right side faces mecca .
some plots at the westfriedhof bear ornate tombstones shaped like mosques or engraved with decorative inscriptions .

“ burial culture , like every form of culture , is constantly changing , ” said kerstin gernig , director of the board of german undertakers .
“ we are not a homogenous society , but rather an intercultural , a multicultural one , where various needs must be responded to accordingly . ”
decades after the first muslim guest workers began arriving in germany from turkey and north africa , where and how they bury their dead has forced germans to re-evaluate the laws and traditions involved in the country 's burial culture .
reunited in death with the home they left behind until now , muslim burials have actually been more the exception than the rule in germany .
many first generation muslims , who came here in the 1960s , still have strong family and emotional ties to their home countries .
they live here in the knowledge that though they may not return home during their lifetime , but at least be reunited in death .
in addition , the prohibitive cost of burial in germany , the small number of muslim cemeteries and legal disagreements over the method of muslim burial have made burial abroad more attractive for most muslim families , says mustapha el-founti , who owns al-rahma in essen , one of germany ’ s largest funeral homes for muslims .
according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .
but as the muslim population in germany becomes more entrenched , the desire to be buried elsewhere has begun to recede .
" most muslims have decided to remain in germany permanently , " nadeem elyas , chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , told dw-world .
" returning the dead to their home countries doesn ’ t make sense because the family ties are here in germany . ”
a resistance to muslim cemeteries but where to bury the dead ?
the only islamic cemetery in germany is in berlin and was opened in 1866 .
but it is long since filled and attempts by muslim groups to set up new graveyards have failed , said el-founti .
" we made the city of essen a proposal that we would buy the land ourselves and manage the cemetery .
and we were told : ' absolutely not ! '
a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .
the administrative hitch is hard for elyas to understand .

the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .

integration for germany ’ s growing muslim population does not stop at death ’ s door as undertakers and city officials are learning .
dw-world 's sabina casagrande visits a cemetery where all graves face mecca . rows and rows of neat graves line the paths of cologne ’ s westfriedhof .
then , all of a sudden , a field catches the eye .
here , all of the graves are slanted .
the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .
the graves are dug so that a corpse lying on its right side faces mecca .
some plots at the westfriedhof bear ornate tombstones shaped like mosques or engraved with decorative inscriptions .
others are marked by a simple wooden plaque .
“ burial culture , like every form of culture , is constantly changing , ” said kerstin gernig , director of the board of german undertakers .
“ we are not a homogenous society , but rather an intercultural , a multicultural one , where various needs must be responded to accordingly . ”
decades after the first muslim guest workers began arriving in germany from turkey and north africa , where and how they bury their dead has forced germans to re-evaluate the laws and traditions involved in the country 's burial culture .
reunited in death with the home they left behind until now , muslim burials have actually been more the exception than the rule in germany .
many first generation muslims , who came here in the 1960s , still have strong family and emotional ties to their home countries .
they live here in the knowledge that though they may not return home during their lifetime , but at least be reunited in death .
in addition , the prohibitive cost of burial in germany , the small number of muslim cemeteries and legal disagreements over the method of muslim burial have made burial abroad more attractive for most muslim families , says mustapha el-founti , who owns al-rahma in essen , one of germany ’ s largest funeral homes for muslims .
according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .
but as the muslim population in germany becomes more entrenched , the desire to be buried elsewhere has begun to recede .
" most muslims have decided to remain in germany permanently , " nadeem elyas , chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , told dw-world .
" returning the dead to their home countries doesn ’ t make sense because the family ties are here in germany . ”
a resistance to muslim cemeteries but where to bury the dead ?
the only islamic cemetery in germany is in berlin and was opened in 1866 .
but it is long since filled and attempts by muslim groups to set up new graveyards have failed , said el-founti .
" we made the city of essen a proposal that we would buy the land ourselves and manage the cemetery .
and we were told : ' absolutely not ! '
a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .
the administrative hitch is hard for elyas to understand .

in europe 's closed-off immigrant communities , hundreds of women are forced to marry against their will .
help is hard to come by and politicians , until recently , have preferred to look the other way . the unhappiest person at sibel öztürk 's wedding was the bride herself .
wearing the white wedding dress she bought in turkey a few weeks before , öztürk -lrb- her name has been changed -rrb- sat at the banquet table next to her new husband , a complete stranger , and fought back tears .
most of the 400 guests in the festive hall in cologne knew that her father was making her marry a man she neither loved nor knew .
" it was like a theater performance , " she says , recounting the story almost a decade later to dw-world .
" my friends all had goose bumps .
they said , ' we do n't recognize you at all . " '
shame and honor kept the shy 23-year-old from running out of the hall , away from the marriage her father had forced on her and the community that had accepted with silence .
hers is a story replayed countless times in immigrant communities in germany and other european countries .
parents view arranged marriages as a way to preserve ties to the homeland and shun what they view as corrupt western european practices .
more often than not , the young women accept these arrangements , knowing that their parents have found them a suitable companion .
but when daughters are forced into marriages , women like öztürk can be relegated to lives of violence , isolation , and abuse , say women 's-rights activists .
no reliable figures , not much help , for victims there are few reliable numbers on how many women in europe 's arab , south asian , turkish , or eastern european bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women from south asia , eastern europe as well as north africa face the same ordeals. communities are suffering in forced marriages .
france and norway have programs that counsel women facing or fleeing forced marriages .
britain boasts a special desk in the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- that helps citizens who are forced into marriage overseas .
last year , the desk 's second year in existence , the fco reported some 200 cases of forced marriage .
british police have adopted procedural guidelines for handling the problem .
in germany , a few extreme cases , like that of a kurdish woman murdered by her brother in 2000 because she had a german boyfriend , spend brief periods of time on the front pages .
but activists say law enforcement and politicians continue to look at forced marriage as a cultural issue , rather than a human rights question .
that might change , however , as germany begins looking more critically at its integration problems decades after the first immigrants arrived .
german state and federal politicians are promising to take action .
lobby work forcing change in thinking " we maybe missed out on this subject , or overlooked it , " said christian storr , who heads the office of the immigration commissioner and justice minister in baden-württemberg .
storr 's office is responsible for drafting a bill that would jail those involved in arranging marriages .
" maybe it will be a signal to these families , that we are aware of -lsb- the problem -rsb- , and maybe it will stop some from doing it . "
such a law is long overdue , says seyran ates , a berlin lawyer whose lobbying on the issue together with the german women 's organization terre des femmes brought forced marriages to the attention of german politicians last year .
german courts continue to tiptoe around the problem , labeling it as a something best taken care within the community .
judges have invoked " religion " or " tradition " in explaining why they were reducing the punishment for men who abused their wives in forced marriages , she says .
" they do n't see it as a human rights violation , " says ates , who fled her traditional turkish home at the age of 18 .
neither did öztürk .
the eldest sister in a family of three sons and two daughters , she was used to obeying her father and older brothers .
she learned early on to serve them first at meals and clean up afterward .

integration for germany ’ s growing muslim population does not stop at death ’ s door as undertakers and city officials are learning .
dw-world 's sabina casagrande visits a cemetery where all graves face mecca . rows and rows of neat graves line the paths of cologne ’ s westfriedhof .
then , all of a sudden , a field catches the eye .
here , all of the graves are slanted .
the westfriedhof is one of 70 public cemeteries in germany that have set up muslim burial grounds .
the graves are dug so that a corpse lying on its right side faces mecca .
some plots at the westfriedhof bear ornate tombstones shaped like mosques or engraved with decorative inscriptions .
others are marked by a simple wooden plaque .
“ burial culture , like every form of culture , is constantly changing , ” said kerstin gernig , director of the board of german undertakers .
“ we are not a homogenous society , but rather an intercultural , a multicultural one , where various needs must be responded to accordingly . ”
decades after the first muslim guest workers began arriving in germany from turkey and north africa , where and how they bury their dead has forced germans to re-evaluate the laws and traditions involved in the country 's burial culture .
reunited in death with the home they left behind until now , muslim burials have actually been more the exception than the rule in germany .
many first generation muslims , who came here in the 1960s , still have strong family and emotional ties to their home countries .
they live here in the knowledge that though they may not return home during their lifetime , but at least be reunited in death .
in addition , the prohibitive cost of burial in germany , the small number of muslim cemeteries and legal disagreements over the method of muslim burial have made burial abroad more attractive for most muslim families , says mustapha el-founti , who owns al-rahma in essen , one of germany ’ s largest funeral homes for muslims .
according to el-founti , transporting a corpse to turkey or morocco costs about € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,400 -rrb- , a third of the cost of a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german and turkish flag burial in germany .
but as the muslim population in germany becomes more entrenched , the desire to be buried elsewhere has begun to recede .
" most muslims have decided to remain in germany permanently , " nadeem elyas , chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , told dw-world .
" returning the dead to their home countries doesn ’ t make sense because the family ties are here in germany . ”
a resistance to muslim cemeteries but where to bury the dead ?
the only islamic cemetery in germany is in berlin and was opened in 1866 .
but it is long since filled and attempts by muslim groups to set up new graveyards have failed , said el-founti .
" we made the city of essen a proposal that we would buy the land ourselves and manage the cemetery .
and we were told : ' absolutely not ! '
a cemetery is a municipal matter and can not be passed on to private investors , ” said el-founti .
in germany , only a recognized public body or a lasting religious community as defined in the constitution can manage confessional cemeteries .
muslim groups , however , are only seen as non-permanent societies meaning they don ’ t have the legal right to operate a cemetery .
the administrative hitch is hard for elyas to understand .

roth , 48 , is the german green party 's expert on human rights and a sought-after partner on questions of integration and immigration .
the former manager of a rock band , roth entered politics in 1985 and has profiled herself both nationally and in europe as a tireless advocate for minority groups , homosexuals and refugees .
she was appointed the government 's commissioner of human rights and humanitarian aid in march 2003 .
bosbach , the domestic affairs expert in the german parliament for the conservative christian democratic union , has been a reliable and steadfast critic of the schröder government 's integration and immigration policy .
in recent negotiations over a proposed immigration law , the 51-year-old politician lead the charge against what he felt was a government law that encouraged immigrants to come to germany .
" we need to do more to integrate the immigrants here , " he says .

here , in the fourth of five articles , he visits the italian town of brescia , where billy shares a room with seven senegalese men .
brescia , a nondescript town in italy 's industrial heartland , is probably better known in senegal and other parts of west africa than in much of europe .
the reason lies about 13km from the town centre .
in the foothills of the italian alps , hidden among row after neat row of wooden-shuttered chalets is the residence prealpino , where overcrowded , chaotic dakar has been recreated in suburban europe .
several hundred immigrants , mostly senegalese men , have completely taken over this hostel , with up to 16 sharing a single room .
as you approach , you can smell the exotic fragrances of senegalese rice and fish being cooked .
when they are not working , many immigrants prefer to hang around outside rather than remain cooped up in their rooms , which reek of multiple layers of body odour .
at the weekend , senegalese clothes and food are displayed for sale outside the front entrance , giving it the appearance of a west african market .
when billy finally reached brescia in 2000 after a gruelling six-month journey , he was unable to contact the cousin he was looking for .
but he bumped into some senegalese taxi-drivers at the train station , who took him to the residence prealpino - the perfect landing pad for newly arrived immigrants to become acclimatised to living in europe .
lack of integration some of the residence 's rooms have been converted into restaurants selling senegalese food or shops full of african clothes , music , videos and beauty products .
there is also a mosque , with the muezzin opening the door to call the faithful to prayers .
the immigrants have even got a satellite dish which picks up senegalese television and use special radio sets to listen to broadcasts from home .
when i was there , life came to a standstill as everyone watched a bout between two of senegal 's most famous wrestlers , broadcast live from dakar .
moustapha gueye , who has lived in brescia for three years , blames the italians for the lack of integration .
" it 's hard for us to rent flats .
even if we have the money , the italians do n't want us to , " he said .
after four years in brescia , billy has just two italian friends - they run a restaurant near the factory where he works .
indeed , when i got into a car with a senegalese driver , we were immediately stopped and asked for our papers - it seems racial mixing is still uncommon enough to warrant police intervention .
unhealthy most of the migrants i spoke to had come to italy with a single goal - to earn enough money to set themselves up in business back home and then return .
" i have n't come here as a tourist , i 've come to earn some money .
as soon as i 've done that , i 'm going back home to live with my family , " said mody kante , who shares a room with billy .
sharing rooms means rent is cheaper , so more of the meagre salaries the immigrants earn working in factories can be sent to the families back home , or saved up for their own eventual return .
rent is about 50 euros a month each - more if there are fewer people in the room - and it is obvious that hardly any of this goes on the hostel 's upkeep .
inside , paint is peeling off the walls , plaster is falling off the ceilings and water leaks into the basement .
in billy and mody 's room , there is a double bed which is shared by three people .
for chairs , they use six mattresses stacked in two piles .
at night , these are pulled out to cover the floor , so all eight room-mates can sleep - or at least lie down .
" it 's not good for our health , we do n't sleep well because there 's always too much noise , " mody said .
billy uses the ear-plugs he was given when working in a noisy factory , to block out the snores of his room-mates .
unfulfilled dreams the men take it in turns to clean the room and cook for each other , all eating around a huge bowl in typical senegalese fashion .
they hardly ever go out , trying to save as much money as possible .
when i asked billy to recommend a good italian restaurant in brescia , he was completely stuck .
but the european dream of working for 10 years or so and then going back home with enough money to go into business has not come true for everyone .
i met one man who has been in brescia for 30 years - he was among the first senegalese to come to brescia and remembers when there were some non-africans in the residence .
he does not have a job at the moment and has been unable to save much money .
he would like to return to dakar but after spending so long supposedly getting rich in europe , he could not bear the shame of going home empty-handed .
looking for peace issa traore left his home in burkina faso 10 years ago to seek his fortune in saudi arabia . "
it 's not easy to find what you need and whatever you have , you want more " issa traore that did not work out and he now sells coffee and breakfast outside the residence prealpino .
" i conclude that everywhere in the world it 's the same .
it 's hard everywhere , " he says .
" in burkina faso , in saudi arabia , in italy , i believe it 's the same in the united states .
it 's not easy to find what you need and whatever you have , you want more . "
but he says he had to go abroad to find that out and now he is ready to go back home .
after four years in the residence , billy wants to move out , even if it would be more expensive .
" some people do n't understand the importance of hygiene and cleanliness , " he says .
" and the police often raid the residence , looking for those without the right papers .
so life would be more peaceful elsewhere . "
billy says that the brescia police want to close down the residence , knowing that it attracts illegal immigrants to the town .
he hopes to move out and rent a flat with his brother and mody and eventually bring his wife idiatou over from dakar .
in the meantime , if he ever feels homesick , he can always go back to the residence to eat some rice and fish , watch senegalese tv or buy the latest releases from dakar 's vibrant music scene .

germany , europe 's largest economy , will break the rules for the fourth year running with a deficit of 3.2 % of gdp .
worse still will be france with 3.5 % .
italy and portugal will also breach the 3 % maximum rule .
germany is set to grow 1.2 % next year down from 1.4 % in earlier predictions .
the oecd figures , reported in monday 's financial times deutschland , also included lower growth forecasts for the euro zone as a whole but did not give a figure .
italy 's deficit is predicted to be 4.3 % of gdp and portugal 's 3.2 % .
debt target under the rules of the european union 's stability pact , euro zone countries are not supposed to run budget deficits above 3 % of gdp .
the european commission wants germany to cut its deficit by 0.8 % this year and bring it down to 3 % by 2005 .
these figures would suggest this will not be attainable .
germany says that with the economy growing at its current rate it needs more time to comply .
in reports over the weekend , german chancellor gerhard schroeder said the government target of 1.5 % to 2 % growth is within reach .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes has in the past said the public finances of these countries are not in a good shape .
earlier this month he said france and italy risked breaking the deficit rules next year while germany seemed to be heading for compliance .
both german and french governments insist that boosting economic growth should take precedence over cutting their respective deficits .
the eu 's growth and stability pact was put together in a bid to protect the credibility of the euro currency , used by 12 of the 15 members .
both germany and france , the two largest euro zone economies , have exceeded limits and have been granted temporary suspensions of fines .

a 12-month pilot scheme in five police forces ended this weekend but a final decision has not been made on whether the guns will be used nationwide .
the metropolitan police federation has strongly backed the use of " tasers " .
but amnesty international argues the guns , which are being used by forces including lincolnshire police , have not been properly tested .
' less lethal ' the lobby group says several people in the us and canada have died after being shot with the stun guns .
it has called for full medical trials to be carried out before the government allows the stun guns to be issued across the country .
taser guns fire needle-tipped barbs up to eight metres to deliver a disabling , 50,000-volt shock .
they are considered a " less lethal " alternative to conventional firearms .
apart from the met , the other police forces taking part in the trials are northamptonshire , thames valley , lincolnshire and north wales .
a report from the association of chief police officers -lrb- acpo -rrb- in december 2003 revealed some officers had expressed concerns about the stun gun 's reliability .
' significant deterrent ' in three cases more than one discharge was required to subdue a suspect and on two of these occasions " taser firings did not appear to go right the first time " , it added .
but the stun gun was thought to have significant " deterrent effects " and " a number of operational benefits for police " .
in june 2003 north wales police used a taser gun against a dangerous dog which was running amok in wrexham .
the gun failed to floor the dog - one of the barbs became detached , breaking the circuit - and the animal ran off .

the sage gateshead , which dominates the revitalised river tyne quayside , was having the final panel placed on its unique roof on monday .
the sage , which will be one of the country 's most individual music venues , has cost £ 70m to build .
it is due to open to the public for the first time towards the end of 2004 .
the spectacular curved steel roof - which weighs 750 tonnes - is made from 3,000 stainless steel panels and 250 glass panels .
it will enclose the halls of acoustic excellence , music education centre , music resource centre , rehearsal spaces , entertainment suite , bars and restaurants beneath .
glass panels if laid flat , its 12,000 square metre area would be big enough to accommodate two football pitches .
the gateshead council project has been designed by architects foster and partners , built by laing o 'rourke and supported by the arts council of england with lottery funding .
the roof was designed , manufactured and put together on site like an enormous jigsaw puzzle , by austrian company waagner biro and was based on a concept design by buro happold .
each stainless steel panel has a linen finish to reduce glare and measures about four metres in length and one metre wide .
the largest glass panel weighs 300kg .
each panel is solid filled to prevent drumming noise during heavy rain to maintain the acoustic excellence within the building .
the leader of gateshead borough council , mick henry , said : " gateshead council has secured over £ 140m to fund ground-breaking projects across the borough over the past few years .
music making " the angel of the north , baltic , gateshead millennium bridge and the sage gateshead have together leveraged the culture led transformation of the area .
" they have put a great emphasis on the value of culture in society , the role of local authorities in cultural development and the educational opportunities that such transformation creates .
" this is a major step in the development of the sage gateshead building - the impressive roof is already a source for much anticipation from people living , working and visiting the area and we look forward to seeing it develop over the coming months . "
the sage will house a 1,700-seat hall , a 400-seat flexible hall , all linked by foyers designed for informal music making .
it will be a permanent home for northern sinfonia and will cater for all forms of professional and amateur music-making , including jazz , brass bands , rock and pop .
more than 500,000 people a year are expected to use the centre .

the company says that , unlike screenreaders for windows , its software will be embedded in the operating system .
this , according to apple , will mean that anyone who needs to use the speech facility will be able to move from one computer to another without having to install assistive technology on each machine .
the software , called spoken interface , will have a variety of voices so that users can select one for menus and other command functions , and another to read content such as documents or web pages .
the announcement has been welcomed by the royal national institute for the blind .
" at the moment we have little information on this development , " rnib 's technology access manager , steve tyler , told bbc news online .
" if the rumours are true , rnib welcomes this initiative - accessibility built into mainstream systems is critical if we 're to move forward . "
software guidelines apple has confirmed to bbc news online that the screenreader will definitely be included in the new versions of os x but was unable to say when this will be available .
last year those needing a screenreader in order to use a mac were dealt a blow when alva - makers of the outpoken speech interface - announced they were discontinuing the product from the beginning of 2004 .
given the preference for macs in some areas of business - for example sound recording - blind and partially sighted people should no longer find that the technology is a barrier to job opportunities .
apple says it will make programming guidelines available to other software developers so that they will be able to make their own applications compatible with it .
spoken interface is part of a bundle of accessibility features which include a screen magnifier , contrast enhancements and the ability to replicate mouse actions using the keyboard .

given the preference for macs in some areas of business - for example sound recording - blind and partially sighted people should no longer find that the technology is a barrier to job opportunities .
apple says it will make programming guidelines available to other software developers so that they will be able to make their own applications compatible with it .

the mac 's new operating system will be more accessible the company says that , unlike screenreaders for windows , its software will be embedded in the operating system .
this , according to apple , will mean that anyone who needs to use the speech facility will be able to move from one computer to another without having to install assistive technology on each machine .
the software , called spoken interface , will have a variety of voices so that users can select one for menus and other command functions , and another to read content such as documents or web pages .
the announcement has been welcomed by the royal national institute for the blind .
" at the moment we have little information on this development , " rnib 's technology access manager , steve tyler , told bbc news online .
" if the rumours are true , rnib welcomes this initiative - accessibility built into mainstream systems is critical if we 're to move forward . "

the prospect of making cheap telephone calls over the net is being threatened by regulation , says an industry figure .
ahal besorai , chief executive of broadband telephony firm inclarity believes that the super-regulator ofcom is adopting the wrong approach to internet telephony .
the issue centres on how numbers are allocated for making telephone calls .
ofcom wants to create new numbers but this could be more costly and less convenient for users argues mr besorai .
" the noises ofcom has made so far are concerning .
if the right approach is not taken to this service it could kill it very quickly , " he told bbc news online .
transferring numbers the system used by inclarity allows users to connect their existing phones to the broadband network rather than using bt 's phone network .
much of the regulatory arrangements for broadband telephony are yet to be worked through and there is a variety of options ofcom spokesperson other broadband telephony services rely on pc to pc communication , using headsets and microphones .
if the prefix 056 , favoured by ofcom , is adopted for all broadband telephony services , consumers could be put off broadband telephony argues mr besorai .
geographical numbering would allow people to transfer their existing telephone number as well as having the advantage of being something callers are familiar with .
ofcom is due to conclude its consultation on the issues at the beginning of next month and is keen to stress that no final decisions will be made until then .
" much of the regulatory arrangements for broadband telephony are yet to be worked through and there is a variety of options , " said an ofcom spokesperson .
one advantage of non-geographical numbering would be that each member of a household would be able to have individual numbers and customers would be able to keep the same number if they moved house .
a special prefix , such as 056 , would also alert customers to the fact that it was a distinct service separate from traditional telephone services , he said .
pc chat broadband telephony is experiencing something of a renaissance with inclarity one of several companies offering services to both businesses and home users .
touted for many years as a killer application for the internet , the proliferation of broadband connections means net calls are now of the same quality as traditional telephone calls .
chatting to relatives the other side of the world could be cheaper there are now a handful of companies across europe introducing the idea of using pcs rather than telephones to make phone calls .
internet service provider aol will offer such a service to its uk customers as part of the latest version of its online service .
it will allow customers to make free calls from their pcs to other aol members using just a microphone and speakers .
aol is certainly not over-hyping the potential at this stage .
" voice over ip has been around for a long time .
it is more likely to be a slow burner than an overnight hit , " said aol spokesperson jonathan lambert .
" the fact that it is cheaper does n't necessarily make it successful .
it changes the way that we use our phones we will have to see how consumers respond , " he said .
for anyone with relatives overseas , a free internet call could be a lot more appealing than picking up the phone , and with a broadband connection the quality is as good said mr lambert .
if net calls do take off it could signal worrying times for traditional telcos such as bt .
to counteract this , bt has made sure it has its finger in the broadband telephony pie , launching its own broadband telephony service , bt communicator , in march .
trials will begin in may .

the prospect of making cheap telephone calls over the net is being threatened by regulation , says an industry figure .
ahal besorai , chief executive of broadband telephony firm inclarity believes that the super-regulator ofcom is adopting the wrong approach to internet telephony .
the issue centres on how numbers are allocated for making telephone calls .
ofcom wants to create new numbers but this could be more costly and less convenient for users argues mr besorai .
" the noises ofcom has made so far are concerning .
if the right approach is not taken to this service it could kill it very quickly , " he told bbc news online .
transferring numbers the system used by inclarity allows users to connect their existing phones to the broadband network rather than using bt 's phone network .
much of the regulatory arrangements for broadband telephony are yet to be worked through and there is a variety of options ofcom spokesperson other broadband telephony services rely on pc to pc communication , using headsets and microphones .
if the prefix 056 , favoured by ofcom , is adopted for all broadband telephony services , consumers could be put off broadband telephony argues mr besorai .
geographical numbering would allow people to transfer their existing telephone number as well as having the advantage of being something callers are familiar with .
ofcom is due to conclude its consultation on the issues at the beginning of next month and is keen to stress that no final decisions will be made until then .
" much of the regulatory arrangements for broadband telephony are yet to be worked through and there is a variety of options , " said an ofcom spokesperson .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- autism link to male sex hormones bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes monday , 19 april , 2004 , 08:54 gmt 09:54 uk autism link to male sex hormones autism may be linked to hormone levels circulating in the developing foetus , research suggests .
a team from cambridge university found babies who produce high levels of the male hormone testosterone in the womb are more likely to show symptoms .
the finding suggests the condition may be genetic - and raises the possibility of a screening test .
it also lends weight to the theory that autism is basically an extreme form of the way men think and behave . "
" what i am doing is testing this idea that autism might be an extreme of the male brain . "
professor simon baron-cohen the research , led by psychologist professor simon baron-cohen , focused on 70 children whose mothers underwent an amniocentesis test while they were pregnant .
this enabled the researchers to measure levels of foetal testosterone in the samples .
when the children were four , their parents were asked to complete a checklist designed to record any signs of behavioural and social difficulties - which are associated with autism .
social difficulty speaking at the british psychological society annual meeting , professor baron-cohen said : " those who had a high level of testosterone also found it more difficult to fit into new social groups . "
children who had higher levels of foetal testosterone were also less curious than other children .
although these children were not autistic , the pattern suggested a link between foetal testosterone and autism-like traits .
professor baron-cohen added that earlier tests , carried out when the children were 12 months old , also showed that those exposed to higher testosterone levels were less willing to make eye contact - another key indicator of autism .
previous research by the cambridge team has shown that men are less empathic and more systematic than women - differences that are greatly exaggerated in people with autism .
professor baron-cohen said : " what i am doing is testing this idea that autism might be an extreme of the male brain .
" it 's showing that the sexes are different .
it 's not about one being better than the other .
you 're going to find individuals who are not typical of either sex . "
stuart notholt , director of policy and pulbic affairs for the national autistic society , told bbc news online the research was a " significant contribution " .
he said : " however , it is early days yet .
we are still quite a long way off understanding what genetic underpinning - if , indeed that is the cause - there is for autism . "
mr notholt said many people would be " very uneasy indeed " about the prospect of a pre-natal screening test for autism .
" it is a very varied condition .
many people with autism go on to live very full and happy lives . "
professor jack scarisbrick , chairman of the charity life , said a screening test would inevitably lead to pressure being placed on parents to abort autistic babies .
" testing and medical screening to provide information and prepare parents for the specific challenges a special-needs child brings is to be encouraged .
but that will not happen in this case .
" what chance does an autistic child have of survival when children with cleft palates are aborted ? "
the research is due to be published in the journal of child psychology and psychiatry .

the finding suggests the condition may be genetic - and raises the possibility of a screening test .
it also lends weight to the theory that autism is basically an extreme form of the way men think and behave .
" what i am doing is testing this idea that autism might be an extreme of the male brain .
professor simon baron-cohen the research , led by psychologist professor simon baron-cohen , focused on 70 children whose mothers underwent an amniocentesis test while they were pregnant .
this enabled the researchers to measure levels of foetal testosterone in the samples .
when the children were four , their parents were asked to complete a checklist designed to record any signs of behavioural and social difficulties - which are associated with autism .
social difficulty speaking at the british psychological society annual meeting , professor baron-cohen said : " those who had a high level of testosterone also found it more difficult to fit into new social groups . "
children who had higher levels of foetal testosterone were also less curious than other children .
although these children were not autistic , the pattern suggested a link between foetal testosterone and autism-like traits .
professor baron-cohen added that earlier tests , carried out when the children were 12 months old , also showed that those exposed to higher testosterone levels were less willing to make eye contact - another key indicator of autism .
previous research by the cambridge team has shown that men are less empathic and more systematic than women - differences that are greatly exaggerated in people with autism .
professor baron-cohen said : " what i am doing is testing this idea that autism might be an extreme of the male brain .
" it 's showing that the sexes are different .
it 's not about one being better than the other .
you 're going to find individuals who are not typical of either sex . "
stuart notholt , director of policy and pulbic affairs for the national autistic society , told bbc news online the research was a " significant contribution " .
he said : " however , it is early days yet .
we are still quite a long way off understanding what genetic underpinning - if , indeed that is the cause - there is for autism . "
mr notholt said many people would be " very uneasy indeed " about the prospect of a pre-natal screening test for autism .
" it is a very varied condition .
many people with autism go on to live very full and happy lives . "
professor jack scarisbrick , chairman of the charity life , said a screening test would inevitably lead to pressure being placed on parents to abort autistic babies .
" testing and medical screening to provide information and prepare parents for the specific challenges a special-needs child brings is to be encouraged .
but that will not happen in this case .
" what chance does an autistic child have of survival when children with cleft palates are aborted ? "
the research is due to be published in the journal of child psychology and psychiatry .

sony ericsson , the japanese-swedish mobile phone maker , says it has closed the gap on rivals and returned to profit in the first quarter of 2004 .
pre-tax profit was 97m euros -lrb- $ 119.5m -rrb- in the period , compared with a loss of 113m euros a year earlier .
the figure is more than double market forecasts and comes after the world 's fifth-largest handset maker focused on new products and cost cutting .
the results contrast with nokia , which recently reported weaker profits .
sony ericsson said it sold 8.8 million phones in the quarter and increased its market share to about 7 % from 6 % in the previous three months .
south korea 's samsung last week reported an increase in global market share to 14 % while nokia , the long-time market leader , has admitted its market share has slipped .
some analysts estimate the finnish mobile phone giant now has little more than 30 % of the market .
sony ericsson executive vice president jan wareby said the company 's gains were thanks to very strong sales of phones in the low and medium-price range .
clam-shell designs are also doing well , he said .
3g promise the joint venture between japan 's sony and sweden 's ericsson was born in april 2001 , and appears to be eating into the market share of the leading mobile phone makers such as nokia , motorola and siemens .
the boss of sony ericsson , katsumi ihara , said recently that as more video and music becomes available to download , users would switch to new mobiles with better screen and sound quality .
as a result , the company has put its weight behind the new generation of 3g phones .
its first 3g model is the clamshell z1010 .

sony ericsson , the japanese-swedish mobile phone maker , says it has closed the gap on rivals and returned to profit in the first quarter of 2004 .
pre-tax profit was 97m euros -lrb- $ 119.5m -rrb- in the period , compared with a loss of 113m euros a year earlier .
the figure is more than double market forecasts and comes after the world 's fifth-largest handset maker focused on new products and cost cutting .
the results contrast with nokia , which recently reported weaker profits .
sony ericsson said it sold 8.8 million phones in the quarter and increased its market share to about 7 % from 6 % in the previous three months .
south korea 's samsung last week reported an increase in global market share to 14 % while nokia , the long-time market leader , has admitted its market share has slipped .
some analysts estimate the finnish mobile phone giant now has little more than 30 % of the market .
sony ericsson executive vice president jan wareby said the company 's gains were thanks to very strong sales of phones in the low and medium-price range .
clam-shell designs are also doing well , he said .
3g promise the joint venture between japan 's sony and sweden 's ericsson was born in april 2001 , and appears to be eating into the market share of the leading mobile phone makers such as nokia , motorola and siemens .
the boss of sony ericsson , katsumi ihara , said recently that as more video and music becomes available to download , users would switch to new mobiles with better screen and sound quality .
as a result , the company has put its weight behind the new generation of 3g phones .

" i just want to apologise to the police , and any readers and anyone who picks up this story thinking it is actually true . "
artistic director spacey initially reported the crime around 0500 bst on saturday morning and subsequently received hospital treatment for his injury .

" asked spacey on the today programme oscar-winning actor kevin spacey has played down reports he was mugged at about 0400 bst on saturday morning while walking his dog in a london park .
reports in monday 's newspapers claimed he was robbed of his mobile phone and was treated for a minor head injury .

exactly when that day will dawn nobody knows , but people in middle age today can probably expect to be here for it .
long before it arrives we shall have had to commit ourselves to one or more of several possible energy futures .
and the momentous decisions we take in the next few years will determine whether our heirs thank or curse us for the energy choices we bequeath to them .
industry 's lifeblood there will always be some oil somewhere , but it may soon cost too much to extract and burn it .
it may be too technically difficult , too expensive compared with other fuels , or too polluting .
an article in scientific american in march 1998 by dr colin campbell and jean laherrere concluded : " the world is not running out of oil - at least not yet .
" what our society does face , and soon , is the end of the abundant and cheap oil on which all industrial nations depend . "
they suggested there were perhaps 1,000 billion barrels of conventional oil still to be produced , though the us geological survey 's world petroleum assessment 2000 put the figure at about 3,000 billion barrels .
too good to burn the world is now producing about 75 million barrels per day -lrb- bpd -rrb- .
conservative -lrb- for which read pessimistic -rrb- analysts say global oil production from all possible sources , including shale , bitumen and deep-water wells , will peak at around 2015 at about 90 million bpd , allowing a fairly modest increase in consumption . "
peaking is at hand , not years away ...
if i 'm right , the unforeseen consequences are devastating " matthew simmons , former us government adviser on campbell and laherrere 's downbeat estimate , that should last about 30 years at 90 million bpd , so drastic change could be necessary soon after 2030 .
and it would be drastic : 90 % of the world 's transport depends on oil , for a start .
most of the chemical and plastic trappings of life which we scarcely notice - furniture , pharmaceuticals , communications - need oil as a feedstock .
the real pessimists want us to stop using oil for transport immediately and keep it for irreplaceable purposes like these .
in may 2003 the association for the study of peak oil and gas -lrb- aspo -rrb- , founded by colin campbell , held a workshop on oil depletion in paris .
changed priorities one of the speakers was an investment banker , matthew simmons , a former adviser to president bush 's administration .
from the wilderness publications reported him as saying : " any serious analysis now shows solid evidence that the non-fsu -lsb- former soviet union -rsb- , non-opec -lsb- organisation of petroleum exporting countries -rsb- oil has certainly petered out and has probably peaked ...
" i think basically that peaking of oil will never be accurately predicted until after the fact .
but the event will occur , and my analysis is ... that peaking is at hand , not years away .
" if i 'm right , the unforeseen consequences are devastating ...
if the world 's oil supply does peak , the world 's issues start to look very different .
" there really are n't any good energy solutions for bridges , to buy some time , from oil and gas to the alternatives .
the only alternative right now is to shrink our economies . "
planning pays off aspo suggests the key date is not when the oil runs out , but when production peaks , meaning supplies decline .
it believes the peak may come by about 2010 .
fundamental change may be closing on us fast .
and even if the oil is there , we may do better to leave it untouched .
many scientists are arguing for cuts in emissions of the main greenhouse gas we produce , carbon dioxide , by at least 60 % by mid-century , to try to avoid runaway climate change .
that would mean burning far less oil than today , not looking for more .
there are other forms of energy , and many are falling fast in price and will soon compete with oil on cost , if not for convenience .
so there is every reason to plan for the post-oil age .
does it have to be devastating ?
different , yes - but our forebears lived without oil and thought themselves none the worse .
we shall have to do the same , so we might as well make the best of it .
and the best might even be an improvement on today .

oil production could soon peak just as certain as death and taxes is the knowledge that we shall one day be forced to learn to live without oil .
exactly when that day will dawn nobody knows , but people in middle age today can probably expect to be here for it .
long before it arrives we shall have had to commit ourselves to one or more of several possible energy futures .
and the momentous decisions we take in the next few years will determine whether our heirs thank or curse us for the energy choices we bequeath to them .
industry 's lifeblood there will always be some oil somewhere , but it may soon cost too much to extract and burn it .
it may be too technically difficult , too expensive compared with other fuels , or too polluting .
click to find out who has oil , who uses it and how much it costs in graphics an article in scientific american in march 1998 by dr colin campbell and jean laherrere concluded : " the world is not running out of oil - at least not yet .
" what our society does face , and soon , is the end of the abundant and cheap oil on which all industrial nations depend . "
they suggested there were perhaps 1,000 billion barrels of conventional oil still to be produced , though the us geological survey 's world petroleum assessment 2000 put the figure at about 3,000 billion barrels .
too good to burn the world is now producing about 75 million barrels per day -lrb- bpd -rrb- .
conservative -lrb- for which read pessimistic -rrb- analysts say global oil production from all possible sources , including shale , bitumen and deep-water wells , will peak at around 2015 at about 90 million bpd , allowing a fairly modest increase in consumption .
peaking is at hand , not years away ...
if i 'm right , the unforeseen consequences are devastating matthew simmons , former us government adviser on campbell and laherrere 's downbeat estimate , that should last about 30 years at 90 million bpd , so drastic change could be necessary soon after 2030 .
and it would be drastic : 90 % of the world 's transport depends on oil , for a start .
most of the chemical and plastic trappings of life which we scarcely notice - furniture , pharmaceuticals , communications - need oil as a feedstock .
the real pessimists want us to stop using oil for transport immediately and keep it for irreplaceable purposes like these .
in may 2003 the association for the study of peak oil and gas -lrb- aspo -rrb- , founded by colin campbell , held a workshop on oil depletion in paris .
changed priorities one of the speakers was an investment banker , matthew simmons , a former adviser to president bush 's administration .
from the wilderness publications reported him as saying : " any serious analysis now shows solid evidence that the non-fsu -lsb- former soviet union -rsb- , non-opec -lsb- organisation of petroleum exporting countries -rsb- oil has certainly petered out and has probably peaked ...
no cheap oil , no cheap food " i think basically that peaking of oil will never be accurately predicted until after the fact .
but the event will occur , and my analysis is ... that peaking is at hand , not years away .
" if i 'm right , the unforeseen consequences are devastating ...
if the world 's oil supply does peak , the world 's issues start to look very different .
" there really are n't any good energy solutions for bridges , to buy some time , from oil and gas to the alternatives .
the only alternative right now is to shrink our economies . "
planning pays off aspo suggests the key date is not when the oil runs out , but when production peaks , meaning supplies decline .
it believes the peak may come by about 2010 .
fundamental change may be closing on us fast .
and even if the oil is there , we may do better to leave it untouched .
many scientists are arguing for cuts in emissions of the main greenhouse gas we produce , carbon dioxide , by at least 60 % by mid-century , to try to avoid runaway climate change .
that would mean burning far less oil than today , not looking for more .
there are other forms of energy , and many are falling fast in price and will soon compete with oil on cost , if not for convenience .
so there is every reason to plan for the post-oil age .
does it have to be devastating ?
different , yes - but our forebears lived without oil and thought themselves none the worse .
we shall have to do the same , so we might as well make the best of it .

rashida bee and champa devi shukla won the goldman environmental prize and will share $ 125,000 .
the women said they would use the money to set up their own award in india for fighting corporate crime .
about 3,000 people died on the night of the toxic leak from the union carbide pesticide plant on 3 december , 1984 .
official indian estimates say there have been a further 15,000 related deaths in the years since .
the two women and five other activists will be honoured in san francisco on monday .
the award , often referred to as the nobel prize for environment , is given to each of six regions , each winning $ 125,000 .
disaster recalled ms bee and ms shukla lived within a few miles of the union carbide plant at the time of the gas leak .
they organised a hunger strike that spanned the world to sustain awareness in the effects of the disaster .
i saw mothers running and leaving their children behind , people coughing up blood rashida bee in addition to the dead , more than 150,000 people suffered injuries .
ms bee said : " the whole world wept , but then people forgot about bhopal . "
the pair spent years trying to hold union carbide 's parent , dow chemical , accountable .
union carbide became a wholly owned subsidiary of dow in 1999 .
" the forces that we have to fight against are too powerful , " ms bee said .
" there is no effective law-enforcing agency to hold large multinationals accountable . "
dow says the case was resolved in 1989 when union carbide paid $ 470m in a settlement with the indian government .
forced to work ms bee recalled the day of the disaster in an interview with reuters .
the women say the forces they fight are powerful " all of us started coughing , " she said .
" it was as though our lungs were on fire .
we started running and i had to pry my eyes open to see .
i saw mothers running and leaving their children behind , people coughing up blood . "
the women say the community still suffers elevated rates of cancer and anaemia .
" you can imagine the health of people who begin life with poisoned milk , " said ms bee .
before the disaster , ms bee was illiterate .
" i knew nothing of the world outside until the day of the disaster .
it changed my life , " she said .
she lost her husband and her father was injured .
defying muslim tradition , she was forced to work .
" i met so many other women in the same situation .
many had debts because of the disaster .
almost all faced starvation because the men could not work . "
she met ms sukla , a hindu , who blames the leak for the death of her husband and the deformity of her grandchild .
the pair established an independent union in 1986 to fight for improved pay and workplace conditions .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- education -pipe- q & a : education maintenance allowance bbc news / education graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- education -pipe- magazine 09:57 gmt , monday , 19 april 2004 10:57 uk q & a : education maintenance allowance a scheme offering payments of up to £ 30 a week for young people to keep studying beyond the age of 16 has been hit by administrative problems .
the government introduced the education maintenance allowance to improve the relatively low rate of people staying in education .
so what does the scheme involve ?
payments of £ 10 , £ 20 or £ 30 a week depending on household income for those who are on eligible courses such as gcses , a or as-levels , btecs , nvqs or basic skills courses .
these means testing income bands are most generous in scotland , where the upper limit for the £ 10 payment is £ 32,316 a year .
in wales and northern ireland it is £ 31,580 .
in england it is £ 30,810 .
in addition , students who attend regularly and satisfy their teachers about their progress can qualify for bonuses of £ 150 in scotland and £ 100 elsewhere in the uk .
the money is paid direct into students ' bank accounts .
how is household income calculated ?
not all income is factored in to the means testing .
for example where a student 's parents no longer live together , any maintenance paid by the non-resident parent does not count .
nor does a student 's own income count unless they are living independently , so they can work part-time while studying .
does ema affect benefit payments ?
no , it is in addition to other support .
it does not even affect parents ' child benefit , or any care to learn funding a student gets .
but you will not be entitled to ema if you have a dance and drama award , even if you are also studying for a-levels .
do emas work ?
pilot studies suggested they would .
in england emas were tested in various forms by 56 of the 150 local education authorities - in some cases for several years .
staying-on rates improved , according to research by the institute for fiscal studies and loughborough university .
overall , they were up 5.9 percentage points among those who were eligible for the grants .
education ministers like to cite the increased uptake of the allowances as evidence of success .
schools minister andrew adonis told a house of lords debate in april : " the numbers continue to increase . ...
540,000 students are in receipt of education maintenance allowances - an increase on 430,000 only two years ago . "
but as the scheme was rolled out from 16-year-olds upwards , two years ago the 18-year-olds were not eligible .
the target group - youngsters not in employment , education or training -lrb- neets -rrb- - peaked in 2005 and has fallen a little since but is still , official statisticians say , " not far off the long run average " at an estimated 9.4 % of those aged 16 to 18 in england .
the conservatives ' shadow schools secretary michael gove has characterised emas , costing more than £ 500m a year , as an expensive flop - though his party also said it would not scrap the payments .
in wales last year , 82 % of the 29,410 approved applications were from students entitled to the maximum £ 30 per week .
there , the proportion of neet young people has remained fairly steady at about 10 % to 12 % for a decade .
in scotland it is a little higher .
the welsh assembly government intends conducting a full evaluation of the ema scheme .
existing research on the subject suggests emas have most impact on young men from poorer homes .
there appears to be no significant effect however on attainment - the level of qualifications the young people have after staying on .
is n't the education leaving age being raised anyway ?
it is in england , initially to 17 then to 18 - though this is nothing like full-time schooling , just some element of training .
lord adonis has assured parliament that emas will continue anyway .

the government introduced the education maintenance allowance to improve the relatively low rate of people staying in education .
so what does the scheme involve ?
payments of £ 10 , £ 20 or £ 30 a week depending on household income for those who are on eligible courses such as gcses , a or as-levels , btecs , nvqs or basic skills courses .
these means testing income bands are most generous in scotland , where the upper limit for the £ 10 payment is £ 32,316 a year .
in wales and northern ireland it is £ 31,580 .
in england it is £ 30,810 .
in addition , students who attend regularly and satisfy their teachers about their progress can qualify for bonuses of £ 150 in scotland and £ 100 elsewhere in the uk .
the money is paid direct into students ' bank accounts .
how is household income calculated ?
not all income is factored in to the means testing .
for example where a student 's parents no longer live together , any maintenance paid by the non-resident parent does not count .
nor does a student 's own income count unless they are living independently , so they can work part-time while studying .
does ema affect benefit payments ?
no , it is in addition to other support .
it does not even affect parents ' child benefit , or any care to learn funding a student gets .
but you will not be entitled to ema if you have a dance and drama award , even if you are also studying for a-levels .
do emas work ?
pilot studies suggested they would .
in england emas were tested in various forms by 56 of the 150 local education authorities - in some cases for several years .
staying-on rates improved , according to research by the institute for fiscal studies and loughborough university .
overall , they were up 5.9 percentage points among those who were eligible for the grants .
education ministers like to cite the increased uptake of the allowances as evidence of success .
schools minister andrew adonis told a house of lords debate in april : " the numbers continue to increase . ...
540,000 students are in receipt of education maintenance allowances - an increase on 430,000 only two years ago . "
but as the scheme was rolled out from 16-year-olds upwards , two years ago the 18-year-olds were not eligible .
the target group - youngsters not in employment , education or training -lrb- neets -rrb- - peaked in 2005 and has fallen a little since but is still , official statisticians say , " not far off the long run average " at an estimated 9.4 % of those aged 16 to 18 in england .
the conservatives ' shadow schools secretary michael gove has characterised emas , costing more than £ 500m a year , as an expensive flop - though his party also said it would not scrap the payments .
in wales last year , 82 % of the 29,410 approved applications were from students entitled to the maximum £ 30 per week .
there , the proportion of neet young people has remained fairly steady at about 10 % to 12 % for a decade .
in scotland it is a little higher .
the welsh assembly government intends conducting a full evaluation of the ema scheme .
existing research on the subject suggests emas have most impact on young men from poorer homes .
there appears to be no significant effect however on attainment - the level of qualifications the young people have after staying on .
is n't the education leaving age being raised anyway ?
it is in england , initially to 17 then to 18 - though this is nothing like full-time schooling , just some element of training .
lord adonis has assured parliament that emas will continue anyway .

there , the proportion of neet young people has remained fairly steady at about 10 % to 12 % for a decade .
in scotland it is a little higher .
the welsh assembly government intends conducting a full evaluation of the ema scheme .
existing research on the subject suggests emas have most impact on young men from poorer homes .
there appears to be no significant effect however on attainment - the level of qualifications the young people have after staying on .
is n't the education leaving age being raised anyway ?
it is in england , initially to 17 then to 18 - though this is nothing like full-time schooling , just some element of training .
lord adonis has assured parliament that emas will continue anyway .

the government introduced the education maintenance allowance to improve the relatively low rate of people staying in education .
so what does the scheme involve ?
payments of £ 10 , £ 20 or £ 30 a week depending on household income for those who are on eligible courses such as gcses , a or as-levels , btecs , nvqs or basic skills courses .
these means testing income bands are most generous in scotland , where the upper limit for the £ 10 payment is £ 32,316 a year .
in wales and northern ireland it is £ 31,580 .
in england it is £ 30,810 .
in addition , students who attend regularly and satisfy their teachers about their progress can qualify for bonuses of £ 150 in scotland and £ 100 elsewhere in the uk .
the money is paid direct into students ' bank accounts .
how is household income calculated ?
not all income is factored in to the means testing .
for example where a student 's parents no longer live together , any maintenance paid by the non-resident parent does not count .
nor does a student 's own income count unless they are living independently , so they can work part-time while studying .
does ema affect benefit payments ?
no , it is in addition to other support .
it does not even affect parents ' child benefit , or any care to learn funding a student gets .
but you will not be entitled to ema if you have a dance and drama award , even if you are also studying for a-levels .
do emas work ?
pilot studies suggested they would .
in england emas were tested in various forms by 56 of the 150 local education authorities - in some cases for several years .
staying-on rates improved , according to research by the institute for fiscal studies and loughborough university .
overall , they were up 5.9 percentage points among those who were eligible for the grants .
education ministers like to cite the increased uptake of the allowances as evidence of success .
schools minister andrew adonis told a house of lords debate in april : " the numbers continue to increase . ...
540,000 students are in receipt of education maintenance allowances - an increase on 430,000 only two years ago . "
but as the scheme was rolled out from 16-year-olds upwards , two years ago the 18-year-olds were not eligible .
the target group - youngsters not in employment , education or training -lrb- neets -rrb- - peaked in 2005 and has fallen a little since but is still , official statisticians say , " not far off the long run average " at an estimated 9.4 % of those aged 16 to 18 in england .
