she will meet with businesspeople , politicians , schoolchildren and be the honorary guest at a concert benefiting the reconstruction of dresden , a city british bombers flattened in the waning months of wwii . in an effort to show just how well the two countries understand each other , british officials have been eagerly pointing out that it is the queen 's fourth visit to germany since the war . indeed , chancellor gehard schröder and prime minister tony blair , both left-of-center leaders , seem to enjoy a good relationship and the two governments have worked closely together on major issues such as the european union and nuclear proliferation in iran .
yet when it comes to cultural understanding between the two countries there remain major deficits . dw-world presents a dossier on why , almost 60 years later , the war continues to cast a shadow over relations between germans and the british . dw-world.de do mention the war ?
a british newspaper has alleged that the german government is putting pressure on queen elizabeth ii to make a public apology for the firebombing of dresden in 1945 when she visits germany in november .

dw 's ute schaeffer weighs up the options . as ukraine decides either to deepen ties with moscow or pursue the liberal policies of its western neighbors , early results monday showed current prime minister yanukovich is just one percent ahead of his reformist challenger . an ugly campaign the ukrainian electorate was determined not to be compromised .
a bitter campaign of political mud-slinging and recrimination was not enough to deter the voters from casting their ballots in what could prove to be a critical poll for the former soviet state . they kept their eye firmly on the broader picture , unshaken as the opposition accused the media of a pro-yanukovich bias and supporters of the establishment 's candidate claimed that western-leaning yushchenko was in cahoots with both the cia and radical nationalistic groups . a divided country the two candidates represent two ends of ukraine 's political spectrum .
prime minister yanukovich , backed by moscow and voters in the russian-speaking industrial east , wants to strengthen the centralist power of the state , while yushchenko stands for liberal economics and social reform . the outcome of sunday 's election shows how precarious ukraine 's future is .
in many respects , it 's a divided country .
many of the younger generation have studied or worked abroad .
today , they 're increasingly alienated from low-income and elderly voters , who can still remember the days of soviet rule , when life was predictable and economically secure . not surprisingly , the western part of the country - which borders poland and therefore the eu - proved to be a yushchenko stronghold . more suprisingly , sunday 's outcome suggested the " establishment candidate " yanukovich failed to win over the country 's elite .
up to 75 percent of voters in the capital came out in support of the opposition .
as the downfall of the soviet union fourteen years ago proved , leadership that lacks the backing of the elite is clearly losing ground . crucial factors the run-off next month will undoubtedly be decided by what now happens behind the scenes . outgoing president leonid kuchma will want to know how much he can rely on yanukovich , were he to remain in office .

will they choose west-leaning yushchenko or russia-oriented yanukovich ? flawed democracy according to ukrainian writer andrey kurkow , the country still lacks a truly democratic candidate .
it would be naïve to see the presidential race as a battle between traditionalists and reformers .
viktor yushchenko 's base includes plenty of non-democratic elements , and if he assumes office , he will have to make inevitable concessions . nonetheless , during his term as prime minister five years ago , yushchenko demonstrated that he acknowledges the nation 's ties to russia while believing in social justice and understanding how to prompt market reforms .

a bitter campaign of political mud-slinging and recrimination was not enough to deter the voters from casting their ballots in what could prove to be a critical poll for the former soviet state . they kept their eye firmly on the broader picture , unshaken as the opposition accused the media of a pro-yanukovich bias and supporters of the establishment 's candidate claimed that western-leaning yushchenko was in cahoots with both the cia and radical nationalistic groups . a divided country the two candidates represent two ends of ukraine 's political spectrum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house bild backs bush an overwhelming case for germany ? former us treasurer campaigns for kerry kerry 's sister gets out the vote in europe reader response -pipe- 02.11.2004 europe 's view of the election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush does n't have quite so many fans in europe dw-world readers weigh in on the us presidential election and predict what the outcome will be and how us-european relations will change as a result . since bush will be elected the question is whether us-eu relations will improve .
this will depend upon attitudes and actions in europe more than anything bush can or will do .
the anti-bush , anti-american feelings that rage in europe are the result of many layers of insecurity , inferiority , resentment , envy , fear and arrogance on the part of the citizens of europe .
only they can deal with these . - jl ronish , seattle , usa bild newspaper endorses bush as a us citizen , i 'm not particularly anxious for the support of the german people .
over the last 100 years , germans have demonstrated breathtaking ineptitude regarding world affairs .
as recently as 1972 , germans demonstrated their true colors when they surrendered the munich terrorists to the libyans .
neither germany nor france have ever been particularly reliable allies to the us , and both have preferred to spend too much money on their welfare states while relying on the us for military protection . - joe bowman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild came out strong for bush at the end of october .
support for bush is to be expected from a tabloid .
most tabloids i am aware of are owned by right-wing pro-business individuals .
i am thinking of the murdoch group , for instance .
unfortunately tabloids are influencial .
but in the case of bild , this paper 's opinion does not reflect the majority of german opinion . - serge i applaud bild for the courage to take a stand on this issue despite the fact that a clear majority of germans - and europeans - appear to despise this very principled man -lrb- bush -rrb- without just cause .
it is clear that you have seen through all the rhetoric . - mark beck what a relief to read that there are still a few sound minds left in germany .
i 'm referring to bild 's endorsement of george bush for president .
the united states will grow stronger economically , militarily and otherwise with the re-election of bush .
it 's unfortunate that the majority of germans are too foolish , too liberal that is , to realize that a strong u.s. is a good thing . - carl mahrenholz seems that the reporter is one of the few who has a cogent argument and does not let an antipathy toward bush cloud his judgment .
kerry will be weak on terrorism as a lot of presidents before him , which is the reason the terrorists became more and more emboldened ; the worst thing i see about kerry is that he ca n't make a decision -lrb- clinton could n't either -rrb- - one might not agree with bush 's decisions , but at least he has the guts to make them . - marga e. doerr bush 's record abroad i feel that the reason why bush has such large support in us is due to the privatized and unquestioning media that we are subjected to .
of the world 's media , 5 people own rougly 90 percent of it .
one of those people , rupert murdock , has been quoted as saying that he 'll do anything to have bush reelected .
this is obvious to anyone who has seen even a small amount of fox " news " .
i would like to see a more questioning media in this country . - brad ahrens , usa i believe absentee ballots cast by us voters overseas can make a difference in the election outcome .
furthermore , in allowing for votes to be cast in this fashion , the electoral process strengthens its ' credibility by ensuring that all citizens , regardless of their location , will have their say . - - vijay dasika somerset , nj , usa i am an american expatriate living in the philippines .
i have sent my absentee ballot , at no small expense , in to my state of residence by fedex because i did n't trust the postal system here .
i have no idea if my vote will actually be counted , but my feelings on this election are more intense than any election i have ever voted in .
living overseas i can see more clearly , than americans at home , the affect that president bush is having on the whole world in general and i think that he has impacted on the world in a more negative manner than a positive one .
i do n't doubt the president 's sincerity in what he is doing , but i do think he is on a totally wrong track and it is time for a change in american politics . - james r. beck-jensen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world has been following the race from a european perspective .

the anti-bush , anti-american feelings that rage in europe are the result of many layers of insecurity , inferiority , resentment , envy , fear and arrogance on the part of the citizens of europe .
only they can deal with these . - jl ronish , seattle , usa bild newspaper endorses bush as a us citizen , i 'm not particularly anxious for the support of the german people .
over the last 100 years , germans have demonstrated breathtaking ineptitude regarding world affairs .
as recently as 1972 , germans demonstrated their true colors when they surrendered the munich terrorists to the libyans .
neither germany nor france have ever been particularly reliable allies to the us , and both have preferred to spend too much money on their welfare states while relying on the us for military protection . - joe bowman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild came out strong for bush at the end of october .
support for bush is to be expected from a tabloid .
most tabloids i am aware of are owned by right-wing pro-business individuals .
i am thinking of the murdoch group , for instance .
unfortunately tabloids are influencial .

the united states will grow stronger economically , militarily and otherwise with the re-election of bush .
it 's unfortunate that the majority of germans are too foolish , too liberal that is , to realize that a strong u.s. is a good thing . - carl mahrenholz seems that the reporter is one of the few who has a cogent argument and does not let an antipathy toward bush cloud his judgment .
kerry will be weak on terrorism as a lot of presidents before him , which is the reason the terrorists became more and more emboldened ; the worst thing i see about kerry is that he ca n't make a decision -lrb- clinton could n't either -rrb- - one might not agree with bush 's decisions , but at least he has the guts to make them . - marga e. doerr bush 's record abroad i feel that the reason why bush has such large support in us is due to the privatized and unquestioning media that we are subjected to .
of the world 's media , 5 people own rougly 90 percent of it .
one of those people , rupert murdock , has been quoted as saying that he 'll do anything to have bush reelected .
this is obvious to anyone who has seen even a small amount of fox " news " .

a vast majority of europeans are hoping for a change in the white house after the us election .
but while john kerry is the candidate of choice , would a democratic administration be the best thing for us-german relations ? us presidential candidate john kerry enjoys great popularity in europe .
in germany , the massachusetts senator commands an overwhelming majority in opinion polls , with almost 80 percent in favor of the democrat . but while the german public favors a change in the white house , deriving mostly from distaste for incumbent george w. bush 's policies , would a kerry administration be the best thing for us-european and , in particular , us-german , relations ? kerry speaks five languages , including fluent french .

a vast majority of europeans are hoping for a change in the white house after the us election .
but while john kerry is the candidate of choice , would a democratic administration be the best thing for us-german relations ? us presidential candidate john kerry enjoys great popularity in europe .
in germany , the massachusetts senator commands an overwhelming majority in opinion polls , with almost 80 percent in favor of the democrat . but while the german public favors a change in the white house , deriving mostly from distaste for incumbent george w. bush 's policies , would a kerry administration be the best thing for us-european and , in particular , us-german , relations ? kerry speaks five languages , including fluent french .

but either way , the place to be in germany this week is at one of the many election parties being held in cities around the country . once upon a time , watching the us presidential election coverage in europe was a low-key affair .
maybe some international friends got together and hung out on someone 's living room couch , cracked open a bag of chips and watched cnn .
or maybe they got a good night 's sleep and picked up the returns from the local broadcasters in the morning .
but the days of casual returns watching are gone , along with any traces of indifference about who wins the white house on nov .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate sen. john kerry rarely has a us election been so important to so many people , in europe as well as in the united states .
in turn , watching it has become a big event - at least in germany .
partying through the night over the course of tuesday night and into the early morning wednesday -lrb- due to the time difference , key results are first expected to come in around 2 a.m.
cet -rrb- , major cities in germany will host a number of election parties both private and public .
and to help make it easier to wait through long hours of state-by-state polling results , most of the parties have been jazzed up with political-themed entertainment .
at what may turn out to be the biggest party , on berlin 's central potsdamer platz , monitors are being set up to broadcast election coverage starting at 11:30 p.m. local time .
several hundred night owls are expected to come and watch the returns while enjoying american snacks and live music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush " we 'll serve breakfast in the morning , " a speaker for the cinestar movie theater told the afp news agency .
the theater , which shows films in their original language and estimates that up to a third of its customers are english speaking , will also show previews for the remake of " the manchurian candidate , " due to open in germany on nov .
11 .
the subject of the film is a manipulated us election .
neutral , and not-so-neutral the potsdamer platz party was organized by the group " american voters abroad , " which says it is politically neutral .
no such claims are being made by a group called vote44 , which , according to its website , was created for the sole purpose of ousting george w. bush . along with large screen election-results viewing and live music , filmmaker wim wenders is expected to attend the vote44 party in berlin 's tränenpalast and show his latest movie , " land of plenty , " which takes a critical look at post-sept .
11 america .
along with the usual coverage , the satiric 1997 political movie " wag the dog " - about an administration that fabricates a war in order to cover up a presidential sex scandal - is on the menu at the election bash being thrown by the cologne amerika haus and the konrad adenauer foundation , between cologne and bonn .
this party , too , is set to end with an election breakfast at 6 a.m.
in hamburg , the tivoli theater on the famous reeperbahn nightlife strip will offer american drinks and popcorn to accompany its vote rebroadcasts .
under the motto " do n't spend this night alone , " the tivoli has come up with games to allow partygoers to bet on the outcome in certain states starting at 1 a.m.
in munich 's amerika haus , 800 guests are expected to attend the election night party , including the publisher of the influential die zeit weekly newspaper and other notable locals .
a huge number of people are scrambling for tickets , organizers of the fete say , since " without a ticket , no one gets in , " spokespeople said .
no fun for soldiers ?
while their numbers are diminishing , germany is still home to many us military compounds - full of people who are likely to be most immediately impacted by the election results .
but the bases are probably among the last bastions of chips-on-the-sofa style returns-watching .
spokespeople for the compounds in hanau , ramstein and schweinfurt explained that in an effort to maintain neturality , the military wo n't throw any parties to celebrate their country 's vote . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house the outcome of the race between george w. bush and john kerry will likely have effects on us-european relations .

this will depend upon attitudes and actions in europe more than anything bush can or will do .
the anti-bush , anti-american feelings that rage in europe are the result of many layers of insecurity , inferiority , resentment , envy , fear and arrogance on the part of the citizens of europe .
only they can deal with these . - jl ronish , seattle , usa bild newspaper endorses bush as a us citizen , i 'm not particularly anxious for the support of the german people .
over the last 100 years , germans have demonstrated breathtaking ineptitude regarding world affairs .
as recently as 1972 , germans demonstrated their true colors when they surrendered the munich terrorists to the libyans .
neither germany nor france have ever been particularly reliable allies to the us , and both have preferred to spend too much money on their welfare states while relying on the us for military protection . - joe bowman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild came out strong for bush at the end of october .
support for bush is to be expected from a tabloid .
most tabloids i am aware of are owned by right-wing pro-business individuals .
i am thinking of the murdoch group , for instance .
unfortunately tabloids are influencial .
but in the case of bild , this paper 's opinion does not reflect the majority of german opinion . - serge i applaud bild for the courage to take a stand on this issue despite the fact that a clear majority of germans - and europeans - appear to despise this very principled man -lrb- bush -rrb- without just cause .
it is clear that you have seen through all the rhetoric . - mark beck what a relief to read that there are still a few sound minds left in germany .
i 'm referring to bild 's endorsement of george bush for president .
the united states will grow stronger economically , militarily and otherwise with the re-election of bush .
it 's unfortunate that the majority of germans are too foolish , too liberal that is , to realize that a strong u.s. is a good thing . - carl mahrenholz seems that the reporter is one of the few who has a cogent argument and does not let an antipathy toward bush cloud his judgment .
kerry will be weak on terrorism as a lot of presidents before him , which is the reason the terrorists became more and more emboldened ; the worst thing i see about kerry is that he ca n't make a decision -lrb- clinton could n't either -rrb- - one might not agree with bush 's decisions , but at least he has the guts to make them . - marga e. doerr bush 's record abroad i feel that the reason why bush has such large support in us is due to the privatized and unquestioning media that we are subjected to .
of the world 's media , 5 people own rougly 90 percent of it .
one of those people , rupert murdock , has been quoted as saying that he 'll do anything to have bush reelected .
this is obvious to anyone who has seen even a small amount of fox " news " .
i would like to see a more questioning media in this country . - brad ahrens , usa i believe absentee ballots cast by us voters overseas can make a difference in the election outcome .
furthermore , in allowing for votes to be cast in this fashion , the electoral process strengthens its ' credibility by ensuring that all citizens , regardless of their location , will have their say . - - vijay dasika somerset , nj , usa i am an american expatriate living in the philippines .
i have sent my absentee ballot , at no small expense , in to my state of residence by fedex because i did n't trust the postal system here .
i have no idea if my vote will actually be counted , but my feelings on this election are more intense than any election i have ever voted in .
living overseas i can see more clearly , than americans at home , the affect that president bush is having on the whole world in general and i think that he has impacted on the world in a more negative manner than a positive one .
i do n't doubt the president 's sincerity in what he is doing , but i do think he is on a totally wrong track and it is time for a change in american politics . - james r. beck-jensen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world has been following the race from a european perspective .

this will depend upon attitudes and actions in europe more than anything bush can or will do .
the anti-bush , anti-american feelings that rage in europe are the result of many layers of insecurity , inferiority , resentment , envy , fear and arrogance on the part of the citizens of europe .
only they can deal with these . - jl ronish , seattle , usa bild newspaper endorses bush as a us citizen , i 'm not particularly anxious for the support of the german people .
over the last 100 years , germans have demonstrated breathtaking ineptitude regarding world affairs .
as recently as 1972 , germans demonstrated their true colors when they surrendered the munich terrorists to the libyans .
neither germany nor france have ever been particularly reliable allies to the us , and both have preferred to spend too much money on their welfare states while relying on the us for military protection . - joe bowman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild came out strong for bush at the end of october .
support for bush is to be expected from a tabloid .
most tabloids i am aware of are owned by right-wing pro-business individuals .
i am thinking of the murdoch group , for instance .
unfortunately tabloids are influencial .
but in the case of bild , this paper 's opinion does not reflect the majority of german opinion . - serge i applaud bild for the courage to take a stand on this issue despite the fact that a clear majority of germans - and europeans - appear to despise this very principled man -lrb- bush -rrb- without just cause .
it is clear that you have seen through all the rhetoric . - mark beck what a relief to read that there are still a few sound minds left in germany .
i 'm referring to bild 's endorsement of george bush for president .
the united states will grow stronger economically , militarily and otherwise with the re-election of bush .
it 's unfortunate that the majority of germans are too foolish , too liberal that is , to realize that a strong u.s. is a good thing . - carl mahrenholz seems that the reporter is one of the few who has a cogent argument and does not let an antipathy toward bush cloud his judgment .
kerry will be weak on terrorism as a lot of presidents before him , which is the reason the terrorists became more and more emboldened ; the worst thing i see about kerry is that he ca n't make a decision -lrb- clinton could n't either -rrb- - one might not agree with bush 's decisions , but at least he has the guts to make them . - marga e. doerr bush 's record abroad i feel that the reason why bush has such large support in us is due to the privatized and unquestioning media that we are subjected to .
of the world 's media , 5 people own rougly 90 percent of it .
one of those people , rupert murdock , has been quoted as saying that he 'll do anything to have bush reelected .
this is obvious to anyone who has seen even a small amount of fox " news " .
i would like to see a more questioning media in this country . - brad ahrens , usa i believe absentee ballots cast by us voters overseas can make a difference in the election outcome .
furthermore , in allowing for votes to be cast in this fashion , the electoral process strengthens its ' credibility by ensuring that all citizens , regardless of their location , will have their say . - - vijay dasika somerset , nj , usa i am an american expatriate living in the philippines .
i have sent my absentee ballot , at no small expense , in to my state of residence by fedex because i did n't trust the postal system here .
i have no idea if my vote will actually be counted , but my feelings on this election are more intense than any election i have ever voted in .
living overseas i can see more clearly , than americans at home , the affect that president bush is having on the whole world in general and i think that he has impacted on the world in a more negative manner than a positive one .
i do n't doubt the president 's sincerity in what he is doing , but i do think he is on a totally wrong track and it is time for a change in american politics . - james r. beck-jensen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world has been following the race from a european perspective .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house bild backs bush an overwhelming case for germany ? former us treasurer campaigns for kerry kerry 's sister gets out the vote in europe germany -pipe- 02.11.2004 a vote for better us-german relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin hopes the next us president works to improve transatlantic ties as the us goes to the polls , german politicians across all parties have expressed their hope that the next administration brings an improvement in transatlantic ties , regardless of who the president is . relations between the current washington administration and berlin have been strained since the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder refused to support george w. bush in the war against iraq .
when american troops marched into iraq without the support of the united nations and all of the nato allies , ties between germany and the us plummeted to an all-time post-war low .
a year later , iraq remains a touchstone of bilateral relations as discussions center around reconstruction and security efforts in the war-torn country .
but beyond iraq , questions about washington 's pre-emptive strike policy , the role of the united nations , climate control , the international court and free trade agreements continue to put the transatlantic partnership to the test .
as a result , politicians in germany have carefully avoided showing public preference for one of the us presidential candidates .
although many may echo the rest of the population in favoring john f. kerry , they have been cautious not to alienate bush .
no matter who the next leader of the united states is , german politicians are hoping for an improvement in diplomatic ties between the two countries during the next four years .
it may not be that easy though , and germany is likely to have to pay a price .
new responsibility for germany wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democrats union , cautioned that a change in us leadership could mean germany taking on greater responsibility .
" our demands for multilateral decision-making and a stronger partnership in transatlantic relations are entirely justified , " he said .
" but at the same time , we should also recognize that this also entails greater efforts on our side . "
" it 's absurd to believe that we can tell the americans what to do while we refuse to get involved , " schäuble said in the run-up to the us election on nov .
2 .
the party leader for the neo-liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , has said the promise of " rejuvenated and rebalanced ties " between germany and the united states will come at a price .
if kerry should win - as many in germany and europe hope is the case - the democratic president will place new demands on berlin .
" this must not necessarily mean that germany will be asked to send troops to iraq , " he said .
" but i expect that a greater role for the german military will indeed be among kerry 's plans for our involvement in other regional hot spots . "
the kerry conundrum many experts believe john kerry would indeed press chancellor schröder even harder than bush to join american efforts in iraq .
if that is the case , the german leader will find himself in an extremely difficult position torn between taking on more international responsibility on the one hand , and sending german troops to iraq - a scenario he has categorically rejected .
schröder 's advisor for transatlantic relations , karsten voigt , has said the chancellor will not rescind his opposition to military intervention .
" in spite of statements by kerry that he wants to involve his european partners more closely and even the likelihood that bush will approach europeans with a new initiative , we can not depart from our position that german troops will not be sent to iraq , no matter who will be the next president . "
redirecting the focus germany 's greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder 's government , have called for the next us president to put more focus on areas other than the fight against terrorism .
party co-leader claudia roth has said the new administration in washington needs to be more pro-active on environmental issues .
" it begins with taking on a greater role in global environmental policy , especially in the field of climate protection which has been entirely abandoned by the bush administration , " she said referring to the current president 's rejection of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
" other areas neglected by the united states are human rights and the international court , whose job it is to prosecute and punish gross violations of such rights . "
" america should be involved in all of this and should not chose to stand on the sidelines , " roth said . uwe hessler -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what does the us vote mean for germany ?
a vast majority of europeans are hoping for a change in the white house after the us election .
but while john kerry is the candidate of choice , would a democratic administration be the best thing for us-german relations ?
-lrb- nov .
2 , 2004 -rrb- a kerry conundrum for schröder the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .
however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier .

when american troops marched into iraq without the support of the united nations and all of the nato allies , ties between germany and the us plummeted to an all-time post-war low .
a year later , iraq remains a touchstone of bilateral relations as discussions center around reconstruction and security efforts in the war-torn country .
but beyond iraq , questions about washington 's pre-emptive strike policy , the role of the united nations , climate control , the international court and free trade agreements continue to put the transatlantic partnership to the test .
as a result , politicians in germany have carefully avoided showing public preference for one of the us presidential candidates .
although many may echo the rest of the population in favoring john f. kerry , they have been cautious not to alienate bush .
no matter who the next leader of the united states is , german politicians are hoping for an improvement in diplomatic ties between the two countries during the next four years .
it may not be that easy though , and germany is likely to have to pay a price .
new responsibility for germany wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democrats union , cautioned that a change in us leadership could mean germany taking on greater responsibility .
" our demands for multilateral decision-making and a stronger partnership in transatlantic relations are entirely justified , " he said .
" but at the same time , we should also recognize that this also entails greater efforts on our side . "
" it 's absurd to believe that we can tell the americans what to do while we refuse to get involved , " schäuble said in the run-up to the us election on nov .
2 .
the party leader for the neo-liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , has said the promise of " rejuvenated and rebalanced ties " between germany and the united states will come at a price .
if kerry should win - as many in germany and europe hope is the case - the democratic president will place new demands on berlin .
" this must not necessarily mean that germany will be asked to send troops to iraq , " he said .
" but i expect that a greater role for the german military will indeed be among kerry 's plans for our involvement in other regional hot spots . "
the kerry conundrum many experts believe john kerry would indeed press chancellor schröder even harder than bush to join american efforts in iraq .
if that is the case , the german leader will find himself in an extremely difficult position torn between taking on more international responsibility on the one hand , and sending german troops to iraq - a scenario he has categorically rejected .
schröder 's advisor for transatlantic relations , karsten voigt , has said the chancellor will not rescind his opposition to military intervention .
" in spite of statements by kerry that he wants to involve his european partners more closely and even the likelihood that bush will approach europeans with a new initiative , we can not depart from our position that german troops will not be sent to iraq , no matter who will be the next president . "
redirecting the focus germany 's greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder 's government , have called for the next us president to put more focus on areas other than the fight against terrorism .
party co-leader claudia roth has said the new administration in washington needs to be more pro-active on environmental issues .
" it begins with taking on a greater role in global environmental policy , especially in the field of climate protection which has been entirely abandoned by the bush administration , " she said referring to the current president 's rejection of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
" other areas neglected by the united states are human rights and the international court , whose job it is to prosecute and punish gross violations of such rights . "

before the start of the autumn bka session in wiesbaden , the social democrat politician refuted speculation in the national media that such a move would reduce the authority of the states .
bka president jörg ziercke supported the idea , saying his agency needed to be able to act preventively .
the opposition cdu-csu parties , however , criticized the push .
the minister made clear that he did n't want to alter anything in the basic policy or overly centralize the agency , which operates on both state and federal levels .
but he noted that it was a weakness in the current system that the bka is n't able to take preventive security measures , and that the constitution needed to be changed to accommodate this . more briefs 01.11.2004 -pipe- german ebay to feature pharmaceuticals 01.11.2004 -pipe- german soccer team faces tough group 29.10.2004 -pipe- germany allows gay couples more rights 29.10.2004 -pipe- report : us to honor german-soviet spies 29.10.2004 -pipe- bundestag passes deutsche welle law 28.10.2004 -pipe- bbc probes german " copy " of hit tv show 28.10.2004 -pipe- tourists ' suspected kidnapper arrested 28.10.2004 -pipe- germany to bolster child care radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a vast majority of europeans are hoping for a change in the white house after the us election .
but while john kerry is the candidate of choice , would a democratic administration be the best thing for us-german relations ? us presidential candidate john kerry enjoys great popularity in europe .
in germany , the massachusetts senator commands an overwhelming majority in opinion polls , with almost 80 percent in favor of the democrat . but while the german public favors a change in the white house , deriving mostly from distaste for incumbent george w. bush 's policies , would a kerry administration be the best thing for us-european and , in particular , us-german , relations ? kerry speaks five languages , including fluent french .
he went to school in switzerland .
he takes his vacations in france and has a european-born wife , teresa heinz kerry . jackson janes of the institute for contemporary german studies in washington admitted these were good credentials for a future president .
but he has reservations that these qualities will bring about a white house more endeared to europe . kerry would neither be the opposite of bush nor would he reform us foreign policy to engage with and consider the interests and ideas of europe , janes said .
" this is complete nonsense , " he told german public tv broadcaster ard 's " tagesschau " news program .
" all this friction which is here today , will still be there . " this friction comes in many guises : the bush white house 's refusal to back the kyoto protocol and the international criminal court , us policy in the middle east and israel , the american insistence on the right to defend its own security by force - pre-emptive or preventative - if necessary . different president , same problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry all these points of contention certainly would n't not be resolved from one day to the next ; president kerry would still face the same problems and issues that president bush did .
but a better atmosphere would likely be created if the reins of power were handed over to the democrat . however , it could also lead to more problems than solutions in germany - foremost among them being iraq . if the democratic challenger is elected , his campaign pledge to create a stronger coalition and alliance in iraq could take on contentious and even unsettling dimensions for some european countries , according to us ambassador to germany daniel coats in the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday . " senator kerry has indicated he would ask -lrb- for troops -rrb- , so that 's going to produce some difficult questions and some tensions here between the us and germany - if that happens , " coats told the paper . similar tensions over german stance on iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder chancellor gerhard schröder angered bush during campaigning for the german general elections in sept .
2002 when he vehemently opposed any military " adventure " in iraq .
subsequently , schröder has refused to send any troops to the war-torn country , but germany is helping train iraqi military officers and police outside the country . speaking during campaigning on oct .
5 , kerry acknowledged that foreign powers would not " trade their young for our young in body-bags , " but he said he would be able to get them involved in missions like securing iraq 's borders .
" those borders have become a sieve for weapons of mass destruction and those weapons of mass destruction are terrorists that are crossing them and coming in and blowing themselves up in cars , " he said . kerry added that the current administration had no credibility to enlist us allies .
" every step of the way these folks have pushed them away , " he said .
" what i will do is bring new credibility , a fresh start . " sticky situation for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops in iraq would be on any agenda for germany and a new president .
that could put schröder in a difficult position .
berlin would consider a kerry administration friendly , and germany would be one of the first stops for a new president .
but if that visit included a call for military support in iraq , a potential thawing of relations could quickly turn icy again and a new friend could be swiftly alienated . if , on the other hand , schröder changes track for the new administration , the german chancellor would face outrage at home that could have a decisive influence on his own chances for re-election in 2006 . jackson janes contended that kerry would not demand a troop deployment from schröder .
" i do not believe that he expects germany to send troops to iraq .
but i believe he would expect development aid .
and much more than germany has provided up to now , " janes told german television . re-election less demanding for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president george w. bush bush 's re-election , however , would likely just lead to a continuation of the animosity between the two governments . " i can not imagine that bush would say : what i have done during the first four years was a mistake .
on the contrary , " said janes .
re-election , he believes , would be seen as endorsement of the first term and justification for the way the us treats the europeans . either way , the result and the future of us-european relations lies in the hands of american voters , and it will surely be a challenge for all european countries , regardless of whether bush or kerry wins . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house the outcome of the race between george w. bush and john kerry will likely have effects on us-european relations .

but either way , the place to be in germany this week is at one of the many election parties being held in cities around the country . once upon a time , watching the us presidential election coverage in europe was a low-key affair .
maybe some international friends got together and hung out on someone 's living room couch , cracked open a bag of chips and watched cnn .
or maybe they got a good night 's sleep and picked up the returns from the local broadcasters in the morning .
but the days of casual returns watching are gone , along with any traces of indifference about who wins the white house on nov .
2 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate sen. john kerry rarely has a us election been so important to so many people , in europe as well as in the united states .
in turn , watching it has become a big event - at least in germany .
partying through the night over the course of tuesday night and into the early morning wednesday -lrb- due to the time difference , key results are first expected to come in around 2 a.m.
cet -rrb- , major cities in germany will host a number of election parties both private and public .
and to help make it easier to wait through long hours of state-by-state polling results , most of the parties have been jazzed up with political-themed entertainment .
at what may turn out to be the biggest party , on berlin 's central potsdamer platz , monitors are being set up to broadcast election coverage starting at 11:30 p.m. local time .
several hundred night owls are expected to come and watch the returns while enjoying american snacks and live music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush " we 'll serve breakfast in the morning , " a speaker for the cinestar movie theater told the afp news agency .
the theater , which shows films in their original language and estimates that up to a third of its customers are english speaking , will also show previews for the remake of " the manchurian candidate , " due to open in germany on nov .
11 .
the subject of the film is a manipulated us election .
neutral , and not-so-neutral the potsdamer platz party was organized by the group " american voters abroad , " which says it is politically neutral .
no such claims are being made by a group called vote44 , which , according to its website , was created for the sole purpose of ousting george w. bush . along with large screen election-results viewing and live music , filmmaker wim wenders is expected to attend the vote44 party in berlin 's tränenpalast and show his latest movie , " land of plenty , " which takes a critical look at post-sept .
11 america .
along with the usual coverage , the satiric 1997 political movie " wag the dog " - about an administration that fabricates a war in order to cover up a presidential sex scandal - is on the menu at the election bash being thrown by the cologne amerika haus and the konrad adenauer foundation , between cologne and bonn .
this party , too , is set to end with an election breakfast at 6 a.m.
in hamburg , the tivoli theater on the famous reeperbahn nightlife strip will offer american drinks and popcorn to accompany its vote rebroadcasts .
under the motto " do n't spend this night alone , " the tivoli has come up with games to allow partygoers to bet on the outcome in certain states starting at 1 a.m.
in munich 's amerika haus , 800 guests are expected to attend the election night party , including the publisher of the influential die zeit weekly newspaper and other notable locals .
a huge number of people are scrambling for tickets , organizers of the fete say , since " without a ticket , no one gets in , " spokespeople said .
no fun for soldiers ?

cet -rrb- , major cities in germany will host a number of election parties both private and public .
and to help make it easier to wait through long hours of state-by-state polling results , most of the parties have been jazzed up with political-themed entertainment .
at what may turn out to be the biggest party , on berlin 's central potsdamer platz , monitors are being set up to broadcast election coverage starting at 11:30 p.m. local time .
several hundred night owls are expected to come and watch the returns while enjoying american snacks and live music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush " we 'll serve breakfast in the morning , " a speaker for the cinestar movie theater told the afp news agency .
the theater , which shows films in their original language and estimates that up to a third of its customers are english speaking , will also show previews for the remake of " the manchurian candidate , " due to open in germany on nov .

the subject of the film is a manipulated us election .
neutral , and not-so-neutral the potsdamer platz party was organized by the group " american voters abroad , " which says it is politically neutral .
no such claims are being made by a group called vote44 , which , according to its website , was created for the sole purpose of ousting george w. bush . along with large screen election-results viewing and live music , filmmaker wim wenders is expected to attend the vote44 party in berlin 's tränenpalast and show his latest movie , " land of plenty , " which takes a critical look at post-sept .
11 america .
along with the usual coverage , the satiric 1997 political movie " wag the dog " - about an administration that fabricates a war in order to cover up a presidential sex scandal - is on the menu at the election bash being thrown by the cologne amerika haus and the konrad adenauer foundation , between cologne and bonn .
this party , too , is set to end with an election breakfast at 6 a.m.
in hamburg , the tivoli theater on the famous reeperbahn nightlife strip will offer american drinks and popcorn to accompany its vote rebroadcasts .
under the motto " do n't spend this night alone , " the tivoli has come up with games to allow partygoers to bet on the outcome in certain states starting at 1 a.m.
in munich 's amerika haus , 800 guests are expected to attend the election night party , including the publisher of the influential die zeit weekly newspaper and other notable locals .
a huge number of people are scrambling for tickets , organizers of the fete say , since " without a ticket , no one gets in , " spokespeople said .
no fun for soldiers ?
while their numbers are diminishing , germany is still home to many us military compounds - full of people who are likely to be most immediately impacted by the election results .
but the bases are probably among the last bastions of chips-on-the-sofa style returns-watching .
spokespeople for the compounds in hanau , ramstein and schweinfurt explained that in an effort to maintain neturality , the military wo n't throw any parties to celebrate their country 's vote . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house the outcome of the race between george w. bush and john kerry will likely have effects on us-european relations .

when american troops marched into iraq without the support of the united nations and all of the nato allies , ties between germany and the us plummeted to an all-time post-war low .
a year later , iraq remains a touchstone of bilateral relations as discussions center around reconstruction and security efforts in the war-torn country .
but beyond iraq , questions about washington 's pre-emptive strike policy , the role of the united nations , climate control , the international court and free trade agreements continue to put the transatlantic partnership to the test .
as a result , politicians in germany have carefully avoided showing public preference for one of the us presidential candidates .
although many may echo the rest of the population in favoring john f. kerry , they have been cautious not to alienate bush .
no matter who the next leader of the united states is , german politicians are hoping for an improvement in diplomatic ties between the two countries during the next four years .
it may not be that easy though , and germany is likely to have to pay a price .
new responsibility for germany wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democrats union , cautioned that a change in us leadership could mean germany taking on greater responsibility .
" our demands for multilateral decision-making and a stronger partnership in transatlantic relations are entirely justified , " he said .
" but at the same time , we should also recognize that this also entails greater efforts on our side . "
" it 's absurd to believe that we can tell the americans what to do while we refuse to get involved , " schäuble said in the run-up to the us election on nov .

the party leader for the neo-liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , has said the promise of " rejuvenated and rebalanced ties " between germany and the united states will come at a price .
if kerry should win - as many in germany and europe hope is the case - the democratic president will place new demands on berlin .
" this must not necessarily mean that germany will be asked to send troops to iraq , " he said .
" but i expect that a greater role for the german military will indeed be among kerry 's plans for our involvement in other regional hot spots . "
the kerry conundrum many experts believe john kerry would indeed press chancellor schröder even harder than bush to join american efforts in iraq .
if that is the case , the german leader will find himself in an extremely difficult position torn between taking on more international responsibility on the one hand , and sending german troops to iraq - a scenario he has categorically rejected .
schröder 's advisor for transatlantic relations , karsten voigt , has said the chancellor will not rescind his opposition to military intervention .
" in spite of statements by kerry that he wants to involve his european partners more closely and even the likelihood that bush will approach europeans with a new initiative , we can not depart from our position that german troops will not be sent to iraq , no matter who will be the next president . "
redirecting the focus germany 's greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder 's government , have called for the next us president to put more focus on areas other than the fight against terrorism .
party co-leader claudia roth has said the new administration in washington needs to be more pro-active on environmental issues .
" it begins with taking on a greater role in global environmental policy , especially in the field of climate protection which has been entirely abandoned by the bush administration , " she said referring to the current president 's rejection of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
" other areas neglected by the united states are human rights and the international court , whose job it is to prosecute and punish gross violations of such rights . "

when american troops marched into iraq without the support of the united nations and all of the nato allies , ties between germany and the us plummeted to an all-time post-war low .
a year later , iraq remains a touchstone of bilateral relations as discussions center around reconstruction and security efforts in the war-torn country .
but beyond iraq , questions about washington 's pre-emptive strike policy , the role of the united nations , climate control , the international court and free trade agreements continue to put the transatlantic partnership to the test .
as a result , politicians in germany have carefully avoided showing public preference for one of the us presidential candidates .
although many may echo the rest of the population in favoring john f. kerry , they have been cautious not to alienate bush .
no matter who the next leader of the united states is , german politicians are hoping for an improvement in diplomatic ties between the two countries during the next four years .
it may not be that easy though , and germany is likely to have to pay a price .
new responsibility for germany wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democrats union , cautioned that a change in us leadership could mean germany taking on greater responsibility .
" our demands for multilateral decision-making and a stronger partnership in transatlantic relations are entirely justified , " he said .
" but at the same time , we should also recognize that this also entails greater efforts on our side . "
" it 's absurd to believe that we can tell the americans what to do while we refuse to get involved , " schäuble said in the run-up to the us election on nov .
2 .
the party leader for the neo-liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , has said the promise of " rejuvenated and rebalanced ties " between germany and the united states will come at a price .
if kerry should win - as many in germany and europe hope is the case - the democratic president will place new demands on berlin .
" this must not necessarily mean that germany will be asked to send troops to iraq , " he said .
" but i expect that a greater role for the german military will indeed be among kerry 's plans for our involvement in other regional hot spots . "
the kerry conundrum many experts believe john kerry would indeed press chancellor schröder even harder than bush to join american efforts in iraq .
if that is the case , the german leader will find himself in an extremely difficult position torn between taking on more international responsibility on the one hand , and sending german troops to iraq - a scenario he has categorically rejected .
schröder 's advisor for transatlantic relations , karsten voigt , has said the chancellor will not rescind his opposition to military intervention .
" in spite of statements by kerry that he wants to involve his european partners more closely and even the likelihood that bush will approach europeans with a new initiative , we can not depart from our position that german troops will not be sent to iraq , no matter who will be the next president . "
redirecting the focus germany 's greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder 's government , have called for the next us president to put more focus on areas other than the fight against terrorism .
party co-leader claudia roth has said the new administration in washington needs to be more pro-active on environmental issues .
" it begins with taking on a greater role in global environmental policy , especially in the field of climate protection which has been entirely abandoned by the bush administration , " she said referring to the current president 's rejection of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
" other areas neglected by the united states are human rights and the international court , whose job it is to prosecute and punish gross violations of such rights . "

an anti-german trick ?
the german press has blamed british media for initiating the rumors of the queen 's apology .
the daily die welt wrote , " this anti-german trick is a way of selling more newspapers . "

a controversial editorial published last week in the british tabloid daily mail by right-wing columnist simon heffer generated outrage in germany , where it received widespread coverage .

this will depend upon attitudes and actions in europe more than anything bush can or will do .
the anti-bush , anti-american feelings that rage in europe are the result of many layers of insecurity , inferiority , resentment , envy , fear and arrogance on the part of the citizens of europe .
only they can deal with these . - jl ronish , seattle , usa bild newspaper endorses bush as a us citizen , i 'm not particularly anxious for the support of the german people .
over the last 100 years , germans have demonstrated breathtaking ineptitude regarding world affairs .
as recently as 1972 , germans demonstrated their true colors when they surrendered the munich terrorists to the libyans .
neither germany nor france have ever been particularly reliable allies to the us , and both have preferred to spend too much money on their welfare states while relying on the us for military protection . - joe bowman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild came out strong for bush at the end of october .
support for bush is to be expected from a tabloid .
most tabloids i am aware of are owned by right-wing pro-business individuals .
i am thinking of the murdoch group , for instance .
unfortunately tabloids are influencial .
but in the case of bild , this paper 's opinion does not reflect the majority of german opinion . - serge i applaud bild for the courage to take a stand on this issue despite the fact that a clear majority of germans - and europeans - appear to despise this very principled man -lrb- bush -rrb- without just cause .

the united states will grow stronger economically , militarily and otherwise with the re-election of bush .
it 's unfortunate that the majority of germans are too foolish , too liberal that is , to realize that a strong u.s. is a good thing . - carl mahrenholz seems that the reporter is one of the few who has a cogent argument and does not let an antipathy toward bush cloud his judgment .
kerry will be weak on terrorism as a lot of presidents before him , which is the reason the terrorists became more and more emboldened ; the worst thing i see about kerry is that he ca n't make a decision -lrb- clinton could n't either -rrb- - one might not agree with bush 's decisions , but at least he has the guts to make them . - marga e. doerr bush 's record abroad i feel that the reason why bush has such large support in us is due to the privatized and unquestioning media that we are subjected to .
of the world 's media , 5 people own rougly 90 percent of it .
one of those people , rupert murdock , has been quoted as saying that he 'll do anything to have bush reelected .
this is obvious to anyone who has seen even a small amount of fox " news " .
i would like to see a more questioning media in this country . - brad ahrens , usa i believe absentee ballots cast by us voters overseas can make a difference in the election outcome .
furthermore , in allowing for votes to be cast in this fashion , the electoral process strengthens its ' credibility by ensuring that all citizens , regardless of their location , will have their say . - - vijay dasika somerset , nj , usa i am an american expatriate living in the philippines .
i have sent my absentee ballot , at no small expense , in to my state of residence by fedex because i did n't trust the postal system here .
i have no idea if my vote will actually be counted , but my feelings on this election are more intense than any election i have ever voted in .
living overseas i can see more clearly , than americans at home , the affect that president bush is having on the whole world in general and i think that he has impacted on the world in a more negative manner than a positive one .
i do n't doubt the president 's sincerity in what he is doing , but i do think he is on a totally wrong track and it is time for a change in american politics . - james r. beck-jensen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world has been following the race from a european perspective .

this will depend upon attitudes and actions in europe more than anything bush can or will do .
the anti-bush , anti-american feelings that rage in europe are the result of many layers of insecurity , inferiority , resentment , envy , fear and arrogance on the part of the citizens of europe .
only they can deal with these . - jl ronish , seattle , usa bild newspaper endorses bush as a us citizen , i 'm not particularly anxious for the support of the german people .
over the last 100 years , germans have demonstrated breathtaking ineptitude regarding world affairs .
as recently as 1972 , germans demonstrated their true colors when they surrendered the munich terrorists to the libyans .
neither germany nor france have ever been particularly reliable allies to the us , and both have preferred to spend too much money on their welfare states while relying on the us for military protection . - joe bowman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild came out strong for bush at the end of october .
support for bush is to be expected from a tabloid .
most tabloids i am aware of are owned by right-wing pro-business individuals .
i am thinking of the murdoch group , for instance .

it is clear that you have seen through all the rhetoric . - mark beck what a relief to read that there are still a few sound minds left in germany .

a vast majority of europeans are hoping for a change in the white house after the us election .
but while john kerry is the candidate of choice , would a democratic administration be the best thing for us-german relations ? us presidential candidate john kerry enjoys great popularity in europe .
in germany , the massachusetts senator commands an overwhelming majority in opinion polls , with almost 80 percent in favor of the democrat . but while the german public favors a change in the white house , deriving mostly from distaste for incumbent george w. bush 's policies , would a kerry administration be the best thing for us-european and , in particular , us-german , relations ? kerry speaks five languages , including fluent french .
he went to school in switzerland .
he takes his vacations in france and has a european-born wife , teresa heinz kerry . jackson janes of the institute for contemporary german studies in washington admitted these were good credentials for a future president .
but he has reservations that these qualities will bring about a white house more endeared to europe . kerry would neither be the opposite of bush nor would he reform us foreign policy to engage with and consider the interests and ideas of europe , janes said .
" this is complete nonsense , " he told german public tv broadcaster ard 's " tagesschau " news program .
" all this friction which is here today , will still be there . " this friction comes in many guises : the bush white house 's refusal to back the kyoto protocol and the international criminal court , us policy in the middle east and israel , the american insistence on the right to defend its own security by force - pre-emptive or preventative - if necessary . different president , same problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry all these points of contention certainly would n't not be resolved from one day to the next ; president kerry would still face the same problems and issues that president bush did .
but a better atmosphere would likely be created if the reins of power were handed over to the democrat . however , it could also lead to more problems than solutions in germany - foremost among them being iraq . if the democratic challenger is elected , his campaign pledge to create a stronger coalition and alliance in iraq could take on contentious and even unsettling dimensions for some european countries , according to us ambassador to germany daniel coats in the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday . " senator kerry has indicated he would ask -lrb- for troops -rrb- , so that 's going to produce some difficult questions and some tensions here between the us and germany - if that happens , " coats told the paper . similar tensions over german stance on iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder chancellor gerhard schröder angered bush during campaigning for the german general elections in sept .
2002 when he vehemently opposed any military " adventure " in iraq .
subsequently , schröder has refused to send any troops to the war-torn country , but germany is helping train iraqi military officers and police outside the country . speaking during campaigning on oct .
5 , kerry acknowledged that foreign powers would not " trade their young for our young in body-bags , " but he said he would be able to get them involved in missions like securing iraq 's borders .
" those borders have become a sieve for weapons of mass destruction and those weapons of mass destruction are terrorists that are crossing them and coming in and blowing themselves up in cars , " he said . kerry added that the current administration had no credibility to enlist us allies .
" every step of the way these folks have pushed them away , " he said .
" what i will do is bring new credibility , a fresh start . " sticky situation for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops in iraq would be on any agenda for germany and a new president .
that could put schröder in a difficult position .
berlin would consider a kerry administration friendly , and germany would be one of the first stops for a new president .
but if that visit included a call for military support in iraq , a potential thawing of relations could quickly turn icy again and a new friend could be swiftly alienated . if , on the other hand , schröder changes track for the new administration , the german chancellor would face outrage at home that could have a decisive influence on his own chances for re-election in 2006 . jackson janes contended that kerry would not demand a troop deployment from schröder .
" i do not believe that he expects germany to send troops to iraq .
but i believe he would expect development aid .
and much more than germany has provided up to now , " janes told german television . re-election less demanding for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president george w. bush bush 's re-election , however , would likely just lead to a continuation of the animosity between the two governments . " i can not imagine that bush would say : what i have done during the first four years was a mistake .
on the contrary , " said janes .
re-election , he believes , would be seen as endorsement of the first term and justification for the way the us treats the europeans . either way , the result and the future of us-european relations lies in the hands of american voters , and it will surely be a challenge for all european countries , regardless of whether bush or kerry wins . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house the outcome of the race between george w. bush and john kerry will likely have effects on us-european relations .

this will depend upon attitudes and actions in europe more than anything bush can or will do .
the anti-bush , anti-american feelings that rage in europe are the result of many layers of insecurity , inferiority , resentment , envy , fear and arrogance on the part of the citizens of europe .
only they can deal with these . - jl ronish , seattle , usa bild newspaper endorses bush as a us citizen , i 'm not particularly anxious for the support of the german people .
over the last 100 years , germans have demonstrated breathtaking ineptitude regarding world affairs .
as recently as 1972 , germans demonstrated their true colors when they surrendered the munich terrorists to the libyans .
neither germany nor france have ever been particularly reliable allies to the us , and both have preferred to spend too much money on their welfare states while relying on the us for military protection . - joe bowman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild came out strong for bush at the end of october .
support for bush is to be expected from a tabloid .
most tabloids i am aware of are owned by right-wing pro-business individuals .
i am thinking of the murdoch group , for instance .
unfortunately tabloids are influencial .
but in the case of bild , this paper 's opinion does not reflect the majority of german opinion . - serge i applaud bild for the courage to take a stand on this issue despite the fact that a clear majority of germans - and europeans - appear to despise this very principled man -lrb- bush -rrb- without just cause .
it is clear that you have seen through all the rhetoric . - mark beck what a relief to read that there are still a few sound minds left in germany .
i 'm referring to bild 's endorsement of george bush for president .
the united states will grow stronger economically , militarily and otherwise with the re-election of bush .
it 's unfortunate that the majority of germans are too foolish , too liberal that is , to realize that a strong u.s. is a good thing . - carl mahrenholz seems that the reporter is one of the few who has a cogent argument and does not let an antipathy toward bush cloud his judgment .
kerry will be weak on terrorism as a lot of presidents before him , which is the reason the terrorists became more and more emboldened ; the worst thing i see about kerry is that he ca n't make a decision -lrb- clinton could n't either -rrb- - one might not agree with bush 's decisions , but at least he has the guts to make them . - marga e. doerr bush 's record abroad i feel that the reason why bush has such large support in us is due to the privatized and unquestioning media that we are subjected to .
of the world 's media , 5 people own rougly 90 percent of it .
one of those people , rupert murdock , has been quoted as saying that he 'll do anything to have bush reelected .
this is obvious to anyone who has seen even a small amount of fox " news " .
i would like to see a more questioning media in this country . - brad ahrens , usa i believe absentee ballots cast by us voters overseas can make a difference in the election outcome .
furthermore , in allowing for votes to be cast in this fashion , the electoral process strengthens its ' credibility by ensuring that all citizens , regardless of their location , will have their say . - - vijay dasika somerset , nj , usa i am an american expatriate living in the philippines .
i have sent my absentee ballot , at no small expense , in to my state of residence by fedex because i did n't trust the postal system here .
i have no idea if my vote will actually be counted , but my feelings on this election are more intense than any election i have ever voted in .
living overseas i can see more clearly , than americans at home , the affect that president bush is having on the whole world in general and i think that he has impacted on the world in a more negative manner than a positive one .
i do n't doubt the president 's sincerity in what he is doing , but i do think he is on a totally wrong track and it is time for a change in american politics . - james r. beck-jensen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world has been following the race from a european perspective .
read about how the results could influence us-european relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house bild backs bush an overwhelming case for germany ? former us treasurer campaigns for kerry kerry 's sister gets out the vote in europe current affairs -pipe- 02.11.2004 what does the us vote mean for germany ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would swapping presidents just put a new face on old problems ?
a vast majority of europeans are hoping for a change in the white house after the us election .
but while john kerry is the candidate of choice , would a democratic administration be the best thing for us-german relations ? us presidential candidate john kerry enjoys great popularity in europe .
in germany , the massachusetts senator commands an overwhelming majority in opinion polls , with almost 80 percent in favor of the democrat . but while the german public favors a change in the white house , deriving mostly from distaste for incumbent george w. bush 's policies , would a kerry administration be the best thing for us-european and , in particular , us-german , relations ? kerry speaks five languages , including fluent french .
he went to school in switzerland .
he takes his vacations in france and has a european-born wife , teresa heinz kerry . jackson janes of the institute for contemporary german studies in washington admitted these were good credentials for a future president .
but he has reservations that these qualities will bring about a white house more endeared to europe . kerry would neither be the opposite of bush nor would he reform us foreign policy to engage with and consider the interests and ideas of europe , janes said .
" this is complete nonsense , " he told german public tv broadcaster ard 's " tagesschau " news program .
" all this friction which is here today , will still be there . " this friction comes in many guises : the bush white house 's refusal to back the kyoto protocol and the international criminal court , us policy in the middle east and israel , the american insistence on the right to defend its own security by force - pre-emptive or preventative - if necessary . different president , same problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry all these points of contention certainly would n't not be resolved from one day to the next ; president kerry would still face the same problems and issues that president bush did .
but a better atmosphere would likely be created if the reins of power were handed over to the democrat . however , it could also lead to more problems than solutions in germany - foremost among them being iraq . if the democratic challenger is elected , his campaign pledge to create a stronger coalition and alliance in iraq could take on contentious and even unsettling dimensions for some european countries , according to us ambassador to germany daniel coats in the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday . " senator kerry has indicated he would ask -lrb- for troops -rrb- , so that 's going to produce some difficult questions and some tensions here between the us and germany - if that happens , " coats told the paper . similar tensions over german stance on iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder chancellor gerhard schröder angered bush during campaigning for the german general elections in sept .
2002 when he vehemently opposed any military " adventure " in iraq .
subsequently , schröder has refused to send any troops to the war-torn country , but germany is helping train iraqi military officers and police outside the country . speaking during campaigning on oct .
5 , kerry acknowledged that foreign powers would not " trade their young for our young in body-bags , " but he said he would be able to get them involved in missions like securing iraq 's borders .
" those borders have become a sieve for weapons of mass destruction and those weapons of mass destruction are terrorists that are crossing them and coming in and blowing themselves up in cars , " he said . kerry added that the current administration had no credibility to enlist us allies .
" every step of the way these folks have pushed them away , " he said .
" what i will do is bring new credibility , a fresh start . " sticky situation for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops in iraq would be on any agenda for germany and a new president .
that could put schröder in a difficult position .
berlin would consider a kerry administration friendly , and germany would be one of the first stops for a new president .
but if that visit included a call for military support in iraq , a potential thawing of relations could quickly turn icy again and a new friend could be swiftly alienated . if , on the other hand , schröder changes track for the new administration , the german chancellor would face outrage at home that could have a decisive influence on his own chances for re-election in 2006 . jackson janes contended that kerry would not demand a troop deployment from schröder .
" i do not believe that he expects germany to send troops to iraq .
but i believe he would expect development aid .
and much more than germany has provided up to now , " janes told german television . re-election less demanding for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president george w. bush bush 's re-election , however , would likely just lead to a continuation of the animosity between the two governments . " i can not imagine that bush would say : what i have done during the first four years was a mistake .
on the contrary , " said janes .
re-election , he believes , would be seen as endorsement of the first term and justification for the way the us treats the europeans . either way , the result and the future of us-european relations lies in the hands of american voters , and it will surely be a challenge for all european countries , regardless of whether bush or kerry wins . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house the outcome of the race between george w. bush and john kerry will likely have effects on us-european relations .

a vast majority of europeans are hoping for a change in the white house after the us election .
but while john kerry is the candidate of choice , would a democratic administration be the best thing for us-german relations ? us presidential candidate john kerry enjoys great popularity in europe .
in germany , the massachusetts senator commands an overwhelming majority in opinion polls , with almost 80 percent in favor of the democrat . but while the german public favors a change in the white house , deriving mostly from distaste for incumbent george w. bush 's policies , would a kerry administration be the best thing for us-european and , in particular , us-german , relations ? kerry speaks five languages , including fluent french .

he takes his vacations in france and has a european-born wife , teresa heinz kerry . jackson janes of the institute for contemporary german studies in washington admitted these were good credentials for a future president .
but he has reservations that these qualities will bring about a white house more endeared to europe . kerry would neither be the opposite of bush nor would he reform us foreign policy to engage with and consider the interests and ideas of europe , janes said .
" this is complete nonsense , " he told german public tv broadcaster ard 's " tagesschau " news program .
" all this friction which is here today , will still be there .

a vast majority of europeans are hoping for a change in the white house after the us election .
but while john kerry is the candidate of choice , would a democratic administration be the best thing for us-german relations ? us presidential candidate john kerry enjoys great popularity in europe .
in germany , the massachusetts senator commands an overwhelming majority in opinion polls , with almost 80 percent in favor of the democrat . but while the german public favors a change in the white house , deriving mostly from distaste for incumbent george w. bush 's policies , would a kerry administration be the best thing for us-european and , in particular , us-german , relations ? kerry speaks five languages , including fluent french .
he went to school in switzerland .
he takes his vacations in france and has a european-born wife , teresa heinz kerry . jackson janes of the institute for contemporary german studies in washington admitted these were good credentials for a future president .
but he has reservations that these qualities will bring about a white house more endeared to europe . kerry would neither be the opposite of bush nor would he reform us foreign policy to engage with and consider the interests and ideas of europe , janes said .
" this is complete nonsense , " he told german public tv broadcaster ard 's " tagesschau " news program .
" all this friction which is here today , will still be there . " this friction comes in many guises : the bush white house 's refusal to back the kyoto protocol and the international criminal court , us policy in the middle east and israel , the american insistence on the right to defend its own security by force - pre-emptive or preventative - if necessary . different president , same problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry all these points of contention certainly would n't not be resolved from one day to the next ; president kerry would still face the same problems and issues that president bush did .
but a better atmosphere would likely be created if the reins of power were handed over to the democrat . however , it could also lead to more problems than solutions in germany - foremost among them being iraq . if the democratic challenger is elected , his campaign pledge to create a stronger coalition and alliance in iraq could take on contentious and even unsettling dimensions for some european countries , according to us ambassador to germany daniel coats in the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday . " senator kerry has indicated he would ask -lrb- for troops -rrb- , so that 's going to produce some difficult questions and some tensions here between the us and germany - if that happens , " coats told the paper . similar tensions over german stance on iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder chancellor gerhard schröder angered bush during campaigning for the german general elections in sept .
2002 when he vehemently opposed any military " adventure " in iraq .
subsequently , schröder has refused to send any troops to the war-torn country , but germany is helping train iraqi military officers and police outside the country . speaking during campaigning on oct .
5 , kerry acknowledged that foreign powers would not " trade their young for our young in body-bags , " but he said he would be able to get them involved in missions like securing iraq 's borders .
" those borders have become a sieve for weapons of mass destruction and those weapons of mass destruction are terrorists that are crossing them and coming in and blowing themselves up in cars , " he said . kerry added that the current administration had no credibility to enlist us allies .
" every step of the way these folks have pushed them away , " he said .
" what i will do is bring new credibility , a fresh start . " sticky situation for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops in iraq would be on any agenda for germany and a new president .
that could put schröder in a difficult position .
berlin would consider a kerry administration friendly , and germany would be one of the first stops for a new president .
but if that visit included a call for military support in iraq , a potential thawing of relations could quickly turn icy again and a new friend could be swiftly alienated . if , on the other hand , schröder changes track for the new administration , the german chancellor would face outrage at home that could have a decisive influence on his own chances for re-election in 2006 . jackson janes contended that kerry would not demand a troop deployment from schröder .
" i do not believe that he expects germany to send troops to iraq .
but i believe he would expect development aid .
and much more than germany has provided up to now , " janes told german television . re-election less demanding for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president george w. bush bush 's re-election , however , would likely just lead to a continuation of the animosity between the two governments . " i can not imagine that bush would say : what i have done during the first four years was a mistake .
on the contrary , " said janes .
re-election , he believes , would be seen as endorsement of the first term and justification for the way the us treats the europeans . either way , the result and the future of us-european relations lies in the hands of american voters , and it will surely be a challenge for all european countries , regardless of whether bush or kerry wins . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house the outcome of the race between george w. bush and john kerry will likely have effects on us-european relations .

but either way , the place to be in germany this week is at one of the many election parties being held in cities around the country . once upon a time , watching the us presidential election coverage in europe was a low-key affair .
maybe some international friends got together and hung out on someone 's living room couch , cracked open a bag of chips and watched cnn .
or maybe they got a good night 's sleep and picked up the returns from the local broadcasters in the morning .
but the days of casual returns watching are gone , along with any traces of indifference about who wins the white house on nov .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate sen. john kerry rarely has a us election been so important to so many people , in europe as well as in the united states .

cet -rrb- , major cities in germany will host a number of election parties both private and public .
and to help make it easier to wait through long hours of state-by-state polling results , most of the parties have been jazzed up with political-themed entertainment .
at what may turn out to be the biggest party , on berlin 's central potsdamer platz , monitors are being set up to broadcast election coverage starting at 11:30 p.m. local time .
several hundred night owls are expected to come and watch the returns while enjoying american snacks and live music .

when american troops marched into iraq without the support of the united nations and all of the nato allies , ties between germany and the us plummeted to an all-time post-war low .
a year later , iraq remains a touchstone of bilateral relations as discussions center around reconstruction and security efforts in the war-torn country .
but beyond iraq , questions about washington 's pre-emptive strike policy , the role of the united nations , climate control , the international court and free trade agreements continue to put the transatlantic partnership to the test .
as a result , politicians in germany have carefully avoided showing public preference for one of the us presidential candidates .
although many may echo the rest of the population in favoring john f. kerry , they have been cautious not to alienate bush .
no matter who the next leader of the united states is , german politicians are hoping for an improvement in diplomatic ties between the two countries during the next four years .
it may not be that easy though , and germany is likely to have to pay a price .
new responsibility for germany wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democrats union , cautioned that a change in us leadership could mean germany taking on greater responsibility .
" our demands for multilateral decision-making and a stronger partnership in transatlantic relations are entirely justified , " he said .
" but at the same time , we should also recognize that this also entails greater efforts on our side . "
" it 's absurd to believe that we can tell the americans what to do while we refuse to get involved , " schäuble said in the run-up to the us election on nov .
2 .
the party leader for the neo-liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , has said the promise of " rejuvenated and rebalanced ties " between germany and the united states will come at a price .
if kerry should win - as many in germany and europe hope is the case - the democratic president will place new demands on berlin .
" this must not necessarily mean that germany will be asked to send troops to iraq , " he said .
" but i expect that a greater role for the german military will indeed be among kerry 's plans for our involvement in other regional hot spots . "
the kerry conundrum many experts believe john kerry would indeed press chancellor schröder even harder than bush to join american efforts in iraq .
if that is the case , the german leader will find himself in an extremely difficult position torn between taking on more international responsibility on the one hand , and sending german troops to iraq - a scenario he has categorically rejected .
schröder 's advisor for transatlantic relations , karsten voigt , has said the chancellor will not rescind his opposition to military intervention .
" in spite of statements by kerry that he wants to involve his european partners more closely and even the likelihood that bush will approach europeans with a new initiative , we can not depart from our position that german troops will not be sent to iraq , no matter who will be the next president . "
redirecting the focus germany 's greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder 's government , have called for the next us president to put more focus on areas other than the fight against terrorism .
party co-leader claudia roth has said the new administration in washington needs to be more pro-active on environmental issues .
" it begins with taking on a greater role in global environmental policy , especially in the field of climate protection which has been entirely abandoned by the bush administration , " she said referring to the current president 's rejection of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
" other areas neglected by the united states are human rights and the international court , whose job it is to prosecute and punish gross violations of such rights . "

when american troops marched into iraq without the support of the united nations and all of the nato allies , ties between germany and the us plummeted to an all-time post-war low .
a year later , iraq remains a touchstone of bilateral relations as discussions center around reconstruction and security efforts in the war-torn country .
but beyond iraq , questions about washington 's pre-emptive strike policy , the role of the united nations , climate control , the international court and free trade agreements continue to put the transatlantic partnership to the test .
as a result , politicians in germany have carefully avoided showing public preference for one of the us presidential candidates .
although many may echo the rest of the population in favoring john f. kerry , they have been cautious not to alienate bush .
no matter who the next leader of the united states is , german politicians are hoping for an improvement in diplomatic ties between the two countries during the next four years .
it may not be that easy though , and germany is likely to have to pay a price .
new responsibility for germany wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democrats union , cautioned that a change in us leadership could mean germany taking on greater responsibility .
" our demands for multilateral decision-making and a stronger partnership in transatlantic relations are entirely justified , " he said .
" but at the same time , we should also recognize that this also entails greater efforts on our side . "
" it 's absurd to believe that we can tell the americans what to do while we refuse to get involved , " schäuble said in the run-up to the us election on nov .

the party leader for the neo-liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , has said the promise of " rejuvenated and rebalanced ties " between germany and the united states will come at a price .
if kerry should win - as many in germany and europe hope is the case - the democratic president will place new demands on berlin .
" this must not necessarily mean that germany will be asked to send troops to iraq , " he said .
" but i expect that a greater role for the german military will indeed be among kerry 's plans for our involvement in other regional hot spots . "
the kerry conundrum many experts believe john kerry would indeed press chancellor schröder even harder than bush to join american efforts in iraq .
if that is the case , the german leader will find himself in an extremely difficult position torn between taking on more international responsibility on the one hand , and sending german troops to iraq - a scenario he has categorically rejected .
schröder 's advisor for transatlantic relations , karsten voigt , has said the chancellor will not rescind his opposition to military intervention .
" in spite of statements by kerry that he wants to involve his european partners more closely and even the likelihood that bush will approach europeans with a new initiative , we can not depart from our position that german troops will not be sent to iraq , no matter who will be the next president . "
redirecting the focus germany 's greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder 's government , have called for the next us president to put more focus on areas other than the fight against terrorism .
party co-leader claudia roth has said the new administration in washington needs to be more pro-active on environmental issues .
" it begins with taking on a greater role in global environmental policy , especially in the field of climate protection which has been entirely abandoned by the bush administration , " she said referring to the current president 's rejection of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
" other areas neglected by the united states are human rights and the international court , whose job it is to prosecute and punish gross violations of such rights . "

" hoping to further reconciliation between britain and germany , queen elizabeth called on the two former world war ii foes to learn from history but not be obsessed by the past .
addressing dignitaries in the german capital on tuesday , the british monarch emphasized her country 's current ties with germany and the success of their modern-day partnerships in nato and the european union .
" in remembering the appalling suffering of war on both sides , we recognize how precious is the peace we have built in europe since 1945 , " the 78-year-old queen said at a state banquet attended by german president horst köhler , among others .

2 , 2004 .
" we owe it to those who built the partnership to continue the process into the 21st century : to learn from history and not be obsessed by it , to look beyond simplistic stereotypes to realize how often we share the same outlook , " she said .
no apology for bombings queen elizabeth 's three-day visit to germany had been overshadowed by press speculation that she would use the trip to apologize for the allied bombing raid on dresden during world war ii .
however , buckingham palace said germany had made no official request for an apology and german chancellor gerhard schröder said he had told the queen shortly after her arrival that the debate had been " absurd . "
" britain has played a conciliatory role " in improving relations between the two countries , schröder said .
calls for a royal apology circulated in british and german newspapers last week after it became known that the queen planned to attend a benefit concert for the rebuilding of dresden 's historic frauenkirche on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : built in 1738 and completely destroyed in 1945 , dresden 's baroque frauenkirche is being completely restored .
the british monarchy has played a leading role in raising funds for restoring the baroque church - considered one of the most beautiful in europe .
so far some 93 million euros -lrb- $ 118 million -rrb- have been collected .
in june , the duke of kent attended a ceremony to mark the lifting of a new gilded cross atop the church steeple .
an anti-german trick ?
the german press has blamed british media for initiating the rumors of the queen 's apology .
the daily die welt wrote , " this anti-german trick is a way of selling more newspapers . "
" an apology by the queen would be a disservice to british-german relations , it would release animosities that have been kept in check by the very fact that each side has learned to deal with the past in its own way , " the berlin-based paper said .
a controversial editorial published last week in the british tabloid daily mail by right-wing columnist simon heffer generated outrage in germany , where it received widespread coverage .
entitled " sorry , the germans must never be allowed to forget their evil past , " heffer rejected the notion of an apology and accused the germans of trying to " rewrite history . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de just do n't mention the war ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .

the german press has blamed british media for initiating the rumors of the queen 's apology .
the daily die welt wrote , " this anti-german trick is a way of selling more newspapers . "

this will depend upon attitudes and actions in europe more than anything bush can or will do .
the anti-bush , anti-american feelings that rage in europe are the result of many layers of insecurity , inferiority , resentment , envy , fear and arrogance on the part of the citizens of europe .
only they can deal with these . - jl ronish , seattle , usa bild newspaper endorses bush as a us citizen , i 'm not particularly anxious for the support of the german people .
over the last 100 years , germans have demonstrated breathtaking ineptitude regarding world affairs .
as recently as 1972 , germans demonstrated their true colors when they surrendered the munich terrorists to the libyans .
neither germany nor france have ever been particularly reliable allies to the us , and both have preferred to spend too much money on their welfare states while relying on the us for military protection . - joe bowman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild came out strong for bush at the end of october .
support for bush is to be expected from a tabloid .
most tabloids i am aware of are owned by right-wing pro-business individuals .
i am thinking of the murdoch group , for instance .
unfortunately tabloids are influencial .
but in the case of bild , this paper 's opinion does not reflect the majority of german opinion . - serge i applaud bild for the courage to take a stand on this issue despite the fact that a clear majority of germans - and europeans - appear to despise this very principled man -lrb- bush -rrb- without just cause .
it is clear that you have seen through all the rhetoric . - mark beck what a relief to read that there are still a few sound minds left in germany .
i 'm referring to bild 's endorsement of george bush for president .
the united states will grow stronger economically , militarily and otherwise with the re-election of bush .
it 's unfortunate that the majority of germans are too foolish , too liberal that is , to realize that a strong u.s. is a good thing . - carl mahrenholz seems that the reporter is one of the few who has a cogent argument and does not let an antipathy toward bush cloud his judgment .
kerry will be weak on terrorism as a lot of presidents before him , which is the reason the terrorists became more and more emboldened ; the worst thing i see about kerry is that he ca n't make a decision -lrb- clinton could n't either -rrb- - one might not agree with bush 's decisions , but at least he has the guts to make them . - marga e. doerr bush 's record abroad i feel that the reason why bush has such large support in us is due to the privatized and unquestioning media that we are subjected to .
of the world 's media , 5 people own rougly 90 percent of it .
one of those people , rupert murdock , has been quoted as saying that he 'll do anything to have bush reelected .
this is obvious to anyone who has seen even a small amount of fox " news " .
i would like to see a more questioning media in this country . - brad ahrens , usa i believe absentee ballots cast by us voters overseas can make a difference in the election outcome .
furthermore , in allowing for votes to be cast in this fashion , the electoral process strengthens its ' credibility by ensuring that all citizens , regardless of their location , will have their say . - - vijay dasika somerset , nj , usa i am an american expatriate living in the philippines .
i have sent my absentee ballot , at no small expense , in to my state of residence by fedex because i did n't trust the postal system here .
i have no idea if my vote will actually be counted , but my feelings on this election are more intense than any election i have ever voted in .
living overseas i can see more clearly , than americans at home , the affect that president bush is having on the whole world in general and i think that he has impacted on the world in a more negative manner than a positive one .
i do n't doubt the president 's sincerity in what he is doing , but i do think he is on a totally wrong track and it is time for a change in american politics . - james r. beck-jensen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world has been following the race from a european perspective .

this will depend upon attitudes and actions in europe more than anything bush can or will do .
the anti-bush , anti-american feelings that rage in europe are the result of many layers of insecurity , inferiority , resentment , envy , fear and arrogance on the part of the citizens of europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.11.2004 opinion : will ukraine choose russia or the west ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich is backed by the outgoing president ukraine 's presidential race between viktor yanukovich and liberal opposition candidate viktor yushchenko is neck-and-neck .
dw 's ute schaeffer weighs up the options . as ukraine decides either to deepen ties with moscow or pursue the liberal policies of its western neighbors , early results monday showed current prime minister yanukovich is just one percent ahead of his reformist challenger . an ugly campaign the ukrainian electorate was determined not to be compromised .
a bitter campaign of political mud-slinging and recrimination was not enough to deter the voters from casting their ballots in what could prove to be a critical poll for the former soviet state . they kept their eye firmly on the broader picture , unshaken as the opposition accused the media of a pro-yanukovich bias and supporters of the establishment 's candidate claimed that western-leaning yushchenko was in cahoots with both the cia and radical nationalistic groups . a divided country the two candidates represent two ends of ukraine 's political spectrum .
prime minister yanukovich , backed by moscow and voters in the russian-speaking industrial east , wants to strengthen the centralist power of the state , while yushchenko stands for liberal economics and social reform . the outcome of sunday 's election shows how precarious ukraine 's future is .
in many respects , it 's a divided country .
many of the younger generation have studied or worked abroad .
today , they 're increasingly alienated from low-income and elderly voters , who can still remember the days of soviet rule , when life was predictable and economically secure . not surprisingly , the western part of the country - which borders poland and therefore the eu - proved to be a yushchenko stronghold . more suprisingly , sunday 's outcome suggested the " establishment candidate " yanukovich failed to win over the country 's elite .
up to 75 percent of voters in the capital came out in support of the opposition .
as the downfall of the soviet union fourteen years ago proved , leadership that lacks the backing of the elite is clearly losing ground . crucial factors the run-off next month will undoubtedly be decided by what now happens behind the scenes . outgoing president leonid kuchma will want to know how much he can rely on yanukovich , were he to remain in office .
and the oligarchs may switch sides and decide to back yushchenko .
its questions like these that will influence the results of the run-off .
other crucial factors include the possibility that yanukovich again raises pensions and public sector wages .
the country 's communists and radical left may also prove critical .
will they choose west-leaning yushchenko or russia-oriented yanukovich ? flawed democracy according to ukrainian writer andrey kurkow , the country still lacks a truly democratic candidate .
it would be naïve to see the presidential race as a battle between traditionalists and reformers .
viktor yushchenko 's base includes plenty of non-democratic elements , and if he assumes office , he will have to make inevitable concessions . nonetheless , during his term as prime minister five years ago , yushchenko demonstrated that he acknowledges the nation 's ties to russia while believing in social justice and understanding how to prompt market reforms .
under his leadership , ukraine might not become a flawless democracy , but the country would get its best shot at gradual , lasting change . ute schaeffer -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stand-off in ukrainian election early results from sunday 's presidential election in ukraine point to a run-off vote next month between the two main candidates for president .

this will depend upon attitudes and actions in europe more than anything bush can or will do .
the anti-bush , anti-american feelings that rage in europe are the result of many layers of insecurity , inferiority , resentment , envy , fear and arrogance on the part of the citizens of europe .
only they can deal with these . - jl ronish , seattle , usa bild newspaper endorses bush as a us citizen , i 'm not particularly anxious for the support of the german people .
over the last 100 years , germans have demonstrated breathtaking ineptitude regarding world affairs .
as recently as 1972 , germans demonstrated their true colors when they surrendered the munich terrorists to the libyans .
neither germany nor france have ever been particularly reliable allies to the us , and both have preferred to spend too much money on their welfare states while relying on the us for military protection . - joe bowman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild came out strong for bush at the end of october .
support for bush is to be expected from a tabloid .
most tabloids i am aware of are owned by right-wing pro-business individuals .
i am thinking of the murdoch group , for instance .
unfortunately tabloids are influencial .
but in the case of bild , this paper 's opinion does not reflect the majority of german opinion . - serge i applaud bild for the courage to take a stand on this issue despite the fact that a clear majority of germans - and europeans - appear to despise this very principled man -lrb- bush -rrb- without just cause .
it is clear that you have seen through all the rhetoric . - mark beck what a relief to read that there are still a few sound minds left in germany .
i 'm referring to bild 's endorsement of george bush for president .
the united states will grow stronger economically , militarily and otherwise with the re-election of bush .
it 's unfortunate that the majority of germans are too foolish , too liberal that is , to realize that a strong u.s. is a good thing . - carl mahrenholz seems that the reporter is one of the few who has a cogent argument and does not let an antipathy toward bush cloud his judgment .
kerry will be weak on terrorism as a lot of presidents before him , which is the reason the terrorists became more and more emboldened ; the worst thing i see about kerry is that he ca n't make a decision -lrb- clinton could n't either -rrb- - one might not agree with bush 's decisions , but at least he has the guts to make them . - marga e. doerr bush 's record abroad i feel that the reason why bush has such large support in us is due to the privatized and unquestioning media that we are subjected to .
of the world 's media , 5 people own rougly 90 percent of it .
one of those people , rupert murdock , has been quoted as saying that he 'll do anything to have bush reelected .
this is obvious to anyone who has seen even a small amount of fox " news " .
i would like to see a more questioning media in this country . - brad ahrens , usa i believe absentee ballots cast by us voters overseas can make a difference in the election outcome .
furthermore , in allowing for votes to be cast in this fashion , the electoral process strengthens its ' credibility by ensuring that all citizens , regardless of their location , will have their say . - - vijay dasika somerset , nj , usa i am an american expatriate living in the philippines .
i have sent my absentee ballot , at no small expense , in to my state of residence by fedex because i did n't trust the postal system here .
i have no idea if my vote will actually be counted , but my feelings on this election are more intense than any election i have ever voted in .
living overseas i can see more clearly , than americans at home , the affect that president bush is having on the whole world in general and i think that he has impacted on the world in a more negative manner than a positive one .
i do n't doubt the president 's sincerity in what he is doing , but i do think he is on a totally wrong track and it is time for a change in american politics . - james r. beck-jensen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world has been following the race from a european perspective .

this will depend upon attitudes and actions in europe more than anything bush can or will do .
the anti-bush , anti-american feelings that rage in europe are the result of many layers of insecurity , inferiority , resentment , envy , fear and arrogance on the part of the citizens of europe .
only they can deal with these . - jl ronish , seattle , usa bild newspaper endorses bush as a us citizen , i 'm not particularly anxious for the support of the german people .
over the last 100 years , germans have demonstrated breathtaking ineptitude regarding world affairs .
as recently as 1972 , germans demonstrated their true colors when they surrendered the munich terrorists to the libyans .
neither germany nor france have ever been particularly reliable allies to the us , and both have preferred to spend too much money on their welfare states while relying on the us for military protection . - joe bowman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild came out strong for bush at the end of october .
support for bush is to be expected from a tabloid .
most tabloids i am aware of are owned by right-wing pro-business individuals .
i am thinking of the murdoch group , for instance .
unfortunately tabloids are influencial .
but in the case of bild , this paper 's opinion does not reflect the majority of german opinion . - serge i applaud bild for the courage to take a stand on this issue despite the fact that a clear majority of germans - and europeans - appear to despise this very principled man -lrb- bush -rrb- without just cause .
it is clear that you have seen through all the rhetoric . - mark beck what a relief to read that there are still a few sound minds left in germany .
i 'm referring to bild 's endorsement of george bush for president .
the united states will grow stronger economically , militarily and otherwise with the re-election of bush .
it 's unfortunate that the majority of germans are too foolish , too liberal that is , to realize that a strong u.s. is a good thing . - carl mahrenholz seems that the reporter is one of the few who has a cogent argument and does not let an antipathy toward bush cloud his judgment .
kerry will be weak on terrorism as a lot of presidents before him , which is the reason the terrorists became more and more emboldened ; the worst thing i see about kerry is that he ca n't make a decision -lrb- clinton could n't either -rrb- - one might not agree with bush 's decisions , but at least he has the guts to make them . - marga e. doerr bush 's record abroad i feel that the reason why bush has such large support in us is due to the privatized and unquestioning media that we are subjected to .
of the world 's media , 5 people own rougly 90 percent of it .

when american troops marched into iraq without the support of the united nations and all of the nato allies , ties between germany and the us plummeted to an all-time post-war low .
a year later , iraq remains a touchstone of bilateral relations as discussions center around reconstruction and security efforts in the war-torn country .
but beyond iraq , questions about washington 's pre-emptive strike policy , the role of the united nations , climate control , the international court and free trade agreements continue to put the transatlantic partnership to the test .
as a result , politicians in germany have carefully avoided showing public preference for one of the us presidential candidates .
although many may echo the rest of the population in favoring john f. kerry , they have been cautious not to alienate bush .
no matter who the next leader of the united states is , german politicians are hoping for an improvement in diplomatic ties between the two countries during the next four years .
it may not be that easy though , and germany is likely to have to pay a price .
new responsibility for germany wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democrats union , cautioned that a change in us leadership could mean germany taking on greater responsibility .
" our demands for multilateral decision-making and a stronger partnership in transatlantic relations are entirely justified , " he said .
" but at the same time , we should also recognize that this also entails greater efforts on our side . "

the party leader for the neo-liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , has said the promise of " rejuvenated and rebalanced ties " between germany and the united states will come at a price .
if kerry should win - as many in germany and europe hope is the case - the democratic president will place new demands on berlin .
" this must not necessarily mean that germany will be asked to send troops to iraq , " he said .
" but i expect that a greater role for the german military will indeed be among kerry 's plans for our involvement in other regional hot spots . "
the kerry conundrum many experts believe john kerry would indeed press chancellor schröder even harder than bush to join american efforts in iraq .
if that is the case , the german leader will find himself in an extremely difficult position torn between taking on more international responsibility on the one hand , and sending german troops to iraq - a scenario he has categorically rejected .
schröder 's advisor for transatlantic relations , karsten voigt , has said the chancellor will not rescind his opposition to military intervention .
" in spite of statements by kerry that he wants to involve his european partners more closely and even the likelihood that bush will approach europeans with a new initiative , we can not depart from our position that german troops will not be sent to iraq , no matter who will be the next president . "
redirecting the focus germany 's greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder 's government , have called for the next us president to put more focus on areas other than the fight against terrorism .

" it begins with taking on a greater role in global environmental policy , especially in the field of climate protection which has been entirely abandoned by the bush administration , " she said referring to the current president 's rejection of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
" other areas neglected by the united states are human rights and the international court , whose job it is to prosecute and punish gross violations of such rights . "

when american troops marched into iraq without the support of the united nations and all of the nato allies , ties between germany and the us plummeted to an all-time post-war low .
a year later , iraq remains a touchstone of bilateral relations as discussions center around reconstruction and security efforts in the war-torn country .
but beyond iraq , questions about washington 's pre-emptive strike policy , the role of the united nations , climate control , the international court and free trade agreements continue to put the transatlantic partnership to the test .
as a result , politicians in germany have carefully avoided showing public preference for one of the us presidential candidates .
although many may echo the rest of the population in favoring john f. kerry , they have been cautious not to alienate bush .
no matter who the next leader of the united states is , german politicians are hoping for an improvement in diplomatic ties between the two countries during the next four years .
it may not be that easy though , and germany is likely to have to pay a price .
new responsibility for germany wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democrats union , cautioned that a change in us leadership could mean germany taking on greater responsibility .
" our demands for multilateral decision-making and a stronger partnership in transatlantic relations are entirely justified , " he said .
" but at the same time , we should also recognize that this also entails greater efforts on our side . "
" it 's absurd to believe that we can tell the americans what to do while we refuse to get involved , " schäuble said in the run-up to the us election on nov .
2 .
the party leader for the neo-liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , has said the promise of " rejuvenated and rebalanced ties " between germany and the united states will come at a price .
if kerry should win - as many in germany and europe hope is the case - the democratic president will place new demands on berlin .
" this must not necessarily mean that germany will be asked to send troops to iraq , " he said .
" but i expect that a greater role for the german military will indeed be among kerry 's plans for our involvement in other regional hot spots . "
the kerry conundrum many experts believe john kerry would indeed press chancellor schröder even harder than bush to join american efforts in iraq .
if that is the case , the german leader will find himself in an extremely difficult position torn between taking on more international responsibility on the one hand , and sending german troops to iraq - a scenario he has categorically rejected .
schröder 's advisor for transatlantic relations , karsten voigt , has said the chancellor will not rescind his opposition to military intervention .
" in spite of statements by kerry that he wants to involve his european partners more closely and even the likelihood that bush will approach europeans with a new initiative , we can not depart from our position that german troops will not be sent to iraq , no matter who will be the next president . "
redirecting the focus germany 's greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder 's government , have called for the next us president to put more focus on areas other than the fight against terrorism .
party co-leader claudia roth has said the new administration in washington needs to be more pro-active on environmental issues .
" it begins with taking on a greater role in global environmental policy , especially in the field of climate protection which has been entirely abandoned by the bush administration , " she said referring to the current president 's rejection of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
" other areas neglected by the united states are human rights and the international court , whose job it is to prosecute and punish gross violations of such rights . "

but either way , the place to be in germany this week is at one of the many election parties being held in cities around the country . once upon a time , watching the us presidential election coverage in europe was a low-key affair .
maybe some international friends got together and hung out on someone 's living room couch , cracked open a bag of chips and watched cnn .
or maybe they got a good night 's sleep and picked up the returns from the local broadcasters in the morning .
but the days of casual returns watching are gone , along with any traces of indifference about who wins the white house on nov .
2 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate sen. john kerry rarely has a us election been so important to so many people , in europe as well as in the united states .
in turn , watching it has become a big event - at least in germany .
partying through the night over the course of tuesday night and into the early morning wednesday -lrb- due to the time difference , key results are first expected to come in around 2 a.m.
cet -rrb- , major cities in germany will host a number of election parties both private and public .
and to help make it easier to wait through long hours of state-by-state polling results , most of the parties have been jazzed up with political-themed entertainment .
at what may turn out to be the biggest party , on berlin 's central potsdamer platz , monitors are being set up to broadcast election coverage starting at 11:30 p.m. local time .
several hundred night owls are expected to come and watch the returns while enjoying american snacks and live music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush " we 'll serve breakfast in the morning , " a speaker for the cinestar movie theater told the afp news agency .
the theater , which shows films in their original language and estimates that up to a third of its customers are english speaking , will also show previews for the remake of " the manchurian candidate , " due to open in germany on nov .
11 .
the subject of the film is a manipulated us election .
neutral , and not-so-neutral the potsdamer platz party was organized by the group " american voters abroad , " which says it is politically neutral .
no such claims are being made by a group called vote44 , which , according to its website , was created for the sole purpose of ousting george w. bush . along with large screen election-results viewing and live music , filmmaker wim wenders is expected to attend the vote44 party in berlin 's tränenpalast and show his latest movie , " land of plenty , " which takes a critical look at post-sept .
11 america .
along with the usual coverage , the satiric 1997 political movie " wag the dog " - about an administration that fabricates a war in order to cover up a presidential sex scandal - is on the menu at the election bash being thrown by the cologne amerika haus and the konrad adenauer foundation , between cologne and bonn .
this party , too , is set to end with an election breakfast at 6 a.m.
in hamburg , the tivoli theater on the famous reeperbahn nightlife strip will offer american drinks and popcorn to accompany its vote rebroadcasts .
under the motto " do n't spend this night alone , " the tivoli has come up with games to allow partygoers to bet on the outcome in certain states starting at 1 a.m.
in munich 's amerika haus , 800 guests are expected to attend the election night party , including the publisher of the influential die zeit weekly newspaper and other notable locals .
a huge number of people are scrambling for tickets , organizers of the fete say , since " without a ticket , no one gets in , " spokespeople said .
no fun for soldiers ?
while their numbers are diminishing , germany is still home to many us military compounds - full of people who are likely to be most immediately impacted by the election results .
but the bases are probably among the last bastions of chips-on-the-sofa style returns-watching .
spokespeople for the compounds in hanau , ramstein and schweinfurt explained that in an effort to maintain neturality , the military wo n't throw any parties to celebrate their country 's vote . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house the outcome of the race between george w. bush and john kerry will likely have effects on us-european relations .

but either way , the place to be in germany this week is at one of the many election parties being held in cities around the country . once upon a time , watching the us presidential election coverage in europe was a low-key affair .
maybe some international friends got together and hung out on someone 's living room couch , cracked open a bag of chips and watched cnn .
or maybe they got a good night 's sleep and picked up the returns from the local broadcasters in the morning .
but the days of casual returns watching are gone , along with any traces of indifference about who wins the white house on nov .
2 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate sen. john kerry rarely has a us election been so important to so many people , in europe as well as in the united states .
in turn , watching it has become a big event - at least in germany .
partying through the night over the course of tuesday night and into the early morning wednesday -lrb- due to the time difference , key results are first expected to come in around 2 a.m.
cet -rrb- , major cities in germany will host a number of election parties both private and public .
and to help make it easier to wait through long hours of state-by-state polling results , most of the parties have been jazzed up with political-themed entertainment .
at what may turn out to be the biggest party , on berlin 's central potsdamer platz , monitors are being set up to broadcast election coverage starting at 11:30 p.m. local time .
several hundred night owls are expected to come and watch the returns while enjoying american snacks and live music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush " we 'll serve breakfast in the morning , " a speaker for the cinestar movie theater told the afp news agency .
the theater , which shows films in their original language and estimates that up to a third of its customers are english speaking , will also show previews for the remake of " the manchurian candidate , " due to open in germany on nov .
11 .
the subject of the film is a manipulated us election .
neutral , and not-so-neutral the potsdamer platz party was organized by the group " american voters abroad , " which says it is politically neutral .
no such claims are being made by a group called vote44 , which , according to its website , was created for the sole purpose of ousting george w. bush . along with large screen election-results viewing and live music , filmmaker wim wenders is expected to attend the vote44 party in berlin 's tränenpalast and show his latest movie , " land of plenty , " which takes a critical look at post-sept .
11 america .
along with the usual coverage , the satiric 1997 political movie " wag the dog " - about an administration that fabricates a war in order to cover up a presidential sex scandal - is on the menu at the election bash being thrown by the cologne amerika haus and the konrad adenauer foundation , between cologne and bonn .
this party , too , is set to end with an election breakfast at 6 a.m.
in hamburg , the tivoli theater on the famous reeperbahn nightlife strip will offer american drinks and popcorn to accompany its vote rebroadcasts .
under the motto " do n't spend this night alone , " the tivoli has come up with games to allow partygoers to bet on the outcome in certain states starting at 1 a.m.
in munich 's amerika haus , 800 guests are expected to attend the election night party , including the publisher of the influential die zeit weekly newspaper and other notable locals .
a huge number of people are scrambling for tickets , organizers of the fete say , since " without a ticket , no one gets in , " spokespeople said .
no fun for soldiers ?
while their numbers are diminishing , germany is still home to many us military compounds - full of people who are likely to be most immediately impacted by the election results .
but the bases are probably among the last bastions of chips-on-the-sofa style returns-watching .
spokespeople for the compounds in hanau , ramstein and schweinfurt explained that in an effort to maintain neturality , the military wo n't throw any parties to celebrate their country 's vote . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house the outcome of the race between george w. bush and john kerry will likely have effects on us-european relations .

a vast majority of europeans are hoping for a change in the white house after the us election .

in germany , the massachusetts senator commands an overwhelming majority in opinion polls , with almost 80 percent in favor of the democrat . but while the german public favors a change in the white house , deriving mostly from distaste for incumbent george w. bush 's policies , would a kerry administration be the best thing for us-european and , in particular , us-german , relations ? kerry speaks five languages , including fluent french .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.11.2004 opinion : will ukraine choose russia or the west ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich is backed by the outgoing president ukraine 's presidential race between viktor yanukovich and liberal opposition candidate viktor yushchenko is neck-and-neck .
dw 's ute schaeffer weighs up the options . as ukraine decides either to deepen ties with moscow or pursue the liberal policies of its western neighbors , early results monday showed current prime minister yanukovich is just one percent ahead of his reformist challenger . an ugly campaign the ukrainian electorate was determined not to be compromised .
a bitter campaign of political mud-slinging and recrimination was not enough to deter the voters from casting their ballots in what could prove to be a critical poll for the former soviet state . they kept their eye firmly on the broader picture , unshaken as the opposition accused the media of a pro-yanukovich bias and supporters of the establishment 's candidate claimed that western-leaning yushchenko was in cahoots with both the cia and radical nationalistic groups . a divided country the two candidates represent two ends of ukraine 's political spectrum .
prime minister yanukovich , backed by moscow and voters in the russian-speaking industrial east , wants to strengthen the centralist power of the state , while yushchenko stands for liberal economics and social reform . the outcome of sunday 's election shows how precarious ukraine 's future is .
in many respects , it 's a divided country .
many of the younger generation have studied or worked abroad .
today , they 're increasingly alienated from low-income and elderly voters , who can still remember the days of soviet rule , when life was predictable and economically secure . not surprisingly , the western part of the country - which borders poland and therefore the eu - proved to be a yushchenko stronghold . more suprisingly , sunday 's outcome suggested the " establishment candidate " yanukovich failed to win over the country 's elite .
up to 75 percent of voters in the capital came out in support of the opposition .
as the downfall of the soviet union fourteen years ago proved , leadership that lacks the backing of the elite is clearly losing ground . crucial factors the run-off next month will undoubtedly be decided by what now happens behind the scenes . outgoing president leonid kuchma will want to know how much he can rely on yanukovich , were he to remain in office .
and the oligarchs may switch sides and decide to back yushchenko .
its questions like these that will influence the results of the run-off .
other crucial factors include the possibility that yanukovich again raises pensions and public sector wages .
the country 's communists and radical left may also prove critical .
will they choose west-leaning yushchenko or russia-oriented yanukovich ? flawed democracy according to ukrainian writer andrey kurkow , the country still lacks a truly democratic candidate .
it would be naïve to see the presidential race as a battle between traditionalists and reformers .
viktor yushchenko 's base includes plenty of non-democratic elements , and if he assumes office , he will have to make inevitable concessions . nonetheless , during his term as prime minister five years ago , yushchenko demonstrated that he acknowledges the nation 's ties to russia while believing in social justice and understanding how to prompt market reforms .
under his leadership , ukraine might not become a flawless democracy , but the country would get its best shot at gradual , lasting change . ute schaeffer -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stand-off in ukrainian election early results from sunday 's presidential election in ukraine point to a run-off vote next month between the two main candidates for president .

this will depend upon attitudes and actions in europe more than anything bush can or will do .
the anti-bush , anti-american feelings that rage in europe are the result of many layers of insecurity , inferiority , resentment , envy , fear and arrogance on the part of the citizens of europe .
only they can deal with these . - jl ronish , seattle , usa bild newspaper endorses bush as a us citizen , i 'm not particularly anxious for the support of the german people .
over the last 100 years , germans have demonstrated breathtaking ineptitude regarding world affairs .
as recently as 1972 , germans demonstrated their true colors when they surrendered the munich terrorists to the libyans .
neither germany nor france have ever been particularly reliable allies to the us , and both have preferred to spend too much money on their welfare states while relying on the us for military protection . - joe bowman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild came out strong for bush at the end of october .
support for bush is to be expected from a tabloid .
most tabloids i am aware of are owned by right-wing pro-business individuals .
i am thinking of the murdoch group , for instance .
unfortunately tabloids are influencial .
but in the case of bild , this paper 's opinion does not reflect the majority of german opinion . - serge i applaud bild for the courage to take a stand on this issue despite the fact that a clear majority of germans - and europeans - appear to despise this very principled man -lrb- bush -rrb- without just cause .
it is clear that you have seen through all the rhetoric . - mark beck what a relief to read that there are still a few sound minds left in germany .
i 'm referring to bild 's endorsement of george bush for president .
the united states will grow stronger economically , militarily and otherwise with the re-election of bush .
it 's unfortunate that the majority of germans are too foolish , too liberal that is , to realize that a strong u.s. is a good thing . - carl mahrenholz seems that the reporter is one of the few who has a cogent argument and does not let an antipathy toward bush cloud his judgment .
kerry will be weak on terrorism as a lot of presidents before him , which is the reason the terrorists became more and more emboldened ; the worst thing i see about kerry is that he ca n't make a decision -lrb- clinton could n't either -rrb- - one might not agree with bush 's decisions , but at least he has the guts to make them . - marga e. doerr bush 's record abroad i feel that the reason why bush has such large support in us is due to the privatized and unquestioning media that we are subjected to .
of the world 's media , 5 people own rougly 90 percent of it .
one of those people , rupert murdock , has been quoted as saying that he 'll do anything to have bush reelected .
this is obvious to anyone who has seen even a small amount of fox " news " .
i would like to see a more questioning media in this country . - brad ahrens , usa i believe absentee ballots cast by us voters overseas can make a difference in the election outcome .
furthermore , in allowing for votes to be cast in this fashion , the electoral process strengthens its ' credibility by ensuring that all citizens , regardless of their location , will have their say . - - vijay dasika somerset , nj , usa i am an american expatriate living in the philippines .
i have sent my absentee ballot , at no small expense , in to my state of residence by fedex because i did n't trust the postal system here .
i have no idea if my vote will actually be counted , but my feelings on this election are more intense than any election i have ever voted in .
living overseas i can see more clearly , than americans at home , the affect that president bush is having on the whole world in general and i think that he has impacted on the world in a more negative manner than a positive one .
i do n't doubt the president 's sincerity in what he is doing , but i do think he is on a totally wrong track and it is time for a change in american politics . - james r. beck-jensen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world has been following the race from a european perspective .

a vast majority of europeans are hoping for a change in the white house after the us election .
but while john kerry is the candidate of choice , would a democratic administration be the best thing for us-german relations ? us presidential candidate john kerry enjoys great popularity in europe .
in germany , the massachusetts senator commands an overwhelming majority in opinion polls , with almost 80 percent in favor of the democrat . but while the german public favors a change in the white house , deriving mostly from distaste for incumbent george w. bush 's policies , would a kerry administration be the best thing for us-european and , in particular , us-german , relations ? kerry speaks five languages , including fluent french .
he went to school in switzerland .
he takes his vacations in france and has a european-born wife , teresa heinz kerry . jackson janes of the institute for contemporary german studies in washington admitted these were good credentials for a future president .
but he has reservations that these qualities will bring about a white house more endeared to europe . kerry would neither be the opposite of bush nor would he reform us foreign policy to engage with and consider the interests and ideas of europe , janes said .
" this is complete nonsense , " he told german public tv broadcaster ard 's " tagesschau " news program .
" all this friction which is here today , will still be there . " this friction comes in many guises : the bush white house 's refusal to back the kyoto protocol and the international criminal court , us policy in the middle east and israel , the american insistence on the right to defend its own security by force - pre-emptive or preventative - if necessary . different president , same problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry all these points of contention certainly would n't not be resolved from one day to the next ; president kerry would still face the same problems and issues that president bush did .
but a better atmosphere would likely be created if the reins of power were handed over to the democrat . however , it could also lead to more problems than solutions in germany - foremost among them being iraq . if the democratic challenger is elected , his campaign pledge to create a stronger coalition and alliance in iraq could take on contentious and even unsettling dimensions for some european countries , according to us ambassador to germany daniel coats in the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday . " senator kerry has indicated he would ask -lrb- for troops -rrb- , so that 's going to produce some difficult questions and some tensions here between the us and germany - if that happens , " coats told the paper . similar tensions over german stance on iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder chancellor gerhard schröder angered bush during campaigning for the german general elections in sept .

this will depend upon attitudes and actions in europe more than anything bush can or will do .
the anti-bush , anti-american feelings that rage in europe are the result of many layers of insecurity , inferiority , resentment , envy , fear and arrogance on the part of the citizens of europe .
only they can deal with these . - jl ronish , seattle , usa bild newspaper endorses bush as a us citizen , i 'm not particularly anxious for the support of the german people .
over the last 100 years , germans have demonstrated breathtaking ineptitude regarding world affairs .
as recently as 1972 , germans demonstrated their true colors when they surrendered the munich terrorists to the libyans .
neither germany nor france have ever been particularly reliable allies to the us , and both have preferred to spend too much money on their welfare states while relying on the us for military protection . - joe bowman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild came out strong for bush at the end of october .
support for bush is to be expected from a tabloid .
most tabloids i am aware of are owned by right-wing pro-business individuals .
i am thinking of the murdoch group , for instance .
unfortunately tabloids are influencial .
but in the case of bild , this paper 's opinion does not reflect the majority of german opinion . - serge i applaud bild for the courage to take a stand on this issue despite the fact that a clear majority of germans - and europeans - appear to despise this very principled man -lrb- bush -rrb- without just cause .
it is clear that you have seen through all the rhetoric . - mark beck what a relief to read that there are still a few sound minds left in germany .
i 'm referring to bild 's endorsement of george bush for president .
the united states will grow stronger economically , militarily and otherwise with the re-election of bush .
it 's unfortunate that the majority of germans are too foolish , too liberal that is , to realize that a strong u.s. is a good thing . - carl mahrenholz seems that the reporter is one of the few who has a cogent argument and does not let an antipathy toward bush cloud his judgment .
kerry will be weak on terrorism as a lot of presidents before him , which is the reason the terrorists became more and more emboldened ; the worst thing i see about kerry is that he ca n't make a decision -lrb- clinton could n't either -rrb- - one might not agree with bush 's decisions , but at least he has the guts to make them . - marga e. doerr bush 's record abroad i feel that the reason why bush has such large support in us is due to the privatized and unquestioning media that we are subjected to .
of the world 's media , 5 people own rougly 90 percent of it .
one of those people , rupert murdock , has been quoted as saying that he 'll do anything to have bush reelected .
this is obvious to anyone who has seen even a small amount of fox " news " .
i would like to see a more questioning media in this country . - brad ahrens , usa i believe absentee ballots cast by us voters overseas can make a difference in the election outcome .
furthermore , in allowing for votes to be cast in this fashion , the electoral process strengthens its ' credibility by ensuring that all citizens , regardless of their location , will have their say . - - vijay dasika somerset , nj , usa i am an american expatriate living in the philippines .
i have sent my absentee ballot , at no small expense , in to my state of residence by fedex because i did n't trust the postal system here .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house bild backs bush an overwhelming case for germany ? former us treasurer campaigns for kerry kerry 's sister gets out the vote in europe reader response -pipe- 02.11.2004 europe 's view of the election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush does n't have quite so many fans in europe dw-world readers weigh in on the us presidential election and predict what the outcome will be and how us-european relations will change as a result . since bush will be elected the question is whether us-eu relations will improve .
this will depend upon attitudes and actions in europe more than anything bush can or will do .
the anti-bush , anti-american feelings that rage in europe are the result of many layers of insecurity , inferiority , resentment , envy , fear and arrogance on the part of the citizens of europe .
only they can deal with these . - jl ronish , seattle , usa bild newspaper endorses bush as a us citizen , i 'm not particularly anxious for the support of the german people .
over the last 100 years , germans have demonstrated breathtaking ineptitude regarding world affairs .
as recently as 1972 , germans demonstrated their true colors when they surrendered the munich terrorists to the libyans .
neither germany nor france have ever been particularly reliable allies to the us , and both have preferred to spend too much money on their welfare states while relying on the us for military protection . - joe bowman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild came out strong for bush at the end of october .
support for bush is to be expected from a tabloid .
most tabloids i am aware of are owned by right-wing pro-business individuals .
i am thinking of the murdoch group , for instance .
unfortunately tabloids are influencial .
but in the case of bild , this paper 's opinion does not reflect the majority of german opinion . - serge i applaud bild for the courage to take a stand on this issue despite the fact that a clear majority of germans - and europeans - appear to despise this very principled man -lrb- bush -rrb- without just cause .
it is clear that you have seen through all the rhetoric . - mark beck what a relief to read that there are still a few sound minds left in germany .
i 'm referring to bild 's endorsement of george bush for president .
the united states will grow stronger economically , militarily and otherwise with the re-election of bush .
it 's unfortunate that the majority of germans are too foolish , too liberal that is , to realize that a strong u.s. is a good thing . - carl mahrenholz seems that the reporter is one of the few who has a cogent argument and does not let an antipathy toward bush cloud his judgment .
kerry will be weak on terrorism as a lot of presidents before him , which is the reason the terrorists became more and more emboldened ; the worst thing i see about kerry is that he ca n't make a decision -lrb- clinton could n't either -rrb- - one might not agree with bush 's decisions , but at least he has the guts to make them . - marga e. doerr bush 's record abroad i feel that the reason why bush has such large support in us is due to the privatized and unquestioning media that we are subjected to .
of the world 's media , 5 people own rougly 90 percent of it .
one of those people , rupert murdock , has been quoted as saying that he 'll do anything to have bush reelected .
this is obvious to anyone who has seen even a small amount of fox " news " .
i would like to see a more questioning media in this country . - brad ahrens , usa i believe absentee ballots cast by us voters overseas can make a difference in the election outcome .
furthermore , in allowing for votes to be cast in this fashion , the electoral process strengthens its ' credibility by ensuring that all citizens , regardless of their location , will have their say . - - vijay dasika somerset , nj , usa i am an american expatriate living in the philippines .
i have sent my absentee ballot , at no small expense , in to my state of residence by fedex because i did n't trust the postal system here .
i have no idea if my vote will actually be counted , but my feelings on this election are more intense than any election i have ever voted in .
living overseas i can see more clearly , than americans at home , the affect that president bush is having on the whole world in general and i think that he has impacted on the world in a more negative manner than a positive one .
i do n't doubt the president 's sincerity in what he is doing , but i do think he is on a totally wrong track and it is time for a change in american politics . - james r. beck-jensen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world has been following the race from a european perspective .

she will meet with businesspeople , politicians , schoolchildren and be the honorary guest at a concert benefiting the reconstruction of dresden , a city british bombers flattened in the waning months of wwii . in an effort to show just how well the two countries understand each other , british officials have been eagerly pointing out that it is the queen 's fourth visit to germany since the war . indeed , chancellor gehard schröder and prime minister tony blair , both left-of-center leaders , seem to enjoy a good relationship and the two governments have worked closely together on major issues such as the european union and nuclear proliferation in iran .
yet when it comes to cultural understanding between the two countries there remain major deficits . dw-world presents a dossier on why , almost 60 years later , the war continues to cast a shadow over relations between germans and the british . dw-world.de do mention the war ?
a british newspaper has alleged that the german government is putting pressure on queen elizabeth ii to make a public apology for the firebombing of dresden in 1945 when she visits germany in november .
-lrb- oct .
22 , 2004 -rrb- traut the kraut scores a goal for understanding the queen 's upcoming visit to germany has been marred by media claims berlin wants an apology for the bombing of dresden in world war ii .
if anyone can distract from the debacle , it 's " traut the kraut . "
-lrb- oct .
29 , 2004 -rrb- just do n't mention the war ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .
exchange programs and innovative campaigns are supposed to tackle the problem .
-lrb- oct .
28 , 2004 -rrb- british and german kids struggle with clichés a new british-german study carried out by two cultural organizations shows what kids from both countries think of each other , and it seems stereotypes still abound .

dw 's ute schaeffer weighs up the options . as ukraine decides either to deepen ties with moscow or pursue the liberal policies of its western neighbors , early results monday showed current prime minister yanukovich is just one percent ahead of his reformist challenger . an ugly campaign the ukrainian electorate was determined not to be compromised .
a bitter campaign of political mud-slinging and recrimination was not enough to deter the voters from casting their ballots in what could prove to be a critical poll for the former soviet state . they kept their eye firmly on the broader picture , unshaken as the opposition accused the media of a pro-yanukovich bias and supporters of the establishment 's candidate claimed that western-leaning yushchenko was in cahoots with both the cia and radical nationalistic groups . a divided country the two candidates represent two ends of ukraine 's political spectrum .
prime minister yanukovich , backed by moscow and voters in the russian-speaking industrial east , wants to strengthen the centralist power of the state , while yushchenko stands for liberal economics and social reform . the outcome of sunday 's election shows how precarious ukraine 's future is .
in many respects , it 's a divided country .
many of the younger generation have studied or worked abroad .
today , they 're increasingly alienated from low-income and elderly voters , who can still remember the days of soviet rule , when life was predictable and economically secure . not surprisingly , the western part of the country - which borders poland and therefore the eu - proved to be a yushchenko stronghold . more suprisingly , sunday 's outcome suggested the " establishment candidate " yanukovich failed to win over the country 's elite .
up to 75 percent of voters in the capital came out in support of the opposition .
as the downfall of the soviet union fourteen years ago proved , leadership that lacks the backing of the elite is clearly losing ground . crucial factors the run-off next month will undoubtedly be decided by what now happens behind the scenes . outgoing president leonid kuchma will want to know how much he can rely on yanukovich , were he to remain in office .
and the oligarchs may switch sides and decide to back yushchenko .
its questions like these that will influence the results of the run-off .
other crucial factors include the possibility that yanukovich again raises pensions and public sector wages .

will they choose west-leaning yushchenko or russia-oriented yanukovich ? flawed democracy according to ukrainian writer andrey kurkow , the country still lacks a truly democratic candidate .
it would be naïve to see the presidential race as a battle between traditionalists and reformers .
viktor yushchenko 's base includes plenty of non-democratic elements , and if he assumes office , he will have to make inevitable concessions . nonetheless , during his term as prime minister five years ago , yushchenko demonstrated that he acknowledges the nation 's ties to russia while believing in social justice and understanding how to prompt market reforms .

this will depend upon attitudes and actions in europe more than anything bush can or will do .
the anti-bush , anti-american feelings that rage in europe are the result of many layers of insecurity , inferiority , resentment , envy , fear and arrogance on the part of the citizens of europe .
only they can deal with these . - jl ronish , seattle , usa bild newspaper endorses bush as a us citizen , i 'm not particularly anxious for the support of the german people .
over the last 100 years , germans have demonstrated breathtaking ineptitude regarding world affairs .
as recently as 1972 , germans demonstrated their true colors when they surrendered the munich terrorists to the libyans .
neither germany nor france have ever been particularly reliable allies to the us , and both have preferred to spend too much money on their welfare states while relying on the us for military protection . - joe bowman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild came out strong for bush at the end of october .
support for bush is to be expected from a tabloid .
most tabloids i am aware of are owned by right-wing pro-business individuals .
i am thinking of the murdoch group , for instance .
unfortunately tabloids are influencial .
but in the case of bild , this paper 's opinion does not reflect the majority of german opinion . - serge i applaud bild for the courage to take a stand on this issue despite the fact that a clear majority of germans - and europeans - appear to despise this very principled man -lrb- bush -rrb- without just cause .
it is clear that you have seen through all the rhetoric . - mark beck what a relief to read that there are still a few sound minds left in germany .
i 'm referring to bild 's endorsement of george bush for president .
the united states will grow stronger economically , militarily and otherwise with the re-election of bush .
it 's unfortunate that the majority of germans are too foolish , too liberal that is , to realize that a strong u.s. is a good thing . - carl mahrenholz seems that the reporter is one of the few who has a cogent argument and does not let an antipathy toward bush cloud his judgment .
kerry will be weak on terrorism as a lot of presidents before him , which is the reason the terrorists became more and more emboldened ; the worst thing i see about kerry is that he ca n't make a decision -lrb- clinton could n't either -rrb- - one might not agree with bush 's decisions , but at least he has the guts to make them . - marga e. doerr bush 's record abroad i feel that the reason why bush has such large support in us is due to the privatized and unquestioning media that we are subjected to .
of the world 's media , 5 people own rougly 90 percent of it .
one of those people , rupert murdock , has been quoted as saying that he 'll do anything to have bush reelected .
this is obvious to anyone who has seen even a small amount of fox " news " .
i would like to see a more questioning media in this country . - brad ahrens , usa i believe absentee ballots cast by us voters overseas can make a difference in the election outcome .
furthermore , in allowing for votes to be cast in this fashion , the electoral process strengthens its ' credibility by ensuring that all citizens , regardless of their location , will have their say . - - vijay dasika somerset , nj , usa i am an american expatriate living in the philippines .
i have sent my absentee ballot , at no small expense , in to my state of residence by fedex because i did n't trust the postal system here .
i have no idea if my vote will actually be counted , but my feelings on this election are more intense than any election i have ever voted in .
living overseas i can see more clearly , than americans at home , the affect that president bush is having on the whole world in general and i think that he has impacted on the world in a more negative manner than a positive one .
i do n't doubt the president 's sincerity in what he is doing , but i do think he is on a totally wrong track and it is time for a change in american politics . - james r. beck-jensen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world has been following the race from a european perspective .
read about how the results could influence us-european relations .
feedback how do you think relations with europe will change after the us election ?

when american troops marched into iraq without the support of the united nations and all of the nato allies , ties between germany and the us plummeted to an all-time post-war low .
a year later , iraq remains a touchstone of bilateral relations as discussions center around reconstruction and security efforts in the war-torn country .
but beyond iraq , questions about washington 's pre-emptive strike policy , the role of the united nations , climate control , the international court and free trade agreements continue to put the transatlantic partnership to the test .
as a result , politicians in germany have carefully avoided showing public preference for one of the us presidential candidates .
although many may echo the rest of the population in favoring john f. kerry , they have been cautious not to alienate bush .
no matter who the next leader of the united states is , german politicians are hoping for an improvement in diplomatic ties between the two countries during the next four years .
it may not be that easy though , and germany is likely to have to pay a price .
new responsibility for germany wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democrats union , cautioned that a change in us leadership could mean germany taking on greater responsibility .
" our demands for multilateral decision-making and a stronger partnership in transatlantic relations are entirely justified , " he said .
" but at the same time , we should also recognize that this also entails greater efforts on our side . "
" it 's absurd to believe that we can tell the americans what to do while we refuse to get involved , " schäuble said in the run-up to the us election on nov .
2 .
the party leader for the neo-liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , has said the promise of " rejuvenated and rebalanced ties " between germany and the united states will come at a price .
if kerry should win - as many in germany and europe hope is the case - the democratic president will place new demands on berlin .
" this must not necessarily mean that germany will be asked to send troops to iraq , " he said .
" but i expect that a greater role for the german military will indeed be among kerry 's plans for our involvement in other regional hot spots . "
the kerry conundrum many experts believe john kerry would indeed press chancellor schröder even harder than bush to join american efforts in iraq .
if that is the case , the german leader will find himself in an extremely difficult position torn between taking on more international responsibility on the one hand , and sending german troops to iraq - a scenario he has categorically rejected .
schröder 's advisor for transatlantic relations , karsten voigt , has said the chancellor will not rescind his opposition to military intervention .
" in spite of statements by kerry that he wants to involve his european partners more closely and even the likelihood that bush will approach europeans with a new initiative , we can not depart from our position that german troops will not be sent to iraq , no matter who will be the next president . "
redirecting the focus germany 's greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder 's government , have called for the next us president to put more focus on areas other than the fight against terrorism .
party co-leader claudia roth has said the new administration in washington needs to be more pro-active on environmental issues .
" it begins with taking on a greater role in global environmental policy , especially in the field of climate protection which has been entirely abandoned by the bush administration , " she said referring to the current president 's rejection of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
" other areas neglected by the united states are human rights and the international court , whose job it is to prosecute and punish gross violations of such rights . "

" this must not necessarily mean that germany will be asked to send troops to iraq , " he said .
" but i expect that a greater role for the german military will indeed be among kerry 's plans for our involvement in other regional hot spots . "
the kerry conundrum many experts believe john kerry would indeed press chancellor schröder even harder than bush to join american efforts in iraq .
if that is the case , the german leader will find himself in an extremely difficult position torn between taking on more international responsibility on the one hand , and sending german troops to iraq - a scenario he has categorically rejected .
schröder 's advisor for transatlantic relations , karsten voigt , has said the chancellor will not rescind his opposition to military intervention .
" in spite of statements by kerry that he wants to involve his european partners more closely and even the likelihood that bush will approach europeans with a new initiative , we can not depart from our position that german troops will not be sent to iraq , no matter who will be the next president . "
redirecting the focus germany 's greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder 's government , have called for the next us president to put more focus on areas other than the fight against terrorism .
party co-leader claudia roth has said the new administration in washington needs to be more pro-active on environmental issues .
" it begins with taking on a greater role in global environmental policy , especially in the field of climate protection which has been entirely abandoned by the bush administration , " she said referring to the current president 's rejection of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
" other areas neglected by the united states are human rights and the international court , whose job it is to prosecute and punish gross violations of such rights . "

but either way , the place to be in germany this week is at one of the many election parties being held in cities around the country . once upon a time , watching the us presidential election coverage in europe was a low-key affair .
maybe some international friends got together and hung out on someone 's living room couch , cracked open a bag of chips and watched cnn .
or maybe they got a good night 's sleep and picked up the returns from the local broadcasters in the morning .
but the days of casual returns watching are gone , along with any traces of indifference about who wins the white house on nov .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate sen. john kerry rarely has a us election been so important to so many people , in europe as well as in the united states .
in turn , watching it has become a big event - at least in germany .
partying through the night over the course of tuesday night and into the early morning wednesday -lrb- due to the time difference , key results are first expected to come in around 2 a.m.
cet -rrb- , major cities in germany will host a number of election parties both private and public .
and to help make it easier to wait through long hours of state-by-state polling results , most of the parties have been jazzed up with political-themed entertainment .
at what may turn out to be the biggest party , on berlin 's central potsdamer platz , monitors are being set up to broadcast election coverage starting at 11:30 p.m. local time .
several hundred night owls are expected to come and watch the returns while enjoying american snacks and live music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush " we 'll serve breakfast in the morning , " a speaker for the cinestar movie theater told the afp news agency .
the theater , which shows films in their original language and estimates that up to a third of its customers are english speaking , will also show previews for the remake of " the manchurian candidate , " due to open in germany on nov .
11 .
the subject of the film is a manipulated us election .
neutral , and not-so-neutral the potsdamer platz party was organized by the group " american voters abroad , " which says it is politically neutral .
no such claims are being made by a group called vote44 , which , according to its website , was created for the sole purpose of ousting george w. bush . along with large screen election-results viewing and live music , filmmaker wim wenders is expected to attend the vote44 party in berlin 's tränenpalast and show his latest movie , " land of plenty , " which takes a critical look at post-sept .
11 america .
along with the usual coverage , the satiric 1997 political movie " wag the dog " - about an administration that fabricates a war in order to cover up a presidential sex scandal - is on the menu at the election bash being thrown by the cologne amerika haus and the konrad adenauer foundation , between cologne and bonn .
this party , too , is set to end with an election breakfast at 6 a.m.
in hamburg , the tivoli theater on the famous reeperbahn nightlife strip will offer american drinks and popcorn to accompany its vote rebroadcasts .
under the motto " do n't spend this night alone , " the tivoli has come up with games to allow partygoers to bet on the outcome in certain states starting at 1 a.m.
in munich 's amerika haus , 800 guests are expected to attend the election night party , including the publisher of the influential die zeit weekly newspaper and other notable locals .
a huge number of people are scrambling for tickets , organizers of the fete say , since " without a ticket , no one gets in , " spokespeople said .
no fun for soldiers ?
while their numbers are diminishing , germany is still home to many us military compounds - full of people who are likely to be most immediately impacted by the election results .
but the bases are probably among the last bastions of chips-on-the-sofa style returns-watching .
spokespeople for the compounds in hanau , ramstein and schweinfurt explained that in an effort to maintain neturality , the military wo n't throw any parties to celebrate their country 's vote . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house the outcome of the race between george w. bush and john kerry will likely have effects on us-european relations .

when american troops marched into iraq without the support of the united nations and all of the nato allies , ties between germany and the us plummeted to an all-time post-war low .
a year later , iraq remains a touchstone of bilateral relations as discussions center around reconstruction and security efforts in the war-torn country .
but beyond iraq , questions about washington 's pre-emptive strike policy , the role of the united nations , climate control , the international court and free trade agreements continue to put the transatlantic partnership to the test .
as a result , politicians in germany have carefully avoided showing public preference for one of the us presidential candidates .
although many may echo the rest of the population in favoring john f. kerry , they have been cautious not to alienate bush .
no matter who the next leader of the united states is , german politicians are hoping for an improvement in diplomatic ties between the two countries during the next four years .
it may not be that easy though , and germany is likely to have to pay a price .
new responsibility for germany wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democrats union , cautioned that a change in us leadership could mean germany taking on greater responsibility .
" our demands for multilateral decision-making and a stronger partnership in transatlantic relations are entirely justified , " he said .

" hoping to further reconciliation between britain and germany , queen elizabeth called on the two former world war ii foes to learn from history but not be obsessed by the past .
addressing dignitaries in the german capital on tuesday , the british monarch emphasized her country 's current ties with germany and the success of their modern-day partnerships in nato and the european union .
" in remembering the appalling suffering of war on both sides , we recognize how precious is the peace we have built in europe since 1945 , " the 78-year-old queen said at a state banquet attended by german president horst köhler , among others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's queen elizabeth ii and german president horst köhler review the guard of honor in front of the charlottenburg palace in berlin , tuesday , nov .
2 , 2004 .
" we owe it to those who built the partnership to continue the process into the 21st century : to learn from history and not be obsessed by it , to look beyond simplistic stereotypes to realize how often we share the same outlook , " she said .
no apology for bombings queen elizabeth 's three-day visit to germany had been overshadowed by press speculation that she would use the trip to apologize for the allied bombing raid on dresden during world war ii .
however , buckingham palace said germany had made no official request for an apology and german chancellor gerhard schröder said he had told the queen shortly after her arrival that the debate had been " absurd . "
" britain has played a conciliatory role " in improving relations between the two countries , schröder said .
calls for a royal apology circulated in british and german newspapers last week after it became known that the queen planned to attend a benefit concert for the rebuilding of dresden 's historic frauenkirche on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : built in 1738 and completely destroyed in 1945 , dresden 's baroque frauenkirche is being completely restored .
the british monarchy has played a leading role in raising funds for restoring the baroque church - considered one of the most beautiful in europe .
so far some 93 million euros -lrb- $ 118 million -rrb- have been collected .
in june , the duke of kent attended a ceremony to mark the lifting of a new gilded cross atop the church steeple .
an anti-german trick ?
the german press has blamed british media for initiating the rumors of the queen 's apology .
the daily die welt wrote , " this anti-german trick is a way of selling more newspapers . "
" an apology by the queen would be a disservice to british-german relations , it would release animosities that have been kept in check by the very fact that each side has learned to deal with the past in its own way , " the berlin-based paper said .
a controversial editorial published last week in the british tabloid daily mail by right-wing columnist simon heffer generated outrage in germany , where it received widespread coverage .
entitled " sorry , the germans must never be allowed to forget their evil past , " heffer rejected the notion of an apology and accused the germans of trying to " rewrite history . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de just do n't mention the war ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .

" hoping to further reconciliation between britain and germany , queen elizabeth called on the two former world war ii foes to learn from history but not be obsessed by the past .
addressing dignitaries in the german capital on tuesday , the british monarch emphasized her country 's current ties with germany and the success of their modern-day partnerships in nato and the european union .
" in remembering the appalling suffering of war on both sides , we recognize how precious is the peace we have built in europe since 1945 , " the 78-year-old queen said at a state banquet attended by german president horst köhler , among others .

" we owe it to those who built the partnership to continue the process into the 21st century : to learn from history and not be obsessed by it , to look beyond simplistic stereotypes to realize how often we share the same outlook , " she said .
no apology for bombings queen elizabeth 's three-day visit to germany had been overshadowed by press speculation that she would use the trip to apologize for the allied bombing raid on dresden during world war ii .
however , buckingham palace said germany had made no official request for an apology and german chancellor gerhard schröder said he had told the queen shortly after her arrival that the debate had been " absurd . "
" britain has played a conciliatory role " in improving relations between the two countries , schröder said .
calls for a royal apology circulated in british and german newspapers last week after it became known that the queen planned to attend a benefit concert for the rebuilding of dresden 's historic frauenkirche on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : built in 1738 and completely destroyed in 1945 , dresden 's baroque frauenkirche is being completely restored .
the british monarchy has played a leading role in raising funds for restoring the baroque church - considered one of the most beautiful in europe .
so far some 93 million euros -lrb- $ 118 million -rrb- have been collected .
in june , the duke of kent attended a ceremony to mark the lifting of a new gilded cross atop the church steeple .
an anti-german trick ?
the german press has blamed british media for initiating the rumors of the queen 's apology .
the daily die welt wrote , " this anti-german trick is a way of selling more newspapers . "
" an apology by the queen would be a disservice to british-german relations , it would release animosities that have been kept in check by the very fact that each side has learned to deal with the past in its own way , " the berlin-based paper said .
a controversial editorial published last week in the british tabloid daily mail by right-wing columnist simon heffer generated outrage in germany , where it received widespread coverage .
entitled " sorry , the germans must never be allowed to forget their evil past , " heffer rejected the notion of an apology and accused the germans of trying to " rewrite history . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de just do n't mention the war ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .

a vast majority of europeans are hoping for a change in the white house after the us election .
but while john kerry is the candidate of choice , would a democratic administration be the best thing for us-german relations ? us presidential candidate john kerry enjoys great popularity in europe .
in germany , the massachusetts senator commands an overwhelming majority in opinion polls , with almost 80 percent in favor of the democrat . but while the german public favors a change in the white house , deriving mostly from distaste for incumbent george w. bush 's policies , would a kerry administration be the best thing for us-european and , in particular , us-german , relations ? kerry speaks five languages , including fluent french .
he went to school in switzerland .
he takes his vacations in france and has a european-born wife , teresa heinz kerry . jackson janes of the institute for contemporary german studies in washington admitted these were good credentials for a future president .
but he has reservations that these qualities will bring about a white house more endeared to europe . kerry would neither be the opposite of bush nor would he reform us foreign policy to engage with and consider the interests and ideas of europe , janes said .
" this is complete nonsense , " he told german public tv broadcaster ard 's " tagesschau " news program .
" all this friction which is here today , will still be there . " this friction comes in many guises : the bush white house 's refusal to back the kyoto protocol and the international criminal court , us policy in the middle east and israel , the american insistence on the right to defend its own security by force - pre-emptive or preventative - if necessary . different president , same problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry all these points of contention certainly would n't not be resolved from one day to the next ; president kerry would still face the same problems and issues that president bush did .
but a better atmosphere would likely be created if the reins of power were handed over to the democrat . however , it could also lead to more problems than solutions in germany - foremost among them being iraq . if the democratic challenger is elected , his campaign pledge to create a stronger coalition and alliance in iraq could take on contentious and even unsettling dimensions for some european countries , according to us ambassador to germany daniel coats in the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday . " senator kerry has indicated he would ask -lrb- for troops -rrb- , so that 's going to produce some difficult questions and some tensions here between the us and germany - if that happens , " coats told the paper . similar tensions over german stance on iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder chancellor gerhard schröder angered bush during campaigning for the german general elections in sept .
2002 when he vehemently opposed any military " adventure " in iraq .
subsequently , schröder has refused to send any troops to the war-torn country , but germany is helping train iraqi military officers and police outside the country . speaking during campaigning on oct .
5 , kerry acknowledged that foreign powers would not " trade their young for our young in body-bags , " but he said he would be able to get them involved in missions like securing iraq 's borders .
" those borders have become a sieve for weapons of mass destruction and those weapons of mass destruction are terrorists that are crossing them and coming in and blowing themselves up in cars , " he said . kerry added that the current administration had no credibility to enlist us allies .
" every step of the way these folks have pushed them away , " he said .
" what i will do is bring new credibility , a fresh start . " sticky situation for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops in iraq would be on any agenda for germany and a new president .
that could put schröder in a difficult position .
berlin would consider a kerry administration friendly , and germany would be one of the first stops for a new president .
but if that visit included a call for military support in iraq , a potential thawing of relations could quickly turn icy again and a new friend could be swiftly alienated . if , on the other hand , schröder changes track for the new administration , the german chancellor would face outrage at home that could have a decisive influence on his own chances for re-election in 2006 . jackson janes contended that kerry would not demand a troop deployment from schröder .
" i do not believe that he expects germany to send troops to iraq .
but i believe he would expect development aid .
and much more than germany has provided up to now , " janes told german television . re-election less demanding for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president george w. bush bush 's re-election , however , would likely just lead to a continuation of the animosity between the two governments . " i can not imagine that bush would say : what i have done during the first four years was a mistake .
on the contrary , " said janes .
re-election , he believes , would be seen as endorsement of the first term and justification for the way the us treats the europeans . either way , the result and the future of us-european relations lies in the hands of american voters , and it will surely be a challenge for all european countries , regardless of whether bush or kerry wins . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house the outcome of the race between george w. bush and john kerry will likely have effects on us-european relations .

" we owe it to those who built the partnership to continue the process into the 21st century : to learn from history and not be obsessed by it , to look beyond simplistic stereotypes to realize how often we share the same outlook , " she said .
no apology for bombings queen elizabeth 's three-day visit to germany had been overshadowed by press speculation that she would use the trip to apologize for the allied bombing raid on dresden during world war ii .
however , buckingham palace said germany had made no official request for an apology and german chancellor gerhard schröder said he had told the queen shortly after her arrival that the debate had been " absurd . "
" britain has played a conciliatory role " in improving relations between the two countries , schröder said .
calls for a royal apology circulated in british and german newspapers last week after it became known that the queen planned to attend a benefit concert for the rebuilding of dresden 's historic frauenkirche on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : built in 1738 and completely destroyed in 1945 , dresden 's baroque frauenkirche is being completely restored .
the british monarchy has played a leading role in raising funds for restoring the baroque church - considered one of the most beautiful in europe .
so far some 93 million euros -lrb- $ 118 million -rrb- have been collected .
in june , the duke of kent attended a ceremony to mark the lifting of a new gilded cross atop the church steeple .
an anti-german trick ?
the german press has blamed british media for initiating the rumors of the queen 's apology .
the daily die welt wrote , " this anti-german trick is a way of selling more newspapers . "
" an apology by the queen would be a disservice to british-german relations , it would release animosities that have been kept in check by the very fact that each side has learned to deal with the past in its own way , " the berlin-based paper said .
a controversial editorial published last week in the british tabloid daily mail by right-wing columnist simon heffer generated outrage in germany , where it received widespread coverage .
entitled " sorry , the germans must never be allowed to forget their evil past , " heffer rejected the notion of an apology and accused the germans of trying to " rewrite history .

" hoping to further reconciliation between britain and germany , queen elizabeth called on the two former world war ii foes to learn from history but not be obsessed by the past .
addressing dignitaries in the german capital on tuesday , the british monarch emphasized her country 's current ties with germany and the success of their modern-day partnerships in nato and the european union .
" in remembering the appalling suffering of war on both sides , we recognize how precious is the peace we have built in europe since 1945 , " the 78-year-old queen said at a state banquet attended by german president horst köhler , among others .

2 , 2004 .
" we owe it to those who built the partnership to continue the process into the 21st century : to learn from history and not be obsessed by it , to look beyond simplistic stereotypes to realize how often we share the same outlook , " she said .
no apology for bombings queen elizabeth 's three-day visit to germany had been overshadowed by press speculation that she would use the trip to apologize for the allied bombing raid on dresden during world war ii .
however , buckingham palace said germany had made no official request for an apology and german chancellor gerhard schröder said he had told the queen shortly after her arrival that the debate had been " absurd . "
" britain has played a conciliatory role " in improving relations between the two countries , schröder said .
calls for a royal apology circulated in british and german newspapers last week after it became known that the queen planned to attend a benefit concert for the rebuilding of dresden 's historic frauenkirche on wednesday .

this will depend upon attitudes and actions in europe more than anything bush can or will do .
the anti-bush , anti-american feelings that rage in europe are the result of many layers of insecurity , inferiority , resentment , envy , fear and arrogance on the part of the citizens of europe .
only they can deal with these . - jl ronish , seattle , usa bild newspaper endorses bush as a us citizen , i 'm not particularly anxious for the support of the german people .
over the last 100 years , germans have demonstrated breathtaking ineptitude regarding world affairs .
as recently as 1972 , germans demonstrated their true colors when they surrendered the munich terrorists to the libyans .

the united states will grow stronger economically , militarily and otherwise with the re-election of bush .
it 's unfortunate that the majority of germans are too foolish , too liberal that is , to realize that a strong u.s. is a good thing . - carl mahrenholz seems that the reporter is one of the few who has a cogent argument and does not let an antipathy toward bush cloud his judgment .

one of those people , rupert murdock , has been quoted as saying that he 'll do anything to have bush reelected .

she will meet with businesspeople , politicians , schoolchildren and be the honorary guest at a concert benefiting the reconstruction of dresden , a city british bombers flattened in the waning months of wwii . in an effort to show just how well the two countries understand each other , british officials have been eagerly pointing out that it is the queen 's fourth visit to germany since the war . indeed , chancellor gehard schröder and prime minister tony blair , both left-of-center leaders , seem to enjoy a good relationship and the two governments have worked closely together on major issues such as the european union and nuclear proliferation in iran .
yet when it comes to cultural understanding between the two countries there remain major deficits . dw-world presents a dossier on why , almost 60 years later , the war continues to cast a shadow over relations between germans and the british . dw-world.de do mention the war ?
a british newspaper has alleged that the german government is putting pressure on queen elizabeth ii to make a public apology for the firebombing of dresden in 1945 when she visits germany in november .

dw 's ute schaeffer weighs up the options . as ukraine decides either to deepen ties with moscow or pursue the liberal policies of its western neighbors , early results monday showed current prime minister yanukovich is just one percent ahead of his reformist challenger . an ugly campaign the ukrainian electorate was determined not to be compromised .
a bitter campaign of political mud-slinging and recrimination was not enough to deter the voters from casting their ballots in what could prove to be a critical poll for the former soviet state . they kept their eye firmly on the broader picture , unshaken as the opposition accused the media of a pro-yanukovich bias and supporters of the establishment 's candidate claimed that western-leaning yushchenko was in cahoots with both the cia and radical nationalistic groups . a divided country the two candidates represent two ends of ukraine 's political spectrum .
prime minister yanukovich , backed by moscow and voters in the russian-speaking industrial east , wants to strengthen the centralist power of the state , while yushchenko stands for liberal economics and social reform . the outcome of sunday 's election shows how precarious ukraine 's future is .
in many respects , it 's a divided country .
many of the younger generation have studied or worked abroad .
today , they 're increasingly alienated from low-income and elderly voters , who can still remember the days of soviet rule , when life was predictable and economically secure . not surprisingly , the western part of the country - which borders poland and therefore the eu - proved to be a yushchenko stronghold . more suprisingly , sunday 's outcome suggested the " establishment candidate " yanukovich failed to win over the country 's elite .
up to 75 percent of voters in the capital came out in support of the opposition .
as the downfall of the soviet union fourteen years ago proved , leadership that lacks the backing of the elite is clearly losing ground . crucial factors the run-off next month will undoubtedly be decided by what now happens behind the scenes . outgoing president leonid kuchma will want to know how much he can rely on yanukovich , were he to remain in office .
and the oligarchs may switch sides and decide to back yushchenko .

the country 's communists and radical left may also prove critical .
will they choose west-leaning yushchenko or russia-oriented yanukovich ? flawed democracy according to ukrainian writer andrey kurkow , the country still lacks a truly democratic candidate .
it would be naïve to see the presidential race as a battle between traditionalists and reformers .
viktor yushchenko 's base includes plenty of non-democratic elements , and if he assumes office , he will have to make inevitable concessions . nonetheless , during his term as prime minister five years ago , yushchenko demonstrated that he acknowledges the nation 's ties to russia while believing in social justice and understanding how to prompt market reforms .

" hoping to further reconciliation between britain and germany , queen elizabeth called on the two former world war ii foes to learn from history but not be obsessed by the past .
addressing dignitaries in the german capital on tuesday , the british monarch emphasized her country 's current ties with germany and the success of their modern-day partnerships in nato and the european union .
" in remembering the appalling suffering of war on both sides , we recognize how precious is the peace we have built in europe since 1945 , " the 78-year-old queen said at a state banquet attended by german president horst köhler , among others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's queen elizabeth ii and german president horst köhler review the guard of honor in front of the charlottenburg palace in berlin , tuesday , nov .
2 , 2004 .
" we owe it to those who built the partnership to continue the process into the 21st century : to learn from history and not be obsessed by it , to look beyond simplistic stereotypes to realize how often we share the same outlook , " she said .
no apology for bombings queen elizabeth 's three-day visit to germany had been overshadowed by press speculation that she would use the trip to apologize for the allied bombing raid on dresden during world war ii .
however , buckingham palace said germany had made no official request for an apology and german chancellor gerhard schröder said he had told the queen shortly after her arrival that the debate had been " absurd . "
" britain has played a conciliatory role " in improving relations between the two countries , schröder said .
calls for a royal apology circulated in british and german newspapers last week after it became known that the queen planned to attend a benefit concert for the rebuilding of dresden 's historic frauenkirche on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : built in 1738 and completely destroyed in 1945 , dresden 's baroque frauenkirche is being completely restored .
the british monarchy has played a leading role in raising funds for restoring the baroque church - considered one of the most beautiful in europe .
so far some 93 million euros -lrb- $ 118 million -rrb- have been collected .
in june , the duke of kent attended a ceremony to mark the lifting of a new gilded cross atop the church steeple .
an anti-german trick ?
the german press has blamed british media for initiating the rumors of the queen 's apology .
the daily die welt wrote , " this anti-german trick is a way of selling more newspapers . "
" an apology by the queen would be a disservice to british-german relations , it would release animosities that have been kept in check by the very fact that each side has learned to deal with the past in its own way , " the berlin-based paper said .
a controversial editorial published last week in the british tabloid daily mail by right-wing columnist simon heffer generated outrage in germany , where it received widespread coverage .
entitled " sorry , the germans must never be allowed to forget their evil past , " heffer rejected the notion of an apology and accused the germans of trying to " rewrite history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house bild backs bush an overwhelming case for germany ? former us treasurer campaigns for kerry kerry 's sister gets out the vote in europe germany -pipe- 02.11.2004 a vote for better us-german relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin hopes the next us president works to improve transatlantic ties as the us goes to the polls , german politicians across all parties have expressed their hope that the next administration brings an improvement in transatlantic ties , regardless of who the president is . relations between the current washington administration and berlin have been strained since the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder refused to support george w. bush in the war against iraq .
when american troops marched into iraq without the support of the united nations and all of the nato allies , ties between germany and the us plummeted to an all-time post-war low .
a year later , iraq remains a touchstone of bilateral relations as discussions center around reconstruction and security efforts in the war-torn country .
but beyond iraq , questions about washington 's pre-emptive strike policy , the role of the united nations , climate control , the international court and free trade agreements continue to put the transatlantic partnership to the test .
as a result , politicians in germany have carefully avoided showing public preference for one of the us presidential candidates .
although many may echo the rest of the population in favoring john f. kerry , they have been cautious not to alienate bush .
no matter who the next leader of the united states is , german politicians are hoping for an improvement in diplomatic ties between the two countries during the next four years .
it may not be that easy though , and germany is likely to have to pay a price .
new responsibility for germany wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democrats union , cautioned that a change in us leadership could mean germany taking on greater responsibility .
" our demands for multilateral decision-making and a stronger partnership in transatlantic relations are entirely justified , " he said .
" but at the same time , we should also recognize that this also entails greater efforts on our side . "
" it 's absurd to believe that we can tell the americans what to do while we refuse to get involved , " schäuble said in the run-up to the us election on nov .
2 .
the party leader for the neo-liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , has said the promise of " rejuvenated and rebalanced ties " between germany and the united states will come at a price .
if kerry should win - as many in germany and europe hope is the case - the democratic president will place new demands on berlin .
" this must not necessarily mean that germany will be asked to send troops to iraq , " he said .
" but i expect that a greater role for the german military will indeed be among kerry 's plans for our involvement in other regional hot spots . "
the kerry conundrum many experts believe john kerry would indeed press chancellor schröder even harder than bush to join american efforts in iraq .
if that is the case , the german leader will find himself in an extremely difficult position torn between taking on more international responsibility on the one hand , and sending german troops to iraq - a scenario he has categorically rejected .
schröder 's advisor for transatlantic relations , karsten voigt , has said the chancellor will not rescind his opposition to military intervention .
" in spite of statements by kerry that he wants to involve his european partners more closely and even the likelihood that bush will approach europeans with a new initiative , we can not depart from our position that german troops will not be sent to iraq , no matter who will be the next president . "
redirecting the focus germany 's greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder 's government , have called for the next us president to put more focus on areas other than the fight against terrorism .
party co-leader claudia roth has said the new administration in washington needs to be more pro-active on environmental issues .
" it begins with taking on a greater role in global environmental policy , especially in the field of climate protection which has been entirely abandoned by the bush administration , " she said referring to the current president 's rejection of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
" other areas neglected by the united states are human rights and the international court , whose job it is to prosecute and punish gross violations of such rights . "
" america should be involved in all of this and should not chose to stand on the sidelines , " roth said . uwe hessler -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what does the us vote mean for germany ?
a vast majority of europeans are hoping for a change in the white house after the us election .
but while john kerry is the candidate of choice , would a democratic administration be the best thing for us-german relations ?

when american troops marched into iraq without the support of the united nations and all of the nato allies , ties between germany and the us plummeted to an all-time post-war low .
a year later , iraq remains a touchstone of bilateral relations as discussions center around reconstruction and security efforts in the war-torn country .
but beyond iraq , questions about washington 's pre-emptive strike policy , the role of the united nations , climate control , the international court and free trade agreements continue to put the transatlantic partnership to the test .
as a result , politicians in germany have carefully avoided showing public preference for one of the us presidential candidates .
although many may echo the rest of the population in favoring john f. kerry , they have been cautious not to alienate bush .
no matter who the next leader of the united states is , german politicians are hoping for an improvement in diplomatic ties between the two countries during the next four years .
it may not be that easy though , and germany is likely to have to pay a price .
new responsibility for germany wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democrats union , cautioned that a change in us leadership could mean germany taking on greater responsibility .
" our demands for multilateral decision-making and a stronger partnership in transatlantic relations are entirely justified , " he said .
" but at the same time , we should also recognize that this also entails greater efforts on our side . "
" it 's absurd to believe that we can tell the americans what to do while we refuse to get involved , " schäuble said in the run-up to the us election on nov .
2 .
the party leader for the neo-liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , has said the promise of " rejuvenated and rebalanced ties " between germany and the united states will come at a price .
if kerry should win - as many in germany and europe hope is the case - the democratic president will place new demands on berlin .
" this must not necessarily mean that germany will be asked to send troops to iraq , " he said .
" but i expect that a greater role for the german military will indeed be among kerry 's plans for our involvement in other regional hot spots . "
the kerry conundrum many experts believe john kerry would indeed press chancellor schröder even harder than bush to join american efforts in iraq .
if that is the case , the german leader will find himself in an extremely difficult position torn between taking on more international responsibility on the one hand , and sending german troops to iraq - a scenario he has categorically rejected .
schröder 's advisor for transatlantic relations , karsten voigt , has said the chancellor will not rescind his opposition to military intervention .
" in spite of statements by kerry that he wants to involve his european partners more closely and even the likelihood that bush will approach europeans with a new initiative , we can not depart from our position that german troops will not be sent to iraq , no matter who will be the next president . "
redirecting the focus germany 's greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder 's government , have called for the next us president to put more focus on areas other than the fight against terrorism .
party co-leader claudia roth has said the new administration in washington needs to be more pro-active on environmental issues .
" it begins with taking on a greater role in global environmental policy , especially in the field of climate protection which has been entirely abandoned by the bush administration , " she said referring to the current president 's rejection of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
" other areas neglected by the united states are human rights and the international court , whose job it is to prosecute and punish gross violations of such rights . "

" but at the same time , we should also recognize that this also entails greater efforts on our side . "
" it 's absurd to believe that we can tell the americans what to do while we refuse to get involved , " schäuble said in the run-up to the us election on nov .

the party leader for the neo-liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , has said the promise of " rejuvenated and rebalanced ties " between germany and the united states will come at a price .
if kerry should win - as many in germany and europe hope is the case - the democratic president will place new demands on berlin .
" this must not necessarily mean that germany will be asked to send troops to iraq , " he said .
" but i expect that a greater role for the german military will indeed be among kerry 's plans for our involvement in other regional hot spots . "
the kerry conundrum many experts believe john kerry would indeed press chancellor schröder even harder than bush to join american efforts in iraq .
if that is the case , the german leader will find himself in an extremely difficult position torn between taking on more international responsibility on the one hand , and sending german troops to iraq - a scenario he has categorically rejected .
schröder 's advisor for transatlantic relations , karsten voigt , has said the chancellor will not rescind his opposition to military intervention .
" in spite of statements by kerry that he wants to involve his european partners more closely and even the likelihood that bush will approach europeans with a new initiative , we can not depart from our position that german troops will not be sent to iraq , no matter who will be the next president . "
redirecting the focus germany 's greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder 's government , have called for the next us president to put more focus on areas other than the fight against terrorism .
party co-leader claudia roth has said the new administration in washington needs to be more pro-active on environmental issues .
" it begins with taking on a greater role in global environmental policy , especially in the field of climate protection which has been entirely abandoned by the bush administration , " she said referring to the current president 's rejection of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
" other areas neglected by the united states are human rights and the international court , whose job it is to prosecute and punish gross violations of such rights . "
" america should be involved in all of this and should not chose to stand on the sidelines , " roth said . uwe hessler -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what does the us vote mean for germany ?

a vast majority of europeans are hoping for a change in the white house after the us election .
but while john kerry is the candidate of choice , would a democratic administration be the best thing for us-german relations ? us presidential candidate john kerry enjoys great popularity in europe .
in germany , the massachusetts senator commands an overwhelming majority in opinion polls , with almost 80 percent in favor of the democrat . but while the german public favors a change in the white house , deriving mostly from distaste for incumbent george w. bush 's policies , would a kerry administration be the best thing for us-european and , in particular , us-german , relations ? kerry speaks five languages , including fluent french .
he went to school in switzerland .
he takes his vacations in france and has a european-born wife , teresa heinz kerry . jackson janes of the institute for contemporary german studies in washington admitted these were good credentials for a future president .
but he has reservations that these qualities will bring about a white house more endeared to europe . kerry would neither be the opposite of bush nor would he reform us foreign policy to engage with and consider the interests and ideas of europe , janes said .
" this is complete nonsense , " he told german public tv broadcaster ard 's " tagesschau " news program .
" all this friction which is here today , will still be there . " this friction comes in many guises : the bush white house 's refusal to back the kyoto protocol and the international criminal court , us policy in the middle east and israel , the american insistence on the right to defend its own security by force - pre-emptive or preventative - if necessary . different president , same problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry all these points of contention certainly would n't not be resolved from one day to the next ; president kerry would still face the same problems and issues that president bush did .
but a better atmosphere would likely be created if the reins of power were handed over to the democrat . however , it could also lead to more problems than solutions in germany - foremost among them being iraq . if the democratic challenger is elected , his campaign pledge to create a stronger coalition and alliance in iraq could take on contentious and even unsettling dimensions for some european countries , according to us ambassador to germany daniel coats in the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday . " senator kerry has indicated he would ask -lrb- for troops -rrb- , so that 's going to produce some difficult questions and some tensions here between the us and germany - if that happens , " coats told the paper . similar tensions over german stance on iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder chancellor gerhard schröder angered bush during campaigning for the german general elections in sept .
2002 when he vehemently opposed any military " adventure " in iraq .
subsequently , schröder has refused to send any troops to the war-torn country , but germany is helping train iraqi military officers and police outside the country . speaking during campaigning on oct .
5 , kerry acknowledged that foreign powers would not " trade their young for our young in body-bags , " but he said he would be able to get them involved in missions like securing iraq 's borders .
" those borders have become a sieve for weapons of mass destruction and those weapons of mass destruction are terrorists that are crossing them and coming in and blowing themselves up in cars , " he said . kerry added that the current administration had no credibility to enlist us allies .
" every step of the way these folks have pushed them away , " he said .
" what i will do is bring new credibility , a fresh start . " sticky situation for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops in iraq would be on any agenda for germany and a new president .
that could put schröder in a difficult position .
berlin would consider a kerry administration friendly , and germany would be one of the first stops for a new president .
but if that visit included a call for military support in iraq , a potential thawing of relations could quickly turn icy again and a new friend could be swiftly alienated . if , on the other hand , schröder changes track for the new administration , the german chancellor would face outrage at home that could have a decisive influence on his own chances for re-election in 2006 . jackson janes contended that kerry would not demand a troop deployment from schröder .
" i do not believe that he expects germany to send troops to iraq .
but i believe he would expect development aid .
and much more than germany has provided up to now , " janes told german television . re-election less demanding for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president george w. bush bush 's re-election , however , would likely just lead to a continuation of the animosity between the two governments . " i can not imagine that bush would say : what i have done during the first four years was a mistake .
on the contrary , " said janes .

a vast majority of europeans are hoping for a change in the white house after the us election .
but while john kerry is the candidate of choice , would a democratic administration be the best thing for us-german relations ? us presidential candidate john kerry enjoys great popularity in europe .
in germany , the massachusetts senator commands an overwhelming majority in opinion polls , with almost 80 percent in favor of the democrat . but while the german public favors a change in the white house , deriving mostly from distaste for incumbent george w. bush 's policies , would a kerry administration be the best thing for us-european and , in particular , us-german , relations ? kerry speaks five languages , including fluent french .

a vast majority of europeans are hoping for a change in the white house after the us election .
but while john kerry is the candidate of choice , would a democratic administration be the best thing for us-german relations ? us presidential candidate john kerry enjoys great popularity in europe .
in germany , the massachusetts senator commands an overwhelming majority in opinion polls , with almost 80 percent in favor of the democrat . but while the german public favors a change in the white house , deriving mostly from distaste for incumbent george w. bush 's policies , would a kerry administration be the best thing for us-european and , in particular , us-german , relations ? kerry speaks five languages , including fluent french .
he went to school in switzerland .
he takes his vacations in france and has a european-born wife , teresa heinz kerry . jackson janes of the institute for contemporary german studies in washington admitted these were good credentials for a future president .
but he has reservations that these qualities will bring about a white house more endeared to europe . kerry would neither be the opposite of bush nor would he reform us foreign policy to engage with and consider the interests and ideas of europe , janes said .
" this is complete nonsense , " he told german public tv broadcaster ard 's " tagesschau " news program .
" all this friction which is here today , will still be there . " this friction comes in many guises : the bush white house 's refusal to back the kyoto protocol and the international criminal court , us policy in the middle east and israel , the american insistence on the right to defend its own security by force - pre-emptive or preventative - if necessary . different president , same problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate john kerry all these points of contention certainly would n't not be resolved from one day to the next ; president kerry would still face the same problems and issues that president bush did .
but a better atmosphere would likely be created if the reins of power were handed over to the democrat . however , it could also lead to more problems than solutions in germany - foremost among them being iraq . if the democratic challenger is elected , his campaign pledge to create a stronger coalition and alliance in iraq could take on contentious and even unsettling dimensions for some european countries , according to us ambassador to germany daniel coats in the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday . " senator kerry has indicated he would ask -lrb- for troops -rrb- , so that 's going to produce some difficult questions and some tensions here between the us and germany - if that happens , " coats told the paper . similar tensions over german stance on iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder chancellor gerhard schröder angered bush during campaigning for the german general elections in sept .
2002 when he vehemently opposed any military " adventure " in iraq .
subsequently , schröder has refused to send any troops to the war-torn country , but germany is helping train iraqi military officers and police outside the country . speaking during campaigning on oct .
5 , kerry acknowledged that foreign powers would not " trade their young for our young in body-bags , " but he said he would be able to get them involved in missions like securing iraq 's borders .
" those borders have become a sieve for weapons of mass destruction and those weapons of mass destruction are terrorists that are crossing them and coming in and blowing themselves up in cars , " he said . kerry added that the current administration had no credibility to enlist us allies .
" every step of the way these folks have pushed them away , " he said .
" what i will do is bring new credibility , a fresh start . " sticky situation for schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops in iraq would be on any agenda for germany and a new president .
that could put schröder in a difficult position .
berlin would consider a kerry administration friendly , and germany would be one of the first stops for a new president .
but if that visit included a call for military support in iraq , a potential thawing of relations could quickly turn icy again and a new friend could be swiftly alienated . if , on the other hand , schröder changes track for the new administration , the german chancellor would face outrage at home that could have a decisive influence on his own chances for re-election in 2006 . jackson janes contended that kerry would not demand a troop deployment from schröder .
" i do not believe that he expects germany to send troops to iraq .
but i believe he would expect development aid .
and much more than germany has provided up to now , " janes told german television . re-election less demanding for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president george w. bush bush 's re-election , however , would likely just lead to a continuation of the animosity between the two governments . " i can not imagine that bush would say : what i have done during the first four years was a mistake .
on the contrary , " said janes .
re-election , he believes , would be seen as endorsement of the first term and justification for the way the us treats the europeans . either way , the result and the future of us-european relations lies in the hands of american voters , and it will surely be a challenge for all european countries , regardless of whether bush or kerry wins . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house the outcome of the race between george w. bush and john kerry will likely have effects on us-european relations .

but either way , the place to be in germany this week is at one of the many election parties being held in cities around the country . once upon a time , watching the us presidential election coverage in europe was a low-key affair .
maybe some international friends got together and hung out on someone 's living room couch , cracked open a bag of chips and watched cnn .
or maybe they got a good night 's sleep and picked up the returns from the local broadcasters in the morning .
but the days of casual returns watching are gone , along with any traces of indifference about who wins the white house on nov .
2 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate sen. john kerry rarely has a us election been so important to so many people , in europe as well as in the united states .
in turn , watching it has become a big event - at least in germany .
partying through the night over the course of tuesday night and into the early morning wednesday -lrb- due to the time difference , key results are first expected to come in around 2 a.m.
cet -rrb- , major cities in germany will host a number of election parties both private and public .
and to help make it easier to wait through long hours of state-by-state polling results , most of the parties have been jazzed up with political-themed entertainment .
at what may turn out to be the biggest party , on berlin 's central potsdamer platz , monitors are being set up to broadcast election coverage starting at 11:30 p.m. local time .
several hundred night owls are expected to come and watch the returns while enjoying american snacks and live music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush " we 'll serve breakfast in the morning , " a speaker for the cinestar movie theater told the afp news agency .
the theater , which shows films in their original language and estimates that up to a third of its customers are english speaking , will also show previews for the remake of " the manchurian candidate , " due to open in germany on nov .
11 .
the subject of the film is a manipulated us election .
neutral , and not-so-neutral the potsdamer platz party was organized by the group " american voters abroad , " which says it is politically neutral .
no such claims are being made by a group called vote44 , which , according to its website , was created for the sole purpose of ousting george w. bush . along with large screen election-results viewing and live music , filmmaker wim wenders is expected to attend the vote44 party in berlin 's tränenpalast and show his latest movie , " land of plenty , " which takes a critical look at post-sept .
11 america .
along with the usual coverage , the satiric 1997 political movie " wag the dog " - about an administration that fabricates a war in order to cover up a presidential sex scandal - is on the menu at the election bash being thrown by the cologne amerika haus and the konrad adenauer foundation , between cologne and bonn .
this party , too , is set to end with an election breakfast at 6 a.m.
in hamburg , the tivoli theater on the famous reeperbahn nightlife strip will offer american drinks and popcorn to accompany its vote rebroadcasts .
under the motto " do n't spend this night alone , " the tivoli has come up with games to allow partygoers to bet on the outcome in certain states starting at 1 a.m.
in munich 's amerika haus , 800 guests are expected to attend the election night party , including the publisher of the influential die zeit weekly newspaper and other notable locals .
a huge number of people are scrambling for tickets , organizers of the fete say , since " without a ticket , no one gets in , " spokespeople said .
no fun for soldiers ?
while their numbers are diminishing , germany is still home to many us military compounds - full of people who are likely to be most immediately impacted by the election results .
but the bases are probably among the last bastions of chips-on-the-sofa style returns-watching .
spokespeople for the compounds in hanau , ramstein and schweinfurt explained that in an effort to maintain neturality , the military wo n't throw any parties to celebrate their country 's vote . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house the outcome of the race between george w. bush and john kerry will likely have effects on us-european relations .

when american troops marched into iraq without the support of the united nations and all of the nato allies , ties between germany and the us plummeted to an all-time post-war low .
a year later , iraq remains a touchstone of bilateral relations as discussions center around reconstruction and security efforts in the war-torn country .
but beyond iraq , questions about washington 's pre-emptive strike policy , the role of the united nations , climate control , the international court and free trade agreements continue to put the transatlantic partnership to the test .
as a result , politicians in germany have carefully avoided showing public preference for one of the us presidential candidates .
although many may echo the rest of the population in favoring john f. kerry , they have been cautious not to alienate bush .
no matter who the next leader of the united states is , german politicians are hoping for an improvement in diplomatic ties between the two countries during the next four years .
it may not be that easy though , and germany is likely to have to pay a price .
new responsibility for germany wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democrats union , cautioned that a change in us leadership could mean germany taking on greater responsibility .
" our demands for multilateral decision-making and a stronger partnership in transatlantic relations are entirely justified , " he said .
" but at the same time , we should also recognize that this also entails greater efforts on our side . "
" it 's absurd to believe that we can tell the americans what to do while we refuse to get involved , " schäuble said in the run-up to the us election on nov .
2 .
the party leader for the neo-liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , has said the promise of " rejuvenated and rebalanced ties " between germany and the united states will come at a price .
if kerry should win - as many in germany and europe hope is the case - the democratic president will place new demands on berlin .
" this must not necessarily mean that germany will be asked to send troops to iraq , " he said .
" but i expect that a greater role for the german military will indeed be among kerry 's plans for our involvement in other regional hot spots . "
the kerry conundrum many experts believe john kerry would indeed press chancellor schröder even harder than bush to join american efforts in iraq .
if that is the case , the german leader will find himself in an extremely difficult position torn between taking on more international responsibility on the one hand , and sending german troops to iraq - a scenario he has categorically rejected .
schröder 's advisor for transatlantic relations , karsten voigt , has said the chancellor will not rescind his opposition to military intervention .
" in spite of statements by kerry that he wants to involve his european partners more closely and even the likelihood that bush will approach europeans with a new initiative , we can not depart from our position that german troops will not be sent to iraq , no matter who will be the next president . "
redirecting the focus germany 's greens , the junior coalition partner in schröder 's government , have called for the next us president to put more focus on areas other than the fight against terrorism .
party co-leader claudia roth has said the new administration in washington needs to be more pro-active on environmental issues .
" it begins with taking on a greater role in global environmental policy , especially in the field of climate protection which has been entirely abandoned by the bush administration , " she said referring to the current president 's rejection of the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
" other areas neglected by the united states are human rights and the international court , whose job it is to prosecute and punish gross violations of such rights . "
" america should be involved in all of this and should not chose to stand on the sidelines , " roth said . uwe hessler -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what does the us vote mean for germany ?

" hoping to further reconciliation between britain and germany , queen elizabeth called on the two former world war ii foes to learn from history but not be obsessed by the past .
addressing dignitaries in the german capital on tuesday , the british monarch emphasized her country 's current ties with germany and the success of their modern-day partnerships in nato and the european union .
" in remembering the appalling suffering of war on both sides , we recognize how precious is the peace we have built in europe since 1945 , " the 78-year-old queen said at a state banquet attended by german president horst köhler , among others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's queen elizabeth ii and german president horst köhler review the guard of honor in front of the charlottenburg palace in berlin , tuesday , nov .
2 , 2004 .
" we owe it to those who built the partnership to continue the process into the 21st century : to learn from history and not be obsessed by it , to look beyond simplistic stereotypes to realize how often we share the same outlook , " she said .
no apology for bombings queen elizabeth 's three-day visit to germany had been overshadowed by press speculation that she would use the trip to apologize for the allied bombing raid on dresden during world war ii .
however , buckingham palace said germany had made no official request for an apology and german chancellor gerhard schröder said he had told the queen shortly after her arrival that the debate had been " absurd . "
" britain has played a conciliatory role " in improving relations between the two countries , schröder said .
calls for a royal apology circulated in british and german newspapers last week after it became known that the queen planned to attend a benefit concert for the rebuilding of dresden 's historic frauenkirche on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : built in 1738 and completely destroyed in 1945 , dresden 's baroque frauenkirche is being completely restored .
the british monarchy has played a leading role in raising funds for restoring the baroque church - considered one of the most beautiful in europe .
so far some 93 million euros -lrb- $ 118 million -rrb- have been collected .
in june , the duke of kent attended a ceremony to mark the lifting of a new gilded cross atop the church steeple .
an anti-german trick ?
the german press has blamed british media for initiating the rumors of the queen 's apology .
the daily die welt wrote , " this anti-german trick is a way of selling more newspapers . "
" an apology by the queen would be a disservice to british-german relations , it would release animosities that have been kept in check by the very fact that each side has learned to deal with the past in its own way , " the berlin-based paper said .
a controversial editorial published last week in the british tabloid daily mail by right-wing columnist simon heffer generated outrage in germany , where it received widespread coverage .
entitled " sorry , the germans must never be allowed to forget their evil past , " heffer rejected the notion of an apology and accused the germans of trying to " rewrite history .

this will depend upon attitudes and actions in europe more than anything bush can or will do .
the anti-bush , anti-american feelings that rage in europe are the result of many layers of insecurity , inferiority , resentment , envy , fear and arrogance on the part of the citizens of europe .
only they can deal with these . - jl ronish , seattle , usa bild newspaper endorses bush as a us citizen , i 'm not particularly anxious for the support of the german people .
over the last 100 years , germans have demonstrated breathtaking ineptitude regarding world affairs .
as recently as 1972 , germans demonstrated their true colors when they surrendered the munich terrorists to the libyans .
neither germany nor france have ever been particularly reliable allies to the us , and both have preferred to spend too much money on their welfare states while relying on the us for military protection . - joe bowman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild came out strong for bush at the end of october .
support for bush is to be expected from a tabloid .
most tabloids i am aware of are owned by right-wing pro-business individuals .
i am thinking of the murdoch group , for instance .
unfortunately tabloids are influencial .
but in the case of bild , this paper 's opinion does not reflect the majority of german opinion . - serge i applaud bild for the courage to take a stand on this issue despite the fact that a clear majority of germans - and europeans - appear to despise this very principled man -lrb- bush -rrb- without just cause .
it is clear that you have seen through all the rhetoric . - mark beck what a relief to read that there are still a few sound minds left in germany .
i 'm referring to bild 's endorsement of george bush for president .
the united states will grow stronger economically , militarily and otherwise with the re-election of bush .
it 's unfortunate that the majority of germans are too foolish , too liberal that is , to realize that a strong u.s. is a good thing . - carl mahrenholz seems that the reporter is one of the few who has a cogent argument and does not let an antipathy toward bush cloud his judgment .
kerry will be weak on terrorism as a lot of presidents before him , which is the reason the terrorists became more and more emboldened ; the worst thing i see about kerry is that he ca n't make a decision -lrb- clinton could n't either -rrb- - one might not agree with bush 's decisions , but at least he has the guts to make them . - marga e. doerr bush 's record abroad i feel that the reason why bush has such large support in us is due to the privatized and unquestioning media that we are subjected to .
of the world 's media , 5 people own rougly 90 percent of it .
one of those people , rupert murdock , has been quoted as saying that he 'll do anything to have bush reelected .
this is obvious to anyone who has seen even a small amount of fox " news " .
i would like to see a more questioning media in this country . - brad ahrens , usa i believe absentee ballots cast by us voters overseas can make a difference in the election outcome .
furthermore , in allowing for votes to be cast in this fashion , the electoral process strengthens its ' credibility by ensuring that all citizens , regardless of their location , will have their say . - - vijay dasika somerset , nj , usa i am an american expatriate living in the philippines .
i have sent my absentee ballot , at no small expense , in to my state of residence by fedex because i did n't trust the postal system here .
i have no idea if my vote will actually be counted , but my feelings on this election are more intense than any election i have ever voted in .
living overseas i can see more clearly , than americans at home , the affect that president bush is having on the whole world in general and i think that he has impacted on the world in a more negative manner than a positive one .
i do n't doubt the president 's sincerity in what he is doing , but i do think he is on a totally wrong track and it is time for a change in american politics . - james r. beck-jensen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world has been following the race from a european perspective .

but either way , the place to be in germany this week is at one of the many election parties being held in cities around the country . once upon a time , watching the us presidential election coverage in europe was a low-key affair .
maybe some international friends got together and hung out on someone 's living room couch , cracked open a bag of chips and watched cnn .
or maybe they got a good night 's sleep and picked up the returns from the local broadcasters in the morning .
but the days of casual returns watching are gone , along with any traces of indifference about who wins the white house on nov .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate sen. john kerry rarely has a us election been so important to so many people , in europe as well as in the united states .
in turn , watching it has become a big event - at least in germany .
partying through the night over the course of tuesday night and into the early morning wednesday -lrb- due to the time difference , key results are first expected to come in around 2 a.m.
cet -rrb- , major cities in germany will host a number of election parties both private and public .
and to help make it easier to wait through long hours of state-by-state polling results , most of the parties have been jazzed up with political-themed entertainment .
at what may turn out to be the biggest party , on berlin 's central potsdamer platz , monitors are being set up to broadcast election coverage starting at 11:30 p.m. local time .
several hundred night owls are expected to come and watch the returns while enjoying american snacks and live music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush " we 'll serve breakfast in the morning , " a speaker for the cinestar movie theater told the afp news agency .
the theater , which shows films in their original language and estimates that up to a third of its customers are english speaking , will also show previews for the remake of " the manchurian candidate , " due to open in germany on nov .
11 .
the subject of the film is a manipulated us election .
neutral , and not-so-neutral the potsdamer platz party was organized by the group " american voters abroad , " which says it is politically neutral .
no such claims are being made by a group called vote44 , which , according to its website , was created for the sole purpose of ousting george w. bush . along with large screen election-results viewing and live music , filmmaker wim wenders is expected to attend the vote44 party in berlin 's tränenpalast and show his latest movie , " land of plenty , " which takes a critical look at post-sept .
11 america .

maybe some international friends got together and hung out on someone 's living room couch , cracked open a bag of chips and watched cnn .

several hundred night owls are expected to come and watch the returns while enjoying american snacks and live music .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.11.2004 no sorry from the queen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen urged germany and britain to reject national stereotypes queen elizabeth ii stopped short of apologizing for the allies ' bombing of dresden during her first state visit to germany in 12 years and instead acknowledged " the appalling suffering of war on both sides . " hoping to further reconciliation between britain and germany , queen elizabeth called on the two former world war ii foes to learn from history but not be obsessed by the past .
addressing dignitaries in the german capital on tuesday , the british monarch emphasized her country 's current ties with germany and the success of their modern-day partnerships in nato and the european union .
" in remembering the appalling suffering of war on both sides , we recognize how precious is the peace we have built in europe since 1945 , " the 78-year-old queen said at a state banquet attended by german president horst köhler , among others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's queen elizabeth ii and german president horst köhler review the guard of honor in front of the charlottenburg palace in berlin , tuesday , nov .
2 , 2004 .
" we owe it to those who built the partnership to continue the process into the 21st century : to learn from history and not be obsessed by it , to look beyond simplistic stereotypes to realize how often we share the same outlook , " she said .
no apology for bombings queen elizabeth 's three-day visit to germany had been overshadowed by press speculation that she would use the trip to apologize for the allied bombing raid on dresden during world war ii .
however , buckingham palace said germany had made no official request for an apology and german chancellor gerhard schröder said he had told the queen shortly after her arrival that the debate had been " absurd . "
" britain has played a conciliatory role " in improving relations between the two countries , schröder said .
calls for a royal apology circulated in british and german newspapers last week after it became known that the queen planned to attend a benefit concert for the rebuilding of dresden 's historic frauenkirche on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : built in 1738 and completely destroyed in 1945 , dresden 's baroque frauenkirche is being completely restored .
the british monarchy has played a leading role in raising funds for restoring the baroque church - considered one of the most beautiful in europe .
so far some 93 million euros -lrb- $ 118 million -rrb- have been collected .
in june , the duke of kent attended a ceremony to mark the lifting of a new gilded cross atop the church steeple .
an anti-german trick ?
the german press has blamed british media for initiating the rumors of the queen 's apology .
the daily die welt wrote , " this anti-german trick is a way of selling more newspapers . "
" an apology by the queen would be a disservice to british-german relations , it would release animosities that have been kept in check by the very fact that each side has learned to deal with the past in its own way , " the berlin-based paper said .
a controversial editorial published last week in the british tabloid daily mail by right-wing columnist simon heffer generated outrage in germany , where it received widespread coverage .
entitled " sorry , the germans must never be allowed to forget their evil past , " heffer rejected the notion of an apology and accused the germans of trying to " rewrite history .

this will depend upon attitudes and actions in europe more than anything bush can or will do .
the anti-bush , anti-american feelings that rage in europe are the result of many layers of insecurity , inferiority , resentment , envy , fear and arrogance on the part of the citizens of europe .
only they can deal with these . - jl ronish , seattle , usa bild newspaper endorses bush as a us citizen , i 'm not particularly anxious for the support of the german people .
over the last 100 years , germans have demonstrated breathtaking ineptitude regarding world affairs .
as recently as 1972 , germans demonstrated their true colors when they surrendered the munich terrorists to the libyans .
neither germany nor france have ever been particularly reliable allies to the us , and both have preferred to spend too much money on their welfare states while relying on the us for military protection . - joe bowman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild came out strong for bush at the end of october .
support for bush is to be expected from a tabloid .
most tabloids i am aware of are owned by right-wing pro-business individuals .
i am thinking of the murdoch group , for instance .
unfortunately tabloids are influencial .
but in the case of bild , this paper 's opinion does not reflect the majority of german opinion . - serge i applaud bild for the courage to take a stand on this issue despite the fact that a clear majority of germans - and europeans - appear to despise this very principled man -lrb- bush -rrb- without just cause .
it is clear that you have seen through all the rhetoric . - mark beck what a relief to read that there are still a few sound minds left in germany .
i 'm referring to bild 's endorsement of george bush for president .
the united states will grow stronger economically , militarily and otherwise with the re-election of bush .
it 's unfortunate that the majority of germans are too foolish , too liberal that is , to realize that a strong u.s. is a good thing . - carl mahrenholz seems that the reporter is one of the few who has a cogent argument and does not let an antipathy toward bush cloud his judgment .
kerry will be weak on terrorism as a lot of presidents before him , which is the reason the terrorists became more and more emboldened ; the worst thing i see about kerry is that he ca n't make a decision -lrb- clinton could n't either -rrb- - one might not agree with bush 's decisions , but at least he has the guts to make them . - marga e. doerr bush 's record abroad i feel that the reason why bush has such large support in us is due to the privatized and unquestioning media that we are subjected to .
of the world 's media , 5 people own rougly 90 percent of it .
one of those people , rupert murdock , has been quoted as saying that he 'll do anything to have bush reelected .
this is obvious to anyone who has seen even a small amount of fox " news " .
i would like to see a more questioning media in this country . - brad ahrens , usa i believe absentee ballots cast by us voters overseas can make a difference in the election outcome .
furthermore , in allowing for votes to be cast in this fashion , the electoral process strengthens its ' credibility by ensuring that all citizens , regardless of their location , will have their say . - - vijay dasika somerset , nj , usa i am an american expatriate living in the philippines .
i have sent my absentee ballot , at no small expense , in to my state of residence by fedex because i did n't trust the postal system here .
i have no idea if my vote will actually be counted , but my feelings on this election are more intense than any election i have ever voted in .
living overseas i can see more clearly , than americans at home , the affect that president bush is having on the whole world in general and i think that he has impacted on the world in a more negative manner than a positive one .
i do n't doubt the president 's sincerity in what he is doing , but i do think he is on a totally wrong track and it is time for a change in american politics . - james r. beck-jensen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world has been following the race from a european perspective .

the commitment came at a meeting with students , human rights activists and other protest groups from the state .
the controversial law gives the military sweeping powers to arrest , detain and shoot suspects .
manipur has been on the boil since the killing and alleged rape of a manipuri woman held by indian soldiers in july .
since then , popular pressure has mounted on the government to withdraw the armed forces special powers act .
the protests were spearheaded by apunba lup , a collection of 32 students ' and human rights groups , whose members met the prime minister in delhi .
the security forces have opposed the move to lift the act , saying it will undermine their efforts to fight the insurgents .
' humane law ' but on monday , a spokesman for the prime minister said he would consider how a more humane law could be put in place that addressed india 's security concerns while respecting people 's rights .
" the prime minister hopes and believes that the meeting -lsb- with apunba lup -rsb- will add a new chapter to the history of manipur , " the press trust of india quoted the spokesman as saying .
manipur has been hit by protests after the bullet-riddled body of manorama devi was discovered in july , a day after she was arrested by the paramilitary assam rifles .
the government says ms devi was a member of a separatist group but her family denies this .

jaguar said it had been forced to take decisive action because the company was making serious losses .
a union spokesman said the meeting of the trade and industry select committee on tuesday provided an important forum to express concerns .
tony woodley , general secretary of the transport and general workers union , said : " the unions have serious concerns about ford 's decision to end car production at browns lane and wider fears about the company 's intentions for its future in the uk .
' effective case for cuts ' " the trade and industry committee will be an important forum to express our views to mps ahead of their questioning of ford bosses later this month . "
tony murphy from amicus said : " we want to make clear our opposition to ford 's move .
" this is an important forum and we want to make clear that ford have not made an effective case for the cuts .
" the committee 's interest reflects what a vital issue this is , not only for those jaguar workers threatened with redundancy , but for the city of coventry , the west midlands and the future of the car industry in this country . "
plans were announced earlier this month for a march and rally in coventry on 27 november in support of keeping car production at browns lane .

northumbria police is setting up six public protection units , which will also tackle domestic and child abuse .
headed by a detective inspector , each one will co-ordinate work previously split between council child protection units and police officers .
in 2003 some 22,268 incidents of domestic violence were reported to northumbria police .
det supt mike jones of northumbria police said : " experience shows that the same people crop up in all these areas of policing .
" children in a house where there is domestic violence are being abused directly or indirectly and people who are abused are often connected with their abusers .
women victims " by putting an experienced detective mind at the head of each unit , and restructuring our approach , the force is designating vulnerable victims as one of our highest priorities . "
a home office survey in 2000 showed most victims of domestic violence have been abused on many occasions before they seek police involvement .
a study this year showed most women victims had suffered an average of 20 attacks .
det supt jones added : " victims can be assured that we will be supportive and sensitive to their needs .
" it 's very difficult to estimate exactly what the impact on reoffending will be , but i do expect that the number of repeat offences will drop because of the strategies and risk assessments we will be able to put in place . "
the new units will be established in sunderland , south tyneside , gateshead , newcastle , northumberland and north tyneside .

they described the act as one of " political terrorism " so deadly that it was difficult to comprehend .
ripudaman singh malik and ajaib singh bagri are accused of planting a pair of bombs on air india jets in 1985 .
one plane exploded over the atlantic , killing 329 people .
the second bomb killed two baggage handlers in tokyo .
prosecution lawyer robert wright said the guilt of the two men had been proven beyond reasonable doubt .
" this is , in our submission , a politically motivated and terrorist event ... consistent only with a political and religious zealotry , " he said .
defence questions credibility the case prosecutors presented in court is largely circumstantial , based mainly on testimony from people claiming either that the accused asked them to help plant the bombs or that they heard the suspects confess to the crime afterwards .
the air india flight 182 plunged into the atlantic ocean near ireland both defendants deny the allegations outright .
last week defence lawyers attacked the credibility of a key witness and said at least one defendant had no motive .
defence lawyer david crossin said a woman witness might have testified against mr malik simply because she was a disgruntled employee .
the trial has been the longest and most expensive ever mounted in canada .
the final arguments are expected to last several weeks .
there is no jury , so the judge alone will then have the task of sifting through thousands of pages of testimony and producing a verdict .
that is expected some time next year .

they described the act as one of " political terrorism " so deadly that it was difficult to comprehend .
ripudaman singh malik and ajaib singh bagri are accused of planting a pair of bombs on air india jets in 1985 .
one plane exploded over the atlantic , killing 329 people .
the second bomb killed two baggage handlers in tokyo .
prosecution lawyer robert wright said the guilt of the two men had been proven beyond reasonable doubt .
" this is , in our submission , a politically motivated and terrorist event ... consistent only with a political and religious zealotry , " he said .
defence questions credibility the case prosecutors presented in court is largely circumstantial , based mainly on testimony from people claiming either that the accused asked them to help plant the bombs or that they heard the suspects confess to the crime afterwards .
the air india flight 182 plunged into the atlantic ocean near ireland both defendants deny the allegations outright .
last week defence lawyers attacked the credibility of a key witness and said at least one defendant had no motive .
defence lawyer david crossin said a woman witness might have testified against mr malik simply because she was a disgruntled employee .
the trial has been the longest and most expensive ever mounted in canada .
the final arguments are expected to last several weeks .
there is no jury , so the judge alone will then have the task of sifting through thousands of pages of testimony and producing a verdict .
that is expected some time next year .

passenger traffic increased 24 % , while profits surged a forecast-beating 18 % .
net income rose to 200.1m euros -lrb- £ 138.9m , $ 255.1m -rrb- in the six months to september , ahead of analysts ' expectations of 187.6m euros .
the dublin-based airline refused to follow its rivals ' ticket price rises as oil prices surged in recent months .
but , it added that if oil prices remain above $ 50 for the rest of the year it would add 55m euros to budgeted costs .
forecasts revised despite high oil prices , the airline has held back from fuel hedging - which is normally used by airlines to protect themselves from rising oil costs .
in its statement ryanair added the policy would continue until fuel prices returned to " normal " .
meanwhile , the firm also revised its forecasts for a dip in yields - the amount it makes per passenger - to a decline of 5-10 % during the second half of the year from its previous estimates of a 10-20 % drop .
during the first half of the year yields fell 5 % .
ryanair said this was partly due to " the initial impact of the fuel price surcharges imposed by many of our high fare competitors " .

merck withdrew vioxx , a top-selling painkiller , on 30 september after evidence linking it to heart problems .
the wall street journal has now published e-mails which , if genuine , suggest merck may have known about the concerns for years , the paper says .
merck shares closed down 9.7 % on fears of patient lawsuits .
popular drug vioxx is thought to have been prescribed to 20 million patients in the us since its launch in 1999 .
it is used to help patients cope with arthritis pain .
about two million people worldwide were using it when it was recalled in september .
vioxx sales were worth £ 2.5bn -lrb- £ 1.3bn -rrb- to merck in 2003 .
merck already faces patient lawsuits , filed after its decision to recall the drug in september .
investors now fear that the picture could be grimmer and the potential costs higher .
the wall street journal quoted internal company e-mails , including one from merck 's head of research edward scolnick in march 2000 to colleagues saying that cardiovascular problems with vioxx " are clearly there " .
" if the e-mails actually exist and say what they are purported to say , they appear at least superficially to be a smoking gun that lawyers could pull up as evidence against merck , " said drug industry analyst trevor polischuk of orbimed advisors .
the result is likely to be more litigation , though he believes it may be difficult for vioxx users to prove the drug harmed them given that many will have had pre-existing heart problems .
