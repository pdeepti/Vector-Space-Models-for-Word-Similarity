it 's been deprived of one of its most popular tourist destinations for the benefit of the capital .
on top of being the seat of the federal government , berlin is now the home of germany 's national debt clock . " our debt clock depicts the entire scale of this catastrophically high level of debt and its growth , " karl heinz däke , head of the taxpayer watchdog group bund der steuerzähler -lrb- bdst -rrb- , said as the red-numbered digital clock was unveiled on a building façade in the government district wednesday . " i would advise politicians from the federal government and the states to come here as often as possible to get an idea of how high the national debt is and how swiftly it increases , " däke said . the taxpayer group recently moved into the building down the street from the federal finance ministry . nearly too fast for the naked eye the last four digits on the clock move so quickly you can hardly register them .
on friday morning it stood at € 1,361,959,207,548 . every second , germany 's national debt increases by € 2,186 -lrb- $ 2,621 -rrb- , bdst , the self-proclaimed " financial conscience of the nation " calculated .
that figure reflects the average monthly salary of a german employee .
the group estimated that finance minister hans eichel had to spend every fifth euro paid in taxes last year to cover the € 38 billion interest the national debt acquired . as they continually put pressure on politicians to stop the state from racking up more debt , däke and the bdst seem to think their pleas will one day be heard .
at least their clock only has space for 13 digits , suggesting the debt wo n't reach € 10 billion . just days after the clock started ticking in the capital , it 's already hit € 1,361,959,273,128 - and counting . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de massive budget hole hits government hard a panel of fiscal experts on thursday delivered the bad news everyone expected : over the next three years , germany will see tax shortfalls of € 61 billion -lrb- $ 72 billion -rrb- , posing huge problems domestically and for europe .

" the woman told me , well , it 's pretty good what you 're doing here , " he said .
" but gypsy people never lived here .
i thought , maybe she never knew that her neighbors were gypsies . " so deming set out on what has become a quest of sorts , to remember those individuals - jews , homosexuals , jehova 's witnesses , dissenters - who were persecuted and often killed by the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig engraving the plaques he began collecting the names of victims of national socialism and then creating small four-by-four-inch brass-topped plaques with names and dates , which he then embedded into the sidewalk at the address where that person used to live . he called them " stumbling stones " because his idea was that they would make people who came across them pause from their everyday lives and remember that an individual killed by the nazis once lived at that address . the idea has found wide resonance in germany and more then 3,500 of the plaques have been installed in 34 german cities . munich , however , will not be one of them . jewish opposition the city council decided this week , following a proposal from three political parties - the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - to withhold permission to install any of the memorials on public grounds , sidewalks included . in a sometimes explosive public debate , opponents of the project said a broad societal consensus had to be found first . city council members from the green party and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- voted to allow the project to go ahead . those against the stumbling stones project , or stolpersteine in german , said they based their opposition on the opinion of the jewish cultural center of munich and upper bavaria , whose board had strongly disapproved of this form of memorial .
for them , the fact that people would be walking over the names of those killed was unacceptable . " should neo-nazis be able to wipe their dirt from their combat boots on the stones ?

" my idea was to bring the names of people who were deported back to their homes , the houses where they had lived , " demnig said .
" it 's personal .

many of the plaques end with the word auschwitz . barbara becker-jákli is a historian at the el-de-haus in cologne , the city 's former gestapo headquarters that is now a museum and research center on the third reich .
she helps artist demnig find the names and addresses of cologne jews who were deported and killed by hitler 's regime . " people come upon the stones for the first time and want to find out more about the people who are mentioned on them , " she said .
" it puts a human face on the nazi terror .

" the woman told me , well , it 's pretty good what you 're doing here , " he said .
" but gypsy people never lived here .
i thought , maybe she never knew that her neighbors were gypsies . " so deming set out on what has become a quest of sorts , to remember those individuals - jews , homosexuals , jehova 's witnesses , dissenters - who were persecuted and often killed by the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig engraving the plaques he began collecting the names of victims of national socialism and then creating small four-by-four-inch brass-topped plaques with names and dates , which he then embedded into the sidewalk at the address where that person used to live . he called them " stumbling stones " because his idea was that they would make people who came across them pause from their everyday lives and remember that an individual killed by the nazis once lived at that address . the idea has found wide resonance in germany and more then 3,500 of the plaques have been installed in 34 german cities . munich , however , will not be one of them . jewish opposition the city council decided this week , following a proposal from three political parties - the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - to withhold permission to install any of the memorials on public grounds , sidewalks included . in a sometimes explosive public debate , opponents of the project said a broad societal consensus had to be found first . city council members from the green party and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- voted to allow the project to go ahead . those against the stumbling stones project , or stolpersteine in german , said they based their opposition on the opinion of the jewish cultural center of munich and upper bavaria , whose board had strongly disapproved of this form of memorial .
for them , the fact that people would be walking over the names of those killed was unacceptable . " should neo-nazis be able to wipe their dirt from their combat boots on the stones ? " asked marian offman , member of the csu and the board of the jewish group , during the debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , munich mayor christian ude and charlotte knobloch , president of the munich jewish cultural center charlotte knobloch -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , president of the jewish cultural center , said she found it " unbearable " that people would be " stepping all over " the names of murdered jews , although she said the project was " well meant " and she could understand those who were of a different opinion . munich 's mayor , christian ude , said he feared a " surfeit of memorials " and pointed to the planned jewish museum and the annual memorials for the victims of the brutal 1938 anti-jewish pogrom called the " night of broken glass " or at the former dachau concentration camp . one at a time but for demnig and the supporters of his project , the effectiveness of the " stumbling stones " lies in their focus on the individual , something impossible to achieve with large monuments or memorial services . " my idea was to bring the names of people who were deported back to their homes , the houses where they had lived , " demnig said .
" it 's personal .
big monuments are abstract . " the plaques have only a few words on them : the name of the person , a birth date and location followed by a date and place or of death , if known .
many of the plaques end with the word auschwitz . barbara becker-jákli is a historian at the el-de-haus in cologne , the city 's former gestapo headquarters that is now a museum and research center on the third reich .
she helps artist demnig find the names and addresses of cologne jews who were deported and killed by hitler 's regime . " people come upon the stones for the first time and want to find out more about the people who are mentioned on them , " she said .
" it puts a human face on the nazi terror .
we 're seeing a growing interest in this part of our history . " project an expansion course demnig said he often receives calls from individuals and communities - from europe to the u.s. to israel - interested in sponsoring a plaque for € 95 -lrb- $ 113 -rrb- .
demnig will create it and then travel to the city to install it .
since demand has gotten so high , he has had to enlist the aid of volunteers in various cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 1,300 plaques in cologne , 655 in hamburg , around 400 in berlin and others scattered throughout smaller towns and villages .
demnig said plaques are planned for vienna and paris and several other european cities have expressed interest . for now , at least , munich will not join this growing roster of cities .
according to the munich city council 's decision , demnig will now have to remove the stones he has already embedded in that city 's sidewalks . although the city council said it was following the wishes of the jewish community in rejecting the memorials , jewish opinion is far from unanimous on the matter .
michael rado , head of cologne 's jewish community , said he does not agree that the stones in the ground are disrespectful of the memory of those killed .
on the contrary , according to him , many jews feel it is very important to have a marked burial place .
the millions who were gassed and then cremated were denied that . " now they have gravestones , " he said .
" whenever i pass a one of the plaques i see the name .

in the coming weeks , they will be sold - but to whom and at what creative cost remains to be seen . located in the green flatlands just outside berlin , the historic german film studios have a colorful , some might even say checkered past .
they played host to marlene dietrich and fritz lang , served as a backdrop for the production of hundreds of nazi-tainted films between 1933 and the end of the second world war , and became home to the ' defa film ag ' during east german communist rule .
by the time the wall fell , the studios were in a state of serious disrepair and in need of a cash injection .
they were sold by the german government to french compagnie generale des eaux , now the media giant vivendi universal .
for the past 12 years , vivendi has been bent on turning babelsberg into a major european film studio .
but plagued by its own financial troubles , vivendi now has to find someone else to play the lead role .
a sale has been in the pipeline for some time , but vivendi , which will be selling at a loss , wants to ensure that whoever takes the studios on also wants to make them shine . head to head there are only two contenders : studio hamburg , a subsidiary of germany 's ndr public broadcaster , and the management team around thierry potok , current babelsberg ceo , who want to acquire the studios by means of a management buy-out .
the ball is squarely in vivendi 's court , and while they scrutinize the bidders ' credentials , everyone concerned is hanging on tenterhooks .
but it was apparently never going to be an easy casting .
" vivendi is assessing the applicants with the care and consideration necessary to ensure an honorable end to its work , " babelsberg press spokesman felix neunzerling told dw-world .
what potok , a former french government worker and banker , could have on his side is money .
whilst studio hamburg is demanding € 30 million -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- from vivendi to take over its activities , potok has made it clear that he would settle for a modest € 25 million , which is less than it would cost the current owners to close the studios down altogether .
film versus television german media has been making much of the implications of inviting a bonafide television network to run this historic highlight of the european film landscape .
film aficionados have voiced loud concern that a tv organization could sound the death knell for the film face of the studios . ingrid meyer-bosse , press spokeswoman for studio hamburg declined to comment on the path babelsberg would strike under the ndr subsidiary 's control .
" our main area of activity is television , but we also do some films , " meyer-bosse told dw-world .
she stressed that at this point , the company was simply waiting for the outcome of the bid .
studio hamburg already owns the film and television studios in berlin 's adlershof , which was the location for germany 's recent box-office hit , " good bye lenin ! " .
the general feeling in the industry is that under potok 's baton , the studios would be less likely to have their image recast .
but to reduce the issue to film versus television is to make it too black and white .
" ultimately any studio needs both because one ca n't survive without the other .
but the big turnover in a studio like studio babelsberg comes from films , which generate more than 50 percent of the production service turnover , " neunzerling said , adding that the studio was completely booked out .
the big projects shot in babelsberg seem to be getting even bigger .
over the past few years , babelsberg has become a hot tip for hollywood producers looking for studio locations on this side of the atlantic .
roman polanski got the ball rolling with his oscar-winning film " the pianist . "
in the past year , babelsberg has been the location for the jackie chan blockbuster , " around the world in 80 days , " kevin spacey 's " beyond the sea , " and " the bourne supremacy " with matt damon and franka potente .
next on the list is " mission impossible , " starring tom cruise , which will start shooting at the end of august .

germany 's joschka fischer eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings . the first agenda item of the conference is the draft european union constitution , which has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
in the time since , a number of compromises have been forged and its chances of a draft getting approved by the end of the summit have increased dramatically .
" as you would expect , there are different points of view , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country also currently holds the rotating european union presidency .
" but i think we are closing in on the agreement . "
a german government spokesperson said on friday that germany was willing to back the irish proposal , but added that no further changes would get his country 's support , reuters news agency reported . the remaining key sticking points are arguments over the member states ' voting powers .
both poland and spain blocked the draft over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most-populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population on key decisions , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent respectively .
the deal would ensure that the eu 's most populous countries , germany , france and britain , would not be able to instantly overrule middle and smaller sized members .
thursday night , the irish suggested allowing a blocking minority of no less than four states that make up 35 percent of the population .
poland and spain hold out for more neither poland nor spain has thus far agreed to the formula devised by the irish presidency , but polish prime minister marek belka described it thursday as " a step in the right direction . "
a member of the spanish delegation negotiating the deal in brussels told the french news wire agence france presse that although prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero had accepted the principle of the double majority voting system , he was unhappy with the 65 percent of the population figure .
instead , the official said , spain would call for 50 percent of the member states plus an additional member and that the votes represent two-thirds of the total population of the eu .
spain is also seeking to increase its number of seats in the european parliament from the 54 seats foreseen in the draft constitution by " three or five " seats , the delegate told afp .
fierce debate over commission president though prospects appear good for a deal to be reached on the constitution , the horse-trading over who will be the next head of the european commission , the eu 's executive , after romano prodi 's mandate expires in october could be far trickier .
germany and france have both backed liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt as their candidate of choice , but the belgian leader 's leanings toward a federalist europe have made tony blair and british politicians uneasy .
verhofstadt also angered london with his steadfast and very vocal opposition of the united states-led war against iraq .
blair has sought to block verhofstadt 's nomination , and a british government spokesman said greece , italy , poland , portugal and slovenia also opposed the belgian .
instead , london has shown enthusiasm for the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- candidate chris patten , the eu external affairs commissioner .
but friday afternoon a german government source told reuters that patten was no longer a candidate .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , also a potential ccontender for the position , again stressed on friday that he does n't want the job , as did ireland 's ahern , who could garner widespread support , on thursday .
the third tough issue facing summit participants is the role of religion in the constitution .
the draft preamble mentions its importance to european culture , but it does n't explicitly refer to christianity or god .
led by italy and poland , several countries are adamant that it should .
but france and belgium are just as vehement in their opposition of any such mention .
" france is n't anti-christian .
it resolved this type of quarrel 100 years ago .
we 're not going to reopen this debate , " french president chirac told a news conference .

germany 's joschka fischer eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings . the first agenda item of the conference is the draft european union constitution , which has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
in the time since , a number of compromises have been forged and its chances of a draft getting approved by the end of the summit have increased dramatically .
" as you would expect , there are different points of view , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country also currently holds the rotating european union presidency .
" but i think we are closing in on the agreement . "
a german government spokesperson said on friday that germany was willing to back the irish proposal , but added that no further changes would get his country 's support , reuters news agency reported . the remaining key sticking points are arguments over the member states ' voting powers .
both poland and spain blocked the draft over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most-populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population on key decisions , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent respectively .
the deal would ensure that the eu 's most populous countries , germany , france and britain , would not be able to instantly overrule middle and smaller sized members .
thursday night , the irish suggested allowing a blocking minority of no less than four states that make up 35 percent of the population .
poland and spain hold out for more neither poland nor spain has thus far agreed to the formula devised by the irish presidency , but polish prime minister marek belka described it thursday as " a step in the right direction . "
a member of the spanish delegation negotiating the deal in brussels told the french news wire agence france presse that although prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero had accepted the principle of the double majority voting system , he was unhappy with the 65 percent of the population figure .
instead , the official said , spain would call for 50 percent of the member states plus an additional member and that the votes represent two-thirds of the total population of the eu .
spain is also seeking to increase its number of seats in the european parliament from the 54 seats foreseen in the draft constitution by " three or five " seats , the delegate told afp .
fierce debate over commission president though prospects appear good for a deal to be reached on the constitution , the horse-trading over who will be the next head of the european commission , the eu 's executive , after romano prodi 's mandate expires in october could be far trickier .
germany and france have both backed liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt as their candidate of choice , but the belgian leader 's leanings toward a federalist europe have made tony blair and british politicians uneasy .
verhofstadt also angered london with his steadfast and very vocal opposition of the united states-led war against iraq .
blair has sought to block verhofstadt 's nomination , and a british government spokesman said greece , italy , poland , portugal and slovenia also opposed the belgian .
instead , london has shown enthusiasm for the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- candidate chris patten , the eu external affairs commissioner .
but friday afternoon a german government source told reuters that patten was no longer a candidate .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , also a potential ccontender for the position , again stressed on friday that he does n't want the job , as did ireland 's ahern , who could garner widespread support , on thursday .
the third tough issue facing summit participants is the role of religion in the constitution .
the draft preamble mentions its importance to european culture , but it does n't explicitly refer to christianity or god .
led by italy and poland , several countries are adamant that it should .
but france and belgium are just as vehement in their opposition of any such mention .
" france is n't anti-christian .
it resolved this type of quarrel 100 years ago .
we 're not going to reopen this debate , " french president chirac told a news conference .

germany 's joschka fischer eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings . the first agenda item of the conference is the draft european union constitution , which has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
in the time since , a number of compromises have been forged and its chances of a draft getting approved by the end of the summit have increased dramatically .
" as you would expect , there are different points of view , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country also currently holds the rotating european union presidency .
" but i think we are closing in on the agreement . "
a german government spokesperson said on friday that germany was willing to back the irish proposal , but added that no further changes would get his country 's support , reuters news agency reported . the remaining key sticking points are arguments over the member states ' voting powers .
both poland and spain blocked the draft over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most-populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population on key decisions , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent respectively .
the deal would ensure that the eu 's most populous countries , germany , france and britain , would not be able to instantly overrule middle and smaller sized members .
thursday night , the irish suggested allowing a blocking minority of no less than four states that make up 35 percent of the population .
poland and spain hold out for more neither poland nor spain has thus far agreed to the formula devised by the irish presidency , but polish prime minister marek belka described it thursday as " a step in the right direction . "
a member of the spanish delegation negotiating the deal in brussels told the french news wire agence france presse that although prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero had accepted the principle of the double majority voting system , he was unhappy with the 65 percent of the population figure .
instead , the official said , spain would call for 50 percent of the member states plus an additional member and that the votes represent two-thirds of the total population of the eu .
spain is also seeking to increase its number of seats in the european parliament from the 54 seats foreseen in the draft constitution by " three or five " seats , the delegate told afp .
fierce debate over commission president though prospects appear good for a deal to be reached on the constitution , the horse-trading over who will be the next head of the european commission , the eu 's executive , after romano prodi 's mandate expires in october could be far trickier .
germany and france have both backed liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt as their candidate of choice , but the belgian leader 's leanings toward a federalist europe have made tony blair and british politicians uneasy .
verhofstadt also angered london with his steadfast and very vocal opposition of the united states-led war against iraq .
blair has sought to block verhofstadt 's nomination , and a british government spokesman said greece , italy , poland , portugal and slovenia also opposed the belgian .
instead , london has shown enthusiasm for the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- candidate chris patten , the eu external affairs commissioner .
but friday afternoon a german government source told reuters that patten was no longer a candidate .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , also a potential ccontender for the position , again stressed on friday that he does n't want the job , as did ireland 's ahern , who could garner widespread support , on thursday .
the third tough issue facing summit participants is the role of religion in the constitution .
the draft preamble mentions its importance to european culture , but it does n't explicitly refer to christianity or god .
led by italy and poland , several countries are adamant that it should .
but france and belgium are just as vehement in their opposition of any such mention .
" france is n't anti-christian .
it resolved this type of quarrel 100 years ago .
we 're not going to reopen this debate , " french president chirac told a news conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.06.2004 back to the future for babelsberg film studios großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin filming location for the oscar-winning " pianist " is for sale in nearly 100 years of existence , the babelsberg film studios have grown used to addressing the issue of their future .
in the coming weeks , they will be sold - but to whom and at what creative cost remains to be seen . located in the green flatlands just outside berlin , the historic german film studios have a colorful , some might even say checkered past .
they played host to marlene dietrich and fritz lang , served as a backdrop for the production of hundreds of nazi-tainted films between 1933 and the end of the second world war , and became home to the ' defa film ag ' during east german communist rule .
by the time the wall fell , the studios were in a state of serious disrepair and in need of a cash injection .
they were sold by the german government to french compagnie generale des eaux , now the media giant vivendi universal .
for the past 12 years , vivendi has been bent on turning babelsberg into a major european film studio .
but plagued by its own financial troubles , vivendi now has to find someone else to play the lead role .
a sale has been in the pipeline for some time , but vivendi , which will be selling at a loss , wants to ensure that whoever takes the studios on also wants to make them shine . head to head there are only two contenders : studio hamburg , a subsidiary of germany 's ndr public broadcaster , and the management team around thierry potok , current babelsberg ceo , who want to acquire the studios by means of a management buy-out .
the ball is squarely in vivendi 's court , and while they scrutinize the bidders ' credentials , everyone concerned is hanging on tenterhooks .
but it was apparently never going to be an easy casting .
" vivendi is assessing the applicants with the care and consideration necessary to ensure an honorable end to its work , " babelsberg press spokesman felix neunzerling told dw-world .
what potok , a former french government worker and banker , could have on his side is money .
whilst studio hamburg is demanding € 30 million -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- from vivendi to take over its activities , potok has made it clear that he would settle for a modest € 25 million , which is less than it would cost the current owners to close the studios down altogether .
film versus television german media has been making much of the implications of inviting a bonafide television network to run this historic highlight of the european film landscape .
film aficionados have voiced loud concern that a tv organization could sound the death knell for the film face of the studios . ingrid meyer-bosse , press spokeswoman for studio hamburg declined to comment on the path babelsberg would strike under the ndr subsidiary 's control .
" our main area of activity is television , but we also do some films , " meyer-bosse told dw-world .
she stressed that at this point , the company was simply waiting for the outcome of the bid .
studio hamburg already owns the film and television studios in berlin 's adlershof , which was the location for germany 's recent box-office hit , " good bye lenin ! " .
the general feeling in the industry is that under potok 's baton , the studios would be less likely to have their image recast .
but to reduce the issue to film versus television is to make it too black and white .
" ultimately any studio needs both because one ca n't survive without the other .
but the big turnover in a studio like studio babelsberg comes from films , which generate more than 50 percent of the production service turnover , " neunzerling said , adding that the studio was completely booked out .
the big projects shot in babelsberg seem to be getting even bigger .
over the past few years , babelsberg has become a hot tip for hollywood producers looking for studio locations on this side of the atlantic .
roman polanski got the ball rolling with his oscar-winning film " the pianist . "
in the past year , babelsberg has been the location for the jackie chan blockbuster , " around the world in 80 days , " kevin spacey 's " beyond the sea , " and " the bourne supremacy " with matt damon and franka potente .
next on the list is " mission impossible , " starring tom cruise , which will start shooting at the end of august .
if the successful bidder can build on this , it might even be possible to direct the studios out of the red . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin studio plays host to hollywood hollywood 's brightest stars land in berlin to remake a jules verne classic .

in the coming weeks , they will be sold - but to whom and at what creative cost remains to be seen . located in the green flatlands just outside berlin , the historic german film studios have a colorful , some might even say checkered past .
they played host to marlene dietrich and fritz lang , served as a backdrop for the production of hundreds of nazi-tainted films between 1933 and the end of the second world war , and became home to the ' defa film ag ' during east german communist rule .
by the time the wall fell , the studios were in a state of serious disrepair and in need of a cash injection .
they were sold by the german government to french compagnie generale des eaux , now the media giant vivendi universal .
for the past 12 years , vivendi has been bent on turning babelsberg into a major european film studio .
but plagued by its own financial troubles , vivendi now has to find someone else to play the lead role .
a sale has been in the pipeline for some time , but vivendi , which will be selling at a loss , wants to ensure that whoever takes the studios on also wants to make them shine . head to head there are only two contenders : studio hamburg , a subsidiary of germany 's ndr public broadcaster , and the management team around thierry potok , current babelsberg ceo , who want to acquire the studios by means of a management buy-out .
the ball is squarely in vivendi 's court , and while they scrutinize the bidders ' credentials , everyone concerned is hanging on tenterhooks .
but it was apparently never going to be an easy casting .
" vivendi is assessing the applicants with the care and consideration necessary to ensure an honorable end to its work , " babelsberg press spokesman felix neunzerling told dw-world .
what potok , a former french government worker and banker , could have on his side is money .
whilst studio hamburg is demanding € 30 million -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- from vivendi to take over its activities , potok has made it clear that he would settle for a modest € 25 million , which is less than it would cost the current owners to close the studios down altogether .
film versus television german media has been making much of the implications of inviting a bonafide television network to run this historic highlight of the european film landscape .
film aficionados have voiced loud concern that a tv organization could sound the death knell for the film face of the studios . ingrid meyer-bosse , press spokeswoman for studio hamburg declined to comment on the path babelsberg would strike under the ndr subsidiary 's control .
" our main area of activity is television , but we also do some films , " meyer-bosse told dw-world .
she stressed that at this point , the company was simply waiting for the outcome of the bid .
studio hamburg already owns the film and television studios in berlin 's adlershof , which was the location for germany 's recent box-office hit , " good bye lenin ! " .
the general feeling in the industry is that under potok 's baton , the studios would be less likely to have their image recast .
but to reduce the issue to film versus television is to make it too black and white .
" ultimately any studio needs both because one ca n't survive without the other .
but the big turnover in a studio like studio babelsberg comes from films , which generate more than 50 percent of the production service turnover , " neunzerling said , adding that the studio was completely booked out .
the big projects shot in babelsberg seem to be getting even bigger .
over the past few years , babelsberg has become a hot tip for hollywood producers looking for studio locations on this side of the atlantic .
roman polanski got the ball rolling with his oscar-winning film " the pianist . "
in the past year , babelsberg has been the location for the jackie chan blockbuster , " around the world in 80 days , " kevin spacey 's " beyond the sea , " and " the bourne supremacy " with matt damon and franka potente .
next on the list is " mission impossible , " starring tom cruise , which will start shooting at the end of august .

a joint statement concludes that croatia has met the political criteria to join the bloc .
however , some thorny issues remain and the eu is warning that efforts still need to be addressed such as minority rights , refugee returns , reform of the judiciary , regional co-operation , the fight against corruption and crucially co-operation with the international criminal tribunal in the hague .
the document presses zagreb to maintain full co-operation with icty and urges the country to find a transfer former general ante gotovina .
britain and the netherlands have heavily criticized croatia for not being able to bring gotovina to the tribunal .
both countries had refused to ratify an association agreement which paves the way for membership until there was increased co-operation from zagreb .
the netherlands has now ratified the agreement and britain is expected to do so before the summer recess of parliament .
italy is also expected to ratify the agreement after some unrelated issues were resolved .
heads of state and government are also expected to encourage other countries in the western balkans to move towards joining the eu .
the commission is expected to present the framework for talks before its mandate ends in october .

in the coming weeks , they will be sold - but to whom and at what creative cost remains to be seen . located in the green flatlands just outside berlin , the historic german film studios have a colorful , some might even say checkered past .
they played host to marlene dietrich and fritz lang , served as a backdrop for the production of hundreds of nazi-tainted films between 1933 and the end of the second world war , and became home to the ' defa film ag ' during east german communist rule .
by the time the wall fell , the studios were in a state of serious disrepair and in need of a cash injection .
they were sold by the german government to french compagnie generale des eaux , now the media giant vivendi universal .
for the past 12 years , vivendi has been bent on turning babelsberg into a major european film studio .
but plagued by its own financial troubles , vivendi now has to find someone else to play the lead role .
a sale has been in the pipeline for some time , but vivendi , which will be selling at a loss , wants to ensure that whoever takes the studios on also wants to make them shine . head to head there are only two contenders : studio hamburg , a subsidiary of germany 's ndr public broadcaster , and the management team around thierry potok , current babelsberg ceo , who want to acquire the studios by means of a management buy-out .
the ball is squarely in vivendi 's court , and while they scrutinize the bidders ' credentials , everyone concerned is hanging on tenterhooks .
but it was apparently never going to be an easy casting .
" vivendi is assessing the applicants with the care and consideration necessary to ensure an honorable end to its work , " babelsberg press spokesman felix neunzerling told dw-world .
what potok , a former french government worker and banker , could have on his side is money .
whilst studio hamburg is demanding € 30 million -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- from vivendi to take over its activities , potok has made it clear that he would settle for a modest € 25 million , which is less than it would cost the current owners to close the studios down altogether .
film versus television german media has been making much of the implications of inviting a bonafide television network to run this historic highlight of the european film landscape .
film aficionados have voiced loud concern that a tv organization could sound the death knell for the film face of the studios . ingrid meyer-bosse , press spokeswoman for studio hamburg declined to comment on the path babelsberg would strike under the ndr subsidiary 's control .
" our main area of activity is television , but we also do some films , " meyer-bosse told dw-world .
she stressed that at this point , the company was simply waiting for the outcome of the bid .
studio hamburg already owns the film and television studios in berlin 's adlershof , which was the location for germany 's recent box-office hit , " good bye lenin ! " .
the general feeling in the industry is that under potok 's baton , the studios would be less likely to have their image recast .
but to reduce the issue to film versus television is to make it too black and white .
" ultimately any studio needs both because one ca n't survive without the other .
but the big turnover in a studio like studio babelsberg comes from films , which generate more than 50 percent of the production service turnover , " neunzerling said , adding that the studio was completely booked out .
the big projects shot in babelsberg seem to be getting even bigger .
over the past few years , babelsberg has become a hot tip for hollywood producers looking for studio locations on this side of the atlantic .
roman polanski got the ball rolling with his oscar-winning film " the pianist . "
in the past year , babelsberg has been the location for the jackie chan blockbuster , " around the world in 80 days , " kevin spacey 's " beyond the sea , " and " the bourne supremacy " with matt damon and franka potente .
next on the list is " mission impossible , " starring tom cruise , which will start shooting at the end of august .

" the woman told me , well , it 's pretty good what you 're doing here , " he said .
" but gypsy people never lived here .
i thought , maybe she never knew that her neighbors were gypsies . " so deming set out on what has become a quest of sorts , to remember those individuals - jews , homosexuals , jehova 's witnesses , dissenters - who were persecuted and often killed by the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig engraving the plaques he began collecting the names of victims of national socialism and then creating small four-by-four-inch brass-topped plaques with names and dates , which he then embedded into the sidewalk at the address where that person used to live . he called them " stumbling stones " because his idea was that they would make people who came across them pause from their everyday lives and remember that an individual killed by the nazis once lived at that address . the idea has found wide resonance in germany and more then 3,500 of the plaques have been installed in 34 german cities . munich , however , will not be one of them . jewish opposition the city council decided this week , following a proposal from three political parties - the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - to withhold permission to install any of the memorials on public grounds , sidewalks included . in a sometimes explosive public debate , opponents of the project said a broad societal consensus had to be found first . city council members from the green party and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- voted to allow the project to go ahead . those against the stumbling stones project , or stolpersteine in german , said they based their opposition on the opinion of the jewish cultural center of munich and upper bavaria , whose board had strongly disapproved of this form of memorial .
for them , the fact that people would be walking over the names of those killed was unacceptable . " should neo-nazis be able to wipe their dirt from their combat boots on the stones ? " asked marian offman , member of the csu and the board of the jewish group , during the debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , munich mayor christian ude and charlotte knobloch , president of the munich jewish cultural center charlotte knobloch -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , president of the jewish cultural center , said she found it " unbearable " that people would be " stepping all over " the names of murdered jews , although she said the project was " well meant " and she could understand those who were of a different opinion . munich 's mayor , christian ude , said he feared a " surfeit of memorials " and pointed to the planned jewish museum and the annual memorials for the victims of the brutal 1938 anti-jewish pogrom called the " night of broken glass " or at the former dachau concentration camp . one at a time but for demnig and the supporters of his project , the effectiveness of the " stumbling stones " lies in their focus on the individual , something impossible to achieve with large monuments or memorial services . " my idea was to bring the names of people who were deported back to their homes , the houses where they had lived , " demnig said .
" it 's personal .
big monuments are abstract . " the plaques have only a few words on them : the name of the person , a birth date and location followed by a date and place or of death , if known .
many of the plaques end with the word auschwitz . barbara becker-jákli is a historian at the el-de-haus in cologne , the city 's former gestapo headquarters that is now a museum and research center on the third reich .
she helps artist demnig find the names and addresses of cologne jews who were deported and killed by hitler 's regime . " people come upon the stones for the first time and want to find out more about the people who are mentioned on them , " she said .
" it puts a human face on the nazi terror .
we 're seeing a growing interest in this part of our history . " project an expansion course demnig said he often receives calls from individuals and communities - from europe to the u.s. to israel - interested in sponsoring a plaque for € 95 -lrb- $ 113 -rrb- .
demnig will create it and then travel to the city to install it .
since demand has gotten so high , he has had to enlist the aid of volunteers in various cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 1,300 plaques in cologne , 655 in hamburg , around 400 in berlin and others scattered throughout smaller towns and villages .
demnig said plaques are planned for vienna and paris and several other european cities have expressed interest . for now , at least , munich will not join this growing roster of cities .
according to the munich city council 's decision , demnig will now have to remove the stones he has already embedded in that city 's sidewalks . although the city council said it was following the wishes of the jewish community in rejecting the memorials , jewish opinion is far from unanimous on the matter .
michael rado , head of cologne 's jewish community , said he does not agree that the stones in the ground are disrespectful of the memory of those killed .
on the contrary , according to him , many jews feel it is very important to have a marked burial place .
the millions who were gassed and then cremated were denied that . " now they have gravestones , " he said .
" whenever i pass a one of the plaques i see the name .

" so deming set out on what has become a quest of sorts , to remember those individuals - jews , homosexuals , jehova 's witnesses , dissenters - who were persecuted and often killed by the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig engraving the plaques he began collecting the names of victims of national socialism and then creating small four-by-four-inch brass-topped plaques with names and dates , which he then embedded into the sidewalk at the address where that person used to live . he called them " stumbling stones " because his idea was that they would make people who came across them pause from their everyday lives and remember that an individual killed by the nazis once lived at that address . the idea has found wide resonance in germany and more then 3,500 of the plaques have been installed in 34 german cities . munich , however , will not be one of them . jewish opposition the city council decided this week , following a proposal from three political parties - the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - to withhold permission to install any of the memorials on public grounds , sidewalks included . in a sometimes explosive public debate , opponents of the project said a broad societal consensus had to be found first . city council members from the green party and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- voted to allow the project to go ahead . those against the stumbling stones project , or stolpersteine in german , said they based their opposition on the opinion of the jewish cultural center of munich and upper bavaria , whose board had strongly disapproved of this form of memorial .
for them , the fact that people would be walking over the names of those killed was unacceptable . " should neo-nazis be able to wipe their dirt from their combat boots on the stones ? " asked marian offman , member of the csu and the board of the jewish group , during the debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , munich mayor christian ude and charlotte knobloch , president of the munich jewish cultural center charlotte knobloch -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , president of the jewish cultural center , said she found it " unbearable " that people would be " stepping all over " the names of murdered jews , although she said the project was " well meant " and she could understand those who were of a different opinion . munich 's mayor , christian ude , said he feared a " surfeit of memorials " and pointed to the planned jewish museum and the annual memorials for the victims of the brutal 1938 anti-jewish pogrom called the " night of broken glass " or at the former dachau concentration camp . one at a time but for demnig and the supporters of his project , the effectiveness of the " stumbling stones " lies in their focus on the individual , something impossible to achieve with large monuments or memorial services . " my idea was to bring the names of people who were deported back to their homes , the houses where they had lived , " demnig said .
" it 's personal .
big monuments are abstract . " the plaques have only a few words on them : the name of the person , a birth date and location followed by a date and place or of death , if known .
many of the plaques end with the word auschwitz . barbara becker-jákli is a historian at the el-de-haus in cologne , the city 's former gestapo headquarters that is now a museum and research center on the third reich .
she helps artist demnig find the names and addresses of cologne jews who were deported and killed by hitler 's regime . " people come upon the stones for the first time and want to find out more about the people who are mentioned on them , " she said .
" it puts a human face on the nazi terror .
we 're seeing a growing interest in this part of our history . " project an expansion course demnig said he often receives calls from individuals and communities - from europe to the u.s. to israel - interested in sponsoring a plaque for € 95 -lrb- $ 113 -rrb- .
demnig will create it and then travel to the city to install it .
since demand has gotten so high , he has had to enlist the aid of volunteers in various cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 1,300 plaques in cologne , 655 in hamburg , around 400 in berlin and others scattered throughout smaller towns and villages .
demnig said plaques are planned for vienna and paris and several other european cities have expressed interest . for now , at least , munich will not join this growing roster of cities .
according to the munich city council 's decision , demnig will now have to remove the stones he has already embedded in that city 's sidewalks . although the city council said it was following the wishes of the jewish community in rejecting the memorials , jewish opinion is far from unanimous on the matter .
michael rado , head of cologne 's jewish community , said he does not agree that the stones in the ground are disrespectful of the memory of those killed .
on the contrary , according to him , many jews feel it is very important to have a marked burial place .
the millions who were gassed and then cremated were denied that . " now they have gravestones , " he said .

their deception has finally come to light . " bees are n't particularly hardworking , " berlin neurobiologist and zoologist randolf menzel , who has been researching the creatures for nearly 40 years , told german news agency dpa .
" instead they sleep a lot and are rather lazy . " " they spend around 80 percent of the night sleeping , and even during the day they often fly into the hive and give their wings a rest . " but , as if to make up for the inevitable disappointment that his statements would cause , menzel explained that bees have other redeeming qualities .
they are quick learners , recognize various scents and have five memory phases . " if the bee is rewarded once for its behavior , it will remember it for a week .
if it 's rewarded three times , it wo n't forget it for the rest of its life , " menzel said . furthermore , bees ' superb memories allow them to tell the difference between numerous colors and more than 50 scents .
and their sense of smell is similar to that of humans . " what smells good to bees , is also a pleasant smell for people , " menzel said . menzel was awarded a € 10,000 prize last week from the german zoological society for his work with bees . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian haute couture goes to the dogs the owner of a shop selling traditional german clothing has put her talents in the service of man 's best friend , designing lederhosen and other typically bavarian garb for canines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.06.2004 debt clock moves next door to government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerned taxpayers mounted the national debt clock in berlin after strolling past the exclusive boutiques on berlin 's friedrichstrasse , tourists , locals and cabinet members may find solace - or distress - in the capital 's newest sight : the rapidly ticking national debt clock . in decentralized germany , the western city of wiesbaden must be fuming .
it 's been deprived of one of its most popular tourist destinations for the benefit of the capital .
on top of being the seat of the federal government , berlin is now the home of germany 's national debt clock . " our debt clock depicts the entire scale of this catastrophically high level of debt and its growth , " karl heinz däke , head of the taxpayer watchdog group bund der steuerzähler -lrb- bdst -rrb- , said as the red-numbered digital clock was unveiled on a building façade in the government district wednesday . " i would advise politicians from the federal government and the states to come here as often as possible to get an idea of how high the national debt is and how swiftly it increases , " däke said . the taxpayer group recently moved into the building down the street from the federal finance ministry . nearly too fast for the naked eye the last four digits on the clock move so quickly you can hardly register them .
on friday morning it stood at € 1,361,959,207,548 . every second , germany 's national debt increases by € 2,186 -lrb- $ 2,621 -rrb- , bdst , the self-proclaimed " financial conscience of the nation " calculated .
that figure reflects the average monthly salary of a german employee .
the group estimated that finance minister hans eichel had to spend every fifth euro paid in taxes last year to cover the € 38 billion interest the national debt acquired . as they continually put pressure on politicians to stop the state from racking up more debt , däke and the bdst seem to think their pleas will one day be heard .
at least their clock only has space for 13 digits , suggesting the debt wo n't reach € 10 billion . just days after the clock started ticking in the capital , it 's already hit € 1,361,959,273,128 - and counting . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de massive budget hole hits government hard a panel of fiscal experts on thursday delivered the bad news everyone expected : over the next three years , germany will see tax shortfalls of € 61 billion -lrb- $ 72 billion -rrb- , posing huge problems domestically and for europe .

germany 's joschka fischer eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings . the first agenda item of the conference is the draft european union constitution , which has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
in the time since , a number of compromises have been forged and its chances of a draft getting approved by the end of the summit have increased dramatically .
" as you would expect , there are different points of view , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country also currently holds the rotating european union presidency .
" but i think we are closing in on the agreement . "
a german government spokesperson said on friday that germany was willing to back the irish proposal , but added that no further changes would get his country 's support , reuters news agency reported . the remaining key sticking points are arguments over the member states ' voting powers .
both poland and spain blocked the draft over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most-populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population on key decisions , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent respectively .
the deal would ensure that the eu 's most populous countries , germany , france and britain , would not be able to instantly overrule middle and smaller sized members .
thursday night , the irish suggested allowing a blocking minority of no less than four states that make up 35 percent of the population .
poland and spain hold out for more neither poland nor spain has thus far agreed to the formula devised by the irish presidency , but polish prime minister marek belka described it thursday as " a step in the right direction . "
a member of the spanish delegation negotiating the deal in brussels told the french news wire agence france presse that although prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero had accepted the principle of the double majority voting system , he was unhappy with the 65 percent of the population figure .
instead , the official said , spain would call for 50 percent of the member states plus an additional member and that the votes represent two-thirds of the total population of the eu .
spain is also seeking to increase its number of seats in the european parliament from the 54 seats foreseen in the draft constitution by " three or five " seats , the delegate told afp .
fierce debate over commission president though prospects appear good for a deal to be reached on the constitution , the horse-trading over who will be the next head of the european commission , the eu 's executive , after romano prodi 's mandate expires in october could be far trickier .
germany and france have both backed liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt as their candidate of choice , but the belgian leader 's leanings toward a federalist europe have made tony blair and british politicians uneasy .
verhofstadt also angered london with his steadfast and very vocal opposition of the united states-led war against iraq .
blair has sought to block verhofstadt 's nomination , and a british government spokesman said greece , italy , poland , portugal and slovenia also opposed the belgian .
instead , london has shown enthusiasm for the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- candidate chris patten , the eu external affairs commissioner .
but friday afternoon a german government source told reuters that patten was no longer a candidate .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , also a potential ccontender for the position , again stressed on friday that he does n't want the job , as did ireland 's ahern , who could garner widespread support , on thursday .
the third tough issue facing summit participants is the role of religion in the constitution .
the draft preamble mentions its importance to european culture , but it does n't explicitly refer to christianity or god .
led by italy and poland , several countries are adamant that it should .
but france and belgium are just as vehement in their opposition of any such mention .
" france is n't anti-christian .
it resolved this type of quarrel 100 years ago .
we 're not going to reopen this debate , " french president chirac told a news conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.06.2004 back to the future for babelsberg film studios großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin filming location for the oscar-winning " pianist " is for sale in nearly 100 years of existence , the babelsberg film studios have grown used to addressing the issue of their future .
in the coming weeks , they will be sold - but to whom and at what creative cost remains to be seen . located in the green flatlands just outside berlin , the historic german film studios have a colorful , some might even say checkered past .
they played host to marlene dietrich and fritz lang , served as a backdrop for the production of hundreds of nazi-tainted films between 1933 and the end of the second world war , and became home to the ' defa film ag ' during east german communist rule .
by the time the wall fell , the studios were in a state of serious disrepair and in need of a cash injection .
they were sold by the german government to french compagnie generale des eaux , now the media giant vivendi universal .
for the past 12 years , vivendi has been bent on turning babelsberg into a major european film studio .
but plagued by its own financial troubles , vivendi now has to find someone else to play the lead role .
a sale has been in the pipeline for some time , but vivendi , which will be selling at a loss , wants to ensure that whoever takes the studios on also wants to make them shine . head to head there are only two contenders : studio hamburg , a subsidiary of germany 's ndr public broadcaster , and the management team around thierry potok , current babelsberg ceo , who want to acquire the studios by means of a management buy-out .
the ball is squarely in vivendi 's court , and while they scrutinize the bidders ' credentials , everyone concerned is hanging on tenterhooks .
but it was apparently never going to be an easy casting .
" vivendi is assessing the applicants with the care and consideration necessary to ensure an honorable end to its work , " babelsberg press spokesman felix neunzerling told dw-world .
what potok , a former french government worker and banker , could have on his side is money .
whilst studio hamburg is demanding € 30 million -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- from vivendi to take over its activities , potok has made it clear that he would settle for a modest € 25 million , which is less than it would cost the current owners to close the studios down altogether .
film versus television german media has been making much of the implications of inviting a bonafide television network to run this historic highlight of the european film landscape .
film aficionados have voiced loud concern that a tv organization could sound the death knell for the film face of the studios . ingrid meyer-bosse , press spokeswoman for studio hamburg declined to comment on the path babelsberg would strike under the ndr subsidiary 's control .
" our main area of activity is television , but we also do some films , " meyer-bosse told dw-world .
she stressed that at this point , the company was simply waiting for the outcome of the bid .
studio hamburg already owns the film and television studios in berlin 's adlershof , which was the location for germany 's recent box-office hit , " good bye lenin ! " .
the general feeling in the industry is that under potok 's baton , the studios would be less likely to have their image recast .
but to reduce the issue to film versus television is to make it too black and white .
" ultimately any studio needs both because one ca n't survive without the other .
but the big turnover in a studio like studio babelsberg comes from films , which generate more than 50 percent of the production service turnover , " neunzerling said , adding that the studio was completely booked out .
the big projects shot in babelsberg seem to be getting even bigger .
over the past few years , babelsberg has become a hot tip for hollywood producers looking for studio locations on this side of the atlantic .
roman polanski got the ball rolling with his oscar-winning film " the pianist . "
in the past year , babelsberg has been the location for the jackie chan blockbuster , " around the world in 80 days , " kevin spacey 's " beyond the sea , " and " the bourne supremacy " with matt damon and franka potente .
next on the list is " mission impossible , " starring tom cruise , which will start shooting at the end of august .
if the successful bidder can build on this , it might even be possible to direct the studios out of the red . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin studio plays host to hollywood hollywood 's brightest stars land in berlin to remake a jules verne classic .

it 's been deprived of one of its most popular tourist destinations for the benefit of the capital .
on top of being the seat of the federal government , berlin is now the home of germany 's national debt clock . " our debt clock depicts the entire scale of this catastrophically high level of debt and its growth , " karl heinz däke , head of the taxpayer watchdog group bund der steuerzähler -lrb- bdst -rrb- , said as the red-numbered digital clock was unveiled on a building façade in the government district wednesday . " i would advise politicians from the federal government and the states to come here as often as possible to get an idea of how high the national debt is and how swiftly it increases , " däke said . the taxpayer group recently moved into the building down the street from the federal finance ministry . nearly too fast for the naked eye the last four digits on the clock move so quickly you can hardly register them .
on friday morning it stood at € 1,361,959,207,548 . every second , germany 's national debt increases by € 2,186 -lrb- $ 2,621 -rrb- , bdst , the self-proclaimed " financial conscience of the nation " calculated .
that figure reflects the average monthly salary of a german employee .
the group estimated that finance minister hans eichel had to spend every fifth euro paid in taxes last year to cover the € 38 billion interest the national debt acquired . as they continually put pressure on politicians to stop the state from racking up more debt , däke and the bdst seem to think their pleas will one day be heard .
at least their clock only has space for 13 digits , suggesting the debt wo n't reach € 10 billion . just days after the clock started ticking in the capital , it 's already hit € 1,361,959,273,128 - and counting . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de massive budget hole hits government hard a panel of fiscal experts on thursday delivered the bad news everyone expected : over the next three years , germany will see tax shortfalls of € 61 billion -lrb- $ 72 billion -rrb- , posing huge problems domestically and for europe .

their deception has finally come to light . " bees are n't particularly hardworking , " berlin neurobiologist and zoologist randolf menzel , who has been researching the creatures for nearly 40 years , told german news agency dpa .
" instead they sleep a lot and are rather lazy . " " they spend around 80 percent of the night sleeping , and even during the day they often fly into the hive and give their wings a rest . " but , as if to make up for the inevitable disappointment that his statements would cause , menzel explained that bees have other redeeming qualities .
they are quick learners , recognize various scents and have five memory phases . " if the bee is rewarded once for its behavior , it will remember it for a week .
if it 's rewarded three times , it wo n't forget it for the rest of its life , " menzel said . furthermore , bees ' superb memories allow them to tell the difference between numerous colors and more than 50 scents .
and their sense of smell is similar to that of humans . " what smells good to bees , is also a pleasant smell for people , " menzel said . menzel was awarded a € 10,000 prize last week from the german zoological society for his work with bees . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian haute couture goes to the dogs the owner of a shop selling traditional german clothing has put her talents in the service of man 's best friend , designing lederhosen and other typically bavarian garb for canines .

germany 's joschka fischer eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings . the first agenda item of the conference is the draft european union constitution , which has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
in the time since , a number of compromises have been forged and its chances of a draft getting approved by the end of the summit have increased dramatically .
" as you would expect , there are different points of view , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country also currently holds the rotating european union presidency .
" but i think we are closing in on the agreement . "
a german government spokesperson said on friday that germany was willing to back the irish proposal , but added that no further changes would get his country 's support , reuters news agency reported . the remaining key sticking points are arguments over the member states ' voting powers .
both poland and spain blocked the draft over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most-populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population on key decisions , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent respectively .
the deal would ensure that the eu 's most populous countries , germany , france and britain , would not be able to instantly overrule middle and smaller sized members .
thursday night , the irish suggested allowing a blocking minority of no less than four states that make up 35 percent of the population .
poland and spain hold out for more neither poland nor spain has thus far agreed to the formula devised by the irish presidency , but polish prime minister marek belka described it thursday as " a step in the right direction . "
a member of the spanish delegation negotiating the deal in brussels told the french news wire agence france presse that although prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero had accepted the principle of the double majority voting system , he was unhappy with the 65 percent of the population figure .
instead , the official said , spain would call for 50 percent of the member states plus an additional member and that the votes represent two-thirds of the total population of the eu .
spain is also seeking to increase its number of seats in the european parliament from the 54 seats foreseen in the draft constitution by " three or five " seats , the delegate told afp .
fierce debate over commission president though prospects appear good for a deal to be reached on the constitution , the horse-trading over who will be the next head of the european commission , the eu 's executive , after romano prodi 's mandate expires in october could be far trickier .
germany and france have both backed liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt as their candidate of choice , but the belgian leader 's leanings toward a federalist europe have made tony blair and british politicians uneasy .
verhofstadt also angered london with his steadfast and very vocal opposition of the united states-led war against iraq .
blair has sought to block verhofstadt 's nomination , and a british government spokesman said greece , italy , poland , portugal and slovenia also opposed the belgian .
instead , london has shown enthusiasm for the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- candidate chris patten , the eu external affairs commissioner .
but friday afternoon a german government source told reuters that patten was no longer a candidate .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , also a potential ccontender for the position , again stressed on friday that he does n't want the job , as did ireland 's ahern , who could garner widespread support , on thursday .
the third tough issue facing summit participants is the role of religion in the constitution .
the draft preamble mentions its importance to european culture , but it does n't explicitly refer to christianity or god .
led by italy and poland , several countries are adamant that it should .
but france and belgium are just as vehement in their opposition of any such mention .
" france is n't anti-christian .
it resolved this type of quarrel 100 years ago .

germany 's joschka fischer eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings . the first agenda item of the conference is the draft european union constitution , which has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
in the time since , a number of compromises have been forged and its chances of a draft getting approved by the end of the summit have increased dramatically .
" as you would expect , there are different points of view , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country also currently holds the rotating european union presidency .
" but i think we are closing in on the agreement . "
a german government spokesperson said on friday that germany was willing to back the irish proposal , but added that no further changes would get his country 's support , reuters news agency reported . the remaining key sticking points are arguments over the member states ' voting powers .
both poland and spain blocked the draft over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most-populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population on key decisions , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent respectively .
the deal would ensure that the eu 's most populous countries , germany , france and britain , would not be able to instantly overrule middle and smaller sized members .
thursday night , the irish suggested allowing a blocking minority of no less than four states that make up 35 percent of the population .
poland and spain hold out for more neither poland nor spain has thus far agreed to the formula devised by the irish presidency , but polish prime minister marek belka described it thursday as " a step in the right direction . "
a member of the spanish delegation negotiating the deal in brussels told the french news wire agence france presse that although prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero had accepted the principle of the double majority voting system , he was unhappy with the 65 percent of the population figure .
instead , the official said , spain would call for 50 percent of the member states plus an additional member and that the votes represent two-thirds of the total population of the eu .
spain is also seeking to increase its number of seats in the european parliament from the 54 seats foreseen in the draft constitution by " three or five " seats , the delegate told afp .
fierce debate over commission president though prospects appear good for a deal to be reached on the constitution , the horse-trading over who will be the next head of the european commission , the eu 's executive , after romano prodi 's mandate expires in october could be far trickier .
germany and france have both backed liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt as their candidate of choice , but the belgian leader 's leanings toward a federalist europe have made tony blair and british politicians uneasy .
verhofstadt also angered london with his steadfast and very vocal opposition of the united states-led war against iraq .
blair has sought to block verhofstadt 's nomination , and a british government spokesman said greece , italy , poland , portugal and slovenia also opposed the belgian .
instead , london has shown enthusiasm for the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- candidate chris patten , the eu external affairs commissioner .
but friday afternoon a german government source told reuters that patten was no longer a candidate .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , also a potential ccontender for the position , again stressed on friday that he does n't want the job , as did ireland 's ahern , who could garner widespread support , on thursday .
the third tough issue facing summit participants is the role of religion in the constitution .
the draft preamble mentions its importance to european culture , but it does n't explicitly refer to christianity or god .
led by italy and poland , several countries are adamant that it should .
but france and belgium are just as vehement in their opposition of any such mention .

a joint statement concludes that croatia has met the political criteria to join the bloc .
however , some thorny issues remain and the eu is warning that efforts still need to be addressed such as minority rights , refugee returns , reform of the judiciary , regional co-operation , the fight against corruption and crucially co-operation with the international criminal tribunal in the hague .
the document presses zagreb to maintain full co-operation with icty and urges the country to find a transfer former general ante gotovina .
britain and the netherlands have heavily criticized croatia for not being able to bring gotovina to the tribunal .
both countries had refused to ratify an association agreement which paves the way for membership until there was increased co-operation from zagreb .
the netherlands has now ratified the agreement and britain is expected to do so before the summer recess of parliament .
italy is also expected to ratify the agreement after some unrelated issues were resolved .
heads of state and government are also expected to encourage other countries in the western balkans to move towards joining the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.06.2004 munich decides against " stumbling stone " holocaust memorials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering victims of the holocaust , one person at a time a project to memorialize individuals killed by the nazis by embedding small name plaques on sidewalks has been rejected by the city of munich , even though the memorials are present in 34 other cities and towns . the original idea to create the " stumbling stones " came to gunter demnig , an artist from cologne , when an elderly woman approached him as while he was working on another project - one which traced the path the city 's sinti and roma , also known as gypsies , were forced to march on their way to deportation trains . " the woman told me , well , it 's pretty good what you 're doing here , " he said .
" but gypsy people never lived here .
i thought , maybe she never knew that her neighbors were gypsies . " so deming set out on what has become a quest of sorts , to remember those individuals - jews , homosexuals , jehova 's witnesses , dissenters - who were persecuted and often killed by the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig engraving the plaques he began collecting the names of victims of national socialism and then creating small four-by-four-inch brass-topped plaques with names and dates , which he then embedded into the sidewalk at the address where that person used to live . he called them " stumbling stones " because his idea was that they would make people who came across them pause from their everyday lives and remember that an individual killed by the nazis once lived at that address . the idea has found wide resonance in germany and more then 3,500 of the plaques have been installed in 34 german cities . munich , however , will not be one of them . jewish opposition the city council decided this week , following a proposal from three political parties - the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - to withhold permission to install any of the memorials on public grounds , sidewalks included . in a sometimes explosive public debate , opponents of the project said a broad societal consensus had to be found first . city council members from the green party and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- voted to allow the project to go ahead . those against the stumbling stones project , or stolpersteine in german , said they based their opposition on the opinion of the jewish cultural center of munich and upper bavaria , whose board had strongly disapproved of this form of memorial .
for them , the fact that people would be walking over the names of those killed was unacceptable . " should neo-nazis be able to wipe their dirt from their combat boots on the stones ? " asked marian offman , member of the csu and the board of the jewish group , during the debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , munich mayor christian ude and charlotte knobloch , president of the munich jewish cultural center charlotte knobloch -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , president of the jewish cultural center , said she found it " unbearable " that people would be " stepping all over " the names of murdered jews , although she said the project was " well meant " and she could understand those who were of a different opinion . munich 's mayor , christian ude , said he feared a " surfeit of memorials " and pointed to the planned jewish museum and the annual memorials for the victims of the brutal 1938 anti-jewish pogrom called the " night of broken glass " or at the former dachau concentration camp . one at a time but for demnig and the supporters of his project , the effectiveness of the " stumbling stones " lies in their focus on the individual , something impossible to achieve with large monuments or memorial services . " my idea was to bring the names of people who were deported back to their homes , the houses where they had lived , " demnig said .
" it 's personal .
big monuments are abstract . " the plaques have only a few words on them : the name of the person , a birth date and location followed by a date and place or of death , if known .
many of the plaques end with the word auschwitz . barbara becker-jákli is a historian at the el-de-haus in cologne , the city 's former gestapo headquarters that is now a museum and research center on the third reich .
she helps artist demnig find the names and addresses of cologne jews who were deported and killed by hitler 's regime . " people come upon the stones for the first time and want to find out more about the people who are mentioned on them , " she said .
" it puts a human face on the nazi terror .
we 're seeing a growing interest in this part of our history . " project an expansion course demnig said he often receives calls from individuals and communities - from europe to the u.s. to israel - interested in sponsoring a plaque for € 95 -lrb- $ 113 -rrb- .
demnig will create it and then travel to the city to install it .
since demand has gotten so high , he has had to enlist the aid of volunteers in various cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 1,300 plaques in cologne , 655 in hamburg , around 400 in berlin and others scattered throughout smaller towns and villages .

" the woman told me , well , it 's pretty good what you 're doing here , " he said .
" but gypsy people never lived here .
i thought , maybe she never knew that her neighbors were gypsies . " so deming set out on what has become a quest of sorts , to remember those individuals - jews , homosexuals , jehova 's witnesses , dissenters - who were persecuted and often killed by the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig engraving the plaques he began collecting the names of victims of national socialism and then creating small four-by-four-inch brass-topped plaques with names and dates , which he then embedded into the sidewalk at the address where that person used to live . he called them " stumbling stones " because his idea was that they would make people who came across them pause from their everyday lives and remember that an individual killed by the nazis once lived at that address . the idea has found wide resonance in germany and more then 3,500 of the plaques have been installed in 34 german cities . munich , however , will not be one of them . jewish opposition the city council decided this week , following a proposal from three political parties - the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - to withhold permission to install any of the memorials on public grounds , sidewalks included . in a sometimes explosive public debate , opponents of the project said a broad societal consensus had to be found first . city council members from the green party and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- voted to allow the project to go ahead . those against the stumbling stones project , or stolpersteine in german , said they based their opposition on the opinion of the jewish cultural center of munich and upper bavaria , whose board had strongly disapproved of this form of memorial .
for them , the fact that people would be walking over the names of those killed was unacceptable . " should neo-nazis be able to wipe their dirt from their combat boots on the stones ? " asked marian offman , member of the csu and the board of the jewish group , during the debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , munich mayor christian ude and charlotte knobloch , president of the munich jewish cultural center charlotte knobloch -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , president of the jewish cultural center , said she found it " unbearable " that people would be " stepping all over " the names of murdered jews , although she said the project was " well meant " and she could understand those who were of a different opinion . munich 's mayor , christian ude , said he feared a " surfeit of memorials " and pointed to the planned jewish museum and the annual memorials for the victims of the brutal 1938 anti-jewish pogrom called the " night of broken glass " or at the former dachau concentration camp . one at a time but for demnig and the supporters of his project , the effectiveness of the " stumbling stones " lies in their focus on the individual , something impossible to achieve with large monuments or memorial services . " my idea was to bring the names of people who were deported back to their homes , the houses where they had lived , " demnig said .
" it 's personal .
big monuments are abstract . " the plaques have only a few words on them : the name of the person , a birth date and location followed by a date and place or of death , if known .
many of the plaques end with the word auschwitz . barbara becker-jákli is a historian at the el-de-haus in cologne , the city 's former gestapo headquarters that is now a museum and research center on the third reich .
she helps artist demnig find the names and addresses of cologne jews who were deported and killed by hitler 's regime . " people come upon the stones for the first time and want to find out more about the people who are mentioned on them , " she said .
" it puts a human face on the nazi terror .
we 're seeing a growing interest in this part of our history . " project an expansion course demnig said he often receives calls from individuals and communities - from europe to the u.s. to israel - interested in sponsoring a plaque for € 95 -lrb- $ 113 -rrb- .
demnig will create it and then travel to the city to install it .
since demand has gotten so high , he has had to enlist the aid of volunteers in various cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 1,300 plaques in cologne , 655 in hamburg , around 400 in berlin and others scattered throughout smaller towns and villages .
demnig said plaques are planned for vienna and paris and several other european cities have expressed interest . for now , at least , munich will not join this growing roster of cities .

germany 's joschka fischer eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings . the first agenda item of the conference is the draft european union constitution , which has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
in the time since , a number of compromises have been forged and its chances of a draft getting approved by the end of the summit have increased dramatically .
" as you would expect , there are different points of view , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country also currently holds the rotating european union presidency .
" but i think we are closing in on the agreement . "
a german government spokesperson said on friday that germany was willing to back the irish proposal , but added that no further changes would get his country 's support , reuters news agency reported . the remaining key sticking points are arguments over the member states ' voting powers .
both poland and spain blocked the draft over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most-populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population on key decisions , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent respectively .
the deal would ensure that the eu 's most populous countries , germany , france and britain , would not be able to instantly overrule middle and smaller sized members .
thursday night , the irish suggested allowing a blocking minority of no less than four states that make up 35 percent of the population .
poland and spain hold out for more neither poland nor spain has thus far agreed to the formula devised by the irish presidency , but polish prime minister marek belka described it thursday as " a step in the right direction . "
a member of the spanish delegation negotiating the deal in brussels told the french news wire agence france presse that although prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero had accepted the principle of the double majority voting system , he was unhappy with the 65 percent of the population figure .
instead , the official said , spain would call for 50 percent of the member states plus an additional member and that the votes represent two-thirds of the total population of the eu .
spain is also seeking to increase its number of seats in the european parliament from the 54 seats foreseen in the draft constitution by " three or five " seats , the delegate told afp .
fierce debate over commission president though prospects appear good for a deal to be reached on the constitution , the horse-trading over who will be the next head of the european commission , the eu 's executive , after romano prodi 's mandate expires in october could be far trickier .
germany and france have both backed liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt as their candidate of choice , but the belgian leader 's leanings toward a federalist europe have made tony blair and british politicians uneasy .
verhofstadt also angered london with his steadfast and very vocal opposition of the united states-led war against iraq .
blair has sought to block verhofstadt 's nomination , and a british government spokesman said greece , italy , poland , portugal and slovenia also opposed the belgian .
instead , london has shown enthusiasm for the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- candidate chris patten , the eu external affairs commissioner .
but friday afternoon a german government source told reuters that patten was no longer a candidate .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , also a potential ccontender for the position , again stressed on friday that he does n't want the job , as did ireland 's ahern , who could garner widespread support , on thursday .
the third tough issue facing summit participants is the role of religion in the constitution .
the draft preamble mentions its importance to european culture , but it does n't explicitly refer to christianity or god .
led by italy and poland , several countries are adamant that it should .
but france and belgium are just as vehement in their opposition of any such mention .
" france is n't anti-christian .

germany 's joschka fischer eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings . the first agenda item of the conference is the draft european union constitution , which has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
in the time since , a number of compromises have been forged and its chances of a draft getting approved by the end of the summit have increased dramatically .
" as you would expect , there are different points of view , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country also currently holds the rotating european union presidency .
" but i think we are closing in on the agreement . "
a german government spokesperson said on friday that germany was willing to back the irish proposal , but added that no further changes would get his country 's support , reuters news agency reported . the remaining key sticking points are arguments over the member states ' voting powers .
both poland and spain blocked the draft over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most-populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population on key decisions , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent respectively .
the deal would ensure that the eu 's most populous countries , germany , france and britain , would not be able to instantly overrule middle and smaller sized members .
thursday night , the irish suggested allowing a blocking minority of no less than four states that make up 35 percent of the population .
poland and spain hold out for more neither poland nor spain has thus far agreed to the formula devised by the irish presidency , but polish prime minister marek belka described it thursday as " a step in the right direction . "
a member of the spanish delegation negotiating the deal in brussels told the french news wire agence france presse that although prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero had accepted the principle of the double majority voting system , he was unhappy with the 65 percent of the population figure .
instead , the official said , spain would call for 50 percent of the member states plus an additional member and that the votes represent two-thirds of the total population of the eu .
spain is also seeking to increase its number of seats in the european parliament from the 54 seats foreseen in the draft constitution by " three or five " seats , the delegate told afp .
fierce debate over commission president though prospects appear good for a deal to be reached on the constitution , the horse-trading over who will be the next head of the european commission , the eu 's executive , after romano prodi 's mandate expires in october could be far trickier .
germany and france have both backed liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt as their candidate of choice , but the belgian leader 's leanings toward a federalist europe have made tony blair and british politicians uneasy .
verhofstadt also angered london with his steadfast and very vocal opposition of the united states-led war against iraq .
blair has sought to block verhofstadt 's nomination , and a british government spokesman said greece , italy , poland , portugal and slovenia also opposed the belgian .
instead , london has shown enthusiasm for the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- candidate chris patten , the eu external affairs commissioner .
but friday afternoon a german government source told reuters that patten was no longer a candidate .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , also a potential ccontender for the position , again stressed on friday that he does n't want the job , as did ireland 's ahern , who could garner widespread support , on thursday .

in the coming weeks , they will be sold - but to whom and at what creative cost remains to be seen . located in the green flatlands just outside berlin , the historic german film studios have a colorful , some might even say checkered past .
they played host to marlene dietrich and fritz lang , served as a backdrop for the production of hundreds of nazi-tainted films between 1933 and the end of the second world war , and became home to the ' defa film ag ' during east german communist rule .
by the time the wall fell , the studios were in a state of serious disrepair and in need of a cash injection .
they were sold by the german government to french compagnie generale des eaux , now the media giant vivendi universal .
for the past 12 years , vivendi has been bent on turning babelsberg into a major european film studio .
but plagued by its own financial troubles , vivendi now has to find someone else to play the lead role .
a sale has been in the pipeline for some time , but vivendi , which will be selling at a loss , wants to ensure that whoever takes the studios on also wants to make them shine . head to head there are only two contenders : studio hamburg , a subsidiary of germany 's ndr public broadcaster , and the management team around thierry potok , current babelsberg ceo , who want to acquire the studios by means of a management buy-out .
the ball is squarely in vivendi 's court , and while they scrutinize the bidders ' credentials , everyone concerned is hanging on tenterhooks .
but it was apparently never going to be an easy casting .
" vivendi is assessing the applicants with the care and consideration necessary to ensure an honorable end to its work , " babelsberg press spokesman felix neunzerling told dw-world .
what potok , a former french government worker and banker , could have on his side is money .
whilst studio hamburg is demanding € 30 million -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- from vivendi to take over its activities , potok has made it clear that he would settle for a modest € 25 million , which is less than it would cost the current owners to close the studios down altogether .
film versus television german media has been making much of the implications of inviting a bonafide television network to run this historic highlight of the european film landscape .
film aficionados have voiced loud concern that a tv organization could sound the death knell for the film face of the studios . ingrid meyer-bosse , press spokeswoman for studio hamburg declined to comment on the path babelsberg would strike under the ndr subsidiary 's control .
" our main area of activity is television , but we also do some films , " meyer-bosse told dw-world .
she stressed that at this point , the company was simply waiting for the outcome of the bid .
studio hamburg already owns the film and television studios in berlin 's adlershof , which was the location for germany 's recent box-office hit , " good bye lenin ! " .
the general feeling in the industry is that under potok 's baton , the studios would be less likely to have their image recast .
but to reduce the issue to film versus television is to make it too black and white .
" ultimately any studio needs both because one ca n't survive without the other .
but the big turnover in a studio like studio babelsberg comes from films , which generate more than 50 percent of the production service turnover , " neunzerling said , adding that the studio was completely booked out .
the big projects shot in babelsberg seem to be getting even bigger .
over the past few years , babelsberg has become a hot tip for hollywood producers looking for studio locations on this side of the atlantic .
roman polanski got the ball rolling with his oscar-winning film " the pianist . "
in the past year , babelsberg has been the location for the jackie chan blockbuster , " around the world in 80 days , " kevin spacey 's " beyond the sea , " and " the bourne supremacy " with matt damon and franka potente .
next on the list is " mission impossible , " starring tom cruise , which will start shooting at the end of august .

in the coming weeks , they will be sold - but to whom and at what creative cost remains to be seen . located in the green flatlands just outside berlin , the historic german film studios have a colorful , some might even say checkered past .
they played host to marlene dietrich and fritz lang , served as a backdrop for the production of hundreds of nazi-tainted films between 1933 and the end of the second world war , and became home to the ' defa film ag ' during east german communist rule .
by the time the wall fell , the studios were in a state of serious disrepair and in need of a cash injection .
they were sold by the german government to french compagnie generale des eaux , now the media giant vivendi universal .
for the past 12 years , vivendi has been bent on turning babelsberg into a major european film studio .
but plagued by its own financial troubles , vivendi now has to find someone else to play the lead role .
a sale has been in the pipeline for some time , but vivendi , which will be selling at a loss , wants to ensure that whoever takes the studios on also wants to make them shine . head to head there are only two contenders : studio hamburg , a subsidiary of germany 's ndr public broadcaster , and the management team around thierry potok , current babelsberg ceo , who want to acquire the studios by means of a management buy-out .
the ball is squarely in vivendi 's court , and while they scrutinize the bidders ' credentials , everyone concerned is hanging on tenterhooks .
but it was apparently never going to be an easy casting .
" vivendi is assessing the applicants with the care and consideration necessary to ensure an honorable end to its work , " babelsberg press spokesman felix neunzerling told dw-world .
what potok , a former french government worker and banker , could have on his side is money .
whilst studio hamburg is demanding € 30 million -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- from vivendi to take over its activities , potok has made it clear that he would settle for a modest € 25 million , which is less than it would cost the current owners to close the studios down altogether .
film versus television german media has been making much of the implications of inviting a bonafide television network to run this historic highlight of the european film landscape .
film aficionados have voiced loud concern that a tv organization could sound the death knell for the film face of the studios . ingrid meyer-bosse , press spokeswoman for studio hamburg declined to comment on the path babelsberg would strike under the ndr subsidiary 's control .
" our main area of activity is television , but we also do some films , " meyer-bosse told dw-world .
she stressed that at this point , the company was simply waiting for the outcome of the bid .
studio hamburg already owns the film and television studios in berlin 's adlershof , which was the location for germany 's recent box-office hit , " good bye lenin ! " .
the general feeling in the industry is that under potok 's baton , the studios would be less likely to have their image recast .
but to reduce the issue to film versus television is to make it too black and white .
" ultimately any studio needs both because one ca n't survive without the other .
but the big turnover in a studio like studio babelsberg comes from films , which generate more than 50 percent of the production service turnover , " neunzerling said , adding that the studio was completely booked out .
the big projects shot in babelsberg seem to be getting even bigger .
over the past few years , babelsberg has become a hot tip for hollywood producers looking for studio locations on this side of the atlantic .
roman polanski got the ball rolling with his oscar-winning film " the pianist . "
in the past year , babelsberg has been the location for the jackie chan blockbuster , " around the world in 80 days , " kevin spacey 's " beyond the sea , " and " the bourne supremacy " with matt damon and franka potente .
next on the list is " mission impossible , " starring tom cruise , which will start shooting at the end of august .

" ultimately any studio needs both because one ca n't survive without the other .
but the big turnover in a studio like studio babelsberg comes from films , which generate more than 50 percent of the production service turnover , " neunzerling said , adding that the studio was completely booked out .
the big projects shot in babelsberg seem to be getting even bigger .
over the past few years , babelsberg has become a hot tip for hollywood producers looking for studio locations on this side of the atlantic .
roman polanski got the ball rolling with his oscar-winning film " the pianist . "
in the past year , babelsberg has been the location for the jackie chan blockbuster , " around the world in 80 days , " kevin spacey 's " beyond the sea , " and " the bourne supremacy " with matt damon and franka potente .
next on the list is " mission impossible , " starring tom cruise , which will start shooting at the end of august .
if the successful bidder can build on this , it might even be possible to direct the studios out of the red . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin studio plays host to hollywood hollywood 's brightest stars land in berlin to remake a jules verne classic .

" our membership in the eu has turned from a distant dream into a close reality , " he told bulgarian public broadcaster bnt . irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country holds the eu presidency , added that " this is a very positive achievement .
it sends out a clear signal that momentum is being maintained in the accession process . "
coming six months ahead of schedule , he pointed out that " this is a major success for bulgaria . " reform still needed eu leaders will be reviewing the accession treaty at their december summit .
if they approve it , it will be signed in spring 2005 . bulgarian foreign minister solomon passy said the talks marked the end of a crucial phase and stressed that over the next two and a half years , the country would be implementing the various commitments made during the negotiations to ensure bulgaria was ready to enter on january 1 , 2007 , when the eu makes its second eastward expansion . new monitoring system may delay entry but the provisional deal also includes a controversial new " safeguard clause " which gives the eu an emergency break measure to delay bulgaria 's entry for up to a year if a tough new monitoring system concludes bulgaria has failed to introduce the necessary reforms . günter verheugen , the eu expansion commissioner , warned that bulgaria still has a lot of work to do .
verheugen said the government still has to " improve its record " in fighting corruption and organized crime . mixed feelings nonetheless , progress has clearly been made .
tourism and industry are growth sectors , with germany one of bulgaria 's most important economic partners .
mitko vassilev , chairman of business club of german economy in bulgaria and a member of the board of bulgaria economic forum , cited numerous examples of german investment . " there 's the metro cash & carry , refrigerator manufacturer liebherr , knauf and waz group , " he said , pointing out that a medium-sized textile business also created 2,200 jobs in the region , exporting mens ' suits to western europe . the mood on the street , meanwhile , is optimistic but reserved .
one young computer programmer told bavarian public broadcaster br that he was in favor of eu accession .
" most of the students i graduated with have gone abroad , " he said .
but the country is becoming increasingly attractive .
he points out that " now they might consider returning .
there are lots of job opportunities for graduates in bulgaria . " for others , though , joining the exclusive eu club wo n't help anything .
small farmers and bulgaria 's roma minority , for example , see a bleak future ahead of them .
" people used to have more respect for us , " said one roma street sweeper .
but now , she added , they are more and more marginalized .
" we used to get decent factory jobs , but these days all you can do if you only have a primary school education is everyone 's dirty work . " sergei stanishev , leader of bulgaria 's socialist opposition , also believes sofia has been over-hasty .
" unfortunately , the government chose speed over quality , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de year-long delay possible for future eu members the eu will be able to delay bulgaria and romania from joining the bloc for a year under a new safeguard clause now being proposed .

their deception has finally come to light . " bees are n't particularly hardworking , " berlin neurobiologist and zoologist randolf menzel , who has been researching the creatures for nearly 40 years , told german news agency dpa .
" instead they sleep a lot and are rather lazy . " " they spend around 80 percent of the night sleeping , and even during the day they often fly into the hive and give their wings a rest . " but , as if to make up for the inevitable disappointment that his statements would cause , menzel explained that bees have other redeeming qualities .
they are quick learners , recognize various scents and have five memory phases . " if the bee is rewarded once for its behavior , it will remember it for a week .
if it 's rewarded three times , it wo n't forget it for the rest of its life , " menzel said . furthermore , bees ' superb memories allow them to tell the difference between numerous colors and more than 50 scents .
and their sense of smell is similar to that of humans . " what smells good to bees , is also a pleasant smell for people , " menzel said . menzel was awarded a € 10,000 prize last week from the german zoological society for his work with bees . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian haute couture goes to the dogs the owner of a shop selling traditional german clothing has put her talents in the service of man 's best friend , designing lederhosen and other typically bavarian garb for canines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.06.2004 munich decides against " stumbling stone " holocaust memorials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering victims of the holocaust , one person at a time a project to memorialize individuals killed by the nazis by embedding small name plaques on sidewalks has been rejected by the city of munich , even though the memorials are present in 34 other cities and towns . the original idea to create the " stumbling stones " came to gunter demnig , an artist from cologne , when an elderly woman approached him as while he was working on another project - one which traced the path the city 's sinti and roma , also known as gypsies , were forced to march on their way to deportation trains . " the woman told me , well , it 's pretty good what you 're doing here , " he said .
" but gypsy people never lived here .
i thought , maybe she never knew that her neighbors were gypsies . " so deming set out on what has become a quest of sorts , to remember those individuals - jews , homosexuals , jehova 's witnesses , dissenters - who were persecuted and often killed by the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig engraving the plaques he began collecting the names of victims of national socialism and then creating small four-by-four-inch brass-topped plaques with names and dates , which he then embedded into the sidewalk at the address where that person used to live . he called them " stumbling stones " because his idea was that they would make people who came across them pause from their everyday lives and remember that an individual killed by the nazis once lived at that address . the idea has found wide resonance in germany and more then 3,500 of the plaques have been installed in 34 german cities . munich , however , will not be one of them . jewish opposition the city council decided this week , following a proposal from three political parties - the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - to withhold permission to install any of the memorials on public grounds , sidewalks included . in a sometimes explosive public debate , opponents of the project said a broad societal consensus had to be found first . city council members from the green party and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- voted to allow the project to go ahead . those against the stumbling stones project , or stolpersteine in german , said they based their opposition on the opinion of the jewish cultural center of munich and upper bavaria , whose board had strongly disapproved of this form of memorial .
for them , the fact that people would be walking over the names of those killed was unacceptable . " should neo-nazis be able to wipe their dirt from their combat boots on the stones ? " asked marian offman , member of the csu and the board of the jewish group , during the debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , munich mayor christian ude and charlotte knobloch , president of the munich jewish cultural center charlotte knobloch -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , president of the jewish cultural center , said she found it " unbearable " that people would be " stepping all over " the names of murdered jews , although she said the project was " well meant " and she could understand those who were of a different opinion . munich 's mayor , christian ude , said he feared a " surfeit of memorials " and pointed to the planned jewish museum and the annual memorials for the victims of the brutal 1938 anti-jewish pogrom called the " night of broken glass " or at the former dachau concentration camp . one at a time but for demnig and the supporters of his project , the effectiveness of the " stumbling stones " lies in their focus on the individual , something impossible to achieve with large monuments or memorial services . " my idea was to bring the names of people who were deported back to their homes , the houses where they had lived , " demnig said .
" it 's personal .
big monuments are abstract . " the plaques have only a few words on them : the name of the person , a birth date and location followed by a date and place or of death , if known .
many of the plaques end with the word auschwitz . barbara becker-jákli is a historian at the el-de-haus in cologne , the city 's former gestapo headquarters that is now a museum and research center on the third reich .
she helps artist demnig find the names and addresses of cologne jews who were deported and killed by hitler 's regime . " people come upon the stones for the first time and want to find out more about the people who are mentioned on them , " she said .
" it puts a human face on the nazi terror .
we 're seeing a growing interest in this part of our history . " project an expansion course demnig said he often receives calls from individuals and communities - from europe to the u.s. to israel - interested in sponsoring a plaque for € 95 -lrb- $ 113 -rrb- .
demnig will create it and then travel to the city to install it .
since demand has gotten so high , he has had to enlist the aid of volunteers in various cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 1,300 plaques in cologne , 655 in hamburg , around 400 in berlin and others scattered throughout smaller towns and villages .
demnig said plaques are planned for vienna and paris and several other european cities have expressed interest . for now , at least , munich will not join this growing roster of cities .
according to the munich city council 's decision , demnig will now have to remove the stones he has already embedded in that city 's sidewalks . although the city council said it was following the wishes of the jewish community in rejecting the memorials , jewish opinion is far from unanimous on the matter .
michael rado , head of cologne 's jewish community , said he does not agree that the stones in the ground are disrespectful of the memory of those killed .
on the contrary , according to him , many jews feel it is very important to have a marked burial place .
the millions who were gassed and then cremated were denied that . " now they have gravestones , " he said .
" whenever i pass a one of the plaques i see the name .

" the woman told me , well , it 's pretty good what you 're doing here , " he said .
" but gypsy people never lived here .
i thought , maybe she never knew that her neighbors were gypsies . " so deming set out on what has become a quest of sorts , to remember those individuals - jews , homosexuals , jehova 's witnesses , dissenters - who were persecuted and often killed by the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig engraving the plaques he began collecting the names of victims of national socialism and then creating small four-by-four-inch brass-topped plaques with names and dates , which he then embedded into the sidewalk at the address where that person used to live . he called them " stumbling stones " because his idea was that they would make people who came across them pause from their everyday lives and remember that an individual killed by the nazis once lived at that address . the idea has found wide resonance in germany and more then 3,500 of the plaques have been installed in 34 german cities . munich , however , will not be one of them . jewish opposition the city council decided this week , following a proposal from three political parties - the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - to withhold permission to install any of the memorials on public grounds , sidewalks included . in a sometimes explosive public debate , opponents of the project said a broad societal consensus had to be found first . city council members from the green party and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- voted to allow the project to go ahead . those against the stumbling stones project , or stolpersteine in german , said they based their opposition on the opinion of the jewish cultural center of munich and upper bavaria , whose board had strongly disapproved of this form of memorial .
for them , the fact that people would be walking over the names of those killed was unacceptable . " should neo-nazis be able to wipe their dirt from their combat boots on the stones ? " asked marian offman , member of the csu and the board of the jewish group , during the debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , munich mayor christian ude and charlotte knobloch , president of the munich jewish cultural center charlotte knobloch -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , president of the jewish cultural center , said she found it " unbearable " that people would be " stepping all over " the names of murdered jews , although she said the project was " well meant " and she could understand those who were of a different opinion . munich 's mayor , christian ude , said he feared a " surfeit of memorials " and pointed to the planned jewish museum and the annual memorials for the victims of the brutal 1938 anti-jewish pogrom called the " night of broken glass " or at the former dachau concentration camp . one at a time but for demnig and the supporters of his project , the effectiveness of the " stumbling stones " lies in their focus on the individual , something impossible to achieve with large monuments or memorial services . " my idea was to bring the names of people who were deported back to their homes , the houses where they had lived , " demnig said .
" it 's personal .
big monuments are abstract . " the plaques have only a few words on them : the name of the person , a birth date and location followed by a date and place or of death , if known .
many of the plaques end with the word auschwitz . barbara becker-jákli is a historian at the el-de-haus in cologne , the city 's former gestapo headquarters that is now a museum and research center on the third reich .
she helps artist demnig find the names and addresses of cologne jews who were deported and killed by hitler 's regime . " people come upon the stones for the first time and want to find out more about the people who are mentioned on them , " she said .
" it puts a human face on the nazi terror .
we 're seeing a growing interest in this part of our history . " project an expansion course demnig said he often receives calls from individuals and communities - from europe to the u.s. to israel - interested in sponsoring a plaque for € 95 -lrb- $ 113 -rrb- .
demnig will create it and then travel to the city to install it .
since demand has gotten so high , he has had to enlist the aid of volunteers in various cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 1,300 plaques in cologne , 655 in hamburg , around 400 in berlin and others scattered throughout smaller towns and villages .
demnig said plaques are planned for vienna and paris and several other european cities have expressed interest . for now , at least , munich will not join this growing roster of cities .
according to the munich city council 's decision , demnig will now have to remove the stones he has already embedded in that city 's sidewalks . although the city council said it was following the wishes of the jewish community in rejecting the memorials , jewish opinion is far from unanimous on the matter .
michael rado , head of cologne 's jewish community , said he does not agree that the stones in the ground are disrespectful of the memory of those killed .
on the contrary , according to him , many jews feel it is very important to have a marked burial place .
the millions who were gassed and then cremated were denied that . " now they have gravestones , " he said .
" whenever i pass a one of the plaques i see the name .
if i see löwenthal , i say , ' yep , now everybody can remember mr. löwenthal . '

" the woman told me , well , it 's pretty good what you 're doing here , " he said .
" but gypsy people never lived here .
i thought , maybe she never knew that her neighbors were gypsies .

it 's been deprived of one of its most popular tourist destinations for the benefit of the capital .
on top of being the seat of the federal government , berlin is now the home of germany 's national debt clock . " our debt clock depicts the entire scale of this catastrophically high level of debt and its growth , " karl heinz däke , head of the taxpayer watchdog group bund der steuerzähler -lrb- bdst -rrb- , said as the red-numbered digital clock was unveiled on a building façade in the government district wednesday . " i would advise politicians from the federal government and the states to come here as often as possible to get an idea of how high the national debt is and how swiftly it increases , " däke said . the taxpayer group recently moved into the building down the street from the federal finance ministry . nearly too fast for the naked eye the last four digits on the clock move so quickly you can hardly register them .
on friday morning it stood at € 1,361,959,207,548 . every second , germany 's national debt increases by € 2,186 -lrb- $ 2,621 -rrb- , bdst , the self-proclaimed " financial conscience of the nation " calculated .
that figure reflects the average monthly salary of a german employee .
the group estimated that finance minister hans eichel had to spend every fifth euro paid in taxes last year to cover the € 38 billion interest the national debt acquired . as they continually put pressure on politicians to stop the state from racking up more debt , däke and the bdst seem to think their pleas will one day be heard .
at least their clock only has space for 13 digits , suggesting the debt wo n't reach € 10 billion . just days after the clock started ticking in the capital , it 's already hit € 1,361,959,273,128 - and counting . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de massive budget hole hits government hard a panel of fiscal experts on thursday delivered the bad news everyone expected : over the next three years , germany will see tax shortfalls of € 61 billion -lrb- $ 72 billion -rrb- , posing huge problems domestically and for europe .

a joint statement concludes that croatia has met the political criteria to join the bloc .
however , some thorny issues remain and the eu is warning that efforts still need to be addressed such as minority rights , refugee returns , reform of the judiciary , regional co-operation , the fight against corruption and crucially co-operation with the international criminal tribunal in the hague .

britain and the netherlands have heavily criticized croatia for not being able to bring gotovina to the tribunal .
both countries had refused to ratify an association agreement which paves the way for membership until there was increased co-operation from zagreb .
the netherlands has now ratified the agreement and britain is expected to do so before the summer recess of parliament .
italy is also expected to ratify the agreement after some unrelated issues were resolved .
heads of state and government are also expected to encourage other countries in the western balkans to move towards joining the eu .

the law limits the area where genetically-modified plants can be grown in germany and also calls for a national register to keep tabs on all gm crops .
farmers planting gm seeds will be required to adhere to strict regulations , including the requirement that a minimum distance be kept from non-gm fields and to take measures to prevent the spread of pollen from gm plants .

it sends out a clear signal that momentum is being maintained in the accession process . "
coming six months ahead of schedule , he pointed out that " this is a major success for bulgaria . " reform still needed eu leaders will be reviewing the accession treaty at their december summit .
if they approve it , it will be signed in spring 2005 . bulgarian foreign minister solomon passy said the talks marked the end of a crucial phase and stressed that over the next two and a half years , the country would be implementing the various commitments made during the negotiations to ensure bulgaria was ready to enter on january 1 , 2007 , when the eu makes its second eastward expansion . new monitoring system may delay entry but the provisional deal also includes a controversial new " safeguard clause " which gives the eu an emergency break measure to delay bulgaria 's entry for up to a year if a tough new monitoring system concludes bulgaria has failed to introduce the necessary reforms . günter verheugen , the eu expansion commissioner , warned that bulgaria still has a lot of work to do .

he points out that " now they might consider returning .
there are lots of job opportunities for graduates in bulgaria . " for others , though , joining the exclusive eu club wo n't help anything .
small farmers and bulgaria 's roma minority , for example , see a bleak future ahead of them .
" people used to have more respect for us , " said one roma street sweeper .
but now , she added , they are more and more marginalized .
" we used to get decent factory jobs , but these days all you can do if you only have a primary school education is everyone 's dirty work . " sergei stanishev , leader of bulgaria 's socialist opposition , also believes sofia has been over-hasty .

in the coming weeks , they will be sold - but to whom and at what creative cost remains to be seen . located in the green flatlands just outside berlin , the historic german film studios have a colorful , some might even say checkered past .
they played host to marlene dietrich and fritz lang , served as a backdrop for the production of hundreds of nazi-tainted films between 1933 and the end of the second world war , and became home to the ' defa film ag ' during east german communist rule .
by the time the wall fell , the studios were in a state of serious disrepair and in need of a cash injection .
they were sold by the german government to french compagnie generale des eaux , now the media giant vivendi universal .
for the past 12 years , vivendi has been bent on turning babelsberg into a major european film studio .
but plagued by its own financial troubles , vivendi now has to find someone else to play the lead role .
a sale has been in the pipeline for some time , but vivendi , which will be selling at a loss , wants to ensure that whoever takes the studios on also wants to make them shine . head to head there are only two contenders : studio hamburg , a subsidiary of germany 's ndr public broadcaster , and the management team around thierry potok , current babelsberg ceo , who want to acquire the studios by means of a management buy-out .
the ball is squarely in vivendi 's court , and while they scrutinize the bidders ' credentials , everyone concerned is hanging on tenterhooks .
but it was apparently never going to be an easy casting .
" vivendi is assessing the applicants with the care and consideration necessary to ensure an honorable end to its work , " babelsberg press spokesman felix neunzerling told dw-world .
what potok , a former french government worker and banker , could have on his side is money .
whilst studio hamburg is demanding € 30 million -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- from vivendi to take over its activities , potok has made it clear that he would settle for a modest € 25 million , which is less than it would cost the current owners to close the studios down altogether .
film versus television german media has been making much of the implications of inviting a bonafide television network to run this historic highlight of the european film landscape .
film aficionados have voiced loud concern that a tv organization could sound the death knell for the film face of the studios . ingrid meyer-bosse , press spokeswoman for studio hamburg declined to comment on the path babelsberg would strike under the ndr subsidiary 's control .
" our main area of activity is television , but we also do some films , " meyer-bosse told dw-world .
she stressed that at this point , the company was simply waiting for the outcome of the bid .
studio hamburg already owns the film and television studios in berlin 's adlershof , which was the location for germany 's recent box-office hit , " good bye lenin ! " .
the general feeling in the industry is that under potok 's baton , the studios would be less likely to have their image recast .
but to reduce the issue to film versus television is to make it too black and white .
" ultimately any studio needs both because one ca n't survive without the other .
but the big turnover in a studio like studio babelsberg comes from films , which generate more than 50 percent of the production service turnover , " neunzerling said , adding that the studio was completely booked out .
the big projects shot in babelsberg seem to be getting even bigger .
over the past few years , babelsberg has become a hot tip for hollywood producers looking for studio locations on this side of the atlantic .
roman polanski got the ball rolling with his oscar-winning film " the pianist . "
in the past year , babelsberg has been the location for the jackie chan blockbuster , " around the world in 80 days , " kevin spacey 's " beyond the sea , " and " the bourne supremacy " with matt damon and franka potente .
next on the list is " mission impossible , " starring tom cruise , which will start shooting at the end of august .

in the coming weeks , they will be sold - but to whom and at what creative cost remains to be seen . located in the green flatlands just outside berlin , the historic german film studios have a colorful , some might even say checkered past .
they played host to marlene dietrich and fritz lang , served as a backdrop for the production of hundreds of nazi-tainted films between 1933 and the end of the second world war , and became home to the ' defa film ag ' during east german communist rule .
by the time the wall fell , the studios were in a state of serious disrepair and in need of a cash injection .
they were sold by the german government to french compagnie generale des eaux , now the media giant vivendi universal .
for the past 12 years , vivendi has been bent on turning babelsberg into a major european film studio .
but plagued by its own financial troubles , vivendi now has to find someone else to play the lead role .
a sale has been in the pipeline for some time , but vivendi , which will be selling at a loss , wants to ensure that whoever takes the studios on also wants to make them shine . head to head there are only two contenders : studio hamburg , a subsidiary of germany 's ndr public broadcaster , and the management team around thierry potok , current babelsberg ceo , who want to acquire the studios by means of a management buy-out .
the ball is squarely in vivendi 's court , and while they scrutinize the bidders ' credentials , everyone concerned is hanging on tenterhooks .
but it was apparently never going to be an easy casting .
" vivendi is assessing the applicants with the care and consideration necessary to ensure an honorable end to its work , " babelsberg press spokesman felix neunzerling told dw-world .
what potok , a former french government worker and banker , could have on his side is money .
whilst studio hamburg is demanding € 30 million -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- from vivendi to take over its activities , potok has made it clear that he would settle for a modest € 25 million , which is less than it would cost the current owners to close the studios down altogether .
film versus television german media has been making much of the implications of inviting a bonafide television network to run this historic highlight of the european film landscape .
film aficionados have voiced loud concern that a tv organization could sound the death knell for the film face of the studios . ingrid meyer-bosse , press spokeswoman for studio hamburg declined to comment on the path babelsberg would strike under the ndr subsidiary 's control .
" our main area of activity is television , but we also do some films , " meyer-bosse told dw-world .
she stressed that at this point , the company was simply waiting for the outcome of the bid .
studio hamburg already owns the film and television studios in berlin 's adlershof , which was the location for germany 's recent box-office hit , " good bye lenin ! " .
the general feeling in the industry is that under potok 's baton , the studios would be less likely to have their image recast .
but to reduce the issue to film versus television is to make it too black and white .
" ultimately any studio needs both because one ca n't survive without the other .
but the big turnover in a studio like studio babelsberg comes from films , which generate more than 50 percent of the production service turnover , " neunzerling said , adding that the studio was completely booked out .
the big projects shot in babelsberg seem to be getting even bigger .
over the past few years , babelsberg has become a hot tip for hollywood producers looking for studio locations on this side of the atlantic .
roman polanski got the ball rolling with his oscar-winning film " the pianist . "
in the past year , babelsberg has been the location for the jackie chan blockbuster , " around the world in 80 days , " kevin spacey 's " beyond the sea , " and " the bourne supremacy " with matt damon and franka potente .
next on the list is " mission impossible , " starring tom cruise , which will start shooting at the end of august .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.06.2004 germans back eu constitution compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will this all end ?
germany 's joschka fischer eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings . the first agenda item of the conference is the draft european union constitution , which has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
in the time since , a number of compromises have been forged and its chances of a draft getting approved by the end of the summit have increased dramatically .
" as you would expect , there are different points of view , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country also currently holds the rotating european union presidency .
" but i think we are closing in on the agreement . "
a german government spokesperson said on friday that germany was willing to back the irish proposal , but added that no further changes would get his country 's support , reuters news agency reported . the remaining key sticking points are arguments over the member states ' voting powers .
both poland and spain blocked the draft over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most-populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population on key decisions , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent respectively .
the deal would ensure that the eu 's most populous countries , germany , france and britain , would not be able to instantly overrule middle and smaller sized members .
thursday night , the irish suggested allowing a blocking minority of no less than four states that make up 35 percent of the population .
poland and spain hold out for more neither poland nor spain has thus far agreed to the formula devised by the irish presidency , but polish prime minister marek belka described it thursday as " a step in the right direction . "
a member of the spanish delegation negotiating the deal in brussels told the french news wire agence france presse that although prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero had accepted the principle of the double majority voting system , he was unhappy with the 65 percent of the population figure .
instead , the official said , spain would call for 50 percent of the member states plus an additional member and that the votes represent two-thirds of the total population of the eu .
spain is also seeking to increase its number of seats in the european parliament from the 54 seats foreseen in the draft constitution by " three or five " seats , the delegate told afp .
fierce debate over commission president though prospects appear good for a deal to be reached on the constitution , the horse-trading over who will be the next head of the european commission , the eu 's executive , after romano prodi 's mandate expires in october could be far trickier .
germany and france have both backed liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt as their candidate of choice , but the belgian leader 's leanings toward a federalist europe have made tony blair and british politicians uneasy .
verhofstadt also angered london with his steadfast and very vocal opposition of the united states-led war against iraq .
blair has sought to block verhofstadt 's nomination , and a british government spokesman said greece , italy , poland , portugal and slovenia also opposed the belgian .
instead , london has shown enthusiasm for the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- candidate chris patten , the eu external affairs commissioner .
but friday afternoon a german government source told reuters that patten was no longer a candidate .

germany 's joschka fischer eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings . the first agenda item of the conference is the draft european union constitution , which has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
in the time since , a number of compromises have been forged and its chances of a draft getting approved by the end of the summit have increased dramatically .
" as you would expect , there are different points of view , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country also currently holds the rotating european union presidency .
" but i think we are closing in on the agreement . "
a german government spokesperson said on friday that germany was willing to back the irish proposal , but added that no further changes would get his country 's support , reuters news agency reported . the remaining key sticking points are arguments over the member states ' voting powers .
both poland and spain blocked the draft over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most-populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population on key decisions , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent respectively .
the deal would ensure that the eu 's most populous countries , germany , france and britain , would not be able to instantly overrule middle and smaller sized members .
thursday night , the irish suggested allowing a blocking minority of no less than four states that make up 35 percent of the population .
poland and spain hold out for more neither poland nor spain has thus far agreed to the formula devised by the irish presidency , but polish prime minister marek belka described it thursday as " a step in the right direction . "
a member of the spanish delegation negotiating the deal in brussels told the french news wire agence france presse that although prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero had accepted the principle of the double majority voting system , he was unhappy with the 65 percent of the population figure .
instead , the official said , spain would call for 50 percent of the member states plus an additional member and that the votes represent two-thirds of the total population of the eu .
spain is also seeking to increase its number of seats in the european parliament from the 54 seats foreseen in the draft constitution by " three or five " seats , the delegate told afp .
fierce debate over commission president though prospects appear good for a deal to be reached on the constitution , the horse-trading over who will be the next head of the european commission , the eu 's executive , after romano prodi 's mandate expires in october could be far trickier .
germany and france have both backed liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt as their candidate of choice , but the belgian leader 's leanings toward a federalist europe have made tony blair and british politicians uneasy .
verhofstadt also angered london with his steadfast and very vocal opposition of the united states-led war against iraq .
blair has sought to block verhofstadt 's nomination , and a british government spokesman said greece , italy , poland , portugal and slovenia also opposed the belgian .
instead , london has shown enthusiasm for the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- candidate chris patten , the eu external affairs commissioner .
but friday afternoon a german government source told reuters that patten was no longer a candidate .

in the time since , a number of compromises have been forged and its chances of a draft getting approved by the end of the summit have increased dramatically .
" as you would expect , there are different points of view , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country also currently holds the rotating european union presidency .
" but i think we are closing in on the agreement . "
a german government spokesperson said on friday that germany was willing to back the irish proposal , but added that no further changes would get his country 's support , reuters news agency reported . the remaining key sticking points are arguments over the member states ' voting powers .
both poland and spain blocked the draft over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most-populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population on key decisions , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent respectively .
the deal would ensure that the eu 's most populous countries , germany , france and britain , would not be able to instantly overrule middle and smaller sized members .
thursday night , the irish suggested allowing a blocking minority of no less than four states that make up 35 percent of the population .
poland and spain hold out for more neither poland nor spain has thus far agreed to the formula devised by the irish presidency , but polish prime minister marek belka described it thursday as " a step in the right direction . "
a member of the spanish delegation negotiating the deal in brussels told the french news wire agence france presse that although prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero had accepted the principle of the double majority voting system , he was unhappy with the 65 percent of the population figure .
instead , the official said , spain would call for 50 percent of the member states plus an additional member and that the votes represent two-thirds of the total population of the eu .
spain is also seeking to increase its number of seats in the european parliament from the 54 seats foreseen in the draft constitution by " three or five " seats , the delegate told afp .
fierce debate over commission president though prospects appear good for a deal to be reached on the constitution , the horse-trading over who will be the next head of the european commission , the eu 's executive , after romano prodi 's mandate expires in october could be far trickier .
germany and france have both backed liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt as their candidate of choice , but the belgian leader 's leanings toward a federalist europe have made tony blair and british politicians uneasy .
verhofstadt also angered london with his steadfast and very vocal opposition of the united states-led war against iraq .
blair has sought to block verhofstadt 's nomination , and a british government spokesman said greece , italy , poland , portugal and slovenia also opposed the belgian .
instead , london has shown enthusiasm for the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- candidate chris patten , the eu external affairs commissioner .
but friday afternoon a german government source told reuters that patten was no longer a candidate .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , also a potential ccontender for the position , again stressed on friday that he does n't want the job , as did ireland 's ahern , who could garner widespread support , on thursday .
the third tough issue facing summit participants is the role of religion in the constitution .
the draft preamble mentions its importance to european culture , but it does n't explicitly refer to christianity or god .
led by italy and poland , several countries are adamant that it should .
but france and belgium are just as vehement in their opposition of any such mention .
" france is n't anti-christian .
it resolved this type of quarrel 100 years ago .
we 're not going to reopen this debate , " french president chirac told a news conference .

germany 's joschka fischer eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings . the first agenda item of the conference is the draft european union constitution , which has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
in the time since , a number of compromises have been forged and its chances of a draft getting approved by the end of the summit have increased dramatically .
" as you would expect , there are different points of view , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country also currently holds the rotating european union presidency .
" but i think we are closing in on the agreement . "
a german government spokesperson said on friday that germany was willing to back the irish proposal , but added that no further changes would get his country 's support , reuters news agency reported . the remaining key sticking points are arguments over the member states ' voting powers .
both poland and spain blocked the draft over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most-populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population on key decisions , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent respectively .
the deal would ensure that the eu 's most populous countries , germany , france and britain , would not be able to instantly overrule middle and smaller sized members .
thursday night , the irish suggested allowing a blocking minority of no less than four states that make up 35 percent of the population .
poland and spain hold out for more neither poland nor spain has thus far agreed to the formula devised by the irish presidency , but polish prime minister marek belka described it thursday as " a step in the right direction . "
a member of the spanish delegation negotiating the deal in brussels told the french news wire agence france presse that although prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero had accepted the principle of the double majority voting system , he was unhappy with the 65 percent of the population figure .
instead , the official said , spain would call for 50 percent of the member states plus an additional member and that the votes represent two-thirds of the total population of the eu .
spain is also seeking to increase its number of seats in the european parliament from the 54 seats foreseen in the draft constitution by " three or five " seats , the delegate told afp .
fierce debate over commission president though prospects appear good for a deal to be reached on the constitution , the horse-trading over who will be the next head of the european commission , the eu 's executive , after romano prodi 's mandate expires in october could be far trickier .
germany and france have both backed liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt as their candidate of choice , but the belgian leader 's leanings toward a federalist europe have made tony blair and british politicians uneasy .
verhofstadt also angered london with his steadfast and very vocal opposition of the united states-led war against iraq .
blair has sought to block verhofstadt 's nomination , and a british government spokesman said greece , italy , poland , portugal and slovenia also opposed the belgian .
instead , london has shown enthusiasm for the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- candidate chris patten , the eu external affairs commissioner .
but friday afternoon a german government source told reuters that patten was no longer a candidate .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , also a potential ccontender for the position , again stressed on friday that he does n't want the job , as did ireland 's ahern , who could garner widespread support , on thursday .
the third tough issue facing summit participants is the role of religion in the constitution .
the draft preamble mentions its importance to european culture , but it does n't explicitly refer to christianity or god .
led by italy and poland , several countries are adamant that it should .
but france and belgium are just as vehement in their opposition of any such mention .
" france is n't anti-christian .
it resolved this type of quarrel 100 years ago .

instead , the official said , spain would call for 50 percent of the member states plus an additional member and that the votes represent two-thirds of the total population of the eu .
spain is also seeking to increase its number of seats in the european parliament from the 54 seats foreseen in the draft constitution by " three or five " seats , the delegate told afp .
fierce debate over commission president though prospects appear good for a deal to be reached on the constitution , the horse-trading over who will be the next head of the european commission , the eu 's executive , after romano prodi 's mandate expires in october could be far trickier .
germany and france have both backed liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt as their candidate of choice , but the belgian leader 's leanings toward a federalist europe have made tony blair and british politicians uneasy .
verhofstadt also angered london with his steadfast and very vocal opposition of the united states-led war against iraq .
blair has sought to block verhofstadt 's nomination , and a british government spokesman said greece , italy , poland , portugal and slovenia also opposed the belgian .
instead , london has shown enthusiasm for the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- candidate chris patten , the eu external affairs commissioner .
but friday afternoon a german government source told reuters that patten was no longer a candidate .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , also a potential ccontender for the position , again stressed on friday that he does n't want the job , as did ireland 's ahern , who could garner widespread support , on thursday .
the third tough issue facing summit participants is the role of religion in the constitution .
the draft preamble mentions its importance to european culture , but it does n't explicitly refer to christianity or god .
led by italy and poland , several countries are adamant that it should .
but france and belgium are just as vehement in their opposition of any such mention .
" france is n't anti-christian .
it resolved this type of quarrel 100 years ago .
we 're not going to reopen this debate , " french president chirac told a news conference .

in the coming weeks , they will be sold - but to whom and at what creative cost remains to be seen . located in the green flatlands just outside berlin , the historic german film studios have a colorful , some might even say checkered past .
they played host to marlene dietrich and fritz lang , served as a backdrop for the production of hundreds of nazi-tainted films between 1933 and the end of the second world war , and became home to the ' defa film ag ' during east german communist rule .
by the time the wall fell , the studios were in a state of serious disrepair and in need of a cash injection .
they were sold by the german government to french compagnie generale des eaux , now the media giant vivendi universal .
for the past 12 years , vivendi has been bent on turning babelsberg into a major european film studio .
but plagued by its own financial troubles , vivendi now has to find someone else to play the lead role .
a sale has been in the pipeline for some time , but vivendi , which will be selling at a loss , wants to ensure that whoever takes the studios on also wants to make them shine . head to head there are only two contenders : studio hamburg , a subsidiary of germany 's ndr public broadcaster , and the management team around thierry potok , current babelsberg ceo , who want to acquire the studios by means of a management buy-out .
the ball is squarely in vivendi 's court , and while they scrutinize the bidders ' credentials , everyone concerned is hanging on tenterhooks .
but it was apparently never going to be an easy casting .
" vivendi is assessing the applicants with the care and consideration necessary to ensure an honorable end to its work , " babelsberg press spokesman felix neunzerling told dw-world .
what potok , a former french government worker and banker , could have on his side is money .
whilst studio hamburg is demanding € 30 million -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- from vivendi to take over its activities , potok has made it clear that he would settle for a modest € 25 million , which is less than it would cost the current owners to close the studios down altogether .
film versus television german media has been making much of the implications of inviting a bonafide television network to run this historic highlight of the european film landscape .
film aficionados have voiced loud concern that a tv organization could sound the death knell for the film face of the studios . ingrid meyer-bosse , press spokeswoman for studio hamburg declined to comment on the path babelsberg would strike under the ndr subsidiary 's control .
" our main area of activity is television , but we also do some films , " meyer-bosse told dw-world .
she stressed that at this point , the company was simply waiting for the outcome of the bid .
studio hamburg already owns the film and television studios in berlin 's adlershof , which was the location for germany 's recent box-office hit , " good bye lenin ! " .
the general feeling in the industry is that under potok 's baton , the studios would be less likely to have their image recast .
but to reduce the issue to film versus television is to make it too black and white .
" ultimately any studio needs both because one ca n't survive without the other .
but the big turnover in a studio like studio babelsberg comes from films , which generate more than 50 percent of the production service turnover , " neunzerling said , adding that the studio was completely booked out .
the big projects shot in babelsberg seem to be getting even bigger .
over the past few years , babelsberg has become a hot tip for hollywood producers looking for studio locations on this side of the atlantic .
roman polanski got the ball rolling with his oscar-winning film " the pianist . "
in the past year , babelsberg has been the location for the jackie chan blockbuster , " around the world in 80 days , " kevin spacey 's " beyond the sea , " and " the bourne supremacy " with matt damon and franka potente .
next on the list is " mission impossible , " starring tom cruise , which will start shooting at the end of august .

it 's been deprived of one of its most popular tourist destinations for the benefit of the capital .
on top of being the seat of the federal government , berlin is now the home of germany 's national debt clock . " our debt clock depicts the entire scale of this catastrophically high level of debt and its growth , " karl heinz däke , head of the taxpayer watchdog group bund der steuerzähler -lrb- bdst -rrb- , said as the red-numbered digital clock was unveiled on a building façade in the government district wednesday . " i would advise politicians from the federal government and the states to come here as often as possible to get an idea of how high the national debt is and how swiftly it increases , " däke said . the taxpayer group recently moved into the building down the street from the federal finance ministry . nearly too fast for the naked eye the last four digits on the clock move so quickly you can hardly register them .

the group estimated that finance minister hans eichel had to spend every fifth euro paid in taxes last year to cover the € 38 billion interest the national debt acquired . as they continually put pressure on politicians to stop the state from racking up more debt , däke and the bdst seem to think their pleas will one day be heard .
at least their clock only has space for 13 digits , suggesting the debt wo n't reach € 10 billion . just days after the clock started ticking in the capital , it 's already hit € 1,361,959,273,128 - and counting . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de massive budget hole hits government hard a panel of fiscal experts on thursday delivered the bad news everyone expected : over the next three years , germany will see tax shortfalls of € 61 billion -lrb- $ 72 billion -rrb- , posing huge problems domestically and for europe .

the center-right epp and uen groups were , however , against the proposal .
under the agreement reached last month , washington is allowed to collect 34 types of data from passengers ’ records flying to the united states , which include names , addresses , phone numbers , credit cards and the identity of their travelling companions .
since march 2003 , airlines have faced the possibility of fines of € 6,000 -lrb- $ 7,200 -rrb- per passenger as well as the potential loss of landing rights in the u.s. if they failed to provide u.s. security agencies with the data 15 minutes before the flight 's departure .
the commission and member states finalized this agreement last month , ignoring requests by meps that they wait until the european court of justice gives its opinion on whether the deal contravenes eu data protection rules .

the center-right epp and uen groups were , however , against the proposal .
under the agreement reached last month , washington is allowed to collect 34 types of data from passengers ’ records flying to the united states , which include names , addresses , phone numbers , credit cards and the identity of their travelling companions .
since march 2003 , airlines have faced the possibility of fines of € 6,000 -lrb- $ 7,200 -rrb- per passenger as well as the potential loss of landing rights in the u.s. if they failed to provide u.s. security agencies with the data 15 minutes before the flight 's departure .
the commission and member states finalized this agreement last month , ignoring requests by meps that they wait until the european court of justice gives its opinion on whether the deal contravenes eu data protection rules .

it 's been deprived of one of its most popular tourist destinations for the benefit of the capital .
on top of being the seat of the federal government , berlin is now the home of germany 's national debt clock . " our debt clock depicts the entire scale of this catastrophically high level of debt and its growth , " karl heinz däke , head of the taxpayer watchdog group bund der steuerzähler -lrb- bdst -rrb- , said as the red-numbered digital clock was unveiled on a building façade in the government district wednesday . " i would advise politicians from the federal government and the states to come here as often as possible to get an idea of how high the national debt is and how swiftly it increases , " däke said . the taxpayer group recently moved into the building down the street from the federal finance ministry . nearly too fast for the naked eye the last four digits on the clock move so quickly you can hardly register them .
on friday morning it stood at € 1,361,959,207,548 . every second , germany 's national debt increases by € 2,186 -lrb- $ 2,621 -rrb- , bdst , the self-proclaimed " financial conscience of the nation " calculated .
that figure reflects the average monthly salary of a german employee .
the group estimated that finance minister hans eichel had to spend every fifth euro paid in taxes last year to cover the € 38 billion interest the national debt acquired . as they continually put pressure on politicians to stop the state from racking up more debt , däke and the bdst seem to think their pleas will one day be heard .
at least their clock only has space for 13 digits , suggesting the debt wo n't reach € 10 billion . just days after the clock started ticking in the capital , it 's already hit € 1,361,959,273,128 - and counting . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de massive budget hole hits government hard a panel of fiscal experts on thursday delivered the bad news everyone expected : over the next three years , germany will see tax shortfalls of € 61 billion -lrb- $ 72 billion -rrb- , posing huge problems domestically and for europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.06.2004 back to the future for babelsberg film studios großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin filming location for the oscar-winning " pianist " is for sale in nearly 100 years of existence , the babelsberg film studios have grown used to addressing the issue of their future .
in the coming weeks , they will be sold - but to whom and at what creative cost remains to be seen . located in the green flatlands just outside berlin , the historic german film studios have a colorful , some might even say checkered past .
they played host to marlene dietrich and fritz lang , served as a backdrop for the production of hundreds of nazi-tainted films between 1933 and the end of the second world war , and became home to the ' defa film ag ' during east german communist rule .
by the time the wall fell , the studios were in a state of serious disrepair and in need of a cash injection .
they were sold by the german government to french compagnie generale des eaux , now the media giant vivendi universal .
for the past 12 years , vivendi has been bent on turning babelsberg into a major european film studio .
but plagued by its own financial troubles , vivendi now has to find someone else to play the lead role .
a sale has been in the pipeline for some time , but vivendi , which will be selling at a loss , wants to ensure that whoever takes the studios on also wants to make them shine . head to head there are only two contenders : studio hamburg , a subsidiary of germany 's ndr public broadcaster , and the management team around thierry potok , current babelsberg ceo , who want to acquire the studios by means of a management buy-out .
the ball is squarely in vivendi 's court , and while they scrutinize the bidders ' credentials , everyone concerned is hanging on tenterhooks .
but it was apparently never going to be an easy casting .
" vivendi is assessing the applicants with the care and consideration necessary to ensure an honorable end to its work , " babelsberg press spokesman felix neunzerling told dw-world .
what potok , a former french government worker and banker , could have on his side is money .
whilst studio hamburg is demanding € 30 million -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- from vivendi to take over its activities , potok has made it clear that he would settle for a modest € 25 million , which is less than it would cost the current owners to close the studios down altogether .
film versus television german media has been making much of the implications of inviting a bonafide television network to run this historic highlight of the european film landscape .
film aficionados have voiced loud concern that a tv organization could sound the death knell for the film face of the studios . ingrid meyer-bosse , press spokeswoman for studio hamburg declined to comment on the path babelsberg would strike under the ndr subsidiary 's control .
" our main area of activity is television , but we also do some films , " meyer-bosse told dw-world .
she stressed that at this point , the company was simply waiting for the outcome of the bid .
studio hamburg already owns the film and television studios in berlin 's adlershof , which was the location for germany 's recent box-office hit , " good bye lenin ! " .
the general feeling in the industry is that under potok 's baton , the studios would be less likely to have their image recast .
but to reduce the issue to film versus television is to make it too black and white .
" ultimately any studio needs both because one ca n't survive without the other .
but the big turnover in a studio like studio babelsberg comes from films , which generate more than 50 percent of the production service turnover , " neunzerling said , adding that the studio was completely booked out .
the big projects shot in babelsberg seem to be getting even bigger .
over the past few years , babelsberg has become a hot tip for hollywood producers looking for studio locations on this side of the atlantic .
roman polanski got the ball rolling with his oscar-winning film " the pianist . "
in the past year , babelsberg has been the location for the jackie chan blockbuster , " around the world in 80 days , " kevin spacey 's " beyond the sea , " and " the bourne supremacy " with matt damon and franka potente .
next on the list is " mission impossible , " starring tom cruise , which will start shooting at the end of august .
if the successful bidder can build on this , it might even be possible to direct the studios out of the red . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin studio plays host to hollywood hollywood 's brightest stars land in berlin to remake a jules verne classic .

" so deming set out on what has become a quest of sorts , to remember those individuals - jews , homosexuals , jehova 's witnesses , dissenters - who were persecuted and often killed by the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig engraving the plaques he began collecting the names of victims of national socialism and then creating small four-by-four-inch brass-topped plaques with names and dates , which he then embedded into the sidewalk at the address where that person used to live . he called them " stumbling stones " because his idea was that they would make people who came across them pause from their everyday lives and remember that an individual killed by the nazis once lived at that address . the idea has found wide resonance in germany and more then 3,500 of the plaques have been installed in 34 german cities . munich , however , will not be one of them . jewish opposition the city council decided this week , following a proposal from three political parties - the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - to withhold permission to install any of the memorials on public grounds , sidewalks included . in a sometimes explosive public debate , opponents of the project said a broad societal consensus had to be found first . city council members from the green party and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- voted to allow the project to go ahead . those against the stumbling stones project , or stolpersteine in german , said they based their opposition on the opinion of the jewish cultural center of munich and upper bavaria , whose board had strongly disapproved of this form of memorial .
for them , the fact that people would be walking over the names of those killed was unacceptable . " should neo-nazis be able to wipe their dirt from their combat boots on the stones ? " asked marian offman , member of the csu and the board of the jewish group , during the debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , munich mayor christian ude and charlotte knobloch , president of the munich jewish cultural center charlotte knobloch -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , president of the jewish cultural center , said she found it " unbearable " that people would be " stepping all over " the names of murdered jews , although she said the project was " well meant " and she could understand those who were of a different opinion . munich 's mayor , christian ude , said he feared a " surfeit of memorials " and pointed to the planned jewish museum and the annual memorials for the victims of the brutal 1938 anti-jewish pogrom called the " night of broken glass " or at the former dachau concentration camp . one at a time but for demnig and the supporters of his project , the effectiveness of the " stumbling stones " lies in their focus on the individual , something impossible to achieve with large monuments or memorial services . " my idea was to bring the names of people who were deported back to their homes , the houses where they had lived , " demnig said .
" it 's personal .
big monuments are abstract . " the plaques have only a few words on them : the name of the person , a birth date and location followed by a date and place or of death , if known .
many of the plaques end with the word auschwitz . barbara becker-jákli is a historian at the el-de-haus in cologne , the city 's former gestapo headquarters that is now a museum and research center on the third reich .
she helps artist demnig find the names and addresses of cologne jews who were deported and killed by hitler 's regime . " people come upon the stones for the first time and want to find out more about the people who are mentioned on them , " she said .
" it puts a human face on the nazi terror .
we 're seeing a growing interest in this part of our history . " project an expansion course demnig said he often receives calls from individuals and communities - from europe to the u.s. to israel - interested in sponsoring a plaque for € 95 -lrb- $ 113 -rrb- .
demnig will create it and then travel to the city to install it .
since demand has gotten so high , he has had to enlist the aid of volunteers in various cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 1,300 plaques in cologne , 655 in hamburg , around 400 in berlin and others scattered throughout smaller towns and villages .
demnig said plaques are planned for vienna and paris and several other european cities have expressed interest . for now , at least , munich will not join this growing roster of cities .
according to the munich city council 's decision , demnig will now have to remove the stones he has already embedded in that city 's sidewalks . although the city council said it was following the wishes of the jewish community in rejecting the memorials , jewish opinion is far from unanimous on the matter .
michael rado , head of cologne 's jewish community , said he does not agree that the stones in the ground are disrespectful of the memory of those killed .
on the contrary , according to him , many jews feel it is very important to have a marked burial place .
the millions who were gassed and then cremated were denied that . " now they have gravestones , " he said .
" whenever i pass a one of the plaques i see the name .
if i see löwenthal , i say , ' yep , now everybody can remember mr. löwenthal . '

in the coming weeks , they will be sold - but to whom and at what creative cost remains to be seen . located in the green flatlands just outside berlin , the historic german film studios have a colorful , some might even say checkered past .
they played host to marlene dietrich and fritz lang , served as a backdrop for the production of hundreds of nazi-tainted films between 1933 and the end of the second world war , and became home to the ' defa film ag ' during east german communist rule .
by the time the wall fell , the studios were in a state of serious disrepair and in need of a cash injection .
they were sold by the german government to french compagnie generale des eaux , now the media giant vivendi universal .
for the past 12 years , vivendi has been bent on turning babelsberg into a major european film studio .
but plagued by its own financial troubles , vivendi now has to find someone else to play the lead role .
a sale has been in the pipeline for some time , but vivendi , which will be selling at a loss , wants to ensure that whoever takes the studios on also wants to make them shine . head to head there are only two contenders : studio hamburg , a subsidiary of germany 's ndr public broadcaster , and the management team around thierry potok , current babelsberg ceo , who want to acquire the studios by means of a management buy-out .
the ball is squarely in vivendi 's court , and while they scrutinize the bidders ' credentials , everyone concerned is hanging on tenterhooks .
but it was apparently never going to be an easy casting .
" vivendi is assessing the applicants with the care and consideration necessary to ensure an honorable end to its work , " babelsberg press spokesman felix neunzerling told dw-world .
what potok , a former french government worker and banker , could have on his side is money .
whilst studio hamburg is demanding € 30 million -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- from vivendi to take over its activities , potok has made it clear that he would settle for a modest € 25 million , which is less than it would cost the current owners to close the studios down altogether .

" our main area of activity is television , but we also do some films , " meyer-bosse told dw-world .
she stressed that at this point , the company was simply waiting for the outcome of the bid .
studio hamburg already owns the film and television studios in berlin 's adlershof , which was the location for germany 's recent box-office hit , " good bye lenin ! " .
the general feeling in the industry is that under potok 's baton , the studios would be less likely to have their image recast .
but to reduce the issue to film versus television is to make it too black and white .
" ultimately any studio needs both because one ca n't survive without the other .
but the big turnover in a studio like studio babelsberg comes from films , which generate more than 50 percent of the production service turnover , " neunzerling said , adding that the studio was completely booked out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.06.2004 germans back eu constitution compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how will this all end ?
germany 's joschka fischer eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings . the first agenda item of the conference is the draft european union constitution , which has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
in the time since , a number of compromises have been forged and its chances of a draft getting approved by the end of the summit have increased dramatically .
" as you would expect , there are different points of view , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country also currently holds the rotating european union presidency .
" but i think we are closing in on the agreement . "
a german government spokesperson said on friday that germany was willing to back the irish proposal , but added that no further changes would get his country 's support , reuters news agency reported . the remaining key sticking points are arguments over the member states ' voting powers .
both poland and spain blocked the draft over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most-populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population on key decisions , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent respectively .
the deal would ensure that the eu 's most populous countries , germany , france and britain , would not be able to instantly overrule middle and smaller sized members .
thursday night , the irish suggested allowing a blocking minority of no less than four states that make up 35 percent of the population .
poland and spain hold out for more neither poland nor spain has thus far agreed to the formula devised by the irish presidency , but polish prime minister marek belka described it thursday as " a step in the right direction . "
a member of the spanish delegation negotiating the deal in brussels told the french news wire agence france presse that although prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero had accepted the principle of the double majority voting system , he was unhappy with the 65 percent of the population figure .
instead , the official said , spain would call for 50 percent of the member states plus an additional member and that the votes represent two-thirds of the total population of the eu .
spain is also seeking to increase its number of seats in the european parliament from the 54 seats foreseen in the draft constitution by " three or five " seats , the delegate told afp .
fierce debate over commission president though prospects appear good for a deal to be reached on the constitution , the horse-trading over who will be the next head of the european commission , the eu 's executive , after romano prodi 's mandate expires in october could be far trickier .
germany and france have both backed liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt as their candidate of choice , but the belgian leader 's leanings toward a federalist europe have made tony blair and british politicians uneasy .

germany 's joschka fischer eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings . the first agenda item of the conference is the draft european union constitution , which has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
in the time since , a number of compromises have been forged and its chances of a draft getting approved by the end of the summit have increased dramatically .
" as you would expect , there are different points of view , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country also currently holds the rotating european union presidency .
" but i think we are closing in on the agreement . "
a german government spokesperson said on friday that germany was willing to back the irish proposal , but added that no further changes would get his country 's support , reuters news agency reported . the remaining key sticking points are arguments over the member states ' voting powers .
both poland and spain blocked the draft over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most-populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population on key decisions , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent respectively .
the deal would ensure that the eu 's most populous countries , germany , france and britain , would not be able to instantly overrule middle and smaller sized members .
thursday night , the irish suggested allowing a blocking minority of no less than four states that make up 35 percent of the population .
poland and spain hold out for more neither poland nor spain has thus far agreed to the formula devised by the irish presidency , but polish prime minister marek belka described it thursday as " a step in the right direction . "
a member of the spanish delegation negotiating the deal in brussels told the french news wire agence france presse that although prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero had accepted the principle of the double majority voting system , he was unhappy with the 65 percent of the population figure .
instead , the official said , spain would call for 50 percent of the member states plus an additional member and that the votes represent two-thirds of the total population of the eu .
spain is also seeking to increase its number of seats in the european parliament from the 54 seats foreseen in the draft constitution by " three or five " seats , the delegate told afp .
fierce debate over commission president though prospects appear good for a deal to be reached on the constitution , the horse-trading over who will be the next head of the european commission , the eu 's executive , after romano prodi 's mandate expires in october could be far trickier .
germany and france have both backed liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt as their candidate of choice , but the belgian leader 's leanings toward a federalist europe have made tony blair and british politicians uneasy .
verhofstadt also angered london with his steadfast and very vocal opposition of the united states-led war against iraq .
blair has sought to block verhofstadt 's nomination , and a british government spokesman said greece , italy , poland , portugal and slovenia also opposed the belgian .

" the woman told me , well , it 's pretty good what you 're doing here , " he said .
" but gypsy people never lived here .
i thought , maybe she never knew that her neighbors were gypsies . " so deming set out on what has become a quest of sorts , to remember those individuals - jews , homosexuals , jehova 's witnesses , dissenters - who were persecuted and often killed by the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig engraving the plaques he began collecting the names of victims of national socialism and then creating small four-by-four-inch brass-topped plaques with names and dates , which he then embedded into the sidewalk at the address where that person used to live . he called them " stumbling stones " because his idea was that they would make people who came across them pause from their everyday lives and remember that an individual killed by the nazis once lived at that address . the idea has found wide resonance in germany and more then 3,500 of the plaques have been installed in 34 german cities . munich , however , will not be one of them . jewish opposition the city council decided this week , following a proposal from three political parties - the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - to withhold permission to install any of the memorials on public grounds , sidewalks included . in a sometimes explosive public debate , opponents of the project said a broad societal consensus had to be found first . city council members from the green party and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- voted to allow the project to go ahead . those against the stumbling stones project , or stolpersteine in german , said they based their opposition on the opinion of the jewish cultural center of munich and upper bavaria , whose board had strongly disapproved of this form of memorial .
for them , the fact that people would be walking over the names of those killed was unacceptable . " should neo-nazis be able to wipe their dirt from their combat boots on the stones ? " asked marian offman , member of the csu and the board of the jewish group , during the debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , munich mayor christian ude and charlotte knobloch , president of the munich jewish cultural center charlotte knobloch -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , president of the jewish cultural center , said she found it " unbearable " that people would be " stepping all over " the names of murdered jews , although she said the project was " well meant " and she could understand those who were of a different opinion . munich 's mayor , christian ude , said he feared a " surfeit of memorials " and pointed to the planned jewish museum and the annual memorials for the victims of the brutal 1938 anti-jewish pogrom called the " night of broken glass " or at the former dachau concentration camp . one at a time but for demnig and the supporters of his project , the effectiveness of the " stumbling stones " lies in their focus on the individual , something impossible to achieve with large monuments or memorial services . " my idea was to bring the names of people who were deported back to their homes , the houses where they had lived , " demnig said .
" it 's personal .
big monuments are abstract . " the plaques have only a few words on them : the name of the person , a birth date and location followed by a date and place or of death , if known .
many of the plaques end with the word auschwitz . barbara becker-jákli is a historian at the el-de-haus in cologne , the city 's former gestapo headquarters that is now a museum and research center on the third reich .
she helps artist demnig find the names and addresses of cologne jews who were deported and killed by hitler 's regime . " people come upon the stones for the first time and want to find out more about the people who are mentioned on them , " she said .
" it puts a human face on the nazi terror .
we 're seeing a growing interest in this part of our history . " project an expansion course demnig said he often receives calls from individuals and communities - from europe to the u.s. to israel - interested in sponsoring a plaque for € 95 -lrb- $ 113 -rrb- .
demnig will create it and then travel to the city to install it .
since demand has gotten so high , he has had to enlist the aid of volunteers in various cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 1,300 plaques in cologne , 655 in hamburg , around 400 in berlin and others scattered throughout smaller towns and villages .
demnig said plaques are planned for vienna and paris and several other european cities have expressed interest . for now , at least , munich will not join this growing roster of cities .
according to the munich city council 's decision , demnig will now have to remove the stones he has already embedded in that city 's sidewalks . although the city council said it was following the wishes of the jewish community in rejecting the memorials , jewish opinion is far from unanimous on the matter .
michael rado , head of cologne 's jewish community , said he does not agree that the stones in the ground are disrespectful of the memory of those killed .
on the contrary , according to him , many jews feel it is very important to have a marked burial place .
the millions who were gassed and then cremated were denied that . " now they have gravestones , " he said .
" whenever i pass a one of the plaques i see the name .

their deception has finally come to light . " bees are n't particularly hardworking , " berlin neurobiologist and zoologist randolf menzel , who has been researching the creatures for nearly 40 years , told german news agency dpa .
" instead they sleep a lot and are rather lazy . " " they spend around 80 percent of the night sleeping , and even during the day they often fly into the hive and give their wings a rest . " but , as if to make up for the inevitable disappointment that his statements would cause , menzel explained that bees have other redeeming qualities .
they are quick learners , recognize various scents and have five memory phases . " if the bee is rewarded once for its behavior , it will remember it for a week .
if it 's rewarded three times , it wo n't forget it for the rest of its life , " menzel said . furthermore , bees ' superb memories allow them to tell the difference between numerous colors and more than 50 scents .
and their sense of smell is similar to that of humans . " what smells good to bees , is also a pleasant smell for people , " menzel said . menzel was awarded a € 10,000 prize last week from the german zoological society for his work with bees . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian haute couture goes to the dogs the owner of a shop selling traditional german clothing has put her talents in the service of man 's best friend , designing lederhosen and other typically bavarian garb for canines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.06.2004 munich decides against " stumbling stone " holocaust memorials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering victims of the holocaust , one person at a time a project to memorialize individuals killed by the nazis by embedding small name plaques on sidewalks has been rejected by the city of munich , even though the memorials are present in 34 other cities and towns . the original idea to create the " stumbling stones " came to gunter demnig , an artist from cologne , when an elderly woman approached him as while he was working on another project - one which traced the path the city 's sinti and roma , also known as gypsies , were forced to march on their way to deportation trains . " the woman told me , well , it 's pretty good what you 're doing here , " he said .
" but gypsy people never lived here .
i thought , maybe she never knew that her neighbors were gypsies . " so deming set out on what has become a quest of sorts , to remember those individuals - jews , homosexuals , jehova 's witnesses , dissenters - who were persecuted and often killed by the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig engraving the plaques he began collecting the names of victims of national socialism and then creating small four-by-four-inch brass-topped plaques with names and dates , which he then embedded into the sidewalk at the address where that person used to live . he called them " stumbling stones " because his idea was that they would make people who came across them pause from their everyday lives and remember that an individual killed by the nazis once lived at that address . the idea has found wide resonance in germany and more then 3,500 of the plaques have been installed in 34 german cities . munich , however , will not be one of them . jewish opposition the city council decided this week , following a proposal from three political parties - the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - to withhold permission to install any of the memorials on public grounds , sidewalks included . in a sometimes explosive public debate , opponents of the project said a broad societal consensus had to be found first . city council members from the green party and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- voted to allow the project to go ahead . those against the stumbling stones project , or stolpersteine in german , said they based their opposition on the opinion of the jewish cultural center of munich and upper bavaria , whose board had strongly disapproved of this form of memorial .
for them , the fact that people would be walking over the names of those killed was unacceptable . " should neo-nazis be able to wipe their dirt from their combat boots on the stones ? " asked marian offman , member of the csu and the board of the jewish group , during the debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , munich mayor christian ude and charlotte knobloch , president of the munich jewish cultural center charlotte knobloch -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , president of the jewish cultural center , said she found it " unbearable " that people would be " stepping all over " the names of murdered jews , although she said the project was " well meant " and she could understand those who were of a different opinion . munich 's mayor , christian ude , said he feared a " surfeit of memorials " and pointed to the planned jewish museum and the annual memorials for the victims of the brutal 1938 anti-jewish pogrom called the " night of broken glass " or at the former dachau concentration camp . one at a time but for demnig and the supporters of his project , the effectiveness of the " stumbling stones " lies in their focus on the individual , something impossible to achieve with large monuments or memorial services . " my idea was to bring the names of people who were deported back to their homes , the houses where they had lived , " demnig said .
" it 's personal .
big monuments are abstract . " the plaques have only a few words on them : the name of the person , a birth date and location followed by a date and place or of death , if known .
many of the plaques end with the word auschwitz . barbara becker-jákli is a historian at the el-de-haus in cologne , the city 's former gestapo headquarters that is now a museum and research center on the third reich .
she helps artist demnig find the names and addresses of cologne jews who were deported and killed by hitler 's regime . " people come upon the stones for the first time and want to find out more about the people who are mentioned on them , " she said .
" it puts a human face on the nazi terror .
we 're seeing a growing interest in this part of our history . " project an expansion course demnig said he often receives calls from individuals and communities - from europe to the u.s. to israel - interested in sponsoring a plaque for € 95 -lrb- $ 113 -rrb- .
demnig will create it and then travel to the city to install it .
since demand has gotten so high , he has had to enlist the aid of volunteers in various cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 1,300 plaques in cologne , 655 in hamburg , around 400 in berlin and others scattered throughout smaller towns and villages .
demnig said plaques are planned for vienna and paris and several other european cities have expressed interest . for now , at least , munich will not join this growing roster of cities .
according to the munich city council 's decision , demnig will now have to remove the stones he has already embedded in that city 's sidewalks . although the city council said it was following the wishes of the jewish community in rejecting the memorials , jewish opinion is far from unanimous on the matter .
michael rado , head of cologne 's jewish community , said he does not agree that the stones in the ground are disrespectful of the memory of those killed .
on the contrary , according to him , many jews feel it is very important to have a marked burial place .
the millions who were gassed and then cremated were denied that . " now they have gravestones , " he said .
" whenever i pass a one of the plaques i see the name .
if i see löwenthal , i say , ' yep , now everybody can remember mr. löwenthal . '

" asked marian offman , member of the csu and the board of the jewish group , during the debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , munich mayor christian ude and charlotte knobloch , president of the munich jewish cultural center charlotte knobloch -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , president of the jewish cultural center , said she found it " unbearable " that people would be " stepping all over " the names of murdered jews , although she said the project was " well meant " and she could understand those who were of a different opinion . munich 's mayor , christian ude , said he feared a " surfeit of memorials " and pointed to the planned jewish museum and the annual memorials for the victims of the brutal 1938 anti-jewish pogrom called the " night of broken glass " or at the former dachau concentration camp . one at a time but for demnig and the supporters of his project , the effectiveness of the " stumbling stones " lies in their focus on the individual , something impossible to achieve with large monuments or memorial services . " my idea was to bring the names of people who were deported back to their homes , the houses where they had lived , " demnig said .
" it 's personal .
big monuments are abstract . " the plaques have only a few words on them : the name of the person , a birth date and location followed by a date and place or of death , if known .
many of the plaques end with the word auschwitz . barbara becker-jákli is a historian at the el-de-haus in cologne , the city 's former gestapo headquarters that is now a museum and research center on the third reich .
she helps artist demnig find the names and addresses of cologne jews who were deported and killed by hitler 's regime . " people come upon the stones for the first time and want to find out more about the people who are mentioned on them , " she said .
" it puts a human face on the nazi terror .
we 're seeing a growing interest in this part of our history . " project an expansion course demnig said he often receives calls from individuals and communities - from europe to the u.s. to israel - interested in sponsoring a plaque for € 95 -lrb- $ 113 -rrb- .
demnig will create it and then travel to the city to install it .
since demand has gotten so high , he has had to enlist the aid of volunteers in various cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 1,300 plaques in cologne , 655 in hamburg , around 400 in berlin and others scattered throughout smaller towns and villages .
demnig said plaques are planned for vienna and paris and several other european cities have expressed interest . for now , at least , munich will not join this growing roster of cities .
according to the munich city council 's decision , demnig will now have to remove the stones he has already embedded in that city 's sidewalks . although the city council said it was following the wishes of the jewish community in rejecting the memorials , jewish opinion is far from unanimous on the matter .
michael rado , head of cologne 's jewish community , said he does not agree that the stones in the ground are disrespectful of the memory of those killed .
on the contrary , according to him , many jews feel it is very important to have a marked burial place .
the millions who were gassed and then cremated were denied that . " now they have gravestones , " he said .
" whenever i pass a one of the plaques i see the name .
if i see löwenthal , i say , ' yep , now everybody can remember mr. löwenthal . '

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.06.2004 munich decides against " stumbling stone " holocaust memorials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering victims of the holocaust , one person at a time a project to memorialize individuals killed by the nazis by embedding small name plaques on sidewalks has been rejected by the city of munich , even though the memorials are present in 34 other cities and towns . the original idea to create the " stumbling stones " came to gunter demnig , an artist from cologne , when an elderly woman approached him as while he was working on another project - one which traced the path the city 's sinti and roma , also known as gypsies , were forced to march on their way to deportation trains . " the woman told me , well , it 's pretty good what you 're doing here , " he said .
" but gypsy people never lived here .
i thought , maybe she never knew that her neighbors were gypsies . " so deming set out on what has become a quest of sorts , to remember those individuals - jews , homosexuals , jehova 's witnesses , dissenters - who were persecuted and often killed by the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig engraving the plaques he began collecting the names of victims of national socialism and then creating small four-by-four-inch brass-topped plaques with names and dates , which he then embedded into the sidewalk at the address where that person used to live . he called them " stumbling stones " because his idea was that they would make people who came across them pause from their everyday lives and remember that an individual killed by the nazis once lived at that address . the idea has found wide resonance in germany and more then 3,500 of the plaques have been installed in 34 german cities . munich , however , will not be one of them . jewish opposition the city council decided this week , following a proposal from three political parties - the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - to withhold permission to install any of the memorials on public grounds , sidewalks included . in a sometimes explosive public debate , opponents of the project said a broad societal consensus had to be found first . city council members from the green party and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- voted to allow the project to go ahead . those against the stumbling stones project , or stolpersteine in german , said they based their opposition on the opinion of the jewish cultural center of munich and upper bavaria , whose board had strongly disapproved of this form of memorial .
for them , the fact that people would be walking over the names of those killed was unacceptable . " should neo-nazis be able to wipe their dirt from their combat boots on the stones ? " asked marian offman , member of the csu and the board of the jewish group , during the debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , munich mayor christian ude and charlotte knobloch , president of the munich jewish cultural center charlotte knobloch -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , president of the jewish cultural center , said she found it " unbearable " that people would be " stepping all over " the names of murdered jews , although she said the project was " well meant " and she could understand those who were of a different opinion . munich 's mayor , christian ude , said he feared a " surfeit of memorials " and pointed to the planned jewish museum and the annual memorials for the victims of the brutal 1938 anti-jewish pogrom called the " night of broken glass " or at the former dachau concentration camp . one at a time but for demnig and the supporters of his project , the effectiveness of the " stumbling stones " lies in their focus on the individual , something impossible to achieve with large monuments or memorial services . " my idea was to bring the names of people who were deported back to their homes , the houses where they had lived , " demnig said .
" it 's personal .
big monuments are abstract . " the plaques have only a few words on them : the name of the person , a birth date and location followed by a date and place or of death , if known .
many of the plaques end with the word auschwitz . barbara becker-jákli is a historian at the el-de-haus in cologne , the city 's former gestapo headquarters that is now a museum and research center on the third reich .
she helps artist demnig find the names and addresses of cologne jews who were deported and killed by hitler 's regime . " people come upon the stones for the first time and want to find out more about the people who are mentioned on them , " she said .
" it puts a human face on the nazi terror .
we 're seeing a growing interest in this part of our history . " project an expansion course demnig said he often receives calls from individuals and communities - from europe to the u.s. to israel - interested in sponsoring a plaque for € 95 -lrb- $ 113 -rrb- .
demnig will create it and then travel to the city to install it .
since demand has gotten so high , he has had to enlist the aid of volunteers in various cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 1,300 plaques in cologne , 655 in hamburg , around 400 in berlin and others scattered throughout smaller towns and villages .
demnig said plaques are planned for vienna and paris and several other european cities have expressed interest . for now , at least , munich will not join this growing roster of cities .
according to the munich city council 's decision , demnig will now have to remove the stones he has already embedded in that city 's sidewalks . although the city council said it was following the wishes of the jewish community in rejecting the memorials , jewish opinion is far from unanimous on the matter .
michael rado , head of cologne 's jewish community , said he does not agree that the stones in the ground are disrespectful of the memory of those killed .
on the contrary , according to him , many jews feel it is very important to have a marked burial place .
the millions who were gassed and then cremated were denied that . " now they have gravestones , " he said .
" whenever i pass a one of the plaques i see the name .
if i see löwenthal , i say , ' yep , now everybody can remember mr. löwenthal . '

in the coming weeks , they will be sold - but to whom and at what creative cost remains to be seen . located in the green flatlands just outside berlin , the historic german film studios have a colorful , some might even say checkered past .
they played host to marlene dietrich and fritz lang , served as a backdrop for the production of hundreds of nazi-tainted films between 1933 and the end of the second world war , and became home to the ' defa film ag ' during east german communist rule .
by the time the wall fell , the studios were in a state of serious disrepair and in need of a cash injection .
they were sold by the german government to french compagnie generale des eaux , now the media giant vivendi universal .
for the past 12 years , vivendi has been bent on turning babelsberg into a major european film studio .
but plagued by its own financial troubles , vivendi now has to find someone else to play the lead role .
a sale has been in the pipeline for some time , but vivendi , which will be selling at a loss , wants to ensure that whoever takes the studios on also wants to make them shine . head to head there are only two contenders : studio hamburg , a subsidiary of germany 's ndr public broadcaster , and the management team around thierry potok , current babelsberg ceo , who want to acquire the studios by means of a management buy-out .
the ball is squarely in vivendi 's court , and while they scrutinize the bidders ' credentials , everyone concerned is hanging on tenterhooks .
but it was apparently never going to be an easy casting .
" vivendi is assessing the applicants with the care and consideration necessary to ensure an honorable end to its work , " babelsberg press spokesman felix neunzerling told dw-world .
what potok , a former french government worker and banker , could have on his side is money .
whilst studio hamburg is demanding € 30 million -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- from vivendi to take over its activities , potok has made it clear that he would settle for a modest € 25 million , which is less than it would cost the current owners to close the studios down altogether .
film versus television german media has been making much of the implications of inviting a bonafide television network to run this historic highlight of the european film landscape .
film aficionados have voiced loud concern that a tv organization could sound the death knell for the film face of the studios . ingrid meyer-bosse , press spokeswoman for studio hamburg declined to comment on the path babelsberg would strike under the ndr subsidiary 's control .
" our main area of activity is television , but we also do some films , " meyer-bosse told dw-world .
she stressed that at this point , the company was simply waiting for the outcome of the bid .
studio hamburg already owns the film and television studios in berlin 's adlershof , which was the location for germany 's recent box-office hit , " good bye lenin ! " .
the general feeling in the industry is that under potok 's baton , the studios would be less likely to have their image recast .
but to reduce the issue to film versus television is to make it too black and white .
" ultimately any studio needs both because one ca n't survive without the other .
but the big turnover in a studio like studio babelsberg comes from films , which generate more than 50 percent of the production service turnover , " neunzerling said , adding that the studio was completely booked out .
the big projects shot in babelsberg seem to be getting even bigger .
over the past few years , babelsberg has become a hot tip for hollywood producers looking for studio locations on this side of the atlantic .
roman polanski got the ball rolling with his oscar-winning film " the pianist . "
in the past year , babelsberg has been the location for the jackie chan blockbuster , " around the world in 80 days , " kevin spacey 's " beyond the sea , " and " the bourne supremacy " with matt damon and franka potente .
next on the list is " mission impossible , " starring tom cruise , which will start shooting at the end of august .
if the successful bidder can build on this , it might even be possible to direct the studios out of the red . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin studio plays host to hollywood hollywood 's brightest stars land in berlin to remake a jules verne classic .

a sale has been in the pipeline for some time , but vivendi , which will be selling at a loss , wants to ensure that whoever takes the studios on also wants to make them shine . head to head there are only two contenders : studio hamburg , a subsidiary of germany 's ndr public broadcaster , and the management team around thierry potok , current babelsberg ceo , who want to acquire the studios by means of a management buy-out .
the ball is squarely in vivendi 's court , and while they scrutinize the bidders ' credentials , everyone concerned is hanging on tenterhooks .
but it was apparently never going to be an easy casting .
" vivendi is assessing the applicants with the care and consideration necessary to ensure an honorable end to its work , " babelsberg press spokesman felix neunzerling told dw-world .
what potok , a former french government worker and banker , could have on his side is money .
whilst studio hamburg is demanding € 30 million -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- from vivendi to take over its activities , potok has made it clear that he would settle for a modest € 25 million , which is less than it would cost the current owners to close the studios down altogether .
film versus television german media has been making much of the implications of inviting a bonafide television network to run this historic highlight of the european film landscape .
film aficionados have voiced loud concern that a tv organization could sound the death knell for the film face of the studios . ingrid meyer-bosse , press spokeswoman for studio hamburg declined to comment on the path babelsberg would strike under the ndr subsidiary 's control .
" our main area of activity is television , but we also do some films , " meyer-bosse told dw-world .
she stressed that at this point , the company was simply waiting for the outcome of the bid .
studio hamburg already owns the film and television studios in berlin 's adlershof , which was the location for germany 's recent box-office hit , " good bye lenin ! " .
the general feeling in the industry is that under potok 's baton , the studios would be less likely to have their image recast .
but to reduce the issue to film versus television is to make it too black and white .
" ultimately any studio needs both because one ca n't survive without the other .
but the big turnover in a studio like studio babelsberg comes from films , which generate more than 50 percent of the production service turnover , " neunzerling said , adding that the studio was completely booked out .
the big projects shot in babelsberg seem to be getting even bigger .
over the past few years , babelsberg has become a hot tip for hollywood producers looking for studio locations on this side of the atlantic .
roman polanski got the ball rolling with his oscar-winning film " the pianist . "
in the past year , babelsberg has been the location for the jackie chan blockbuster , " around the world in 80 days , " kevin spacey 's " beyond the sea , " and " the bourne supremacy " with matt damon and franka potente .
next on the list is " mission impossible , " starring tom cruise , which will start shooting at the end of august .

in the coming weeks , they will be sold - but to whom and at what creative cost remains to be seen . located in the green flatlands just outside berlin , the historic german film studios have a colorful , some might even say checkered past .
they played host to marlene dietrich and fritz lang , served as a backdrop for the production of hundreds of nazi-tainted films between 1933 and the end of the second world war , and became home to the ' defa film ag ' during east german communist rule .
by the time the wall fell , the studios were in a state of serious disrepair and in need of a cash injection .
they were sold by the german government to french compagnie generale des eaux , now the media giant vivendi universal .
for the past 12 years , vivendi has been bent on turning babelsberg into a major european film studio .
but plagued by its own financial troubles , vivendi now has to find someone else to play the lead role .
a sale has been in the pipeline for some time , but vivendi , which will be selling at a loss , wants to ensure that whoever takes the studios on also wants to make them shine . head to head there are only two contenders : studio hamburg , a subsidiary of germany 's ndr public broadcaster , and the management team around thierry potok , current babelsberg ceo , who want to acquire the studios by means of a management buy-out .

their deception has finally come to light . " bees are n't particularly hardworking , " berlin neurobiologist and zoologist randolf menzel , who has been researching the creatures for nearly 40 years , told german news agency dpa .
" instead they sleep a lot and are rather lazy . " " they spend around 80 percent of the night sleeping , and even during the day they often fly into the hive and give their wings a rest . " but , as if to make up for the inevitable disappointment that his statements would cause , menzel explained that bees have other redeeming qualities .
they are quick learners , recognize various scents and have five memory phases . " if the bee is rewarded once for its behavior , it will remember it for a week .
if it 's rewarded three times , it wo n't forget it for the rest of its life , " menzel said . furthermore , bees ' superb memories allow them to tell the difference between numerous colors and more than 50 scents .
and their sense of smell is similar to that of humans . " what smells good to bees , is also a pleasant smell for people , " menzel said . menzel was awarded a € 10,000 prize last week from the german zoological society for his work with bees . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian haute couture goes to the dogs the owner of a shop selling traditional german clothing has put her talents in the service of man 's best friend , designing lederhosen and other typically bavarian garb for canines .

" our membership in the eu has turned from a distant dream into a close reality , " he told bulgarian public broadcaster bnt . irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country holds the eu presidency , added that " this is a very positive achievement .
it sends out a clear signal that momentum is being maintained in the accession process . "
coming six months ahead of schedule , he pointed out that " this is a major success for bulgaria . " reform still needed eu leaders will be reviewing the accession treaty at their december summit .
if they approve it , it will be signed in spring 2005 . bulgarian foreign minister solomon passy said the talks marked the end of a crucial phase and stressed that over the next two and a half years , the country would be implementing the various commitments made during the negotiations to ensure bulgaria was ready to enter on january 1 , 2007 , when the eu makes its second eastward expansion . new monitoring system may delay entry but the provisional deal also includes a controversial new " safeguard clause " which gives the eu an emergency break measure to delay bulgaria 's entry for up to a year if a tough new monitoring system concludes bulgaria has failed to introduce the necessary reforms . günter verheugen , the eu expansion commissioner , warned that bulgaria still has a lot of work to do .
verheugen said the government still has to " improve its record " in fighting corruption and organized crime . mixed feelings nonetheless , progress has clearly been made .
tourism and industry are growth sectors , with germany one of bulgaria 's most important economic partners .
mitko vassilev , chairman of business club of german economy in bulgaria and a member of the board of bulgaria economic forum , cited numerous examples of german investment . " there 's the metro cash & carry , refrigerator manufacturer liebherr , knauf and waz group , " he said , pointing out that a medium-sized textile business also created 2,200 jobs in the region , exporting mens ' suits to western europe . the mood on the street , meanwhile , is optimistic but reserved .
one young computer programmer told bavarian public broadcaster br that he was in favor of eu accession .
" most of the students i graduated with have gone abroad , " he said .
but the country is becoming increasingly attractive .
he points out that " now they might consider returning .
there are lots of job opportunities for graduates in bulgaria . " for others , though , joining the exclusive eu club wo n't help anything .
small farmers and bulgaria 's roma minority , for example , see a bleak future ahead of them .
" people used to have more respect for us , " said one roma street sweeper .
but now , she added , they are more and more marginalized .
" we used to get decent factory jobs , but these days all you can do if you only have a primary school education is everyone 's dirty work . " sergei stanishev , leader of bulgaria 's socialist opposition , also believes sofia has been over-hasty .

their deception has finally come to light . " bees are n't particularly hardworking , " berlin neurobiologist and zoologist randolf menzel , who has been researching the creatures for nearly 40 years , told german news agency dpa .
" instead they sleep a lot and are rather lazy . " " they spend around 80 percent of the night sleeping , and even during the day they often fly into the hive and give their wings a rest . " but , as if to make up for the inevitable disappointment that his statements would cause , menzel explained that bees have other redeeming qualities .
they are quick learners , recognize various scents and have five memory phases . " if the bee is rewarded once for its behavior , it will remember it for a week .
if it 's rewarded three times , it wo n't forget it for the rest of its life , " menzel said . furthermore , bees ' superb memories allow them to tell the difference between numerous colors and more than 50 scents .
and their sense of smell is similar to that of humans . " what smells good to bees , is also a pleasant smell for people , " menzel said . menzel was awarded a € 10,000 prize last week from the german zoological society for his work with bees . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian haute couture goes to the dogs the owner of a shop selling traditional german clothing has put her talents in the service of man 's best friend , designing lederhosen and other typically bavarian garb for canines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.06.2004 munich decides against " stumbling stone " holocaust memorials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering victims of the holocaust , one person at a time a project to memorialize individuals killed by the nazis by embedding small name plaques on sidewalks has been rejected by the city of munich , even though the memorials are present in 34 other cities and towns . the original idea to create the " stumbling stones " came to gunter demnig , an artist from cologne , when an elderly woman approached him as while he was working on another project - one which traced the path the city 's sinti and roma , also known as gypsies , were forced to march on their way to deportation trains . " the woman told me , well , it 's pretty good what you 're doing here , " he said .
" but gypsy people never lived here .
i thought , maybe she never knew that her neighbors were gypsies . " so deming set out on what has become a quest of sorts , to remember those individuals - jews , homosexuals , jehova 's witnesses , dissenters - who were persecuted and often killed by the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig engraving the plaques he began collecting the names of victims of national socialism and then creating small four-by-four-inch brass-topped plaques with names and dates , which he then embedded into the sidewalk at the address where that person used to live . he called them " stumbling stones " because his idea was that they would make people who came across them pause from their everyday lives and remember that an individual killed by the nazis once lived at that address . the idea has found wide resonance in germany and more then 3,500 of the plaques have been installed in 34 german cities . munich , however , will not be one of them . jewish opposition the city council decided this week , following a proposal from three political parties - the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - to withhold permission to install any of the memorials on public grounds , sidewalks included . in a sometimes explosive public debate , opponents of the project said a broad societal consensus had to be found first . city council members from the green party and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- voted to allow the project to go ahead . those against the stumbling stones project , or stolpersteine in german , said they based their opposition on the opinion of the jewish cultural center of munich and upper bavaria , whose board had strongly disapproved of this form of memorial .
for them , the fact that people would be walking over the names of those killed was unacceptable . " should neo-nazis be able to wipe their dirt from their combat boots on the stones ? " asked marian offman , member of the csu and the board of the jewish group , during the debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , munich mayor christian ude and charlotte knobloch , president of the munich jewish cultural center charlotte knobloch -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , president of the jewish cultural center , said she found it " unbearable " that people would be " stepping all over " the names of murdered jews , although she said the project was " well meant " and she could understand those who were of a different opinion . munich 's mayor , christian ude , said he feared a " surfeit of memorials " and pointed to the planned jewish museum and the annual memorials for the victims of the brutal 1938 anti-jewish pogrom called the " night of broken glass " or at the former dachau concentration camp . one at a time but for demnig and the supporters of his project , the effectiveness of the " stumbling stones " lies in their focus on the individual , something impossible to achieve with large monuments or memorial services . " my idea was to bring the names of people who were deported back to their homes , the houses where they had lived , " demnig said .
" it 's personal .
big monuments are abstract . " the plaques have only a few words on them : the name of the person , a birth date and location followed by a date and place or of death , if known .
many of the plaques end with the word auschwitz . barbara becker-jákli is a historian at the el-de-haus in cologne , the city 's former gestapo headquarters that is now a museum and research center on the third reich .
she helps artist demnig find the names and addresses of cologne jews who were deported and killed by hitler 's regime . " people come upon the stones for the first time and want to find out more about the people who are mentioned on them , " she said .
" it puts a human face on the nazi terror .
we 're seeing a growing interest in this part of our history . " project an expansion course demnig said he often receives calls from individuals and communities - from europe to the u.s. to israel - interested in sponsoring a plaque for € 95 -lrb- $ 113 -rrb- .
demnig will create it and then travel to the city to install it .
since demand has gotten so high , he has had to enlist the aid of volunteers in various cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 1,300 plaques in cologne , 655 in hamburg , around 400 in berlin and others scattered throughout smaller towns and villages .
demnig said plaques are planned for vienna and paris and several other european cities have expressed interest . for now , at least , munich will not join this growing roster of cities .
according to the munich city council 's decision , demnig will now have to remove the stones he has already embedded in that city 's sidewalks . although the city council said it was following the wishes of the jewish community in rejecting the memorials , jewish opinion is far from unanimous on the matter .
michael rado , head of cologne 's jewish community , said he does not agree that the stones in the ground are disrespectful of the memory of those killed .
on the contrary , according to him , many jews feel it is very important to have a marked burial place .
the millions who were gassed and then cremated were denied that . " now they have gravestones , " he said .
" whenever i pass a one of the plaques i see the name .

" our membership in the eu has turned from a distant dream into a close reality , " he told bulgarian public broadcaster bnt . irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country holds the eu presidency , added that " this is a very positive achievement .
it sends out a clear signal that momentum is being maintained in the accession process . "
coming six months ahead of schedule , he pointed out that " this is a major success for bulgaria . " reform still needed eu leaders will be reviewing the accession treaty at their december summit .
if they approve it , it will be signed in spring 2005 . bulgarian foreign minister solomon passy said the talks marked the end of a crucial phase and stressed that over the next two and a half years , the country would be implementing the various commitments made during the negotiations to ensure bulgaria was ready to enter on january 1 , 2007 , when the eu makes its second eastward expansion . new monitoring system may delay entry but the provisional deal also includes a controversial new " safeguard clause " which gives the eu an emergency break measure to delay bulgaria 's entry for up to a year if a tough new monitoring system concludes bulgaria has failed to introduce the necessary reforms . günter verheugen , the eu expansion commissioner , warned that bulgaria still has a lot of work to do .
verheugen said the government still has to " improve its record " in fighting corruption and organized crime . mixed feelings nonetheless , progress has clearly been made .
tourism and industry are growth sectors , with germany one of bulgaria 's most important economic partners .
mitko vassilev , chairman of business club of german economy in bulgaria and a member of the board of bulgaria economic forum , cited numerous examples of german investment . " there 's the metro cash & carry , refrigerator manufacturer liebherr , knauf and waz group , " he said , pointing out that a medium-sized textile business also created 2,200 jobs in the region , exporting mens ' suits to western europe . the mood on the street , meanwhile , is optimistic but reserved .
one young computer programmer told bavarian public broadcaster br that he was in favor of eu accession .
" most of the students i graduated with have gone abroad , " he said .
but the country is becoming increasingly attractive .
he points out that " now they might consider returning .
there are lots of job opportunities for graduates in bulgaria . " for others , though , joining the exclusive eu club wo n't help anything .
small farmers and bulgaria 's roma minority , for example , see a bleak future ahead of them .
" people used to have more respect for us , " said one roma street sweeper .
but now , she added , they are more and more marginalized .
" we used to get decent factory jobs , but these days all you can do if you only have a primary school education is everyone 's dirty work . " sergei stanishev , leader of bulgaria 's socialist opposition , also believes sofia has been over-hasty .
" unfortunately , the government chose speed over quality , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de year-long delay possible for future eu members the eu will be able to delay bulgaria and romania from joining the bloc for a year under a new safeguard clause now being proposed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.06.2004 munich decides against " stumbling stone " holocaust memorials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering victims of the holocaust , one person at a time a project to memorialize individuals killed by the nazis by embedding small name plaques on sidewalks has been rejected by the city of munich , even though the memorials are present in 34 other cities and towns . the original idea to create the " stumbling stones " came to gunter demnig , an artist from cologne , when an elderly woman approached him as while he was working on another project - one which traced the path the city 's sinti and roma , also known as gypsies , were forced to march on their way to deportation trains . " the woman told me , well , it 's pretty good what you 're doing here , " he said .
" but gypsy people never lived here .
i thought , maybe she never knew that her neighbors were gypsies . " so deming set out on what has become a quest of sorts , to remember those individuals - jews , homosexuals , jehova 's witnesses , dissenters - who were persecuted and often killed by the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig engraving the plaques he began collecting the names of victims of national socialism and then creating small four-by-four-inch brass-topped plaques with names and dates , which he then embedded into the sidewalk at the address where that person used to live . he called them " stumbling stones " because his idea was that they would make people who came across them pause from their everyday lives and remember that an individual killed by the nazis once lived at that address . the idea has found wide resonance in germany and more then 3,500 of the plaques have been installed in 34 german cities . munich , however , will not be one of them . jewish opposition the city council decided this week , following a proposal from three political parties - the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - to withhold permission to install any of the memorials on public grounds , sidewalks included . in a sometimes explosive public debate , opponents of the project said a broad societal consensus had to be found first . city council members from the green party and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- voted to allow the project to go ahead . those against the stumbling stones project , or stolpersteine in german , said they based their opposition on the opinion of the jewish cultural center of munich and upper bavaria , whose board had strongly disapproved of this form of memorial .
for them , the fact that people would be walking over the names of those killed was unacceptable . " should neo-nazis be able to wipe their dirt from their combat boots on the stones ? " asked marian offman , member of the csu and the board of the jewish group , during the debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , munich mayor christian ude and charlotte knobloch , president of the munich jewish cultural center charlotte knobloch -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , president of the jewish cultural center , said she found it " unbearable " that people would be " stepping all over " the names of murdered jews , although she said the project was " well meant " and she could understand those who were of a different opinion . munich 's mayor , christian ude , said he feared a " surfeit of memorials " and pointed to the planned jewish museum and the annual memorials for the victims of the brutal 1938 anti-jewish pogrom called the " night of broken glass " or at the former dachau concentration camp . one at a time but for demnig and the supporters of his project , the effectiveness of the " stumbling stones " lies in their focus on the individual , something impossible to achieve with large monuments or memorial services . " my idea was to bring the names of people who were deported back to their homes , the houses where they had lived , " demnig said .
" it 's personal .
big monuments are abstract . " the plaques have only a few words on them : the name of the person , a birth date and location followed by a date and place or of death , if known .
many of the plaques end with the word auschwitz . barbara becker-jákli is a historian at the el-de-haus in cologne , the city 's former gestapo headquarters that is now a museum and research center on the third reich .
she helps artist demnig find the names and addresses of cologne jews who were deported and killed by hitler 's regime . " people come upon the stones for the first time and want to find out more about the people who are mentioned on them , " she said .
" it puts a human face on the nazi terror .
we 're seeing a growing interest in this part of our history . " project an expansion course demnig said he often receives calls from individuals and communities - from europe to the u.s. to israel - interested in sponsoring a plaque for € 95 -lrb- $ 113 -rrb- .
demnig will create it and then travel to the city to install it .
since demand has gotten so high , he has had to enlist the aid of volunteers in various cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 1,300 plaques in cologne , 655 in hamburg , around 400 in berlin and others scattered throughout smaller towns and villages .
demnig said plaques are planned for vienna and paris and several other european cities have expressed interest . for now , at least , munich will not join this growing roster of cities .
according to the munich city council 's decision , demnig will now have to remove the stones he has already embedded in that city 's sidewalks . although the city council said it was following the wishes of the jewish community in rejecting the memorials , jewish opinion is far from unanimous on the matter .
michael rado , head of cologne 's jewish community , said he does not agree that the stones in the ground are disrespectful of the memory of those killed .
on the contrary , according to him , many jews feel it is very important to have a marked burial place .
the millions who were gassed and then cremated were denied that . " now they have gravestones , " he said .
" whenever i pass a one of the plaques i see the name .

their deception has finally come to light . " bees are n't particularly hardworking , " berlin neurobiologist and zoologist randolf menzel , who has been researching the creatures for nearly 40 years , told german news agency dpa .
" instead they sleep a lot and are rather lazy . " " they spend around 80 percent of the night sleeping , and even during the day they often fly into the hive and give their wings a rest . " but , as if to make up for the inevitable disappointment that his statements would cause , menzel explained that bees have other redeeming qualities .
they are quick learners , recognize various scents and have five memory phases . " if the bee is rewarded once for its behavior , it will remember it for a week .
if it 's rewarded three times , it wo n't forget it for the rest of its life , " menzel said . furthermore , bees ' superb memories allow them to tell the difference between numerous colors and more than 50 scents .
and their sense of smell is similar to that of humans . " what smells good to bees , is also a pleasant smell for people , " menzel said . menzel was awarded a € 10,000 prize last week from the german zoological society for his work with bees . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian haute couture goes to the dogs the owner of a shop selling traditional german clothing has put her talents in the service of man 's best friend , designing lederhosen and other typically bavarian garb for canines .

a joint statement concludes that croatia has met the political criteria to join the bloc .
however , some thorny issues remain and the eu is warning that efforts still need to be addressed such as minority rights , refugee returns , reform of the judiciary , regional co-operation , the fight against corruption and crucially co-operation with the international criminal tribunal in the hague .
the document presses zagreb to maintain full co-operation with icty and urges the country to find a transfer former general ante gotovina .
britain and the netherlands have heavily criticized croatia for not being able to bring gotovina to the tribunal .
both countries had refused to ratify an association agreement which paves the way for membership until there was increased co-operation from zagreb .
the netherlands has now ratified the agreement and britain is expected to do so before the summer recess of parliament .
italy is also expected to ratify the agreement after some unrelated issues were resolved .
heads of state and government are also expected to encourage other countries in the western balkans to move towards joining the eu .
the commission is expected to present the framework for talks before its mandate ends in october .

a joint statement concludes that croatia has met the political criteria to join the bloc .
however , some thorny issues remain and the eu is warning that efforts still need to be addressed such as minority rights , refugee returns , reform of the judiciary , regional co-operation , the fight against corruption and crucially co-operation with the international criminal tribunal in the hague .
the document presses zagreb to maintain full co-operation with icty and urges the country to find a transfer former general ante gotovina .
britain and the netherlands have heavily criticized croatia for not being able to bring gotovina to the tribunal .
both countries had refused to ratify an association agreement which paves the way for membership until there was increased co-operation from zagreb .
the netherlands has now ratified the agreement and britain is expected to do so before the summer recess of parliament .
italy is also expected to ratify the agreement after some unrelated issues were resolved .
heads of state and government are also expected to encourage other countries in the western balkans to move towards joining the eu .
the commission is expected to present the framework for talks before its mandate ends in october .

in the coming weeks , they will be sold - but to whom and at what creative cost remains to be seen . located in the green flatlands just outside berlin , the historic german film studios have a colorful , some might even say checkered past .
they played host to marlene dietrich and fritz lang , served as a backdrop for the production of hundreds of nazi-tainted films between 1933 and the end of the second world war , and became home to the ' defa film ag ' during east german communist rule .
by the time the wall fell , the studios were in a state of serious disrepair and in need of a cash injection .
they were sold by the german government to french compagnie generale des eaux , now the media giant vivendi universal .
for the past 12 years , vivendi has been bent on turning babelsberg into a major european film studio .
but plagued by its own financial troubles , vivendi now has to find someone else to play the lead role .
a sale has been in the pipeline for some time , but vivendi , which will be selling at a loss , wants to ensure that whoever takes the studios on also wants to make them shine . head to head there are only two contenders : studio hamburg , a subsidiary of germany 's ndr public broadcaster , and the management team around thierry potok , current babelsberg ceo , who want to acquire the studios by means of a management buy-out .
the ball is squarely in vivendi 's court , and while they scrutinize the bidders ' credentials , everyone concerned is hanging on tenterhooks .
but it was apparently never going to be an easy casting .
" vivendi is assessing the applicants with the care and consideration necessary to ensure an honorable end to its work , " babelsberg press spokesman felix neunzerling told dw-world .
what potok , a former french government worker and banker , could have on his side is money .
whilst studio hamburg is demanding € 30 million -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- from vivendi to take over its activities , potok has made it clear that he would settle for a modest € 25 million , which is less than it would cost the current owners to close the studios down altogether .
film versus television german media has been making much of the implications of inviting a bonafide television network to run this historic highlight of the european film landscape .
film aficionados have voiced loud concern that a tv organization could sound the death knell for the film face of the studios . ingrid meyer-bosse , press spokeswoman for studio hamburg declined to comment on the path babelsberg would strike under the ndr subsidiary 's control .
" our main area of activity is television , but we also do some films , " meyer-bosse told dw-world .
she stressed that at this point , the company was simply waiting for the outcome of the bid .
studio hamburg already owns the film and television studios in berlin 's adlershof , which was the location for germany 's recent box-office hit , " good bye lenin ! " .
the general feeling in the industry is that under potok 's baton , the studios would be less likely to have their image recast .
but to reduce the issue to film versus television is to make it too black and white .
" ultimately any studio needs both because one ca n't survive without the other .
but the big turnover in a studio like studio babelsberg comes from films , which generate more than 50 percent of the production service turnover , " neunzerling said , adding that the studio was completely booked out .
the big projects shot in babelsberg seem to be getting even bigger .
over the past few years , babelsberg has become a hot tip for hollywood producers looking for studio locations on this side of the atlantic .
roman polanski got the ball rolling with his oscar-winning film " the pianist . "
in the past year , babelsberg has been the location for the jackie chan blockbuster , " around the world in 80 days , " kevin spacey 's " beyond the sea , " and " the bourne supremacy " with matt damon and franka potente .

in the coming weeks , they will be sold - but to whom and at what creative cost remains to be seen . located in the green flatlands just outside berlin , the historic german film studios have a colorful , some might even say checkered past .
they played host to marlene dietrich and fritz lang , served as a backdrop for the production of hundreds of nazi-tainted films between 1933 and the end of the second world war , and became home to the ' defa film ag ' during east german communist rule .
by the time the wall fell , the studios were in a state of serious disrepair and in need of a cash injection .
they were sold by the german government to french compagnie generale des eaux , now the media giant vivendi universal .
for the past 12 years , vivendi has been bent on turning babelsberg into a major european film studio .
but plagued by its own financial troubles , vivendi now has to find someone else to play the lead role .
a sale has been in the pipeline for some time , but vivendi , which will be selling at a loss , wants to ensure that whoever takes the studios on also wants to make them shine . head to head there are only two contenders : studio hamburg , a subsidiary of germany 's ndr public broadcaster , and the management team around thierry potok , current babelsberg ceo , who want to acquire the studios by means of a management buy-out .
the ball is squarely in vivendi 's court , and while they scrutinize the bidders ' credentials , everyone concerned is hanging on tenterhooks .
but it was apparently never going to be an easy casting .
" vivendi is assessing the applicants with the care and consideration necessary to ensure an honorable end to its work , " babelsberg press spokesman felix neunzerling told dw-world .
what potok , a former french government worker and banker , could have on his side is money .
whilst studio hamburg is demanding € 30 million -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- from vivendi to take over its activities , potok has made it clear that he would settle for a modest € 25 million , which is less than it would cost the current owners to close the studios down altogether .
film versus television german media has been making much of the implications of inviting a bonafide television network to run this historic highlight of the european film landscape .
film aficionados have voiced loud concern that a tv organization could sound the death knell for the film face of the studios . ingrid meyer-bosse , press spokeswoman for studio hamburg declined to comment on the path babelsberg would strike under the ndr subsidiary 's control .
" our main area of activity is television , but we also do some films , " meyer-bosse told dw-world .
she stressed that at this point , the company was simply waiting for the outcome of the bid .
studio hamburg already owns the film and television studios in berlin 's adlershof , which was the location for germany 's recent box-office hit , " good bye lenin ! " .
the general feeling in the industry is that under potok 's baton , the studios would be less likely to have their image recast .
but to reduce the issue to film versus television is to make it too black and white .
" ultimately any studio needs both because one ca n't survive without the other .
but the big turnover in a studio like studio babelsberg comes from films , which generate more than 50 percent of the production service turnover , " neunzerling said , adding that the studio was completely booked out .
the big projects shot in babelsberg seem to be getting even bigger .
over the past few years , babelsberg has become a hot tip for hollywood producers looking for studio locations on this side of the atlantic .
roman polanski got the ball rolling with his oscar-winning film " the pianist . "
in the past year , babelsberg has been the location for the jackie chan blockbuster , " around the world in 80 days , " kevin spacey 's " beyond the sea , " and " the bourne supremacy " with matt damon and franka potente .
next on the list is " mission impossible , " starring tom cruise , which will start shooting at the end of august .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.06.2004 munich decides against " stumbling stone " holocaust memorials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering victims of the holocaust , one person at a time a project to memorialize individuals killed by the nazis by embedding small name plaques on sidewalks has been rejected by the city of munich , even though the memorials are present in 34 other cities and towns . the original idea to create the " stumbling stones " came to gunter demnig , an artist from cologne , when an elderly woman approached him as while he was working on another project - one which traced the path the city 's sinti and roma , also known as gypsies , were forced to march on their way to deportation trains . " the woman told me , well , it 's pretty good what you 're doing here , " he said .
" but gypsy people never lived here .
i thought , maybe she never knew that her neighbors were gypsies . " so deming set out on what has become a quest of sorts , to remember those individuals - jews , homosexuals , jehova 's witnesses , dissenters - who were persecuted and often killed by the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gunter demnig engraving the plaques he began collecting the names of victims of national socialism and then creating small four-by-four-inch brass-topped plaques with names and dates , which he then embedded into the sidewalk at the address where that person used to live . he called them " stumbling stones " because his idea was that they would make people who came across them pause from their everyday lives and remember that an individual killed by the nazis once lived at that address . the idea has found wide resonance in germany and more then 3,500 of the plaques have been installed in 34 german cities . munich , however , will not be one of them . jewish opposition the city council decided this week , following a proposal from three political parties - the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - to withhold permission to install any of the memorials on public grounds , sidewalks included . in a sometimes explosive public debate , opponents of the project said a broad societal consensus had to be found first . city council members from the green party and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- voted to allow the project to go ahead . those against the stumbling stones project , or stolpersteine in german , said they based their opposition on the opinion of the jewish cultural center of munich and upper bavaria , whose board had strongly disapproved of this form of memorial .
for them , the fact that people would be walking over the names of those killed was unacceptable . " should neo-nazis be able to wipe their dirt from their combat boots on the stones ? " asked marian offman , member of the csu and the board of the jewish group , during the debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , munich mayor christian ude and charlotte knobloch , president of the munich jewish cultural center charlotte knobloch -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , president of the jewish cultural center , said she found it " unbearable " that people would be " stepping all over " the names of murdered jews , although she said the project was " well meant " and she could understand those who were of a different opinion . munich 's mayor , christian ude , said he feared a " surfeit of memorials " and pointed to the planned jewish museum and the annual memorials for the victims of the brutal 1938 anti-jewish pogrom called the " night of broken glass " or at the former dachau concentration camp . one at a time but for demnig and the supporters of his project , the effectiveness of the " stumbling stones " lies in their focus on the individual , something impossible to achieve with large monuments or memorial services . " my idea was to bring the names of people who were deported back to their homes , the houses where they had lived , " demnig said .
" it 's personal .
big monuments are abstract . " the plaques have only a few words on them : the name of the person , a birth date and location followed by a date and place or of death , if known .
many of the plaques end with the word auschwitz . barbara becker-jákli is a historian at the el-de-haus in cologne , the city 's former gestapo headquarters that is now a museum and research center on the third reich .
she helps artist demnig find the names and addresses of cologne jews who were deported and killed by hitler 's regime . " people come upon the stones for the first time and want to find out more about the people who are mentioned on them , " she said .
" it puts a human face on the nazi terror .
we 're seeing a growing interest in this part of our history . " project an expansion course demnig said he often receives calls from individuals and communities - from europe to the u.s. to israel - interested in sponsoring a plaque for € 95 -lrb- $ 113 -rrb- .
demnig will create it and then travel to the city to install it .
since demand has gotten so high , he has had to enlist the aid of volunteers in various cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 1,300 plaques in cologne , 655 in hamburg , around 400 in berlin and others scattered throughout smaller towns and villages .
demnig said plaques are planned for vienna and paris and several other european cities have expressed interest . for now , at least , munich will not join this growing roster of cities .
according to the munich city council 's decision , demnig will now have to remove the stones he has already embedded in that city 's sidewalks . although the city council said it was following the wishes of the jewish community in rejecting the memorials , jewish opinion is far from unanimous on the matter .
michael rado , head of cologne 's jewish community , said he does not agree that the stones in the ground are disrespectful of the memory of those killed .
on the contrary , according to him , many jews feel it is very important to have a marked burial place .
the millions who were gassed and then cremated were denied that . " now they have gravestones , " he said .
" whenever i pass a one of the plaques i see the name .
if i see löwenthal , i say , ' yep , now everybody can remember mr. löwenthal . '

the document presses zagreb to maintain full co-operation with icty and urges the country to find a transfer former general ante gotovina .
britain and the netherlands have heavily criticized croatia for not being able to bring gotovina to the tribunal .

in the coming weeks , they will be sold - but to whom and at what creative cost remains to be seen . located in the green flatlands just outside berlin , the historic german film studios have a colorful , some might even say checkered past .
they played host to marlene dietrich and fritz lang , served as a backdrop for the production of hundreds of nazi-tainted films between 1933 and the end of the second world war , and became home to the ' defa film ag ' during east german communist rule .
by the time the wall fell , the studios were in a state of serious disrepair and in need of a cash injection .
they were sold by the german government to french compagnie generale des eaux , now the media giant vivendi universal .
for the past 12 years , vivendi has been bent on turning babelsberg into a major european film studio .
but plagued by its own financial troubles , vivendi now has to find someone else to play the lead role .
a sale has been in the pipeline for some time , but vivendi , which will be selling at a loss , wants to ensure that whoever takes the studios on also wants to make them shine . head to head there are only two contenders : studio hamburg , a subsidiary of germany 's ndr public broadcaster , and the management team around thierry potok , current babelsberg ceo , who want to acquire the studios by means of a management buy-out .
the ball is squarely in vivendi 's court , and while they scrutinize the bidders ' credentials , everyone concerned is hanging on tenterhooks .
but it was apparently never going to be an easy casting .
" vivendi is assessing the applicants with the care and consideration necessary to ensure an honorable end to its work , " babelsberg press spokesman felix neunzerling told dw-world .
what potok , a former french government worker and banker , could have on his side is money .
whilst studio hamburg is demanding € 30 million -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- from vivendi to take over its activities , potok has made it clear that he would settle for a modest € 25 million , which is less than it would cost the current owners to close the studios down altogether .
film versus television german media has been making much of the implications of inviting a bonafide television network to run this historic highlight of the european film landscape .
film aficionados have voiced loud concern that a tv organization could sound the death knell for the film face of the studios . ingrid meyer-bosse , press spokeswoman for studio hamburg declined to comment on the path babelsberg would strike under the ndr subsidiary 's control .
" our main area of activity is television , but we also do some films , " meyer-bosse told dw-world .
she stressed that at this point , the company was simply waiting for the outcome of the bid .
studio hamburg already owns the film and television studios in berlin 's adlershof , which was the location for germany 's recent box-office hit , " good bye lenin ! " .
the general feeling in the industry is that under potok 's baton , the studios would be less likely to have their image recast .

germany 's joschka fischer eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings . the first agenda item of the conference is the draft european union constitution , which has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
in the time since , a number of compromises have been forged and its chances of a draft getting approved by the end of the summit have increased dramatically .
" as you would expect , there are different points of view , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country also currently holds the rotating european union presidency .
" but i think we are closing in on the agreement . "
a german government spokesperson said on friday that germany was willing to back the irish proposal , but added that no further changes would get his country 's support , reuters news agency reported . the remaining key sticking points are arguments over the member states ' voting powers .
both poland and spain blocked the draft over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most-populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population on key decisions , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent respectively .
the deal would ensure that the eu 's most populous countries , germany , france and britain , would not be able to instantly overrule middle and smaller sized members .
thursday night , the irish suggested allowing a blocking minority of no less than four states that make up 35 percent of the population .
poland and spain hold out for more neither poland nor spain has thus far agreed to the formula devised by the irish presidency , but polish prime minister marek belka described it thursday as " a step in the right direction . "
a member of the spanish delegation negotiating the deal in brussels told the french news wire agence france presse that although prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero had accepted the principle of the double majority voting system , he was unhappy with the 65 percent of the population figure .
instead , the official said , spain would call for 50 percent of the member states plus an additional member and that the votes represent two-thirds of the total population of the eu .
spain is also seeking to increase its number of seats in the european parliament from the 54 seats foreseen in the draft constitution by " three or five " seats , the delegate told afp .
fierce debate over commission president though prospects appear good for a deal to be reached on the constitution , the horse-trading over who will be the next head of the european commission , the eu 's executive , after romano prodi 's mandate expires in october could be far trickier .
germany and france have both backed liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt as their candidate of choice , but the belgian leader 's leanings toward a federalist europe have made tony blair and british politicians uneasy .
verhofstadt also angered london with his steadfast and very vocal opposition of the united states-led war against iraq .
blair has sought to block verhofstadt 's nomination , and a british government spokesman said greece , italy , poland , portugal and slovenia also opposed the belgian .
instead , london has shown enthusiasm for the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- candidate chris patten , the eu external affairs commissioner .
but friday afternoon a german government source told reuters that patten was no longer a candidate .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , also a potential ccontender for the position , again stressed on friday that he does n't want the job , as did ireland 's ahern , who could garner widespread support , on thursday .
the third tough issue facing summit participants is the role of religion in the constitution .
the draft preamble mentions its importance to european culture , but it does n't explicitly refer to christianity or god .
led by italy and poland , several countries are adamant that it should .
but france and belgium are just as vehement in their opposition of any such mention .
" france is n't anti-christian .
it resolved this type of quarrel 100 years ago .
we 're not going to reopen this debate , " french president chirac told a news conference .

germany 's joschka fischer eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings . the first agenda item of the conference is the draft european union constitution , which has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
in the time since , a number of compromises have been forged and its chances of a draft getting approved by the end of the summit have increased dramatically .
" as you would expect , there are different points of view , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country also currently holds the rotating european union presidency .
" but i think we are closing in on the agreement . "
a german government spokesperson said on friday that germany was willing to back the irish proposal , but added that no further changes would get his country 's support , reuters news agency reported . the remaining key sticking points are arguments over the member states ' voting powers .
both poland and spain blocked the draft over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most-populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population on key decisions , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent respectively .
the deal would ensure that the eu 's most populous countries , germany , france and britain , would not be able to instantly overrule middle and smaller sized members .
thursday night , the irish suggested allowing a blocking minority of no less than four states that make up 35 percent of the population .
poland and spain hold out for more neither poland nor spain has thus far agreed to the formula devised by the irish presidency , but polish prime minister marek belka described it thursday as " a step in the right direction . "
a member of the spanish delegation negotiating the deal in brussels told the french news wire agence france presse that although prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero had accepted the principle of the double majority voting system , he was unhappy with the 65 percent of the population figure .
instead , the official said , spain would call for 50 percent of the member states plus an additional member and that the votes represent two-thirds of the total population of the eu .
spain is also seeking to increase its number of seats in the european parliament from the 54 seats foreseen in the draft constitution by " three or five " seats , the delegate told afp .
fierce debate over commission president though prospects appear good for a deal to be reached on the constitution , the horse-trading over who will be the next head of the european commission , the eu 's executive , after romano prodi 's mandate expires in october could be far trickier .
germany and france have both backed liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt as their candidate of choice , but the belgian leader 's leanings toward a federalist europe have made tony blair and british politicians uneasy .
verhofstadt also angered london with his steadfast and very vocal opposition of the united states-led war against iraq .
blair has sought to block verhofstadt 's nomination , and a british government spokesman said greece , italy , poland , portugal and slovenia also opposed the belgian .
instead , london has shown enthusiasm for the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- candidate chris patten , the eu external affairs commissioner .
but friday afternoon a german government source told reuters that patten was no longer a candidate .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , also a potential ccontender for the position , again stressed on friday that he does n't want the job , as did ireland 's ahern , who could garner widespread support , on thursday .
the third tough issue facing summit participants is the role of religion in the constitution .
the draft preamble mentions its importance to european culture , but it does n't explicitly refer to christianity or god .
led by italy and poland , several countries are adamant that it should .
but france and belgium are just as vehement in their opposition of any such mention .
" france is n't anti-christian .
it resolved this type of quarrel 100 years ago .

it 's been deprived of one of its most popular tourist destinations for the benefit of the capital .
on top of being the seat of the federal government , berlin is now the home of germany 's national debt clock . " our debt clock depicts the entire scale of this catastrophically high level of debt and its growth , " karl heinz däke , head of the taxpayer watchdog group bund der steuerzähler -lrb- bdst -rrb- , said as the red-numbered digital clock was unveiled on a building façade in the government district wednesday . " i would advise politicians from the federal government and the states to come here as often as possible to get an idea of how high the national debt is and how swiftly it increases , " däke said . the taxpayer group recently moved into the building down the street from the federal finance ministry . nearly too fast for the naked eye the last four digits on the clock move so quickly you can hardly register them .
on friday morning it stood at € 1,361,959,207,548 . every second , germany 's national debt increases by € 2,186 -lrb- $ 2,621 -rrb- , bdst , the self-proclaimed " financial conscience of the nation " calculated .
that figure reflects the average monthly salary of a german employee .
the group estimated that finance minister hans eichel had to spend every fifth euro paid in taxes last year to cover the € 38 billion interest the national debt acquired . as they continually put pressure on politicians to stop the state from racking up more debt , däke and the bdst seem to think their pleas will one day be heard .
at least their clock only has space for 13 digits , suggesting the debt wo n't reach € 10 billion . just days after the clock started ticking in the capital , it 's already hit € 1,361,959,273,128 - and counting . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de massive budget hole hits government hard a panel of fiscal experts on thursday delivered the bad news everyone expected : over the next three years , germany will see tax shortfalls of € 61 billion -lrb- $ 72 billion -rrb- , posing huge problems domestically and for europe .

their deception has finally come to light . " bees are n't particularly hardworking , " berlin neurobiologist and zoologist randolf menzel , who has been researching the creatures for nearly 40 years , told german news agency dpa .
" instead they sleep a lot and are rather lazy . " " they spend around 80 percent of the night sleeping , and even during the day they often fly into the hive and give their wings a rest . " but , as if to make up for the inevitable disappointment that his statements would cause , menzel explained that bees have other redeeming qualities .
they are quick learners , recognize various scents and have five memory phases . " if the bee is rewarded once for its behavior , it will remember it for a week .
if it 's rewarded three times , it wo n't forget it for the rest of its life , " menzel said . furthermore , bees ' superb memories allow them to tell the difference between numerous colors and more than 50 scents .
and their sense of smell is similar to that of humans .

bbc news online looks back on this medical milestone .
gordon underwent surgery in 1979 gordon macdonald is one of the uk 's longest surviving heart transplant patient .
he underwent surgery in 1979 .
his heart was failing and he was critically ill .
" life was very difficult , " he says .
" i was only 40 years old .
i had young children .
i had everything to live for .
" but i was very ill .
my life was ebbing away . "
doctors offered gordon a heart transplant .
it was a gamble .
there was no guarantee it would save his life .
the procedure had only been carried out on a small number of patients around the world , with mixed results .
gordon jumped at the chance .
" i was absolutely delighted , " he says .
the surgery , which was carried out at papworth hospital in cambridgeshire , was a success .
" i felt fantastically well after the transplant , " he says .
" i started to do things that i had n't done for a long time , such as walking , cycling and swimming .
" my life changed from that day .
it changed in every way . "
british pioneer the operation was carried out by sir terrence english .
he had spent most of the 1970s in the united states , where he developed the skills needed to carry out such a complex procedure .
on his return to britain , sir terrence faced some opposition to his plans to carry out heart transplants .
there was a lot of pressure on us to succeed sir terrence english " there were a lot of difficulties , " he says .
" we did n't have approval from the department of health to carry out heart transplants .
" we had tacit approval from the local health authority , which agreed to fund two operations .
there was a lot of pressure on us to succeed . "
the first patient died before he could have the transplant .
however , subsequent attempts proved more successful .
" we were very relieved , " says the now-retired surgeon .
over 1,000 people have since gone on to have a heart transplant at papworth .
sir terrence and his colleagues went on to achieve even greater things .
in 1984 , they carried out europe 's first successful heart-lung transplant .
the following year , they performed the world 's first heart , lung and liver transplant .
ten years ago , they carried out the world 's first operation to give a man a " bionic " heart - a battery-operated heart known as a ventricular assist device .
world first the first heart transplant was carried out by christian barnard in south africa in 1967 .
he transplanted the heart of a road accident victim into a 59 year-old-man , called louis washkansky , in cape town 's groote schuur hospital .
we did not think it was a great event christian barnard after carrying out the world 's first heart transplant in 1967 mr washkansky died 18 days later after contracting pneumonia .
the powerful drugs he was taking to stop his body from rejecting the heart had reduced his ability to fight off the infection .
nevertheless , the operation marked a milestone in medicine - even if mr barnard did not see it that way .
speaking after the operation , he played down the importance of what he had just done .
" we did not think it was a great event and there was no special feeling .
i was happy when i saw the heart beating again .
" we did not stand up or cheer or something like that .
i did n't even inform the hospital authorities that i was going to do the operation . "
however , others did see it as a great event .
today , thousands of people have heart transplants every year .
to date , there have been 4,792 heart transplants in the uk .
the operation has helped many to live full and healthy lives .
" the heart transplant really was an enormous technological advance , " says professor jeremy pearson , associate medical director of the british heart foundation .
" having a transplant gives you at least 10 years of healthy life .
for some people , its much longer . "
around 300 heart transplants are carried out in the uk each year .
the figure could be much higher if more hearts were available .
organ shortage the fact is not enough people in the uk are willing to donate their organs after they die .
it is something the government is trying to address .
" we know that 90 % of the population support transplantation but only 19 % have so far joined the nhs organ donor register , " says a spokeswoman for the department of health .
" we would urge people to discuss this issue with relatives and join the nhs organ donor register . "
in recent years , doctors and scientists have started to look at alternatives to live heart transplants .
" there is quite a lot of work going on , " says professor pearson .
one of the big hopes is stem cell research .
recent studies have suggested that taking cells from bone marrow and injecting them directly into the heart can help it to repair .
however , much more research is needed before this technique could be offered to patients .
" it is not quite science fiction , " says professor pearson .
" but it is still many years away . "
in the meantime , the focus is on getting more people to sign up to donate their hearts after they die .
" it is essential , " says gordon macdonald .
" it makes such a difference to people 's lives .
it 's incredible .
" i am so indebted to the family who donated their relative 's organ for my transplant .
it has changed my life . "

" having a transplant gives you at least 10 years of healthy life .
for some people , its much longer . "
around 300 heart transplants are carried out in the uk each year .
the figure could be much higher if more hearts were available .
organ shortage the fact is not enough people in the uk are willing to donate their organs after they die .
it is something the government is trying to address .
" we know that 90 % of the population support transplantation but only 19 % have so far joined the nhs organ donor register , " says a spokeswoman for the department of health .
" we would urge people to discuss this issue with relatives and join the nhs organ donor register . "
in recent years , doctors and scientists have started to look at alternatives to live heart transplants .
" there is quite a lot of work going on , " says professor pearson .
one of the big hopes is stem cell research .
recent studies have suggested that taking cells from bone marrow and injecting them directly into the heart can help it to repair .
however , much more research is needed before this technique could be offered to patients .
" it is not quite science fiction , " says professor pearson .
" but it is still many years away . "
in the meantime , the focus is on getting more people to sign up to donate their hearts after they die .
" it is essential , " says gordon macdonald .
" it makes such a difference to people 's lives .
it 's incredible .
" i am so indebted to the family who donated their relative 's organ for my transplant .
it has changed my life . "

bbc news online looks back on this medical milestone .
gordon underwent surgery in 1979 gordon macdonald is one of the uk 's longest surviving heart transplant patient .
he underwent surgery in 1979 .
his heart was failing and he was critically ill .
" life was very difficult , " he says .
" i was only 40 years old .
i had young children .
i had everything to live for .
" but i was very ill .
my life was ebbing away . "
doctors offered gordon a heart transplant .
it was a gamble .
there was no guarantee it would save his life .
the procedure had only been carried out on a small number of patients around the world , with mixed results .
gordon jumped at the chance .
" i was absolutely delighted , " he says .
the surgery , which was carried out at papworth hospital in cambridgeshire , was a success .
" i felt fantastically well after the transplant , " he says .
" i started to do things that i had n't done for a long time , such as walking , cycling and swimming .
" my life changed from that day .
it changed in every way . "
british pioneer the operation was carried out by sir terrence english .
he had spent most of the 1970s in the united states , where he developed the skills needed to carry out such a complex procedure .
on his return to britain , sir terrence faced some opposition to his plans to carry out heart transplants .
there was a lot of pressure on us to succeed sir terrence english " there were a lot of difficulties , " he says .
" we did n't have approval from the department of health to carry out heart transplants .
" we had tacit approval from the local health authority , which agreed to fund two operations .
there was a lot of pressure on us to succeed . "
the first patient died before he could have the transplant .
however , subsequent attempts proved more successful .
" we were very relieved , " says the now-retired surgeon .
over 1,000 people have since gone on to have a heart transplant at papworth .
sir terrence and his colleagues went on to achieve even greater things .
in 1984 , they carried out europe 's first successful heart-lung transplant .
the following year , they performed the world 's first heart , lung and liver transplant .
ten years ago , they carried out the world 's first operation to give a man a " bionic " heart - a battery-operated heart known as a ventricular assist device .
world first the first heart transplant was carried out by christian barnard in south africa in 1967 .
he transplanted the heart of a road accident victim into a 59 year-old-man , called louis washkansky , in cape town 's groote schuur hospital .
we did not think it was a great event christian barnard after carrying out the world 's first heart transplant in 1967 mr washkansky died 18 days later after contracting pneumonia .
the powerful drugs he was taking to stop his body from rejecting the heart had reduced his ability to fight off the infection .
nevertheless , the operation marked a milestone in medicine - even if mr barnard did not see it that way .
speaking after the operation , he played down the importance of what he had just done .
" we did not think it was a great event and there was no special feeling .
i was happy when i saw the heart beating again .
" we did not stand up or cheer or something like that .
i did n't even inform the hospital authorities that i was going to do the operation . "
however , others did see it as a great event .
today , thousands of people have heart transplants every year .
to date , there have been 4,792 heart transplants in the uk .
the operation has helped many to live full and healthy lives .
" the heart transplant really was an enormous technological advance , " says professor jeremy pearson , associate medical director of the british heart foundation .

bbc news online 's duncan walker is in portugal and tom geoghegan is in london to gauge supporters ' reaction , and correspondents from across the bbc are logging their thoughts from the match .
duncan walker : : the strip , albufeira : : 1935 the atmosphere in coimbra and albufeira is loud and happy less than half an hour after the football finished , the streets that had been so full of fans quickly emptied as they went off to watch the france game or find a drink elsewhere .
some people decided to have an early night though , just in case there was trouble .
jan arnold , from milton keynes , said : " we hope it stays as happy and light-hearted as it is .
we 're going off now because my grandson , who 's nine is with us . "
police are still here , and mounted police have arrived but the atmosphere is a happy , calm one .
glen from essex , said : " everyone has had a couple of drinks and i can see it 's necessary for them to be here . "
james pearce : : coimbra : : 1930 it has been an incredible and friendly atmosphere here with english , swiss and portuguese fans mixing together and watching the match on the big screen .
i saw two friends having a slightly drunken argument and that 's all , out of thousands of people who have been here all day .
of course the english fans are happier , but the reality is tournament organisers uefa could n't have asked for better scenes than we are seeing right now .
gaetan portal : : coimbra : : 1920 the relief and jubilation followed a tense first half there 's a big happy crowd of around 2,500 at the big screen in coimbra .
the band is on stage and everyone is celebrating the result , singing along to three lions , vindaloo and the theme from the great escape .
towards the end of the second half , seven vans carrying riot police with shields arrived .
but there is no tension at the moment .
it is very boisterous and beery , but there is no trouble , it is a very happy atmosphere .
tom geoghegan : : trafalgar square : : 1915 the beautiful game meets ballet in trafalgar square the car horns started dead on full-time and this was the signal to party .
trafalgar square is traditionally the spot where london celebrates football triumphs but hundreds of opera and ballet fans were having none of this .
they sat patiently in front of the big screen , one hour before the start of tchaikovsky 's onegin .
a dozen delirious england fans , fresh from the pubs , tried in vain to lift the atmosphere with a rendition of " in-ger-land " as they danced by the fountains .
more and more bemused football fans arrived , to underline the clash of cultures .
steve elliott , 34 , said : " we 're going to wait for friends and maybe we 'll crash the opera . "

hundreds joined in the singing and dancing at the start of a night of partying .
the main street is so crowded with fans police have sealed it to traffic , and officers in body armour have moved into the area to keep an eye on the celebrations .
tom geoghegan : : holborn : : 1750 there were more suits than football shirts at the pitcher and piano pub although the national anthem was greeted with unrestrained roars .
more suits than shirts in city bars early pressure from switzerland frayed the nerves , compounded by the fact some could n't see the screen .
rooney 's goal made the bar erupt and the half-time round of drinks all the more enjoyable .
barrister sandeep parma , 27 , thinks england can now go all the way to the final : " it was a bright start bearing in mind the pressure they 're under . "
duncan walker : : paradise bar , albufeira : : 1755 in the rush for the bar at half-time , fans are happy but nervous .
" we do n't really look on top of it , we 're a bit nervous and we 're just not solid enough , " says kyle perry , from wolverhampton .
others agreed .
" england always under perform and you never really know what 's going to happen , " says stephen smith , from cambridge .
many supporters were using the break to move on and investigate other bars .
others reached for their mobile phones to swap thoughts on england 's performance with friends back home .
duncan walker : : estrela ozul bar , albufeira : : 1725 as england go one ahead in the 22nd minute , shouts of " rooney , rooney " fill the bars .

" we have had a few nervous moments but this should sort things out .
this game is ours now , " said one fan .
duncan walker : : ancora bar , albufeira : : 1700 every bar in the centre of albufeira is now packed with england fans jostling for the best view of the tvs and big screens .
it seems as if everyone is anticipating victory .
" it will be at least three goals for england but the swiss may pull one back .
they have to win .
the alternative does n't bear thinking about , " says chris moxy from manchester .
police are keeping a very low profile .
two officers who are nearby , however , say everyone seems happy at the moment , they 're just singing and having a good time .
" there was no trouble last night and we hope it stays that way , " says one .
tom geoghegan : : covent garden : : 1645 sonny cook , two , is quietly confident fans gathering at the cross keys pub are in very confident mood as the kick-off is only minutes away .
two-year-old sonny cook , an arsenal fan , shows no trace of nerves as he yells " sking-land " .
roger button , 43 , is also optimistic : " i think three-nil because the french result could boost them and they will be really up for it . "
james pearce : : coimbra : : 1625 cheering , shouting , dancing , singing - you name it , it is all happening at the temporary supporters ' pitch .
swiss fans will need to be loud to be heard swiss fans are here as well .
" it 's going to be tough but we 're confident , " one says .
asked if they would be heard above the chanting england supporters , his friend adds : " i doubt that , but we 'll be behind our team and we 'll do the best we can . "

they have no ticket but he is optimistic about england 's chances .
" king david is going to win the cup , " he says .
duncan walker : : the strip , albufeira : : 1610 at cafe del mar , a singalong involving large numbers of england fans is well under way , the atmosphere full of anticipation .
in full song at the cafe del mar " it 's brilliant .
there 's thousands of us here and in town every bar will be full of fans .
it 's just like being in england but boiling hot , " says scott willoughby , from sheffield .
his friend lee osborne has just paid four euros for a pint of beer , more than he would back home , but he says it 's worth it as some bars are charging england fans 10 euros to get in .
duncan walker : : the strip , albufeira : : 1545 large numbers of lads in england colours , many with the flag of st george wrapped around their shoulders , are starting to gather in the bars to bag a good seat in time for the match .
the first chants of " england , england " can be heard .
residents of albufeira are hoping things will be calm whichever way the result goes .
" we think they 're a bit crazy and they drink too much but we know it 's not all english people that cause the trouble , " said pedro vorgues , 14 .
tom geoghegan : : uptown records , soho : : 1530 the party has already started in london with less than two hours to go , the tension is mounting and more football-clad fans are on the streets .
dj woody , 29 , is still working in uptown records but plans to knock off to watch the game in trap nightclub nearby .
asked his opinion on the england football anthem all together now , remixed by dj spoony , he said : " vindaloo and world in motion were the best football songs ever . "
one of his customers is less kind : " it 's terrible and he should stick to house and garage , " he says .
" it 's like pavarotti doing reggae . "
duncan walker : : albufeira court : : 1510 it is a relatively quiet day at albufeira 's court .
after a marathon 12-hour sitting on wednesday , to decide the fate of 12 english fans accused of disorder , it took just a few hours to deal with 33 on thursday .
all were given the option to go home and not return to portugal within one year .
they must leave statements of their version of events and could face trial at a later date , which they need not attend .
the large number of people present meant the court was closed to all but two members of the press .
some friends and family were also there , trying to find out what happened to those arrested .
tom geoghegan : : soho square : : 1445 for fans finding the stress all a bit too much , soho square is a popular choice to settle pre-match nerves .
an art exhibition takes visitors ' minds off the diamond formation and a statue of charles ii gives an injection of patriotism , as people lie down , read , or in one case , get a massage .
soho square is an oasis of calm for anxious fans trisha white , 34 , a manchester united supporter and gym manager says : " this park is very quiet today and i think people are working through lunch so they can see the football .
" i 'm leaving work early to go home and watch it . "
james pearce : : coimbra : : 1430 soccer fans are making the most of an astroturf football pitch provided by the authorities in coimbra 's " fanzone " while they wait for the match .
the english contingent , stripped to the waist in the blistering heat , confidently predict their own victory over the swiss followers on the astroturf .
england fans are ready in coimbra two fans dressed as david james seem equally sure sven 's boys will win later in a " hard-fought " game .
only 24,000 england fans have tickets for the stadium , compared to 40,000 for the encounter with france , so many thousands are preparing to watch on a giant screen .
the mood is one of excitement , with no signs of misbehaviour so far .
duncan walker : : reef sports bar : : 1420 the fact it is several hundred miles from the algarve to coimbra has persuaded many england fans to stay put .
" i travelled up to lisbon for the france game but i had tickets for that , " says martin potter , a 29-year-old sales rep from orpington , kent .
fans are red and white both on and off the beach " the switzerland match is further away and it 's just not worth going only to see things on a big screen .
i can do that here and the weather 's better . "
others simply want to be in the euro 2004 host country to soak up the atmosphere .
" we flew into faro this morning and only decided to come over last week .
it 's just a cheap weekend , it cost us £ 140 . "
tom geoghegan : : china town : : 1410 chinatown appears to be a football-free zone until , at the end of gerrard street , a young england fan walks past wearing a shirt bearing the same name .
kim vaccari , 20 , also has his face painted red and white and is draped in a st george 's flag .
the loss to france was a confidence blow for some the gap-year student , who lives in earls court , is searching for a venue to watch the match .
" i 'm feeling excited , a bit anxious , but most of all just looking forward to it .
the france game was agony and i hope there 's no more pain today , " he says .
tom geoghegan : : leicester square : : 1345 london 's swiss are optimistic not forgetting there are two sides in the big game , the swiss centre in leicester square was the next stop .
on the tenth floor , switzerland tourism was busy preparing for the match which swiss dignitaries will watch with british travel journalists in an attempt to promote the country .
deputy director roland minder , 50 , said : " we are all very excited because we 're going to win .
i have heard the british media taking the mickey out of the swiss but having lived here for 23 years i 've got the british sense of humour so i quite like it " for my son it 's more difficult but i think he will support england and my english wife is so annoyed with the british hooligans she wants switzerland to win . "
duncan walker : : praia da oura : : 1315 down on the beach the england fans are easy to spot , with their football towels , replica strips and more than a few bright red backs .
while some people are enjoying paragliding above the water , jet-skiing or playing football , most are simply lying out in the sun .
in pictures : england fans many have picked up the latest british newspapers and are concerned at how the violence of monday and tuesday is being reported back home .
" i think it has been glorified , " says paul boswell , 20 , from stockport .
" saying 400 people were involved is not right , there were 20 or 30 who were being violent . "
paul and friend david evans , 21 , are not looking forward to the game though .
" we 've messed up our flights and are leaving at exactly the same time as the game , " says david .
tom geoghegan : : piccadilly : : 1300 a very patriotic looking lillywhites is getting right behind the england team .
the sports department store is awash with flags and the england shirts are selling faster than the german toilet rolls .
trade is expected to pick up if england win john noon , 32 , and deborah morrey , 36 , both from manchester , have braved the rush and bought a shirt and two pairs of tracksuit trousers before they head off to watch the game .
" two or three-nil to england , " said john .
lillywhites staff hope he is right because they say custom will pick up if england win .
tom geoghegan : : sports cafe , haymarket : : 1215 the three fans were first to the bar five hours before kick-off and the cafe has opened its doors .
three die-hard england fans - with american accents - are first inside .
the three students missed out on getting in when england played brazil in the world cup so wanted to make sure this time .
nate kinet , 18 , originally from chicago , said : " my friends think i 'm crazy to like soccer and i hated it before i came here in 2000 . "
all three predict a comfortable england win .
manager jane white predicts a full house of 600 customers who will drink enough pints " to fill an olympic-sized pool " .
duncan walker : : albufeira : : 1200 it is already approaching 30 degrees in southern portugal and many england fans are making a beeline for albufeira 's wide sandy beaches .

bbc news online 's duncan walker is in portugal and tom geoghegan is in london to gauge supporters ' reaction , and correspondents from across the bbc are logging their thoughts from the match .
duncan walker : : the strip , albufeira : : 1935 the atmosphere in coimbra and albufeira is loud and happy less than half an hour after the football finished , the streets that had been so full of fans quickly emptied as they went off to watch the france game or find a drink elsewhere .
some people decided to have an early night though , just in case there was trouble .
jan arnold , from milton keynes , said : " we hope it stays as happy and light-hearted as it is .
we 're going off now because my grandson , who 's nine is with us . "
police are still here , and mounted police have arrived but the atmosphere is a happy , calm one .
glen from essex , said : " everyone has had a couple of drinks and i can see it 's necessary for them to be here . "
james pearce : : coimbra : : 1930 it has been an incredible and friendly atmosphere here with english , swiss and portuguese fans mixing together and watching the match on the big screen .
i saw two friends having a slightly drunken argument and that 's all , out of thousands of people who have been here all day .
of course the english fans are happier , but the reality is tournament organisers uefa could n't have asked for better scenes than we are seeing right now .
gaetan portal : : coimbra : : 1920 the relief and jubilation followed a tense first half there 's a big happy crowd of around 2,500 at the big screen in coimbra .
the band is on stage and everyone is celebrating the result , singing along to three lions , vindaloo and the theme from the great escape .
towards the end of the second half , seven vans carrying riot police with shields arrived .
but there is no tension at the moment .
it is very boisterous and beery , but there is no trouble , it is a very happy atmosphere .
tom geoghegan : : trafalgar square : : 1915 the beautiful game meets ballet in trafalgar square the car horns started dead on full-time and this was the signal to party .
trafalgar square is traditionally the spot where london celebrates football triumphs but hundreds of opera and ballet fans were having none of this .
they sat patiently in front of the big screen , one hour before the start of tchaikovsky 's onegin .
a dozen delirious england fans , fresh from the pubs , tried in vain to lift the atmosphere with a rendition of " in-ger-land " as they danced by the fountains .
more and more bemused football fans arrived , to underline the clash of cultures .
steve elliott , 34 , said : " we 're going to wait for friends and maybe we 'll crash the opera . "
reflecting on the match , he said : " england are going to go all the way to the final where they will get revenge on the french . "
duncan walker : : paradise bar , albufeira : : 1900 back at cafe del mar , celebrating england fans conga-ed past albufeira 's bars and restaurants following the team 's comfortable victory .
roaring in celebration these supporters had not been able to make the trip up to coimbra but that did not stop them enjoying the result .
hundreds joined in the singing and dancing at the start of a night of partying .
the main street is so crowded with fans police have sealed it to traffic , and officers in body armour have moved into the area to keep an eye on the celebrations .
tom geoghegan : : holborn : : 1750 there were more suits than football shirts at the pitcher and piano pub although the national anthem was greeted with unrestrained roars .
more suits than shirts in city bars early pressure from switzerland frayed the nerves , compounded by the fact some could n't see the screen .
rooney 's goal made the bar erupt and the half-time round of drinks all the more enjoyable .
barrister sandeep parma , 27 , thinks england can now go all the way to the final : " it was a bright start bearing in mind the pressure they 're under . "
duncan walker : : paradise bar , albufeira : : 1755 in the rush for the bar at half-time , fans are happy but nervous .
" we do n't really look on top of it , we 're a bit nervous and we 're just not solid enough , " says kyle perry , from wolverhampton .
others agreed .
" england always under perform and you never really know what 's going to happen , " says stephen smith , from cambridge .
many supporters were using the break to move on and investigate other bars .
others reached for their mobile phones to swap thoughts on england 's performance with friends back home .
duncan walker : : estrela ozul bar , albufeira : : 1725 as england go one ahead in the 22nd minute , shouts of " rooney , rooney " fill the bars .
the goal was exactly what everybody wanted to see .
" we have had a few nervous moments but this should sort things out .
this game is ours now , " said one fan .
duncan walker : : ancora bar , albufeira : : 1700 every bar in the centre of albufeira is now packed with england fans jostling for the best view of the tvs and big screens .
it seems as if everyone is anticipating victory .
" it will be at least three goals for england but the swiss may pull one back .
they have to win .
the alternative does n't bear thinking about , " says chris moxy from manchester .
police are keeping a very low profile .
two officers who are nearby , however , say everyone seems happy at the moment , they 're just singing and having a good time .
" there was no trouble last night and we hope it stays that way , " says one .
tom geoghegan : : covent garden : : 1645 sonny cook , two , is quietly confident fans gathering at the cross keys pub are in very confident mood as the kick-off is only minutes away .
two-year-old sonny cook , an arsenal fan , shows no trace of nerves as he yells " sking-land " .
roger button , 43 , is also optimistic : " i think three-nil because the french result could boost them and they will be really up for it . "
james pearce : : coimbra : : 1625 cheering , shouting , dancing , singing - you name it , it is all happening at the temporary supporters ' pitch .
swiss fans will need to be loud to be heard swiss fans are here as well .
" it 's going to be tough but we 're confident , " one says .
asked if they would be heard above the chanting england supporters , his friend adds : " i doubt that , but we 'll be behind our team and we 'll do the best we can . "
an australian father has travelled with his son from sydney .
they have no ticket but he is optimistic about england 's chances .
" king david is going to win the cup , " he says .
duncan walker : : the strip , albufeira : : 1610 at cafe del mar , a singalong involving large numbers of england fans is well under way , the atmosphere full of anticipation .
in full song at the cafe del mar " it 's brilliant .
there 's thousands of us here and in town every bar will be full of fans .
it 's just like being in england but boiling hot , " says scott willoughby , from sheffield .
his friend lee osborne has just paid four euros for a pint of beer , more than he would back home , but he says it 's worth it as some bars are charging england fans 10 euros to get in .
duncan walker : : the strip , albufeira : : 1545 large numbers of lads in england colours , many with the flag of st george wrapped around their shoulders , are starting to gather in the bars to bag a good seat in time for the match .
the first chants of " england , england " can be heard .
residents of albufeira are hoping things will be calm whichever way the result goes .
" we think they 're a bit crazy and they drink too much but we know it 's not all english people that cause the trouble , " said pedro vorgues , 14 .
tom geoghegan : : uptown records , soho : : 1530 the party has already started in london with less than two hours to go , the tension is mounting and more football-clad fans are on the streets .
dj woody , 29 , is still working in uptown records but plans to knock off to watch the game in trap nightclub nearby .
asked his opinion on the england football anthem all together now , remixed by dj spoony , he said : " vindaloo and world in motion were the best football songs ever . "
one of his customers is less kind : " it 's terrible and he should stick to house and garage , " he says .
" it 's like pavarotti doing reggae . "
duncan walker : : albufeira court : : 1510 it is a relatively quiet day at albufeira 's court .
after a marathon 12-hour sitting on wednesday , to decide the fate of 12 english fans accused of disorder , it took just a few hours to deal with 33 on thursday .
all were given the option to go home and not return to portugal within one year .
they must leave statements of their version of events and could face trial at a later date , which they need not attend .
the large number of people present meant the court was closed to all but two members of the press .
some friends and family were also there , trying to find out what happened to those arrested .
tom geoghegan : : soho square : : 1445 for fans finding the stress all a bit too much , soho square is a popular choice to settle pre-match nerves .
an art exhibition takes visitors ' minds off the diamond formation and a statue of charles ii gives an injection of patriotism , as people lie down , read , or in one case , get a massage .
soho square is an oasis of calm for anxious fans trisha white , 34 , a manchester united supporter and gym manager says : " this park is very quiet today and i think people are working through lunch so they can see the football .
" i 'm leaving work early to go home and watch it . "
james pearce : : coimbra : : 1430 soccer fans are making the most of an astroturf football pitch provided by the authorities in coimbra 's " fanzone " while they wait for the match .
the english contingent , stripped to the waist in the blistering heat , confidently predict their own victory over the swiss followers on the astroturf .
england fans are ready in coimbra two fans dressed as david james seem equally sure sven 's boys will win later in a " hard-fought " game .
only 24,000 england fans have tickets for the stadium , compared to 40,000 for the encounter with france , so many thousands are preparing to watch on a giant screen .
the mood is one of excitement , with no signs of misbehaviour so far .
duncan walker : : reef sports bar : : 1420 the fact it is several hundred miles from the algarve to coimbra has persuaded many england fans to stay put .
" i travelled up to lisbon for the france game but i had tickets for that , " says martin potter , a 29-year-old sales rep from orpington , kent .
fans are red and white both on and off the beach " the switzerland match is further away and it 's just not worth going only to see things on a big screen .
i can do that here and the weather 's better . "
others simply want to be in the euro 2004 host country to soak up the atmosphere .
" we flew into faro this morning and only decided to come over last week .
it 's just a cheap weekend , it cost us £ 140 . "
tom geoghegan : : china town : : 1410 chinatown appears to be a football-free zone until , at the end of gerrard street , a young england fan walks past wearing a shirt bearing the same name .
kim vaccari , 20 , also has his face painted red and white and is draped in a st george 's flag .
the loss to france was a confidence blow for some the gap-year student , who lives in earls court , is searching for a venue to watch the match .
" i 'm feeling excited , a bit anxious , but most of all just looking forward to it .
the france game was agony and i hope there 's no more pain today , " he says .
tom geoghegan : : leicester square : : 1345 london 's swiss are optimistic not forgetting there are two sides in the big game , the swiss centre in leicester square was the next stop .
on the tenth floor , switzerland tourism was busy preparing for the match which swiss dignitaries will watch with british travel journalists in an attempt to promote the country .
deputy director roland minder , 50 , said : " we are all very excited because we 're going to win .
i have heard the british media taking the mickey out of the swiss but having lived here for 23 years i 've got the british sense of humour so i quite like it " for my son it 's more difficult but i think he will support england and my english wife is so annoyed with the british hooligans she wants switzerland to win . "
duncan walker : : praia da oura : : 1315 down on the beach the england fans are easy to spot , with their football towels , replica strips and more than a few bright red backs .
while some people are enjoying paragliding above the water , jet-skiing or playing football , most are simply lying out in the sun .
in pictures : england fans many have picked up the latest british newspapers and are concerned at how the violence of monday and tuesday is being reported back home .
" i think it has been glorified , " says paul boswell , 20 , from stockport .
" saying 400 people were involved is not right , there were 20 or 30 who were being violent . "
paul and friend david evans , 21 , are not looking forward to the game though .
" we 've messed up our flights and are leaving at exactly the same time as the game , " says david .
tom geoghegan : : piccadilly : : 1300 a very patriotic looking lillywhites is getting right behind the england team .
the sports department store is awash with flags and the england shirts are selling faster than the german toilet rolls .
trade is expected to pick up if england win john noon , 32 , and deborah morrey , 36 , both from manchester , have braved the rush and bought a shirt and two pairs of tracksuit trousers before they head off to watch the game .
" two or three-nil to england , " said john .
lillywhites staff hope he is right because they say custom will pick up if england win .
tom geoghegan : : sports cafe , haymarket : : 1215 the three fans were first to the bar five hours before kick-off and the cafe has opened its doors .
three die-hard england fans - with american accents - are first inside .
the three students missed out on getting in when england played brazil in the world cup so wanted to make sure this time .
nate kinet , 18 , originally from chicago , said : " my friends think i 'm crazy to like soccer and i hated it before i came here in 2000 . "
all three predict a comfortable england win .
manager jane white predicts a full house of 600 customers who will drink enough pints " to fill an olympic-sized pool " .
duncan walker : : albufeira : : 1200 it is already approaching 30 degrees in southern portugal and many england fans are making a beeline for albufeira 's wide sandy beaches .
others are enjoying a late traditional fry-up and looking forward to the game .
the town , which had a trouble-free night after violence in the early hours of tuesday and wednesday , is relatively quiet as many people have travelled for several hundred miles for the match in coimbra .
families with young children and small groups of lads are among the many happy holidaymakers .
none seem at all concerned that england will do anything but beat the swiss .
" i think they 're going to be angry after losing to france and it will be three-nil , " says 13-year-old ryan atkins from devon .

the rspca was called on wednesday when visiting health and safety inspectors heard the cat mewing .
it is not clear how long the cat had been trapped , but the animal charity says he is quite thin and dehydrated .
charles gilby , from the health and safety executive , said the concrete floor was laid two months ago . "
he 's probably used up more than one of his nine lives " felicity cross , rspca officer inspectors from the executive have been carrying out construction site visits across the county in a bid to reduce the number of fatal and serious injuries in the industry .
it was on one of these routine visits that two inspectors heard the cat .
mr gilby said at first they could not place where the noise was coming from .
he said : " this floor had been down for two months , but they managed to break open the floor and a black cat came out .
" it was certainly the worse for wear , but not actually harmed . "
animal collection officer felicity cross believed the cat , which is about 10-years-old , had tried to get out .
she said : " his claws are really scuffed and broken , which suggests he 's been scrabbling around trying to find a way out .
" generally , he 's very subdued .
but i 've been down to the site in pentire avenue and , if he 's been there for a while , he 's probably used up more than one of his nine lives . "
ms cross said although the cat was probably local , it was possible it came to the site in one of the building construction vans .

it is not clear how long the cat had been trapped , but the animal charity says he is quite thin and dehydrated .
charles gilby , from the health and safety executive , said the concrete floor was laid two months ago .
he 's probably used up more than one of his nine lives felicity cross , rspca officer inspectors from the executive have been carrying out construction site visits across the county in a bid to reduce the number of fatal and serious injuries in the industry .
it was on one of these routine visits that two inspectors heard the cat .
mr gilby said at first they could not place where the noise was coming from .
he said : " this floor had been down for two months , but they managed to break open the floor and a black cat came out .
" it was certainly the worse for wear , but not actually harmed . "
animal collection officer felicity cross believed the cat , which is about 10-years-old , had tried to get out .
she said : " his claws are really scuffed and broken , which suggests he 's been scrabbling around trying to find a way out .
" generally , he 's very subdued .
but i 've been down to the site in pentire avenue and , if he 's been there for a while , he 's probably used up more than one of his nine lives . "
ms cross said although the cat was probably local , it was possible it came to the site in one of the building construction vans .

mr goodway , who resigned after labour lost control of the capital in last week 's elections , said he wanted to continue performing public service .
the best-known councillor in wales also renewed his attack on first minister rhodri morgan .
he accused " king rhodri " of refusing to allow dissent in welsh labour .
i consider my faith as being the one commodity which has enabled me to deal with all the pressures that have come my way russell goodway mr goodway led first south glamorgan and then cardiff councils for 12 years before stepping down as leader of the labour group when the liberal democrats became the city 's biggest party .
his term in office was marked by controversy over such issues as allowances which saw him become the highest-paid councillor in the country .
now , aged 47 , he says he may revive his earlier ambitions of becoming a clergyman .
the st michael 's training college in cardiff went on sale in march he had hoped to enter the church in wales training college in cardiff in the early 1980s .
" i 'm serious about looking at it , " mr goodway told the bbc wales news website .
" i was very serious -lrb- in the 1980s -rrb- and i was told then that i would have to wait to get into st michael 's college in llandaff before there was a place , in between which i was elected .
" i do n't know if i 'm qualified for it , i really do n't know now .
it 's something i 'll have to sit down and talk to the church authorities about .
highly critical " i 'd prefer to find something in public service .
i enjoy public service and i think there 's a lot of merit in it " .
mr goodway , an accountant who is married with a teenage son , said throughout his time as council leader he had prepared for the day he would lose power .
" i consider my faith as being the one commodity which has enabled me to deal with all the pressures that have come my way . "
he remains a councillor , but declines to say whether he would stand again .
if he does join the clergy , there is a precedent in his own ward : the rev bob morgan - father of labour euro-mp eluned morgan - also used to lead south glamorgan council while an ely councillor .
but mr goodway said his future in politics may depend on his troubled relationship with first minister rhodri morgan , whom he accused last week of wanting him to lose his seat .
mr morgan has denied that claim .
andrew davies , his economic development minister in the welsh assembly government , has in turn described it as an " outrageous " accusation from a politician " thrashing around and pointing the finger of blame at somebody else " .
mr goodway said : " if rhodri morgan fell under the proverbial bus and politics became more open , then opportunities for people like me in the labour party may once again be available , " he said .
" but there is no room for dissent at the court of king rhodri .
" but rhodri could be gone within a year .
what is clear is that the party both in and out of the assembly is starting to talk about life after rhodri , and then the party will take on a completely new approach . "

mr goodway , who resigned after labour lost control of the capital in last week 's elections , said he wanted to continue performing public service .
the best-known councillor in wales also renewed his attack on first minister rhodri morgan .
he accused " king rhodri " of refusing to allow dissent in welsh labour .
i consider my faith as being the one commodity which has enabled me to deal with all the pressures that have come my way russell goodway mr goodway led first south glamorgan and then cardiff councils for 12 years before stepping down as leader of the labour group when the liberal democrats became the city 's biggest party .
his term in office was marked by controversy over such issues as allowances which saw him become the highest-paid councillor in the country .
now , aged 47 , he says he may revive his earlier ambitions of becoming a clergyman .
the st michael 's training college in cardiff went on sale in march he had hoped to enter the church in wales training college in cardiff in the early 1980s .
" i 'm serious about looking at it , " mr goodway told the bbc wales news website .
" i was very serious -lrb- in the 1980s -rrb- and i was told then that i would have to wait to get into st michael 's college in llandaff before there was a place , in between which i was elected .
" i do n't know if i 'm qualified for it , i really do n't know now .
it 's something i 'll have to sit down and talk to the church authorities about .
highly critical " i 'd prefer to find something in public service .
i enjoy public service and i think there 's a lot of merit in it " .
mr goodway , an accountant who is married with a teenage son , said throughout his time as council leader he had prepared for the day he would lose power .
" i consider my faith as being the one commodity which has enabled me to deal with all the pressures that have come my way . "
he remains a councillor , but declines to say whether he would stand again .
if he does join the clergy , there is a precedent in his own ward : the rev bob morgan - father of labour euro-mp eluned morgan - also used to lead south glamorgan council while an ely councillor .
but mr goodway said his future in politics may depend on his troubled relationship with first minister rhodri morgan , whom he accused last week of wanting him to lose his seat .
mr morgan has denied that claim .
andrew davies , his economic development minister in the welsh assembly government , has in turn described it as an " outrageous " accusation from a politician " thrashing around and pointing the finger of blame at somebody else " .
mr goodway said : " if rhodri morgan fell under the proverbial bus and politics became more open , then opportunities for people like me in the labour party may once again be available , " he said .
" but there is no room for dissent at the court of king rhodri .
" but rhodri could be gone within a year .
what is clear is that the party both in and out of the assembly is starting to talk about life after rhodri , and then the party will take on a completely new approach . "
