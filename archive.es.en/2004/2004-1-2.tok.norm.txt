following an invitation from paris , chancellor schröder will become the first german leader to attend the 60th anniversary of the allied landings in normandy .
the move signals growing ties between paris and berlin . marking a historic turn of events , german chancellor gerhard schröder has accepted an invitation to attend a commemoration ceremony on the anniversary of the landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 .
sixty years after american , british and canadian soldiers set foot on the french beaches and began their campaign to liberate europe from nazi forces , schröder will become the first german leader to participate in the celebrations .
a spokesman for the german government confirmed to journalists on thursday that the chancellor had indeed accepted an invitation from paris to attend the ceremony in france .
" mr. chirac invited the chancellor before christmas , " he said .
" he ’ s -lrb- schröder -rrb- very pleased to have been invited . "
the french government also confirmed the invitation .
a spokeswoman said all invitations had already been sent out .
the guests include representatives from around 15 nations , who attended key 50th anniversary celebrations in 1994 and those countries who contributed troops to the d-day landings .
message of reconciliation schröder ’ s attendance at the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings is expected to drive home a potent message of reconciliation between the two nations , one that has been made clearer in the past year as france and germany teamed up to oppose the u.s.-led war in iraq .
the inclusion of schröder in this year ’ s list is especially noteworthy after his predecessor helmut kohl was pointedly left out of the high-profile invitation list for the 50th anniversary .
at the time ties between the two neighbors were at a low and french president francois mitterand responded to the offended kohl by taking him to a franco-german youth festival and invited german soldiers to participate in france ’ s bastille day parade along the champs elysees in paris .
growing franco-german ties apart from the historic symbolism surrounding the anniversary , the event in june is a reaffirmation of strengthening ties between paris and berlin in the last year .
after enduring several spats - among others over president chirac ’ s support for conservative bavarian leader edmund stoiber in the german general election of 2002 - the franco-german motor roared back into life last year .
in addition to their shared position on the iraq war and reconstruction efforts , the friendship was boosted by frequent franco-german summits , where the two sides agreed to a raft of joint initiatives including regular joint cabinet meetings .
in recent months , the two european heavyweights have also begun cooperating closely on eu affairs .
not only are they the two biggest economies in europe , but they back each other up when it comes to violating the euro zone ’ s stability pact .
they also align themselves closely on the issue of the eu constitution , which failed to be signed due to a controversy over voting methods , and have jointly called for more investment in europe ’ s infrastructure .
in fact , the two neighbors reputedly work so well together that it was no problem for chirac , in a historic first for the european union , to represent the german leader at an eu summit in october , when schröder was forced to stay in berlin for an important vote on social reforms .
to smaller eu members , those who see europe ’ s future endangered by the dominance of france and germany and at the same time foresee a " two-speed europe " falling back on its founding members , the berlin-paris axis is not necessarily an entirely welcome turning-around of history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution summit fails eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.01.2004 german companies profit from nafta großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw plans to invest billions in mexico over the next five years .
ten years ago , the north american free trade agreement -lrb- nafta -rrb- created the world ’ s largest free trade area .
officials for german companies based in mexico say their business has benefited as a result . mexico was a relatively closed market until it joined the u.s. and canada under the auspices of nafta a decade ago .
but things have changed dramatically since then , with mexican exports more than tripling to $ 160 billion -lrb- € 127 billion -rrb- . the agreement also boosted foreign investments , which quadrupled since the 1980s .
many firms built new factories in mexico to take advantage of low wages and to avoid tariffs when importing to the u.s. many german companies had operations in mexico prior to nafta , but they had mainly produced for the mexican market .
after the agreement went into effect , some expanded their production for export .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nafta countries include canada , the u.s. and mexico .
the u.s. government plans a pan-american free trade zone by 2005 . vw , siemens and others expand mexican operations volkswagen ’ s factory in puebla , for example , now exports 80 percent of its beetles and jettas , with 65 percent going across the border to the north .
the company , which already is the largest german employer in mexico , plans to invest an additional $ 2 billion -lrb- € 1.58 billion -rrb- over the next five years .
“ thanks to the various free trade agreements , mexico is an international production location today , ” reinhard jung , head of vw ’ s mexican operations , told dpa . siemens has also expanded its mexican presence over the last decade , setting up new car technology factories in aquascalientes , guadalajara , puebla , ciudad juarez and monterrey . chemical giant basf invested $ 450 million in a new production facility .
“ without nafta , this sum surely would have been smaller , ” nicholas jose ivandic , head of basf mexico , told dpa .
bayer , the german pharmaceutical company , is another investor in mexico . lack of skilled labor a problem for smaller investors lack of skilled labor has been a problem , but big companies deal with the issue by training employees themselves .
it ’ s kept most smaller german companies out of the country , according to the german-mexican chamber of commerce -lrb- camexa -rrb- .

thirteen hundred little kings and queens marched through the narrow streets of the southern german town accompanied by two live camels and horses as they recreated the visit of the three kings to baby jesus in bethlehem .
four ships then carried the children out to the middle of lake constance ’ s azure waters , where they launched the 46th annual event of the sternsinger , or " star singers . "
on friday , the traditional event will be carried out nationwide .
jan .
2 marks the day every year in germany when a half a million sternsinger roam the country ’ s streets for a good cause .
in small groups of three or four , children go from house to house singing songs and gathering donations - an engagement that has brought them considerable recognition , including this year ’ s prestigious westphalian peace prize .
the children are meant to portray casper , melchior and balthazar , the three kings who walked to bethlehem 2,000 years ago to pay homage to baby jesus .
the donations gathered by the children finance projects of the kindermissionswerk , a catholic children ’ s charity , and the association of catholic youth aid projects for young people throughout the world .
a centuries-old tradition the sternsinger custom began in germany during the 16th century , but back then children collected donations for themselves .
during the christmas holidays , they went from house to house singing songs and collecting money that they used to pay for their schooling .
today , in more prosperous times , the children pass the donations on to the needy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after world war ii , the tradition took on a new form and began in earnest as an organized event .
since then the sternsinger have gathered a total of close to € 250 million donations for the kindermissionswerk , supporting more than 25,000 charity projects .
last year alone , they collected close to € 33 million which went to some 3,000 projects around the world , including a community health center in the philippines and a kindergarten for traumatized children in the palestinian cities of ramallah and jerusalem .
each year the sternsinger select a different developing nation as their focus for donations and projects , and this year ’ s beneficiary is rwanda .
in addition , the organization donated the € 50,000 it received for the peace prize in 2003 to the youth victims of the iran earthquake .
each time the sternsinger pass a house , they leave their mark : the children always write the letters " c m b " as well as the year in chalk on the doors of homes where they receive donations .
to this day , even theologians dispute the letters ’ meaning .
some believe it means " christus mansionem benedicat , " or " jesus blesses this house . "
others believe it ’ s just the initials of the three kings : caspar , melchior and balthazar . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

following an invitation from paris , chancellor schröder will become the first german leader to attend the 60th anniversary of the allied landings in normandy .
the move signals growing ties between paris and berlin . marking a historic turn of events , german chancellor gerhard schröder has accepted an invitation to attend a commemoration ceremony on the anniversary of the landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 .
sixty years after american , british and canadian soldiers set foot on the french beaches and began their campaign to liberate europe from nazi forces , schröder will become the first german leader to participate in the celebrations .
a spokesman for the german government confirmed to journalists on thursday that the chancellor had indeed accepted an invitation from paris to attend the ceremony in france .
" mr. chirac invited the chancellor before christmas , " he said .
" he ’ s -lrb- schröder -rrb- very pleased to have been invited . "
the french government also confirmed the invitation .
a spokeswoman said all invitations had already been sent out .
the guests include representatives from around 15 nations , who attended key 50th anniversary celebrations in 1994 and those countries who contributed troops to the d-day landings .
message of reconciliation schröder ’ s attendance at the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings is expected to drive home a potent message of reconciliation between the two nations , one that has been made clearer in the past year as france and germany teamed up to oppose the u.s.-led war in iraq .
the inclusion of schröder in this year ’ s list is especially noteworthy after his predecessor helmut kohl was pointedly left out of the high-profile invitation list for the 50th anniversary .
at the time ties between the two neighbors were at a low and french president francois mitterand responded to the offended kohl by taking him to a franco-german youth festival and invited german soldiers to participate in france ’ s bastille day parade along the champs elysees in paris .
growing franco-german ties apart from the historic symbolism surrounding the anniversary , the event in june is a reaffirmation of strengthening ties between paris and berlin in the last year .
after enduring several spats - among others over president chirac ’ s support for conservative bavarian leader edmund stoiber in the german general election of 2002 - the franco-german motor roared back into life last year .
in addition to their shared position on the iraq war and reconstruction efforts , the friendship was boosted by frequent franco-german summits , where the two sides agreed to a raft of joint initiatives including regular joint cabinet meetings .
in recent months , the two european heavyweights have also begun cooperating closely on eu affairs .
not only are they the two biggest economies in europe , but they back each other up when it comes to violating the euro zone ’ s stability pact .
they also align themselves closely on the issue of the eu constitution , which failed to be signed due to a controversy over voting methods , and have jointly called for more investment in europe ’ s infrastructure .
in fact , the two neighbors reputedly work so well together that it was no problem for chirac , in a historic first for the european union , to represent the german leader at an eu summit in october , when schröder was forced to stay in berlin for an important vote on social reforms .
to smaller eu members , those who see europe ’ s future endangered by the dominance of france and germany and at the same time foresee a " two-speed europe " falling back on its founding members , the berlin-paris axis is not necessarily an entirely welcome turning-around of history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution summit fails eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights .

not only are they the two biggest economies in europe , but they back each other up when it comes to violating the euro zone ’ s stability pact .
they also align themselves closely on the issue of the eu constitution , which failed to be signed due to a controversy over voting methods , and have jointly called for more investment in europe ’ s infrastructure .
in fact , the two neighbors reputedly work so well together that it was no problem for chirac , in a historic first for the european union , to represent the german leader at an eu summit in october , when schröder was forced to stay in berlin for an important vote on social reforms .
to smaller eu members , those who see europe ’ s future endangered by the dominance of france and germany and at the same time foresee a " two-speed europe " falling back on its founding members , the berlin-paris axis is not necessarily an entirely welcome turning-around of history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution summit fails eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights .

in small groups of three or four , children go from house to house singing songs and gathering donations - an engagement that has brought them considerable recognition , including this year ’ s prestigious westphalian peace prize .
the children are meant to portray casper , melchior and balthazar , the three kings who walked to bethlehem 2,000 years ago to pay homage to baby jesus .
the donations gathered by the children finance projects of the kindermissionswerk , a catholic children ’ s charity , and the association of catholic youth aid projects for young people throughout the world .

in addition , the organization donated the € 50,000 it received for the peace prize in 2003 to the youth victims of the iran earthquake .
each time the sternsinger pass a house , they leave their mark : the children always write the letters " c m b " as well as the year in chalk on the doors of homes where they receive donations .

ten years ago , the north american free trade agreement -lrb- nafta -rrb- created the world ’ s largest free trade area .
officials for german companies based in mexico say their business has benefited as a result . mexico was a relatively closed market until it joined the u.s. and canada under the auspices of nafta a decade ago .
but things have changed dramatically since then , with mexican exports more than tripling to $ 160 billion -lrb- € 127 billion -rrb- . the agreement also boosted foreign investments , which quadrupled since the 1980s .
many firms built new factories in mexico to take advantage of low wages and to avoid tariffs when importing to the u.s. many german companies had operations in mexico prior to nafta , but they had mainly produced for the mexican market .
after the agreement went into effect , some expanded their production for export .

following an invitation from paris , chancellor schröder will become the first german leader to attend the 60th anniversary of the allied landings in normandy .
the move signals growing ties between paris and berlin . marking a historic turn of events , german chancellor gerhard schröder has accepted an invitation to attend a commemoration ceremony on the anniversary of the landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 .
sixty years after american , british and canadian soldiers set foot on the french beaches and began their campaign to liberate europe from nazi forces , schröder will become the first german leader to participate in the celebrations .
a spokesman for the german government confirmed to journalists on thursday that the chancellor had indeed accepted an invitation from paris to attend the ceremony in france .
" mr. chirac invited the chancellor before christmas , " he said .
" he ’ s -lrb- schröder -rrb- very pleased to have been invited . "
the french government also confirmed the invitation .
a spokeswoman said all invitations had already been sent out .
the guests include representatives from around 15 nations , who attended key 50th anniversary celebrations in 1994 and those countries who contributed troops to the d-day landings .
message of reconciliation schröder ’ s attendance at the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings is expected to drive home a potent message of reconciliation between the two nations , one that has been made clearer in the past year as france and germany teamed up to oppose the u.s.-led war in iraq .
the inclusion of schröder in this year ’ s list is especially noteworthy after his predecessor helmut kohl was pointedly left out of the high-profile invitation list for the 50th anniversary .
at the time ties between the two neighbors were at a low and french president francois mitterand responded to the offended kohl by taking him to a franco-german youth festival and invited german soldiers to participate in france ’ s bastille day parade along the champs elysees in paris .
growing franco-german ties apart from the historic symbolism surrounding the anniversary , the event in june is a reaffirmation of strengthening ties between paris and berlin in the last year .
after enduring several spats - among others over president chirac ’ s support for conservative bavarian leader edmund stoiber in the german general election of 2002 - the franco-german motor roared back into life last year .
in addition to their shared position on the iraq war and reconstruction efforts , the friendship was boosted by frequent franco-german summits , where the two sides agreed to a raft of joint initiatives including regular joint cabinet meetings .
in recent months , the two european heavyweights have also begun cooperating closely on eu affairs .
not only are they the two biggest economies in europe , but they back each other up when it comes to violating the euro zone ’ s stability pact .
they also align themselves closely on the issue of the eu constitution , which failed to be signed due to a controversy over voting methods , and have jointly called for more investment in europe ’ s infrastructure .
in fact , the two neighbors reputedly work so well together that it was no problem for chirac , in a historic first for the european union , to represent the german leader at an eu summit in october , when schröder was forced to stay in berlin for an important vote on social reforms .
to smaller eu members , those who see europe ’ s future endangered by the dominance of france and germany and at the same time foresee a " two-speed europe " falling back on its founding members , the berlin-paris axis is not necessarily an entirely welcome turning-around of history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution summit fails eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights .

following an invitation from paris , chancellor schröder will become the first german leader to attend the 60th anniversary of the allied landings in normandy .
the move signals growing ties between paris and berlin . marking a historic turn of events , german chancellor gerhard schröder has accepted an invitation to attend a commemoration ceremony on the anniversary of the landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 .
sixty years after american , british and canadian soldiers set foot on the french beaches and began their campaign to liberate europe from nazi forces , schröder will become the first german leader to participate in the celebrations .
a spokesman for the german government confirmed to journalists on thursday that the chancellor had indeed accepted an invitation from paris to attend the ceremony in france .
" mr. chirac invited the chancellor before christmas , " he said .
" he ’ s -lrb- schröder -rrb- very pleased to have been invited . "
the french government also confirmed the invitation .
a spokeswoman said all invitations had already been sent out .
the guests include representatives from around 15 nations , who attended key 50th anniversary celebrations in 1994 and those countries who contributed troops to the d-day landings .
message of reconciliation schröder ’ s attendance at the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings is expected to drive home a potent message of reconciliation between the two nations , one that has been made clearer in the past year as france and germany teamed up to oppose the u.s.-led war in iraq .
the inclusion of schröder in this year ’ s list is especially noteworthy after his predecessor helmut kohl was pointedly left out of the high-profile invitation list for the 50th anniversary .
at the time ties between the two neighbors were at a low and french president francois mitterand responded to the offended kohl by taking him to a franco-german youth festival and invited german soldiers to participate in france ’ s bastille day parade along the champs elysees in paris .
growing franco-german ties apart from the historic symbolism surrounding the anniversary , the event in june is a reaffirmation of strengthening ties between paris and berlin in the last year .
after enduring several spats - among others over president chirac ’ s support for conservative bavarian leader edmund stoiber in the german general election of 2002 - the franco-german motor roared back into life last year .
in addition to their shared position on the iraq war and reconstruction efforts , the friendship was boosted by frequent franco-german summits , where the two sides agreed to a raft of joint initiatives including regular joint cabinet meetings .
in recent months , the two european heavyweights have also begun cooperating closely on eu affairs .
not only are they the two biggest economies in europe , but they back each other up when it comes to violating the euro zone ’ s stability pact .
they also align themselves closely on the issue of the eu constitution , which failed to be signed due to a controversy over voting methods , and have jointly called for more investment in europe ’ s infrastructure .
in fact , the two neighbors reputedly work so well together that it was no problem for chirac , in a historic first for the european union , to represent the german leader at an eu summit in october , when schröder was forced to stay in berlin for an important vote on social reforms .

thirteen hundred little kings and queens marched through the narrow streets of the southern german town accompanied by two live camels and horses as they recreated the visit of the three kings to baby jesus in bethlehem .
four ships then carried the children out to the middle of lake constance ’ s azure waters , where they launched the 46th annual event of the sternsinger , or " star singers . "
on friday , the traditional event will be carried out nationwide .
jan .
2 marks the day every year in germany when a half a million sternsinger roam the country ’ s streets for a good cause .
in small groups of three or four , children go from house to house singing songs and gathering donations - an engagement that has brought them considerable recognition , including this year ’ s prestigious westphalian peace prize .
the children are meant to portray casper , melchior and balthazar , the three kings who walked to bethlehem 2,000 years ago to pay homage to baby jesus .
the donations gathered by the children finance projects of the kindermissionswerk , a catholic children ’ s charity , and the association of catholic youth aid projects for young people throughout the world .
a centuries-old tradition the sternsinger custom began in germany during the 16th century , but back then children collected donations for themselves .
during the christmas holidays , they went from house to house singing songs and collecting money that they used to pay for their schooling .
today , in more prosperous times , the children pass the donations on to the needy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after world war ii , the tradition took on a new form and began in earnest as an organized event .
since then the sternsinger have gathered a total of close to € 250 million donations for the kindermissionswerk , supporting more than 25,000 charity projects .
last year alone , they collected close to € 33 million which went to some 3,000 projects around the world , including a community health center in the philippines and a kindergarten for traumatized children in the palestinian cities of ramallah and jerusalem .
each year the sternsinger select a different developing nation as their focus for donations and projects , and this year ’ s beneficiary is rwanda .
in addition , the organization donated the € 50,000 it received for the peace prize in 2003 to the youth victims of the iran earthquake .
each time the sternsinger pass a house , they leave their mark : the children always write the letters " c m b " as well as the year in chalk on the doors of homes where they receive donations .
to this day , even theologians dispute the letters ’ meaning .
some believe it means " christus mansionem benedicat , " or " jesus blesses this house . "
others believe it ’ s just the initials of the three kings : caspar , melchior and balthazar . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

sixty years after american , british and canadian soldiers set foot on the french beaches and began their campaign to liberate europe from nazi forces , schröder will become the first german leader to participate in the celebrations .
a spokesman for the german government confirmed to journalists on thursday that the chancellor had indeed accepted an invitation from paris to attend the ceremony in france .
" mr. chirac invited the chancellor before christmas , " he said .
" he ’ s -lrb- schröder -rrb- very pleased to have been invited . "
the french government also confirmed the invitation .
a spokeswoman said all invitations had already been sent out .
the guests include representatives from around 15 nations , who attended key 50th anniversary celebrations in 1994 and those countries who contributed troops to the d-day landings .
message of reconciliation schröder ’ s attendance at the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings is expected to drive home a potent message of reconciliation between the two nations , one that has been made clearer in the past year as france and germany teamed up to oppose the u.s.-led war in iraq .
the inclusion of schröder in this year ’ s list is especially noteworthy after his predecessor helmut kohl was pointedly left out of the high-profile invitation list for the 50th anniversary .
at the time ties between the two neighbors were at a low and french president francois mitterand responded to the offended kohl by taking him to a franco-german youth festival and invited german soldiers to participate in france ’ s bastille day parade along the champs elysees in paris .
growing franco-german ties apart from the historic symbolism surrounding the anniversary , the event in june is a reaffirmation of strengthening ties between paris and berlin in the last year .
after enduring several spats - among others over president chirac ’ s support for conservative bavarian leader edmund stoiber in the german general election of 2002 - the franco-german motor roared back into life last year .
in addition to their shared position on the iraq war and reconstruction efforts , the friendship was boosted by frequent franco-german summits , where the two sides agreed to a raft of joint initiatives including regular joint cabinet meetings .
in recent months , the two european heavyweights have also begun cooperating closely on eu affairs .
not only are they the two biggest economies in europe , but they back each other up when it comes to violating the euro zone ’ s stability pact .
they also align themselves closely on the issue of the eu constitution , which failed to be signed due to a controversy over voting methods , and have jointly called for more investment in europe ’ s infrastructure .
in fact , the two neighbors reputedly work so well together that it was no problem for chirac , in a historic first for the european union , to represent the german leader at an eu summit in october , when schröder was forced to stay in berlin for an important vote on social reforms .
to smaller eu members , those who see europe ’ s future endangered by the dominance of france and germany and at the same time foresee a " two-speed europe " falling back on its founding members , the berlin-paris axis is not necessarily an entirely welcome turning-around of history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution summit fails eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights .

following an invitation from paris , chancellor schröder will become the first german leader to attend the 60th anniversary of the allied landings in normandy .
the move signals growing ties between paris and berlin . marking a historic turn of events , german chancellor gerhard schröder has accepted an invitation to attend a commemoration ceremony on the anniversary of the landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 .
sixty years after american , british and canadian soldiers set foot on the french beaches and began their campaign to liberate europe from nazi forces , schröder will become the first german leader to participate in the celebrations .
a spokesman for the german government confirmed to journalists on thursday that the chancellor had indeed accepted an invitation from paris to attend the ceremony in france .
" mr. chirac invited the chancellor before christmas , " he said .
" he ’ s -lrb- schröder -rrb- very pleased to have been invited . "
the french government also confirmed the invitation .
a spokeswoman said all invitations had already been sent out .
the guests include representatives from around 15 nations , who attended key 50th anniversary celebrations in 1994 and those countries who contributed troops to the d-day landings .
message of reconciliation schröder ’ s attendance at the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings is expected to drive home a potent message of reconciliation between the two nations , one that has been made clearer in the past year as france and germany teamed up to oppose the u.s.-led war in iraq .
the inclusion of schröder in this year ’ s list is especially noteworthy after his predecessor helmut kohl was pointedly left out of the high-profile invitation list for the 50th anniversary .
at the time ties between the two neighbors were at a low and french president francois mitterand responded to the offended kohl by taking him to a franco-german youth festival and invited german soldiers to participate in france ’ s bastille day parade along the champs elysees in paris .
growing franco-german ties apart from the historic symbolism surrounding the anniversary , the event in june is a reaffirmation of strengthening ties between paris and berlin in the last year .
after enduring several spats - among others over president chirac ’ s support for conservative bavarian leader edmund stoiber in the german general election of 2002 - the franco-german motor roared back into life last year .
in addition to their shared position on the iraq war and reconstruction efforts , the friendship was boosted by frequent franco-german summits , where the two sides agreed to a raft of joint initiatives including regular joint cabinet meetings .
in recent months , the two european heavyweights have also begun cooperating closely on eu affairs .
not only are they the two biggest economies in europe , but they back each other up when it comes to violating the euro zone ’ s stability pact .
they also align themselves closely on the issue of the eu constitution , which failed to be signed due to a controversy over voting methods , and have jointly called for more investment in europe ’ s infrastructure .
in fact , the two neighbors reputedly work so well together that it was no problem for chirac , in a historic first for the european union , to represent the german leader at an eu summit in october , when schröder was forced to stay in berlin for an important vote on social reforms .
to smaller eu members , those who see europe ’ s future endangered by the dominance of france and germany and at the same time foresee a " two-speed europe " falling back on its founding members , the berlin-paris axis is not necessarily an entirely welcome turning-around of history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution summit fails eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights .

thirteen hundred little kings and queens marched through the narrow streets of the southern german town accompanied by two live camels and horses as they recreated the visit of the three kings to baby jesus in bethlehem .
four ships then carried the children out to the middle of lake constance ’ s azure waters , where they launched the 46th annual event of the sternsinger , or " star singers . "
on friday , the traditional event will be carried out nationwide .
jan .
2 marks the day every year in germany when a half a million sternsinger roam the country ’ s streets for a good cause .
in small groups of three or four , children go from house to house singing songs and gathering donations - an engagement that has brought them considerable recognition , including this year ’ s prestigious westphalian peace prize .
the children are meant to portray casper , melchior and balthazar , the three kings who walked to bethlehem 2,000 years ago to pay homage to baby jesus .
the donations gathered by the children finance projects of the kindermissionswerk , a catholic children ’ s charity , and the association of catholic youth aid projects for young people throughout the world .
a centuries-old tradition the sternsinger custom began in germany during the 16th century , but back then children collected donations for themselves .
during the christmas holidays , they went from house to house singing songs and collecting money that they used to pay for their schooling .
today , in more prosperous times , the children pass the donations on to the needy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after world war ii , the tradition took on a new form and began in earnest as an organized event .
since then the sternsinger have gathered a total of close to € 250 million donations for the kindermissionswerk , supporting more than 25,000 charity projects .
last year alone , they collected close to € 33 million which went to some 3,000 projects around the world , including a community health center in the philippines and a kindergarten for traumatized children in the palestinian cities of ramallah and jerusalem .
each year the sternsinger select a different developing nation as their focus for donations and projects , and this year ’ s beneficiary is rwanda .
in addition , the organization donated the € 50,000 it received for the peace prize in 2003 to the youth victims of the iran earthquake .
each time the sternsinger pass a house , they leave their mark : the children always write the letters " c m b " as well as the year in chalk on the doors of homes where they receive donations .
to this day , even theologians dispute the letters ’ meaning .
some believe it means " christus mansionem benedicat , " or " jesus blesses this house . "
others believe it ’ s just the initials of the three kings : caspar , melchior and balthazar . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

officials for german companies based in mexico say their business has benefited as a result . mexico was a relatively closed market until it joined the u.s. and canada under the auspices of nafta a decade ago .
but things have changed dramatically since then , with mexican exports more than tripling to $ 160 billion -lrb- € 127 billion -rrb- . the agreement also boosted foreign investments , which quadrupled since the 1980s .
many firms built new factories in mexico to take advantage of low wages and to avoid tariffs when importing to the u.s. many german companies had operations in mexico prior to nafta , but they had mainly produced for the mexican market .
after the agreement went into effect , some expanded their production for export .

following an invitation from paris , chancellor schröder will become the first german leader to attend the 60th anniversary of the allied landings in normandy .
the move signals growing ties between paris and berlin . marking a historic turn of events , german chancellor gerhard schröder has accepted an invitation to attend a commemoration ceremony on the anniversary of the landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 .
sixty years after american , british and canadian soldiers set foot on the french beaches and began their campaign to liberate europe from nazi forces , schröder will become the first german leader to participate in the celebrations .
a spokesman for the german government confirmed to journalists on thursday that the chancellor had indeed accepted an invitation from paris to attend the ceremony in france .
" mr. chirac invited the chancellor before christmas , " he said .
" he ’ s -lrb- schröder -rrb- very pleased to have been invited . "
the french government also confirmed the invitation .
a spokeswoman said all invitations had already been sent out .
the guests include representatives from around 15 nations , who attended key 50th anniversary celebrations in 1994 and those countries who contributed troops to the d-day landings .
message of reconciliation schröder ’ s attendance at the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings is expected to drive home a potent message of reconciliation between the two nations , one that has been made clearer in the past year as france and germany teamed up to oppose the u.s.-led war in iraq .
the inclusion of schröder in this year ’ s list is especially noteworthy after his predecessor helmut kohl was pointedly left out of the high-profile invitation list for the 50th anniversary .
at the time ties between the two neighbors were at a low and french president francois mitterand responded to the offended kohl by taking him to a franco-german youth festival and invited german soldiers to participate in france ’ s bastille day parade along the champs elysees in paris .
growing franco-german ties apart from the historic symbolism surrounding the anniversary , the event in june is a reaffirmation of strengthening ties between paris and berlin in the last year .
after enduring several spats - among others over president chirac ’ s support for conservative bavarian leader edmund stoiber in the german general election of 2002 - the franco-german motor roared back into life last year .
in addition to their shared position on the iraq war and reconstruction efforts , the friendship was boosted by frequent franco-german summits , where the two sides agreed to a raft of joint initiatives including regular joint cabinet meetings .
in recent months , the two european heavyweights have also begun cooperating closely on eu affairs .
not only are they the two biggest economies in europe , but they back each other up when it comes to violating the euro zone ’ s stability pact .
they also align themselves closely on the issue of the eu constitution , which failed to be signed due to a controversy over voting methods , and have jointly called for more investment in europe ’ s infrastructure .
in fact , the two neighbors reputedly work so well together that it was no problem for chirac , in a historic first for the european union , to represent the german leader at an eu summit in october , when schröder was forced to stay in berlin for an important vote on social reforms .
to smaller eu members , those who see europe ’ s future endangered by the dominance of france and germany and at the same time foresee a " two-speed europe " falling back on its founding members , the berlin-paris axis is not necessarily an entirely welcome turning-around of history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution summit fails eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights .

ten years ago , the north american free trade agreement -lrb- nafta -rrb- created the world ’ s largest free trade area .
officials for german companies based in mexico say their business has benefited as a result . mexico was a relatively closed market until it joined the u.s. and canada under the auspices of nafta a decade ago .
but things have changed dramatically since then , with mexican exports more than tripling to $ 160 billion -lrb- € 127 billion -rrb- . the agreement also boosted foreign investments , which quadrupled since the 1980s .
many firms built new factories in mexico to take advantage of low wages and to avoid tariffs when importing to the u.s. many german companies had operations in mexico prior to nafta , but they had mainly produced for the mexican market .
after the agreement went into effect , some expanded their production for export .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nafta countries include canada , the u.s. and mexico .
the u.s. government plans a pan-american free trade zone by 2005 . vw , siemens and others expand mexican operations volkswagen ’ s factory in puebla , for example , now exports 80 percent of its beetles and jettas , with 65 percent going across the border to the north .
the company , which already is the largest german employer in mexico , plans to invest an additional $ 2 billion -lrb- € 1.58 billion -rrb- over the next five years .
“ thanks to the various free trade agreements , mexico is an international production location today , ” reinhard jung , head of vw ’ s mexican operations , told dpa . siemens has also expanded its mexican presence over the last decade , setting up new car technology factories in aquascalientes , guadalajara , puebla , ciudad juarez and monterrey . chemical giant basf invested $ 450 million in a new production facility .
“ without nafta , this sum surely would have been smaller , ” nicholas jose ivandic , head of basf mexico , told dpa .
bayer , the german pharmaceutical company , is another investor in mexico . lack of skilled labor a problem for smaller investors lack of skilled labor has been a problem , but big companies deal with the issue by training employees themselves .
it ’ s kept most smaller german companies out of the country , according to the german-mexican chamber of commerce -lrb- camexa -rrb- .
mexico ’ s bureaucracy , crime levels and courts that usually side with the employee are other reasons to deter investors , chamber officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november , german president johannes rau , right , here with his mexican counterpart vicente fox , visited mexico with a group of businessmen to promote ties between the two countries .
despite all that , some have still set up shop in mexico .
burgmann , a company based outside of munich that makes mechanical seals , has opened production facilities in several mexican cities and now employs 113 people there . “ we decided to come to mexico to use nafta ’ s advantages , ” mario ramirez , who heads a burgmann plant in the mexican state of guerrero , told deutsche welle .
“ we ’ re able to ship products to the u.s. without paying tariffs and we have low costs .
we can produce for about 25 percent less than in a european country . ” farmers suffer ramirez added that as a mexican , he hopes his country will invest more in education .
“ cheap labor alone will eventually lead to a fiasco , ” he said .
already , mexican farmers are complaining that they can not compete with their american counterparts , who receive subsidies from their government . “ everything ’ s getting ruined in the mexican countryside , ” pedro miramontes , a farm worker , told deutsche welle .
he added that two-thirds of the people in his village have already left for the u.s. because they could no longer survive in their own country . there are also signs that other countries are beginning to trump mexico as far as cheap labor is concerned : some of the so-called maquiladoras , factories where mexican laborers assemble products , have been closed and reopened in china , for example . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's mexican dreaming chancellor gerhard schröder traveled to mexico to discuss with president vicente fox how germany and the european union can carve out a bigger slice of the prosperous mexican market .

thirteen hundred little kings and queens marched through the narrow streets of the southern german town accompanied by two live camels and horses as they recreated the visit of the three kings to baby jesus in bethlehem .
four ships then carried the children out to the middle of lake constance ’ s azure waters , where they launched the 46th annual event of the sternsinger , or " star singers . "
on friday , the traditional event will be carried out nationwide .
jan .
2 marks the day every year in germany when a half a million sternsinger roam the country ’ s streets for a good cause .
in small groups of three or four , children go from house to house singing songs and gathering donations - an engagement that has brought them considerable recognition , including this year ’ s prestigious westphalian peace prize .
the children are meant to portray casper , melchior and balthazar , the three kings who walked to bethlehem 2,000 years ago to pay homage to baby jesus .
the donations gathered by the children finance projects of the kindermissionswerk , a catholic children ’ s charity , and the association of catholic youth aid projects for young people throughout the world .
a centuries-old tradition the sternsinger custom began in germany during the 16th century , but back then children collected donations for themselves .
during the christmas holidays , they went from house to house singing songs and collecting money that they used to pay for their schooling .
today , in more prosperous times , the children pass the donations on to the needy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after world war ii , the tradition took on a new form and began in earnest as an organized event .
since then the sternsinger have gathered a total of close to € 250 million donations for the kindermissionswerk , supporting more than 25,000 charity projects .
last year alone , they collected close to € 33 million which went to some 3,000 projects around the world , including a community health center in the philippines and a kindergarten for traumatized children in the palestinian cities of ramallah and jerusalem .
each year the sternsinger select a different developing nation as their focus for donations and projects , and this year ’ s beneficiary is rwanda .
in addition , the organization donated the € 50,000 it received for the peace prize in 2003 to the youth victims of the iran earthquake .
each time the sternsinger pass a house , they leave their mark : the children always write the letters " c m b " as well as the year in chalk on the doors of homes where they receive donations .
to this day , even theologians dispute the letters ’ meaning .
some believe it means " christus mansionem benedicat , " or " jesus blesses this house . "
others believe it ’ s just the initials of the three kings : caspar , melchior and balthazar . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

in small groups of three or four , children go from house to house singing songs and gathering donations - an engagement that has brought them considerable recognition , including this year ’ s prestigious westphalian peace prize .
the children are meant to portray casper , melchior and balthazar , the three kings who walked to bethlehem 2,000 years ago to pay homage to baby jesus .

last year alone , they collected close to € 33 million which went to some 3,000 projects around the world , including a community health center in the philippines and a kindergarten for traumatized children in the palestinian cities of ramallah and jerusalem .

ten years ago , the north american free trade agreement -lrb- nafta -rrb- created the world ’ s largest free trade area .
officials for german companies based in mexico say their business has benefited as a result . mexico was a relatively closed market until it joined the u.s. and canada under the auspices of nafta a decade ago .
but things have changed dramatically since then , with mexican exports more than tripling to $ 160 billion -lrb- € 127 billion -rrb- . the agreement also boosted foreign investments , which quadrupled since the 1980s .
many firms built new factories in mexico to take advantage of low wages and to avoid tariffs when importing to the u.s. many german companies had operations in mexico prior to nafta , but they had mainly produced for the mexican market .
after the agreement went into effect , some expanded their production for export .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nafta countries include canada , the u.s. and mexico .
the u.s. government plans a pan-american free trade zone by 2005 . vw , siemens and others expand mexican operations volkswagen ’ s factory in puebla , for example , now exports 80 percent of its beetles and jettas , with 65 percent going across the border to the north .
the company , which already is the largest german employer in mexico , plans to invest an additional $ 2 billion -lrb- € 1.58 billion -rrb- over the next five years .
“ thanks to the various free trade agreements , mexico is an international production location today , ” reinhard jung , head of vw ’ s mexican operations , told dpa . siemens has also expanded its mexican presence over the last decade , setting up new car technology factories in aquascalientes , guadalajara , puebla , ciudad juarez and monterrey . chemical giant basf invested $ 450 million in a new production facility .
“ without nafta , this sum surely would have been smaller , ” nicholas jose ivandic , head of basf mexico , told dpa .
bayer , the german pharmaceutical company , is another investor in mexico . lack of skilled labor a problem for smaller investors lack of skilled labor has been a problem , but big companies deal with the issue by training employees themselves .
it ’ s kept most smaller german companies out of the country , according to the german-mexican chamber of commerce -lrb- camexa -rrb- .
mexico ’ s bureaucracy , crime levels and courts that usually side with the employee are other reasons to deter investors , chamber officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november , german president johannes rau , right , here with his mexican counterpart vicente fox , visited mexico with a group of businessmen to promote ties between the two countries .
despite all that , some have still set up shop in mexico .
burgmann , a company based outside of munich that makes mechanical seals , has opened production facilities in several mexican cities and now employs 113 people there . “ we decided to come to mexico to use nafta ’ s advantages , ” mario ramirez , who heads a burgmann plant in the mexican state of guerrero , told deutsche welle .
“ we ’ re able to ship products to the u.s. without paying tariffs and we have low costs .
we can produce for about 25 percent less than in a european country . ” farmers suffer ramirez added that as a mexican , he hopes his country will invest more in education .
“ cheap labor alone will eventually lead to a fiasco , ” he said .
already , mexican farmers are complaining that they can not compete with their american counterparts , who receive subsidies from their government . “ everything ’ s getting ruined in the mexican countryside , ” pedro miramontes , a farm worker , told deutsche welle .
he added that two-thirds of the people in his village have already left for the u.s. because they could no longer survive in their own country . there are also signs that other countries are beginning to trump mexico as far as cheap labor is concerned : some of the so-called maquiladoras , factories where mexican laborers assemble products , have been closed and reopened in china , for example . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's mexican dreaming chancellor gerhard schröder traveled to mexico to discuss with president vicente fox how germany and the european union can carve out a bigger slice of the prosperous mexican market .

following an invitation from paris , chancellor schröder will become the first german leader to attend the 60th anniversary of the allied landings in normandy .
the move signals growing ties between paris and berlin . marking a historic turn of events , german chancellor gerhard schröder has accepted an invitation to attend a commemoration ceremony on the anniversary of the landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 .
sixty years after american , british and canadian soldiers set foot on the french beaches and began their campaign to liberate europe from nazi forces , schröder will become the first german leader to participate in the celebrations .
a spokesman for the german government confirmed to journalists on thursday that the chancellor had indeed accepted an invitation from paris to attend the ceremony in france .
" mr. chirac invited the chancellor before christmas , " he said .
" he ’ s -lrb- schröder -rrb- very pleased to have been invited . "
the french government also confirmed the invitation .
a spokeswoman said all invitations had already been sent out .
the guests include representatives from around 15 nations , who attended key 50th anniversary celebrations in 1994 and those countries who contributed troops to the d-day landings .
message of reconciliation schröder ’ s attendance at the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings is expected to drive home a potent message of reconciliation between the two nations , one that has been made clearer in the past year as france and germany teamed up to oppose the u.s.-led war in iraq .
the inclusion of schröder in this year ’ s list is especially noteworthy after his predecessor helmut kohl was pointedly left out of the high-profile invitation list for the 50th anniversary .
at the time ties between the two neighbors were at a low and french president francois mitterand responded to the offended kohl by taking him to a franco-german youth festival and invited german soldiers to participate in france ’ s bastille day parade along the champs elysees in paris .
growing franco-german ties apart from the historic symbolism surrounding the anniversary , the event in june is a reaffirmation of strengthening ties between paris and berlin in the last year .
after enduring several spats - among others over president chirac ’ s support for conservative bavarian leader edmund stoiber in the german general election of 2002 - the franco-german motor roared back into life last year .
in addition to their shared position on the iraq war and reconstruction efforts , the friendship was boosted by frequent franco-german summits , where the two sides agreed to a raft of joint initiatives including regular joint cabinet meetings .
in recent months , the two european heavyweights have also begun cooperating closely on eu affairs .
not only are they the two biggest economies in europe , but they back each other up when it comes to violating the euro zone ’ s stability pact .
they also align themselves closely on the issue of the eu constitution , which failed to be signed due to a controversy over voting methods , and have jointly called for more investment in europe ’ s infrastructure .
in fact , the two neighbors reputedly work so well together that it was no problem for chirac , in a historic first for the european union , to represent the german leader at an eu summit in october , when schröder was forced to stay in berlin for an important vote on social reforms .
to smaller eu members , those who see europe ’ s future endangered by the dominance of france and germany and at the same time foresee a " two-speed europe " falling back on its founding members , the berlin-paris axis is not necessarily an entirely welcome turning-around of history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution summit fails eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights .

schily has criticized local authorities for acting " prematurely " on a warning that islamic militants were planning an attack .
" what i strongly criticize is the fact that confidential leads , that had been gathered by several security authorities , have come out in public , " schily said on friday and added it would make a successful investigation more difficult .
he accused nockemann of " loquacity " .
for his part , nockemann said , " if schily is seriously criticizing the measures , then i have to ask myself if he ’ s the right man responsible for security in germany . "

following an invitation from paris , chancellor schröder will become the first german leader to attend the 60th anniversary of the allied landings in normandy .
the move signals growing ties between paris and berlin . marking a historic turn of events , german chancellor gerhard schröder has accepted an invitation to attend a commemoration ceremony on the anniversary of the landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 .
sixty years after american , british and canadian soldiers set foot on the french beaches and began their campaign to liberate europe from nazi forces , schröder will become the first german leader to participate in the celebrations .
a spokesman for the german government confirmed to journalists on thursday that the chancellor had indeed accepted an invitation from paris to attend the ceremony in france .
" mr. chirac invited the chancellor before christmas , " he said .
" he ’ s -lrb- schröder -rrb- very pleased to have been invited . "
the french government also confirmed the invitation .
a spokeswoman said all invitations had already been sent out .
the guests include representatives from around 15 nations , who attended key 50th anniversary celebrations in 1994 and those countries who contributed troops to the d-day landings .
message of reconciliation schröder ’ s attendance at the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings is expected to drive home a potent message of reconciliation between the two nations , one that has been made clearer in the past year as france and germany teamed up to oppose the u.s.-led war in iraq .
the inclusion of schröder in this year ’ s list is especially noteworthy after his predecessor helmut kohl was pointedly left out of the high-profile invitation list for the 50th anniversary .
at the time ties between the two neighbors were at a low and french president francois mitterand responded to the offended kohl by taking him to a franco-german youth festival and invited german soldiers to participate in france ’ s bastille day parade along the champs elysees in paris .
growing franco-german ties apart from the historic symbolism surrounding the anniversary , the event in june is a reaffirmation of strengthening ties between paris and berlin in the last year .
after enduring several spats - among others over president chirac ’ s support for conservative bavarian leader edmund stoiber in the german general election of 2002 - the franco-german motor roared back into life last year .
in addition to their shared position on the iraq war and reconstruction efforts , the friendship was boosted by frequent franco-german summits , where the two sides agreed to a raft of joint initiatives including regular joint cabinet meetings .
in recent months , the two european heavyweights have also begun cooperating closely on eu affairs .
not only are they the two biggest economies in europe , but they back each other up when it comes to violating the euro zone ’ s stability pact .
they also align themselves closely on the issue of the eu constitution , which failed to be signed due to a controversy over voting methods , and have jointly called for more investment in europe ’ s infrastructure .
in fact , the two neighbors reputedly work so well together that it was no problem for chirac , in a historic first for the european union , to represent the german leader at an eu summit in october , when schröder was forced to stay in berlin for an important vote on social reforms .
to smaller eu members , those who see europe ’ s future endangered by the dominance of france and germany and at the same time foresee a " two-speed europe " falling back on its founding members , the berlin-paris axis is not necessarily an entirely welcome turning-around of history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution summit fails eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights .

thirteen hundred little kings and queens marched through the narrow streets of the southern german town accompanied by two live camels and horses as they recreated the visit of the three kings to baby jesus in bethlehem .
four ships then carried the children out to the middle of lake constance ’ s azure waters , where they launched the 46th annual event of the sternsinger , or " star singers . "
on friday , the traditional event will be carried out nationwide .
jan .
2 marks the day every year in germany when a half a million sternsinger roam the country ’ s streets for a good cause .
in small groups of three or four , children go from house to house singing songs and gathering donations - an engagement that has brought them considerable recognition , including this year ’ s prestigious westphalian peace prize .
the children are meant to portray casper , melchior and balthazar , the three kings who walked to bethlehem 2,000 years ago to pay homage to baby jesus .
the donations gathered by the children finance projects of the kindermissionswerk , a catholic children ’ s charity , and the association of catholic youth aid projects for young people throughout the world .
a centuries-old tradition the sternsinger custom began in germany during the 16th century , but back then children collected donations for themselves .
during the christmas holidays , they went from house to house singing songs and collecting money that they used to pay for their schooling .
today , in more prosperous times , the children pass the donations on to the needy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after world war ii , the tradition took on a new form and began in earnest as an organized event .
since then the sternsinger have gathered a total of close to € 250 million donations for the kindermissionswerk , supporting more than 25,000 charity projects .
last year alone , they collected close to € 33 million which went to some 3,000 projects around the world , including a community health center in the philippines and a kindergarten for traumatized children in the palestinian cities of ramallah and jerusalem .
each year the sternsinger select a different developing nation as their focus for donations and projects , and this year ’ s beneficiary is rwanda .
in addition , the organization donated the € 50,000 it received for the peace prize in 2003 to the youth victims of the iran earthquake .
each time the sternsinger pass a house , they leave their mark : the children always write the letters " c m b " as well as the year in chalk on the doors of homes where they receive donations .
to this day , even theologians dispute the letters ’ meaning .

ten years ago , the north american free trade agreement -lrb- nafta -rrb- created the world ’ s largest free trade area .
officials for german companies based in mexico say their business has benefited as a result . mexico was a relatively closed market until it joined the u.s. and canada under the auspices of nafta a decade ago .
but things have changed dramatically since then , with mexican exports more than tripling to $ 160 billion -lrb- € 127 billion -rrb- . the agreement also boosted foreign investments , which quadrupled since the 1980s .
many firms built new factories in mexico to take advantage of low wages and to avoid tariffs when importing to the u.s. many german companies had operations in mexico prior to nafta , but they had mainly produced for the mexican market .
after the agreement went into effect , some expanded their production for export .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nafta countries include canada , the u.s. and mexico .
the u.s. government plans a pan-american free trade zone by 2005 . vw , siemens and others expand mexican operations volkswagen ’ s factory in puebla , for example , now exports 80 percent of its beetles and jettas , with 65 percent going across the border to the north .
the company , which already is the largest german employer in mexico , plans to invest an additional $ 2 billion -lrb- € 1.58 billion -rrb- over the next five years .
“ thanks to the various free trade agreements , mexico is an international production location today , ” reinhard jung , head of vw ’ s mexican operations , told dpa . siemens has also expanded its mexican presence over the last decade , setting up new car technology factories in aquascalientes , guadalajara , puebla , ciudad juarez and monterrey . chemical giant basf invested $ 450 million in a new production facility .
“ without nafta , this sum surely would have been smaller , ” nicholas jose ivandic , head of basf mexico , told dpa .
bayer , the german pharmaceutical company , is another investor in mexico . lack of skilled labor a problem for smaller investors lack of skilled labor has been a problem , but big companies deal with the issue by training employees themselves .
it ’ s kept most smaller german companies out of the country , according to the german-mexican chamber of commerce -lrb- camexa -rrb- .

despite all that , some have still set up shop in mexico .
burgmann , a company based outside of munich that makes mechanical seals , has opened production facilities in several mexican cities and now employs 113 people there . “ we decided to come to mexico to use nafta ’ s advantages , ” mario ramirez , who heads a burgmann plant in the mexican state of guerrero , told deutsche welle .

ten years ago , the north american free trade agreement -lrb- nafta -rrb- created the world ’ s largest free trade area .
officials for german companies based in mexico say their business has benefited as a result . mexico was a relatively closed market until it joined the u.s. and canada under the auspices of nafta a decade ago .
but things have changed dramatically since then , with mexican exports more than tripling to $ 160 billion -lrb- € 127 billion -rrb- . the agreement also boosted foreign investments , which quadrupled since the 1980s .
many firms built new factories in mexico to take advantage of low wages and to avoid tariffs when importing to the u.s. many german companies had operations in mexico prior to nafta , but they had mainly produced for the mexican market .

following an invitation from paris , chancellor schröder will become the first german leader to attend the 60th anniversary of the allied landings in normandy .
the move signals growing ties between paris and berlin . marking a historic turn of events , german chancellor gerhard schröder has accepted an invitation to attend a commemoration ceremony on the anniversary of the landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 .
sixty years after american , british and canadian soldiers set foot on the french beaches and began their campaign to liberate europe from nazi forces , schröder will become the first german leader to participate in the celebrations .
a spokesman for the german government confirmed to journalists on thursday that the chancellor had indeed accepted an invitation from paris to attend the ceremony in france .
" mr. chirac invited the chancellor before christmas , " he said .
" he ’ s -lrb- schröder -rrb- very pleased to have been invited . "
the french government also confirmed the invitation .
a spokeswoman said all invitations had already been sent out .
the guests include representatives from around 15 nations , who attended key 50th anniversary celebrations in 1994 and those countries who contributed troops to the d-day landings .
message of reconciliation schröder ’ s attendance at the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings is expected to drive home a potent message of reconciliation between the two nations , one that has been made clearer in the past year as france and germany teamed up to oppose the u.s.-led war in iraq .
the inclusion of schröder in this year ’ s list is especially noteworthy after his predecessor helmut kohl was pointedly left out of the high-profile invitation list for the 50th anniversary .
at the time ties between the two neighbors were at a low and french president francois mitterand responded to the offended kohl by taking him to a franco-german youth festival and invited german soldiers to participate in france ’ s bastille day parade along the champs elysees in paris .
growing franco-german ties apart from the historic symbolism surrounding the anniversary , the event in june is a reaffirmation of strengthening ties between paris and berlin in the last year .
after enduring several spats - among others over president chirac ’ s support for conservative bavarian leader edmund stoiber in the german general election of 2002 - the franco-german motor roared back into life last year .
in addition to their shared position on the iraq war and reconstruction efforts , the friendship was boosted by frequent franco-german summits , where the two sides agreed to a raft of joint initiatives including regular joint cabinet meetings .
in recent months , the two european heavyweights have also begun cooperating closely on eu affairs .
not only are they the two biggest economies in europe , but they back each other up when it comes to violating the euro zone ’ s stability pact .
they also align themselves closely on the issue of the eu constitution , which failed to be signed due to a controversy over voting methods , and have jointly called for more investment in europe ’ s infrastructure .
in fact , the two neighbors reputedly work so well together that it was no problem for chirac , in a historic first for the european union , to represent the german leader at an eu summit in october , when schröder was forced to stay in berlin for an important vote on social reforms .

following an invitation from paris , chancellor schröder will become the first german leader to attend the 60th anniversary of the allied landings in normandy .
the move signals growing ties between paris and berlin . marking a historic turn of events , german chancellor gerhard schröder has accepted an invitation to attend a commemoration ceremony on the anniversary of the landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 .
sixty years after american , british and canadian soldiers set foot on the french beaches and began their campaign to liberate europe from nazi forces , schröder will become the first german leader to participate in the celebrations .
a spokesman for the german government confirmed to journalists on thursday that the chancellor had indeed accepted an invitation from paris to attend the ceremony in france .
" mr. chirac invited the chancellor before christmas , " he said .
" he ’ s -lrb- schröder -rrb- very pleased to have been invited . "
the french government also confirmed the invitation .
a spokeswoman said all invitations had already been sent out .
the guests include representatives from around 15 nations , who attended key 50th anniversary celebrations in 1994 and those countries who contributed troops to the d-day landings .
message of reconciliation schröder ’ s attendance at the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings is expected to drive home a potent message of reconciliation between the two nations , one that has been made clearer in the past year as france and germany teamed up to oppose the u.s.-led war in iraq .
the inclusion of schröder in this year ’ s list is especially noteworthy after his predecessor helmut kohl was pointedly left out of the high-profile invitation list for the 50th anniversary .
at the time ties between the two neighbors were at a low and french president francois mitterand responded to the offended kohl by taking him to a franco-german youth festival and invited german soldiers to participate in france ’ s bastille day parade along the champs elysees in paris .
growing franco-german ties apart from the historic symbolism surrounding the anniversary , the event in june is a reaffirmation of strengthening ties between paris and berlin in the last year .
after enduring several spats - among others over president chirac ’ s support for conservative bavarian leader edmund stoiber in the german general election of 2002 - the franco-german motor roared back into life last year .
in addition to their shared position on the iraq war and reconstruction efforts , the friendship was boosted by frequent franco-german summits , where the two sides agreed to a raft of joint initiatives including regular joint cabinet meetings .
in recent months , the two european heavyweights have also begun cooperating closely on eu affairs .
not only are they the two biggest economies in europe , but they back each other up when it comes to violating the euro zone ’ s stability pact .
they also align themselves closely on the issue of the eu constitution , which failed to be signed due to a controversy over voting methods , and have jointly called for more investment in europe ’ s infrastructure .
in fact , the two neighbors reputedly work so well together that it was no problem for chirac , in a historic first for the european union , to represent the german leader at an eu summit in october , when schröder was forced to stay in berlin for an important vote on social reforms .
to smaller eu members , those who see europe ’ s future endangered by the dominance of france and germany and at the same time foresee a " two-speed europe " falling back on its founding members , the berlin-paris axis is not necessarily an entirely welcome turning-around of history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution summit fails eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights .

thirteen hundred little kings and queens marched through the narrow streets of the southern german town accompanied by two live camels and horses as they recreated the visit of the three kings to baby jesus in bethlehem .

on friday , the traditional event will be carried out nationwide .

2 marks the day every year in germany when a half a million sternsinger roam the country ’ s streets for a good cause .
in small groups of three or four , children go from house to house singing songs and gathering donations - an engagement that has brought them considerable recognition , including this year ’ s prestigious westphalian peace prize .
the children are meant to portray casper , melchior and balthazar , the three kings who walked to bethlehem 2,000 years ago to pay homage to baby jesus .
the donations gathered by the children finance projects of the kindermissionswerk , a catholic children ’ s charity , and the association of catholic youth aid projects for young people throughout the world .
a centuries-old tradition the sternsinger custom began in germany during the 16th century , but back then children collected donations for themselves .
during the christmas holidays , they went from house to house singing songs and collecting money that they used to pay for their schooling .
today , in more prosperous times , the children pass the donations on to the needy .

since then the sternsinger have gathered a total of close to € 250 million donations for the kindermissionswerk , supporting more than 25,000 charity projects .
last year alone , they collected close to € 33 million which went to some 3,000 projects around the world , including a community health center in the philippines and a kindergarten for traumatized children in the palestinian cities of ramallah and jerusalem .
each year the sternsinger select a different developing nation as their focus for donations and projects , and this year ’ s beneficiary is rwanda .
in addition , the organization donated the € 50,000 it received for the peace prize in 2003 to the youth victims of the iran earthquake .
each time the sternsinger pass a house , they leave their mark : the children always write the letters " c m b " as well as the year in chalk on the doors of homes where they receive donations .
to this day , even theologians dispute the letters ’ meaning .

following an invitation from paris , chancellor schröder will become the first german leader to attend the 60th anniversary of the allied landings in normandy .
the move signals growing ties between paris and berlin . marking a historic turn of events , german chancellor gerhard schröder has accepted an invitation to attend a commemoration ceremony on the anniversary of the landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 .
sixty years after american , british and canadian soldiers set foot on the french beaches and began their campaign to liberate europe from nazi forces , schröder will become the first german leader to participate in the celebrations .
a spokesman for the german government confirmed to journalists on thursday that the chancellor had indeed accepted an invitation from paris to attend the ceremony in france .
" mr. chirac invited the chancellor before christmas , " he said .
" he ’ s -lrb- schröder -rrb- very pleased to have been invited . "
the french government also confirmed the invitation .
a spokeswoman said all invitations had already been sent out .
the guests include representatives from around 15 nations , who attended key 50th anniversary celebrations in 1994 and those countries who contributed troops to the d-day landings .
message of reconciliation schröder ’ s attendance at the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings is expected to drive home a potent message of reconciliation between the two nations , one that has been made clearer in the past year as france and germany teamed up to oppose the u.s.-led war in iraq .
the inclusion of schröder in this year ’ s list is especially noteworthy after his predecessor helmut kohl was pointedly left out of the high-profile invitation list for the 50th anniversary .
at the time ties between the two neighbors were at a low and french president francois mitterand responded to the offended kohl by taking him to a franco-german youth festival and invited german soldiers to participate in france ’ s bastille day parade along the champs elysees in paris .
growing franco-german ties apart from the historic symbolism surrounding the anniversary , the event in june is a reaffirmation of strengthening ties between paris and berlin in the last year .
after enduring several spats - among others over president chirac ’ s support for conservative bavarian leader edmund stoiber in the german general election of 2002 - the franco-german motor roared back into life last year .
in addition to their shared position on the iraq war and reconstruction efforts , the friendship was boosted by frequent franco-german summits , where the two sides agreed to a raft of joint initiatives including regular joint cabinet meetings .
in recent months , the two european heavyweights have also begun cooperating closely on eu affairs .
not only are they the two biggest economies in europe , but they back each other up when it comes to violating the euro zone ’ s stability pact .
they also align themselves closely on the issue of the eu constitution , which failed to be signed due to a controversy over voting methods , and have jointly called for more investment in europe ’ s infrastructure .
in fact , the two neighbors reputedly work so well together that it was no problem for chirac , in a historic first for the european union , to represent the german leader at an eu summit in october , when schröder was forced to stay in berlin for an important vote on social reforms .
to smaller eu members , those who see europe ’ s future endangered by the dominance of france and germany and at the same time foresee a " two-speed europe " falling back on its founding members , the berlin-paris axis is not necessarily an entirely welcome turning-around of history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution summit fails eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights .

at the time ties between the two neighbors were at a low and french president francois mitterand responded to the offended kohl by taking him to a franco-german youth festival and invited german soldiers to participate in france ’ s bastille day parade along the champs elysees in paris .
growing franco-german ties apart from the historic symbolism surrounding the anniversary , the event in june is a reaffirmation of strengthening ties between paris and berlin in the last year .
after enduring several spats - among others over president chirac ’ s support for conservative bavarian leader edmund stoiber in the german general election of 2002 - the franco-german motor roared back into life last year .

the move signals growing ties between paris and berlin . marking a historic turn of events , german chancellor gerhard schröder has accepted an invitation to attend a commemoration ceremony on the anniversary of the landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 .
sixty years after american , british and canadian soldiers set foot on the french beaches and began their campaign to liberate europe from nazi forces , schröder will become the first german leader to participate in the celebrations .
a spokesman for the german government confirmed to journalists on thursday that the chancellor had indeed accepted an invitation from paris to attend the ceremony in france .

officials for german companies based in mexico say their business has benefited as a result . mexico was a relatively closed market until it joined the u.s. and canada under the auspices of nafta a decade ago .
but things have changed dramatically since then , with mexican exports more than tripling to $ 160 billion -lrb- € 127 billion -rrb- . the agreement also boosted foreign investments , which quadrupled since the 1980s .
many firms built new factories in mexico to take advantage of low wages and to avoid tariffs when importing to the u.s. many german companies had operations in mexico prior to nafta , but they had mainly produced for the mexican market .

following an invitation from paris , chancellor schröder will become the first german leader to attend the 60th anniversary of the allied landings in normandy .
the move signals growing ties between paris and berlin . marking a historic turn of events , german chancellor gerhard schröder has accepted an invitation to attend a commemoration ceremony on the anniversary of the landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 .
sixty years after american , british and canadian soldiers set foot on the french beaches and began their campaign to liberate europe from nazi forces , schröder will become the first german leader to participate in the celebrations .
a spokesman for the german government confirmed to journalists on thursday that the chancellor had indeed accepted an invitation from paris to attend the ceremony in france .
" mr. chirac invited the chancellor before christmas , " he said .
" he ’ s -lrb- schröder -rrb- very pleased to have been invited . "
the french government also confirmed the invitation .
a spokeswoman said all invitations had already been sent out .
the guests include representatives from around 15 nations , who attended key 50th anniversary celebrations in 1994 and those countries who contributed troops to the d-day landings .
message of reconciliation schröder ’ s attendance at the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings is expected to drive home a potent message of reconciliation between the two nations , one that has been made clearer in the past year as france and germany teamed up to oppose the u.s.-led war in iraq .
the inclusion of schröder in this year ’ s list is especially noteworthy after his predecessor helmut kohl was pointedly left out of the high-profile invitation list for the 50th anniversary .
at the time ties between the two neighbors were at a low and french president francois mitterand responded to the offended kohl by taking him to a franco-german youth festival and invited german soldiers to participate in france ’ s bastille day parade along the champs elysees in paris .
growing franco-german ties apart from the historic symbolism surrounding the anniversary , the event in june is a reaffirmation of strengthening ties between paris and berlin in the last year .
after enduring several spats - among others over president chirac ’ s support for conservative bavarian leader edmund stoiber in the german general election of 2002 - the franco-german motor roared back into life last year .
in addition to their shared position on the iraq war and reconstruction efforts , the friendship was boosted by frequent franco-german summits , where the two sides agreed to a raft of joint initiatives including regular joint cabinet meetings .
in recent months , the two european heavyweights have also begun cooperating closely on eu affairs .
not only are they the two biggest economies in europe , but they back each other up when it comes to violating the euro zone ’ s stability pact .
they also align themselves closely on the issue of the eu constitution , which failed to be signed due to a controversy over voting methods , and have jointly called for more investment in europe ’ s infrastructure .
in fact , the two neighbors reputedly work so well together that it was no problem for chirac , in a historic first for the european union , to represent the german leader at an eu summit in october , when schröder was forced to stay in berlin for an important vote on social reforms .
to smaller eu members , those who see europe ’ s future endangered by the dominance of france and germany and at the same time foresee a " two-speed europe " falling back on its founding members , the berlin-paris axis is not necessarily an entirely welcome turning-around of history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution summit fails eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights .

but things have changed dramatically since then , with mexican exports more than tripling to $ 160 billion -lrb- € 127 billion -rrb- . the agreement also boosted foreign investments , which quadrupled since the 1980s .
many firms built new factories in mexico to take advantage of low wages and to avoid tariffs when importing to the u.s. many german companies had operations in mexico prior to nafta , but they had mainly produced for the mexican market .
after the agreement went into effect , some expanded their production for export .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nafta countries include canada , the u.s. and mexico .
the u.s. government plans a pan-american free trade zone by 2005 . vw , siemens and others expand mexican operations volkswagen ’ s factory in puebla , for example , now exports 80 percent of its beetles and jettas , with 65 percent going across the border to the north .
the company , which already is the largest german employer in mexico , plans to invest an additional $ 2 billion -lrb- € 1.58 billion -rrb- over the next five years .
“ thanks to the various free trade agreements , mexico is an international production location today , ” reinhard jung , head of vw ’ s mexican operations , told dpa . siemens has also expanded its mexican presence over the last decade , setting up new car technology factories in aquascalientes , guadalajara , puebla , ciudad juarez and monterrey . chemical giant basf invested $ 450 million in a new production facility .
“ without nafta , this sum surely would have been smaller , ” nicholas jose ivandic , head of basf mexico , told dpa .
bayer , the german pharmaceutical company , is another investor in mexico . lack of skilled labor a problem for smaller investors lack of skilled labor has been a problem , but big companies deal with the issue by training employees themselves .
it ’ s kept most smaller german companies out of the country , according to the german-mexican chamber of commerce -lrb- camexa -rrb- .
mexico ’ s bureaucracy , crime levels and courts that usually side with the employee are other reasons to deter investors , chamber officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last november , german president johannes rau , right , here with his mexican counterpart vicente fox , visited mexico with a group of businessmen to promote ties between the two countries .
despite all that , some have still set up shop in mexico .
burgmann , a company based outside of munich that makes mechanical seals , has opened production facilities in several mexican cities and now employs 113 people there . “ we decided to come to mexico to use nafta ’ s advantages , ” mario ramirez , who heads a burgmann plant in the mexican state of guerrero , told deutsche welle .
“ we ’ re able to ship products to the u.s. without paying tariffs and we have low costs .
we can produce for about 25 percent less than in a european country . ” farmers suffer ramirez added that as a mexican , he hopes his country will invest more in education .
“ cheap labor alone will eventually lead to a fiasco , ” he said .
already , mexican farmers are complaining that they can not compete with their american counterparts , who receive subsidies from their government . “ everything ’ s getting ruined in the mexican countryside , ” pedro miramontes , a farm worker , told deutsche welle .
he added that two-thirds of the people in his village have already left for the u.s. because they could no longer survive in their own country . there are also signs that other countries are beginning to trump mexico as far as cheap labor is concerned : some of the so-called maquiladoras , factories where mexican laborers assemble products , have been closed and reopened in china , for example . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's mexican dreaming chancellor gerhard schröder traveled to mexico to discuss with president vicente fox how germany and the european union can carve out a bigger slice of the prosperous mexican market .

following an invitation from paris , chancellor schröder will become the first german leader to attend the 60th anniversary of the allied landings in normandy .
the move signals growing ties between paris and berlin . marking a historic turn of events , german chancellor gerhard schröder has accepted an invitation to attend a commemoration ceremony on the anniversary of the landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 .
sixty years after american , british and canadian soldiers set foot on the french beaches and began their campaign to liberate europe from nazi forces , schröder will become the first german leader to participate in the celebrations .
a spokesman for the german government confirmed to journalists on thursday that the chancellor had indeed accepted an invitation from paris to attend the ceremony in france .
" mr. chirac invited the chancellor before christmas , " he said .
" he ’ s -lrb- schröder -rrb- very pleased to have been invited . "
the french government also confirmed the invitation .
a spokeswoman said all invitations had already been sent out .
the guests include representatives from around 15 nations , who attended key 50th anniversary celebrations in 1994 and those countries who contributed troops to the d-day landings .
message of reconciliation schröder ’ s attendance at the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings is expected to drive home a potent message of reconciliation between the two nations , one that has been made clearer in the past year as france and germany teamed up to oppose the u.s.-led war in iraq .
the inclusion of schröder in this year ’ s list is especially noteworthy after his predecessor helmut kohl was pointedly left out of the high-profile invitation list for the 50th anniversary .
at the time ties between the two neighbors were at a low and french president francois mitterand responded to the offended kohl by taking him to a franco-german youth festival and invited german soldiers to participate in france ’ s bastille day parade along the champs elysees in paris .
growing franco-german ties apart from the historic symbolism surrounding the anniversary , the event in june is a reaffirmation of strengthening ties between paris and berlin in the last year .
after enduring several spats - among others over president chirac ’ s support for conservative bavarian leader edmund stoiber in the german general election of 2002 - the franco-german motor roared back into life last year .
in addition to their shared position on the iraq war and reconstruction efforts , the friendship was boosted by frequent franco-german summits , where the two sides agreed to a raft of joint initiatives including regular joint cabinet meetings .
in recent months , the two european heavyweights have also begun cooperating closely on eu affairs .
not only are they the two biggest economies in europe , but they back each other up when it comes to violating the euro zone ’ s stability pact .
they also align themselves closely on the issue of the eu constitution , which failed to be signed due to a controversy over voting methods , and have jointly called for more investment in europe ’ s infrastructure .
in fact , the two neighbors reputedly work so well together that it was no problem for chirac , in a historic first for the european union , to represent the german leader at an eu summit in october , when schröder was forced to stay in berlin for an important vote on social reforms .
to smaller eu members , those who see europe ’ s future endangered by the dominance of france and germany and at the same time foresee a " two-speed europe " falling back on its founding members , the berlin-paris axis is not necessarily an entirely welcome turning-around of history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution summit fails eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights .

following an invitation from paris , chancellor schröder will become the first german leader to attend the 60th anniversary of the allied landings in normandy .
the move signals growing ties between paris and berlin . marking a historic turn of events , german chancellor gerhard schröder has accepted an invitation to attend a commemoration ceremony on the anniversary of the landing of allied troops in normandy on june 6 , 1944 .
sixty years after american , british and canadian soldiers set foot on the french beaches and began their campaign to liberate europe from nazi forces , schröder will become the first german leader to participate in the celebrations .
a spokesman for the german government confirmed to journalists on thursday that the chancellor had indeed accepted an invitation from paris to attend the ceremony in france .
" mr. chirac invited the chancellor before christmas , " he said .
" he ’ s -lrb- schröder -rrb- very pleased to have been invited . "
the french government also confirmed the invitation .
a spokeswoman said all invitations had already been sent out .
the guests include representatives from around 15 nations , who attended key 50th anniversary celebrations in 1994 and those countries who contributed troops to the d-day landings .
message of reconciliation schröder ’ s attendance at the 60th anniversary of the d-day landings is expected to drive home a potent message of reconciliation between the two nations , one that has been made clearer in the past year as france and germany teamed up to oppose the u.s.-led war in iraq .
the inclusion of schröder in this year ’ s list is especially noteworthy after his predecessor helmut kohl was pointedly left out of the high-profile invitation list for the 50th anniversary .
at the time ties between the two neighbors were at a low and french president francois mitterand responded to the offended kohl by taking him to a franco-german youth festival and invited german soldiers to participate in france ’ s bastille day parade along the champs elysees in paris .
growing franco-german ties apart from the historic symbolism surrounding the anniversary , the event in june is a reaffirmation of strengthening ties between paris and berlin in the last year .
after enduring several spats - among others over president chirac ’ s support for conservative bavarian leader edmund stoiber in the german general election of 2002 - the franco-german motor roared back into life last year .
in addition to their shared position on the iraq war and reconstruction efforts , the friendship was boosted by frequent franco-german summits , where the two sides agreed to a raft of joint initiatives including regular joint cabinet meetings .
in recent months , the two european heavyweights have also begun cooperating closely on eu affairs .
not only are they the two biggest economies in europe , but they back each other up when it comes to violating the euro zone ’ s stability pact .
they also align themselves closely on the issue of the eu constitution , which failed to be signed due to a controversy over voting methods , and have jointly called for more investment in europe ’ s infrastructure .
in fact , the two neighbors reputedly work so well together that it was no problem for chirac , in a historic first for the european union , to represent the german leader at an eu summit in october , when schröder was forced to stay in berlin for an important vote on social reforms .
to smaller eu members , those who see europe ’ s future endangered by the dominance of france and germany and at the same time foresee a " two-speed europe " falling back on its founding members , the berlin-paris axis is not necessarily an entirely welcome turning-around of history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution summit fails eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights .

the us has been at code orange - the second highest level on a five-step terror attack warning scale - since 21 december .
russ knocke , of the homeland security department , said the decision to close the port in alaska was consistent with code orange .
it is not known what specifically triggered the decision , but local coastguards said the port had now reopened .
" right now we are allowing tanker traffic throughout the port , " said a spokesperson for the coastguard 's valdez marine safety office .
" appropriate safety measures are being taken with regard to the security information that we have " .
valdez is the loading point for oil from the trans-alaska pipeline , which carries about 17 % of america 's domestic supply from the prudhoe bay oilfields .
pipeline operator , alyeska pipeline service co , said production was not interrupted by the two-day shutdown .

azar nafisi is the author of reading lolita in tehran .
born in tehran , iran , she now lives in the us and teaches at the school for advanced international studies at johns hopkins university .
i lived in iran until i was 13 , and then my parents sent me to england - to lancaster - to finish my studies .
that was when i first tasted the pangs of exile .
azar nafisi : i have not lost contact -lrb- photo lili iravani -rrb- i finally returned to iran in 1979 , when i got my degree in english and american literature , and stayed for 18 years in the islamic republic .
when i first left iran at the age of 13 , iran had become such a shining star - it was the point to which all my desires and dreams returned .
when i went back home after the revolution in 1979 , i discovered that home was not really home .
everything that had been familiar during my youth had changed beyond recognition .
when i was teaching at the university of tehran we were struggling against the implementation of the revolution rules .
from the very first years i returned , i was trying to redefine what home meant .
was it where you were born , was it where the values that you cherish were practised ?
it was a dilemma that i had to deal with over the 18 years that i lived in iran .
certain things you take with you wherever you go .
my passion has always been books and literature , and teaching .
in the us i teach - and i also write .
the main difference is of course that the book that i recently wrote could not have been written had i lived in my homeland .
but now that i have written this book , i can re-create the relationship with the people living in iran through my writings .
so i have not lost contact with iran .
i think that this is what makes literature and books so wonderful - they transcend geographical boundaries .

' essential work ' " student nurses with children are particularly hard hit at this time of year with the additional expense and are under enormous pressure to work extra shifts , " said karen jennings , head of health at unison .
" there is no doubt in my mind that many hospitals rely on student nurses to work hard on the wards all over the christmas and new year holiday .
" the government could do a great deal to relieve the pressure by paying students a decent wage for the essential work they do . "
second jobs the unison survey of 2,400 student nurses found that almost half had responsibilities for looking after children or relatives .
two out of five said they had seriously considered quitting their training , while most had other jobs to supplement their income .
a department of health spokesman said student nurses made a " valuable contribution " to the nhs and received more financial support than other students .
" this is in recognition of the specialist nature and particular demands of health professional training programmes . "
she said older students and single parents got additional allowances and grants towards childcare costs .

snowdon warden sam roberts said it had already been busy with people keen to try out their christmas presents .
" just because father christmas brought you the same equipment that chris bonington used to climb everest , that does n't mean that you wo n't come unstuck going up snowdon , " said mr roberts .
he said many people did come with the necessary skills , equipment and winter clothing , but others still relied on just a mobile phone to help them if they got into trouble .
in one an incident over the holiday period , two walkers had to be guided to safety by the ogwen valley mountain rescue team rescuers said said the two were ill-prepared as it grew dark and weather conditions changed ... the only equipment they had was a mobile phone in an area where phone signals are unreliable .
the experts said people were still ignoring advice to wear sensible clothes and take suitable safety precautions , even on the most challenging routes like the pyg track up crib goch .
mr roberts said : " crampons and ice axes are pretty essential , but some people are still only wearing trainers . "

the forecast says australia can expect more bushfires these gloomy predictions are made in a new government report on climate change over the next 70 years .
the findings will add to pressure on prime minister john howard over his decision not to sign the kyoto protocol on reducing greenhouse gases .
the report by australia 's leading climate scientists gives a devastating assessment of what future generations can expect .
it is predicted the country will be hotter , more prone to drought and severe storms .
the study has claimed average annual temperatures will rise by up to six degrees by 2070 .

climate change caused by global warming will , say the authors of the study , put great pressure on water resources , while the great barrier reef could be threatened by the bleaching of coral .
on top of all that , there is the prospect of more outbreaks of tropical diseases such as dengue and ross river fever .

prime minister john howard has refused to ratify the global agreement , claiming it would cost jobs and damage industry and would be meaningless without the support of the united states , which has also rejected it .

trams were operating on a reduced service on new year 's day after the drivers went on strike at midnight in a row over union recognition .
they are unhappy that only the transport and general workers union -lrb- tgwu -rrb- has negotiation rights for pay and conditions .
aslef represents about a quarter of metrolink 's 340 staff .
the union 's representative colin smith said : " we 've got nothing against the tgwu , they 're a fantastic trade union along with all of the trade unions , but we 'd like recognition along with them . "
but metrolink has said if it begins talking to aslef it could cause a strike by tgwu members .
the firm says the original agreement has the blessing of the tuc .
more aslef strike action is currently planned over the next eight weeks .

the global car industry is due for a pickup in 2004 , a survey of 100 top bosses in the auto industry says .
but carmakers will have to wait until 2006 for profits to return to peak levels , the executives warn .
the 100 people surveyed by audit and consultancy firm kpmg - from 19 carmakers and 81 suppliers - saw asian manufacturers as 2004 's big gainers .
detroit 's drought could finally come to an end too , they said , as the need for heavy incentives slackened .
caution the improved expectations come just days ahead of the highlight of the us industry 's year , the north american international auto show , which kicks off in detroit on sunday .
but it is not all good news either for the us or the industry as a whole , the kpmg survey found .
of the 100 executives questioned , 36 said 2003 would prove to have been the worst year for profits in recent times - and 13 said 2004 would be even worse .
meanwhile , the prediction of 2006 for a return to peak profitability is a repeat of the consensus in the survey a year ago .
that year , executives foresaw that the business would be back in a boom by 2005 .
and despite falling incentives - only 38 of the respondents saw the need to bribe customers into the showrooms increasing , against 63 in 2001 and 48 in 2002 - us carmakers are set to keep losing market share .
the improving us economy is instead likely to prove good news for asian carmakers , particularly toyota - now the number three seller ahead of chrysler - and nissan but also korean marques .
european vendors are set to gain less from an expanding us market , those surveyed said , predicting at the same time that merger activity in europe would accelerate .

from january , social services have two days to find a place for someone ready to be discharged or face a £ 100 fine .
the measure is designed to free up beds at hospitals in england and wales for the sick and reduce waiting lists .
however , researchers at university college london said the elderly would have no choice over where they went .
a report by the public accounts committee in september said that an " intolerable " number of older patients were waiting too long to be discharged from hospital .
new financial incentives could see the chronically ill and older patients being forced into accommodation which is inappropriate david rowland and allyson pollock the report estimated it was costing the nhs £ 170m a year .
the mps said that on any given day , around 3,500 older people remained in hospital in england after they had been declared fit to leave because arrangements had not been made for them to move on .
this situation is known as " bed blocking " .
individual choices now social services will be fined if they do not move well enough patients on within two days .
david rowland and allyson pollock of ucl said this contradicted the government 's pledge to give " genuine individual choices " about when , where and how they were treated .
writing in the british medical journal , they said reduced nhs and social services capacity and financial incentives could see the chronically ill and older patients being forced into inappropriate accommodation .
" if their first choice of care home is not available , older patients will be offered an interim placement , which may be far away from their family ... and inappropriate to their care needs . "
ms pollock told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " this legislation is targeting really vulnerable people and placing them at greater risk . "
she warned it would not only shift the risk and costs from the nhs to social services but also to individuals and their carers .
safety of patients patients exercising their right to choose a home are said to account for 8 % of all delayed discharges from hospital , they said .
they said that meant choice was seen as an obstacle to the efficient functioning of the system .
from 2006 , new financial arrangements will also mean that hospitals make a loss if they continue to care for a patient longer than average .
tony hunter , vice president of the association of directors of social services , said the new fines made it all the more urgent to tackle an issue that had been a concern for years .
but he told the bbc : " i think we are well poised to do everything we can to maintain improvements of recent years in getting people out of hospital safely and promptly . "
he said social services departments would have to attempt to anticipate likely fines for delayed discharges and provide short term care places for elderly patients while plans were made for their care in the long term .
a department of health spokeswoman said they wanted to guarantee greater choice for older people over the services they received .
" hospitals have a responsibility to ensure that patients are discharged safely , if they discharge patients too early , it will face the risk that the patient will be readmitted , which will not benefit the patient or the hospital , " she said .
liberal democrat health spokesman paul burstow said : " elderly people become the victims of a game of pass the parcel between the nhs and social services when they are at their most vulnerable .
" instead of having the ludicrous situation where the government passes money to social services on the one hand and takes it away through arbitrary fines , patients would benefit by having the money going directly to the front line . "

from january , social services have two days to find a place for someone ready to be discharged or face a £ 100 fine .
the measure is designed to free up beds at hospitals in england and wales for the sick and reduce waiting lists .
however , researchers at university college london said the elderly would have no choice over where they went .
a report by the public accounts committee in september said that an " intolerable " number of older patients were waiting too long to be discharged from hospital .
new financial incentives could see the chronically ill and older patients being forced into accommodation which is inappropriate david rowland and allyson pollock the report estimated it was costing the nhs £ 170m a year .
the mps said that on any given day , around 3,500 older people remained in hospital in england after they had been declared fit to leave because arrangements had not been made for them to move on .
this situation is known as " bed blocking " .
individual choices now social services will be fined if they do not move well enough patients on within two days .
david rowland and allyson pollock of ucl said this contradicted the government 's pledge to give " genuine individual choices " about when , where and how they were treated .
writing in the british medical journal , they said reduced nhs and social services capacity and financial incentives could see the chronically ill and older patients being forced into inappropriate accommodation .
" if their first choice of care home is not available , older patients will be offered an interim placement , which may be far away from their family ... and inappropriate to their care needs . "
ms pollock told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " this legislation is targeting really vulnerable people and placing them at greater risk . "
she warned it would not only shift the risk and costs from the nhs to social services but also to individuals and their carers .
safety of patients patients exercising their right to choose a home are said to account for 8 % of all delayed discharges from hospital , they said .
they said that meant choice was seen as an obstacle to the efficient functioning of the system .
from 2006 , new financial arrangements will also mean that hospitals make a loss if they continue to care for a patient longer than average .
tony hunter , vice president of the association of directors of social services , said the new fines made it all the more urgent to tackle an issue that had been a concern for years .
but he told the bbc : " i think we are well poised to do everything we can to maintain improvements of recent years in getting people out of hospital safely and promptly . "
he said social services departments would have to attempt to anticipate likely fines for delayed discharges and provide short term care places for elderly patients while plans were made for their care in the long term .
a department of health spokeswoman said they wanted to guarantee greater choice for older people over the services they received .
" hospitals have a responsibility to ensure that patients are discharged safely , if they discharge patients too early , it will face the risk that the patient will be readmitted , which will not benefit the patient or the hospital , " she said .
liberal democrat health spokesman paul burstow said : " elderly people become the victims of a game of pass the parcel between the nhs and social services when they are at their most vulnerable .
" instead of having the ludicrous situation where the government passes money to social services on the one hand and takes it away through arbitrary fines , patients would benefit by having the money going directly to the front line . "

tony hunter , vice president of the association of directors of social services , said the new fines made it all the more urgent to tackle an issue that had been a concern for years .
but he told the bbc : " i think we are well poised to do everything we can to maintain improvements of recent years in getting people out of hospital safely and promptly . "
he said social services departments would have to attempt to anticipate likely fines for delayed discharges and provide short term care places for elderly patients while plans were made for their care in the long term .
a department of health spokeswoman said they wanted to guarantee greater choice for older people over the services they received .
" hospitals have a responsibility to ensure that patients are discharged safely , if they discharge patients too early , it will face the risk that the patient will be readmitted , which will not benefit the patient or the hospital , " she said .
liberal democrat health spokesman paul burstow said : " elderly people become the victims of a game of pass the parcel between the nhs and social services when they are at their most vulnerable .
" instead of having the ludicrous situation where the government passes money to social services on the one hand and takes it away through arbitrary fines , patients would benefit by having the money going directly to the front line . "

liberal democrat dr evan harris has called on the government to allow a free vote on an amendment to the human tissue bill .
the amendment would replace the current " opt-in " system for organ donations with an " opt-out " - or presumed consent - system .
dr harris , a former hospital doctor , made the call after the idea received support in a bbc radio 4 listeners ' poll on ideas for new legislation .
the mp for oxford west and abingdon said he had the backing of patient groups , such as the national kidney federation , as well as the bma .
he added : " hundreds of patients die each year while waiting for an organ transplant .
" these tragic deaths , often of young people , are entirely avoidable since hundreds of organs are lost each year following deaths of potential donors who would have wanted them to be used to save or transform the lives of others , but who never opted in through the donor card or organ register and whose relatives refused permission , unable to second guess their loved ones ' wishes .
" it is time for the government to engage in the public debate on this important issue and mps must be given a free vote , as it is a matter of conscience . "
