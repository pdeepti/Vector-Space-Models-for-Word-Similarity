almost two years after a school massacre killed 16 people , one of the victims ' partners has taken state authorities to court for not having done enough to save lives .
it 's reopened questions underlying the tragedy . on april 26 , 2002 , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser gunned down 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman within minutes at his former high school in the eastern german town of erfurt .
he then shot himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police at the erfurt high school shooting the bloodbath stunned the nation and left a stain on the sleepy german town in the state of thuringia .
a national debate broke out on the link between vicious computer games , which steinhäuser was addicted to , and increasing violence among teenagers .
at the time , critical voices were also raised about the role of the local police and whether they had done enough to save victims ' lives . now , almost two years later , erfurt lawyer eric langer , who lost his partner , an art teacher , during the massacre , is ensuring that the same questions are kept alive .
langer filed a case against the state of thuringia this week , accusing those responsible for the police action on the day of the shoot-out , of acting too late or irresponsibly in five cases .
langer , who has carried out his own research into the incident and personally spoken to about 70 witnesses , believes that three teachers and two students died only one to two hours after they were fatally injured by steinhäuser .
though there is no way of knowing if they could have been saved , langer says it 's incomprehensible that no attempt was made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lawyer has also accused the various emergency services of disastrous coordination efforts .
" each emergency service waited for the next one with the result that the entire deployment was paralysed , " langer told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . langer also described the entire operation as " entirely chaotic , " with several students and police officers not even aware that paramedics had been allowed to enter the school building .
langer 's own partner , birgit dettke , is said to have laid crying in vain for help for almost an hour and a half in the schoolyard , just meters away from policemen . no mention of police failures a 43-page investigative report compiled by thuringia 's interior ministry two months after the massacre , however , assumed that , " all victims would have had no chance of survival even if they had undergone an immediate emergency operation . "
langer has slammed the report for ignoring the alleged failures of the police operation . nor had the report , which was originally meant to be just an interim assessment , been pursued further .
it was only in january this year that thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , commissioned his justice minister to open a detailed probe into the massacre after facing pressure from an opposition political parties and langer 's threat to take the matter to the court . bodo ramelow of the party of democratic socialism is also pushing the government to implement a tighter weapons law than the existing one , introduce school reforms and make more provisions for traumatized victims . book on massacre causes controversy the issue has been lent urgency with the publication of the controversial part-fiction book " das reicht für heute " -lrb- that 's enough for today -rrb- by german author ines geipel .

germany 's highest court ruled on wednesday that telephone surveillance as currently practiced is unconstitutional .
it demanded changes in the six-year old law . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe said the current law that allows authorities to eavesdrop on conversations in private homes was unconstitutional and must be rectified by june 2005 . three politicians from germany 's small fdp party had brought the complaint , even though the liberals were part of former chancellor helmut kohl 's government when the law was passed six years ago . aiming to fight organized crime and terrorism , it was highly controversial at the time , because of the country 's history of the nazi police state , and following decades of surveillance by the east german secret police , the stasi . however , fdp politicians sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , gerhart baum und burkhard hirsch opposed the law on the grounds that it violates constitutional privacy guarantees , and that it has n't helped solve any major cases . new rules according to the latest ruling , bugging of phones in private homes should only be allowed in cases where there is a suspicion of a serious offense that could carry a prison sentence of more than five years . up to now , phone surveillance was allowed in the case of offenses that carried lesser sentences . in addition , surveillance must be immediately cut when the conversation is clearly of a private nature , or when people under surveillance are speaking in their homes to close relatives , doctors , priests or defense lawyers who are not themselves suspects . the court 's decision argues that the protecting private homes is part of protecting human dignity , and that only surveillance that protect human dignity should be permitted . " it is not necessarily a violation of human dignity if someone is put under observation , " court justice hans-juergen papier said , according to a report by the associated press .
" but in such cases , the core area of privacy must be safeguarded . " the german government says eavesdropping is used only as a last resort .
overall , authorities plant bugs in homes in about 30 cases a year . dw staff -lrb- jm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.n. spy allegations widen following allegations that the british government had illegally tapped u.n. secretary general kofi annan 's phone in the run up to the iraq war , sources now say chief weapons inspector hans blix 's phone was also bugged .

new line cinema has acquired the film rights to best-selling german children 's author cornelia funke 's fantasy novel " inkheart . "
it 's an unprecedented success for a german writer . many writers dream that one day they 'll hit the hollywood jackpot , with movie moguls slugging it out to see which top studio snags the rights to the big-screen version of their book .
britain 's j.k.rowling did it with her famous " harry potter " series , but german writers generally do n't make much of a splash in tinseltown .
that may be changing , thanks to the hamburg-based writer cornelia funke . in recent months the 44-year-old mother of two has found herself in the middle of a frantic tussle between heyday films and new line cinema , both desperate to secure movie rights to her book " inkheart . "
new line cinema has won and has signed her up for a three-movie deal - similar to the hugely successful harry potter series produced by heyday films - which will also cover the subsequent two volumes in funke 's planned trilogy .
the second part of the series is due for publication in germany later this year .
in an interview with dw-tv , funke was still reeling from her sudden a-list status , saying " all these famous names were being bandied around … .tom hanks … .brad pitt … the names kept on coming at me , they talked about taking $ 50 million in the first weekend … it was everything you imagine hollywood to be . "
runaway success at home and abroad cornelia funke is germany 's bestselling children 's author after j. k. rowling and r. l. stine .
born in 1958 , she began her career as an illustrator , but soon became bored of the books she was working with and decided to go it alone .
she published her first novel at the age of 28 and now has some 40 titles to her name .
german publisher cecilie dressler verlag has sold some 2.5 million of her books in germany alone , and she 's been translated into around 26 languages .
a slow-burning success at home as well as in far-flung countries such as japan and sweden , she still had to wait a while to be noticed by english-language publishers .
with english-language markets notoriously slow to pick up on foreign fiction , it was n't until 2002 that the prolific author made her debut in the u.k. and the u.s. with " the thief lord , " which fast became a new york times bestseller and scooped several european children 's literature awards .
it 's also the first of funke 's novels to get a movie treatment , with filming set to begin in venice this spring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publishers then wasted no time releasing " inkheart " in late 2003 .
still no .
7 after 20 weeks on the new york times bestseller list , it 's even giving illustrious rival authors such as rowling and lemony snicket a run for their money .
scholastic promptly rushed out funke 's " the princess knight " in february , and is now eagerly awaiting the second part of the inkheart trilogy , " inkblood " , which was recently delivered for english translation and will be published world-wide next year .
following the footsteps of j.k. rowling fêted by the english-language press , funke realized it would n't be long before hollywood came knocking .
fortunately for her , her brand of fantasy fiction seemed to capture the zeitgeist perfectly , and the studios were soon queuing up to get in on the act .
with its " lord of the rings " trilogy down and dusted - and currently basking in oscar glory - , new line in particular was looking around for another fantasy franchise .
" inkheart " is a fast-paced adventure story about a young girl whose father has the power to bring characters from books to life .
when he 's kidnapped by a power-hungry villain from a rare children 's fable , his daughter gets together with a group of friends both real and imagined to set things right .
in an interview with the guardian last october , funke stressed that she would be signing with the studio most likely to give her creative control .
" what for me is most important , and what disturbs especially the americans , is that i do n't talk about money , " she said .
" i could do a bidding war , but i do n't want to , because the only thing that interests me is creative control , and they do n't like that . "

the second part of the series is due for publication in germany later this year .
in an interview with dw-tv , funke was still reeling from her sudden a-list status , saying " all these famous names were being bandied around … .tom hanks … .brad pitt … the names kept on coming at me , they talked about taking $ 50 million in the first weekend … it was everything you imagine hollywood to be .

almost two years after a school massacre killed 16 people , one of the victims ' partners has taken state authorities to court for not having done enough to save lives .
it 's reopened questions underlying the tragedy . on april 26 , 2002 , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser gunned down 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman within minutes at his former high school in the eastern german town of erfurt .
he then shot himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police at the erfurt high school shooting the bloodbath stunned the nation and left a stain on the sleepy german town in the state of thuringia .
a national debate broke out on the link between vicious computer games , which steinhäuser was addicted to , and increasing violence among teenagers .
at the time , critical voices were also raised about the role of the local police and whether they had done enough to save victims ' lives . now , almost two years later , erfurt lawyer eric langer , who lost his partner , an art teacher , during the massacre , is ensuring that the same questions are kept alive .
langer filed a case against the state of thuringia this week , accusing those responsible for the police action on the day of the shoot-out , of acting too late or irresponsibly in five cases .
langer , who has carried out his own research into the incident and personally spoken to about 70 witnesses , believes that three teachers and two students died only one to two hours after they were fatally injured by steinhäuser .
though there is no way of knowing if they could have been saved , langer says it 's incomprehensible that no attempt was made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lawyer has also accused the various emergency services of disastrous coordination efforts .
" each emergency service waited for the next one with the result that the entire deployment was paralysed , " langer told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . langer also described the entire operation as " entirely chaotic , " with several students and police officers not even aware that paramedics had been allowed to enter the school building .
langer 's own partner , birgit dettke , is said to have laid crying in vain for help for almost an hour and a half in the schoolyard , just meters away from policemen . no mention of police failures a 43-page investigative report compiled by thuringia 's interior ministry two months after the massacre , however , assumed that , " all victims would have had no chance of survival even if they had undergone an immediate emergency operation . "
langer has slammed the report for ignoring the alleged failures of the police operation . nor had the report , which was originally meant to be just an interim assessment , been pursued further .
it was only in january this year that thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , commissioned his justice minister to open a detailed probe into the massacre after facing pressure from an opposition political parties and langer 's threat to take the matter to the court . bodo ramelow of the party of democratic socialism is also pushing the government to implement a tighter weapons law than the existing one , introduce school reforms and make more provisions for traumatized victims . book on massacre causes controversy the issue has been lent urgency with the publication of the controversial part-fiction book " das reicht für heute " -lrb- that 's enough for today -rrb- by german author ines geipel .
geipel , who wrote the story through the perspective of a fictitious former student , has accused the police of inaction and criticized efforts by the thuringia government to bury fundamental debates and questions that sprung up in the aftermath of the shooting . geipel , however , has been publicly slammed by both teachers and students from the high school where the massacre took place as a sensation-seeker .

new line cinema has acquired the film rights to best-selling german children 's author cornelia funke 's fantasy novel " inkheart . "
it 's an unprecedented success for a german writer . many writers dream that one day they 'll hit the hollywood jackpot , with movie moguls slugging it out to see which top studio snags the rights to the big-screen version of their book .
britain 's j.k.rowling did it with her famous " harry potter " series , but german writers generally do n't make much of a splash in tinseltown .
that may be changing , thanks to the hamburg-based writer cornelia funke . in recent months the 44-year-old mother of two has found herself in the middle of a frantic tussle between heyday films and new line cinema , both desperate to secure movie rights to her book " inkheart . "
new line cinema has won and has signed her up for a three-movie deal - similar to the hugely successful harry potter series produced by heyday films - which will also cover the subsequent two volumes in funke 's planned trilogy .
the second part of the series is due for publication in germany later this year .
in an interview with dw-tv , funke was still reeling from her sudden a-list status , saying " all these famous names were being bandied around … .tom hanks … .brad pitt … the names kept on coming at me , they talked about taking $ 50 million in the first weekend … it was everything you imagine hollywood to be . "
runaway success at home and abroad cornelia funke is germany 's bestselling children 's author after j. k. rowling and r. l. stine .
born in 1958 , she began her career as an illustrator , but soon became bored of the books she was working with and decided to go it alone .
she published her first novel at the age of 28 and now has some 40 titles to her name .
german publisher cecilie dressler verlag has sold some 2.5 million of her books in germany alone , and she 's been translated into around 26 languages .
a slow-burning success at home as well as in far-flung countries such as japan and sweden , she still had to wait a while to be noticed by english-language publishers .
with english-language markets notoriously slow to pick up on foreign fiction , it was n't until 2002 that the prolific author made her debut in the u.k. and the u.s. with " the thief lord , " which fast became a new york times bestseller and scooped several european children 's literature awards .
it 's also the first of funke 's novels to get a movie treatment , with filming set to begin in venice this spring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publishers then wasted no time releasing " inkheart " in late 2003 .
still no .
7 after 20 weeks on the new york times bestseller list , it 's even giving illustrious rival authors such as rowling and lemony snicket a run for their money .
scholastic promptly rushed out funke 's " the princess knight " in february , and is now eagerly awaiting the second part of the inkheart trilogy , " inkblood " , which was recently delivered for english translation and will be published world-wide next year .
following the footsteps of j.k. rowling fêted by the english-language press , funke realized it would n't be long before hollywood came knocking .
fortunately for her , her brand of fantasy fiction seemed to capture the zeitgeist perfectly , and the studios were soon queuing up to get in on the act .
with its " lord of the rings " trilogy down and dusted - and currently basking in oscar glory - , new line in particular was looking around for another fantasy franchise .
" inkheart " is a fast-paced adventure story about a young girl whose father has the power to bring characters from books to life .
when he 's kidnapped by a power-hungry villain from a rare children 's fable , his daughter gets together with a group of friends both real and imagined to set things right .
in an interview with the guardian last october , funke stressed that she would be signing with the studio most likely to give her creative control .
" what for me is most important , and what disturbs especially the americans , is that i do n't talk about money , " she said .

"
now that john kerry has locked up the democratic nomination , the next stage begins in his fight against george w. bush .
kerry says if elected he 'll change u.s. foreign policy and renew frayed alliances . kerry 's coast-to-coast victories in the super tuesday primaries and caucuses means the 60-year-old democratic senator from massachusetts will be george w. bush 's opponent in the november election .
but even before cementing the nomination , kerry has been laying out a vision of international affairs that lies in stark contrast to the one pursued by president bush and which europeans and much of the world will probably find more to their liking . while the bush campaign will focus on the danger of terrorism and the president 's role as commander-in-chief during the election fight , kerry seems determined not to let the republicans gain the advantage on security and international affairs .
he has been relentless in his criticism of white house foreign policy . " the bush administration has run the most inept , reckless , arrogant and ideological foreign policy in the modern history of our country , " kerry often says on the stump . kerry has continued to paint a bleak picture of bush 's foreign policy and his approach to terrorism in his speeches in recent weeks and says he would take a radically different approach to fighting the danger of terrorism and ensuring america 's security . " no matter how much power we have , we can not prevail single-handedly , " he has said .
" we have to work with the international community to define a global strategy that is inclusive , not exclusive , collective and not imperial . " rebuilding bridges kerry says he would break with several tenets of the bush administration , which he accuses of abandoning belief in collective security , respect for international institutions , international law and multilateral engagement . kerry promises a " new era of alliances " and says he would make an aggressive effort to rebuild " frayed and shredded " relationships , especially with nato allies .
he says he would call an international summit to draw up a common anti-terrorism and security agenda and pledges to return to the use of diplomacy as a tool for foreign policy and treat the un as a " full partner . " " we will renew our alliances and we will build new alliances because they are essential to the final victory and success of a war on terror , " he told supporters in one speech . a kerry administration would reengage the u.s. in the fight against global warming , the candidate has said , in sharp contrast to the bush white house , which turned its back on the kyoto protocol on climate change three years ago . putting the stress on dialog bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john kerry in 1969 with members of his crew aboard pcf-31 in the mekong delta during the war in vietnam .
kerry , who is a both a vietnam veteran and former anti-war protester and worked toward normalization of ties with hanoi , says he understands the importance of dialog and diplomacy and the dangers of bullying with a big stick . he says once in office , he will put the united nations in charge of rebuilding iraq and establish a " reasonable plan and specific timetable " for restoring self-government and not engage in a rush to hand back power . in a speech last friday in los angeles , kerry vowed that if elected , he will revamp u.s. intelligence agencies and begin diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing islamic youth from embracing radicalism . ties to europe kerry 's vision of his administration 's foreign policy have been greeted with enthusiasm from many in europe , where anti-bush sentiment is high .
the bush administration has alienated many of its closest allies , particularly france and germany , over the iraq war and its dismissive attitude toward the " old world . "
though bush and chancellor gerhard schröder recently met at the white house and publicly put their differences over iraq behind them , relations between them can not be described as close . while bush has had limited foreign travel experience - when he was 21 he listed his only foreign travel as a vacation trip to scotland - kerry attended a swiss boarding school and when he receives envoys from paris in washington , he chats with them in fluent french .
his wife , teresa heinz kerry , was born in mozambique , studied in south africa and switzerland and is fluent in five languages herself . " bush has managed to offend everybody , " said ruth oldenziel , an american history professor at the university of amsterdam , in an interview with dutch radio .

kerry says if elected he 'll change u.s. foreign policy and renew frayed alliances . kerry 's coast-to-coast victories in the super tuesday primaries and caucuses means the 60-year-old democratic senator from massachusetts will be george w. bush 's opponent in the november election .

almost two years after a school massacre killed 16 people , one of the victims ' partners has taken state authorities to court for not having done enough to save lives .
it 's reopened questions underlying the tragedy . on april 26 , 2002 , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser gunned down 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman within minutes at his former high school in the eastern german town of erfurt .
he then shot himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police at the erfurt high school shooting the bloodbath stunned the nation and left a stain on the sleepy german town in the state of thuringia .
a national debate broke out on the link between vicious computer games , which steinhäuser was addicted to , and increasing violence among teenagers .
at the time , critical voices were also raised about the role of the local police and whether they had done enough to save victims ' lives . now , almost two years later , erfurt lawyer eric langer , who lost his partner , an art teacher , during the massacre , is ensuring that the same questions are kept alive .
langer filed a case against the state of thuringia this week , accusing those responsible for the police action on the day of the shoot-out , of acting too late or irresponsibly in five cases .
langer , who has carried out his own research into the incident and personally spoken to about 70 witnesses , believes that three teachers and two students died only one to two hours after they were fatally injured by steinhäuser .
though there is no way of knowing if they could have been saved , langer says it 's incomprehensible that no attempt was made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lawyer has also accused the various emergency services of disastrous coordination efforts .
" each emergency service waited for the next one with the result that the entire deployment was paralysed , " langer told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . langer also described the entire operation as " entirely chaotic , " with several students and police officers not even aware that paramedics had been allowed to enter the school building .
langer 's own partner , birgit dettke , is said to have laid crying in vain for help for almost an hour and a half in the schoolyard , just meters away from policemen . no mention of police failures a 43-page investigative report compiled by thuringia 's interior ministry two months after the massacre , however , assumed that , " all victims would have had no chance of survival even if they had undergone an immediate emergency operation . "
langer has slammed the report for ignoring the alleged failures of the police operation . nor had the report , which was originally meant to be just an interim assessment , been pursued further .
it was only in january this year that thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , commissioned his justice minister to open a detailed probe into the massacre after facing pressure from an opposition political parties and langer 's threat to take the matter to the court . bodo ramelow of the party of democratic socialism is also pushing the government to implement a tighter weapons law than the existing one , introduce school reforms and make more provisions for traumatized victims . book on massacre causes controversy the issue has been lent urgency with the publication of the controversial part-fiction book " das reicht für heute " -lrb- that 's enough for today -rrb- by german author ines geipel .
geipel , who wrote the story through the perspective of a fictitious former student , has accused the police of inaction and criticized efforts by the thuringia government to bury fundamental debates and questions that sprung up in the aftermath of the shooting . geipel , however , has been publicly slammed by both teachers and students from the high school where the massacre took place as a sensation-seeker .

it 's reopened questions underlying the tragedy . on april 26 , 2002 , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser gunned down 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman within minutes at his former high school in the eastern german town of erfurt .
he then shot himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police at the erfurt high school shooting the bloodbath stunned the nation and left a stain on the sleepy german town in the state of thuringia .
a national debate broke out on the link between vicious computer games , which steinhäuser was addicted to , and increasing violence among teenagers .
at the time , critical voices were also raised about the role of the local police and whether they had done enough to save victims ' lives . now , almost two years later , erfurt lawyer eric langer , who lost his partner , an art teacher , during the massacre , is ensuring that the same questions are kept alive .
langer filed a case against the state of thuringia this week , accusing those responsible for the police action on the day of the shoot-out , of acting too late or irresponsibly in five cases .
langer , who has carried out his own research into the incident and personally spoken to about 70 witnesses , believes that three teachers and two students died only one to two hours after they were fatally injured by steinhäuser .
though there is no way of knowing if they could have been saved , langer says it 's incomprehensible that no attempt was made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lawyer has also accused the various emergency services of disastrous coordination efforts .
" each emergency service waited for the next one with the result that the entire deployment was paralysed , " langer told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . langer also described the entire operation as " entirely chaotic , " with several students and police officers not even aware that paramedics had been allowed to enter the school building .
langer 's own partner , birgit dettke , is said to have laid crying in vain for help for almost an hour and a half in the schoolyard , just meters away from policemen . no mention of police failures a 43-page investigative report compiled by thuringia 's interior ministry two months after the massacre , however , assumed that , " all victims would have had no chance of survival even if they had undergone an immediate emergency operation . "
langer has slammed the report for ignoring the alleged failures of the police operation . nor had the report , which was originally meant to be just an interim assessment , been pursued further .
it was only in january this year that thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , commissioned his justice minister to open a detailed probe into the massacre after facing pressure from an opposition political parties and langer 's threat to take the matter to the court . bodo ramelow of the party of democratic socialism is also pushing the government to implement a tighter weapons law than the existing one , introduce school reforms and make more provisions for traumatized victims . book on massacre causes controversy the issue has been lent urgency with the publication of the controversial part-fiction book " das reicht für heute " -lrb- that 's enough for today -rrb- by german author ines geipel .
geipel , who wrote the story through the perspective of a fictitious former student , has accused the police of inaction and criticized efforts by the thuringia government to bury fundamental debates and questions that sprung up in the aftermath of the shooting . geipel , however , has been publicly slammed by both teachers and students from the high school where the massacre took place as a sensation-seeker .

"
now that john kerry has locked up the democratic nomination , the next stage begins in his fight against george w. bush .
kerry says if elected he 'll change u.s. foreign policy and renew frayed alliances . kerry 's coast-to-coast victories in the super tuesday primaries and caucuses means the 60-year-old democratic senator from massachusetts will be george w. bush 's opponent in the november election .
but even before cementing the nomination , kerry has been laying out a vision of international affairs that lies in stark contrast to the one pursued by president bush and which europeans and much of the world will probably find more to their liking . while the bush campaign will focus on the danger of terrorism and the president 's role as commander-in-chief during the election fight , kerry seems determined not to let the republicans gain the advantage on security and international affairs .
he has been relentless in his criticism of white house foreign policy . " the bush administration has run the most inept , reckless , arrogant and ideological foreign policy in the modern history of our country , " kerry often says on the stump . kerry has continued to paint a bleak picture of bush 's foreign policy and his approach to terrorism in his speeches in recent weeks and says he would take a radically different approach to fighting the danger of terrorism and ensuring america 's security . " no matter how much power we have , we can not prevail single-handedly , " he has said .
" we have to work with the international community to define a global strategy that is inclusive , not exclusive , collective and not imperial . " rebuilding bridges kerry says he would break with several tenets of the bush administration , which he accuses of abandoning belief in collective security , respect for international institutions , international law and multilateral engagement . kerry promises a " new era of alliances " and says he would make an aggressive effort to rebuild " frayed and shredded " relationships , especially with nato allies .
he says he would call an international summit to draw up a common anti-terrorism and security agenda and pledges to return to the use of diplomacy as a tool for foreign policy and treat the un as a " full partner . " " we will renew our alliances and we will build new alliances because they are essential to the final victory and success of a war on terror , " he told supporters in one speech . a kerry administration would reengage the u.s. in the fight against global warming , the candidate has said , in sharp contrast to the bush white house , which turned its back on the kyoto protocol on climate change three years ago . putting the stress on dialog bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john kerry in 1969 with members of his crew aboard pcf-31 in the mekong delta during the war in vietnam .
kerry , who is a both a vietnam veteran and former anti-war protester and worked toward normalization of ties with hanoi , says he understands the importance of dialog and diplomacy and the dangers of bullying with a big stick . he says once in office , he will put the united nations in charge of rebuilding iraq and establish a " reasonable plan and specific timetable " for restoring self-government and not engage in a rush to hand back power . in a speech last friday in los angeles , kerry vowed that if elected , he will revamp u.s. intelligence agencies and begin diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing islamic youth from embracing radicalism . ties to europe kerry 's vision of his administration 's foreign policy have been greeted with enthusiasm from many in europe , where anti-bush sentiment is high .
the bush administration has alienated many of its closest allies , particularly france and germany , over the iraq war and its dismissive attitude toward the " old world . "
though bush and chancellor gerhard schröder recently met at the white house and publicly put their differences over iraq behind them , relations between them can not be described as close . while bush has had limited foreign travel experience - when he was 21 he listed his only foreign travel as a vacation trip to scotland - kerry attended a swiss boarding school and when he receives envoys from paris in washington , he chats with them in fluent french .
his wife , teresa heinz kerry , was born in mozambique , studied in south africa and switzerland and is fluent in five languages herself . " bush has managed to offend everybody , " said ruth oldenziel , an american history professor at the university of amsterdam , in an interview with dutch radio .

new line cinema has acquired the film rights to best-selling german children 's author cornelia funke 's fantasy novel " inkheart . "
it 's an unprecedented success for a german writer . many writers dream that one day they 'll hit the hollywood jackpot , with movie moguls slugging it out to see which top studio snags the rights to the big-screen version of their book .
britain 's j.k.rowling did it with her famous " harry potter " series , but german writers generally do n't make much of a splash in tinseltown .
that may be changing , thanks to the hamburg-based writer cornelia funke . in recent months the 44-year-old mother of two has found herself in the middle of a frantic tussle between heyday films and new line cinema , both desperate to secure movie rights to her book " inkheart . "
new line cinema has won and has signed her up for a three-movie deal - similar to the hugely successful harry potter series produced by heyday films - which will also cover the subsequent two volumes in funke 's planned trilogy .
the second part of the series is due for publication in germany later this year .
in an interview with dw-tv , funke was still reeling from her sudden a-list status , saying " all these famous names were being bandied around … .tom hanks … .brad pitt … the names kept on coming at me , they talked about taking $ 50 million in the first weekend … it was everything you imagine hollywood to be . "
runaway success at home and abroad cornelia funke is germany 's bestselling children 's author after j. k. rowling and r. l. stine .
born in 1958 , she began her career as an illustrator , but soon became bored of the books she was working with and decided to go it alone .
she published her first novel at the age of 28 and now has some 40 titles to her name .
german publisher cecilie dressler verlag has sold some 2.5 million of her books in germany alone , and she 's been translated into around 26 languages .
a slow-burning success at home as well as in far-flung countries such as japan and sweden , she still had to wait a while to be noticed by english-language publishers .
with english-language markets notoriously slow to pick up on foreign fiction , it was n't until 2002 that the prolific author made her debut in the u.k. and the u.s. with " the thief lord , " which fast became a new york times bestseller and scooped several european children 's literature awards .
it 's also the first of funke 's novels to get a movie treatment , with filming set to begin in venice this spring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publishers then wasted no time releasing " inkheart " in late 2003 .
still no .
7 after 20 weeks on the new york times bestseller list , it 's even giving illustrious rival authors such as rowling and lemony snicket a run for their money .
scholastic promptly rushed out funke 's " the princess knight " in february , and is now eagerly awaiting the second part of the inkheart trilogy , " inkblood " , which was recently delivered for english translation and will be published world-wide next year .
following the footsteps of j.k. rowling fêted by the english-language press , funke realized it would n't be long before hollywood came knocking .
fortunately for her , her brand of fantasy fiction seemed to capture the zeitgeist perfectly , and the studios were soon queuing up to get in on the act .
with its " lord of the rings " trilogy down and dusted - and currently basking in oscar glory - , new line in particular was looking around for another fantasy franchise .
" inkheart " is a fast-paced adventure story about a young girl whose father has the power to bring characters from books to life .
when he 's kidnapped by a power-hungry villain from a rare children 's fable , his daughter gets together with a group of friends both real and imagined to set things right .
in an interview with the guardian last october , funke stressed that she would be signing with the studio most likely to give her creative control .
" what for me is most important , and what disturbs especially the americans , is that i do n't talk about money , " she said .
" i could do a bidding war , but i do n't want to , because the only thing that interests me is creative control , and they do n't like that . "
however , now that funke has clinched the deal , she seems to be content that the studio " will stay true to my book .

new line cinema has acquired the film rights to best-selling german children 's author cornelia funke 's fantasy novel " inkheart . "
it 's an unprecedented success for a german writer . many writers dream that one day they 'll hit the hollywood jackpot , with movie moguls slugging it out to see which top studio snags the rights to the big-screen version of their book .
britain 's j.k.rowling did it with her famous " harry potter " series , but german writers generally do n't make much of a splash in tinseltown .
that may be changing , thanks to the hamburg-based writer cornelia funke . in recent months the 44-year-old mother of two has found herself in the middle of a frantic tussle between heyday films and new line cinema , both desperate to secure movie rights to her book " inkheart . "
new line cinema has won and has signed her up for a three-movie deal - similar to the hugely successful harry potter series produced by heyday films - which will also cover the subsequent two volumes in funke 's planned trilogy .
the second part of the series is due for publication in germany later this year .
in an interview with dw-tv , funke was still reeling from her sudden a-list status , saying " all these famous names were being bandied around … .tom hanks … .brad pitt … the names kept on coming at me , they talked about taking $ 50 million in the first weekend … it was everything you imagine hollywood to be . "
runaway success at home and abroad cornelia funke is germany 's bestselling children 's author after j. k. rowling and r. l. stine .
born in 1958 , she began her career as an illustrator , but soon became bored of the books she was working with and decided to go it alone .
she published her first novel at the age of 28 and now has some 40 titles to her name .
german publisher cecilie dressler verlag has sold some 2.5 million of her books in germany alone , and she 's been translated into around 26 languages .
a slow-burning success at home as well as in far-flung countries such as japan and sweden , she still had to wait a while to be noticed by english-language publishers .
with english-language markets notoriously slow to pick up on foreign fiction , it was n't until 2002 that the prolific author made her debut in the u.k. and the u.s. with " the thief lord , " which fast became a new york times bestseller and scooped several european children 's literature awards .
it 's also the first of funke 's novels to get a movie treatment , with filming set to begin in venice this spring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publishers then wasted no time releasing " inkheart " in late 2003 .
still no .
7 after 20 weeks on the new york times bestseller list , it 's even giving illustrious rival authors such as rowling and lemony snicket a run for their money .
scholastic promptly rushed out funke 's " the princess knight " in february , and is now eagerly awaiting the second part of the inkheart trilogy , " inkblood " , which was recently delivered for english translation and will be published world-wide next year .
following the footsteps of j.k. rowling fêted by the english-language press , funke realized it would n't be long before hollywood came knocking .
fortunately for her , her brand of fantasy fiction seemed to capture the zeitgeist perfectly , and the studios were soon queuing up to get in on the act .
with its " lord of the rings " trilogy down and dusted - and currently basking in oscar glory - , new line in particular was looking around for another fantasy franchise .
" inkheart " is a fast-paced adventure story about a young girl whose father has the power to bring characters from books to life .
when he 's kidnapped by a power-hungry villain from a rare children 's fable , his daughter gets together with a group of friends both real and imagined to set things right .
in an interview with the guardian last october , funke stressed that she would be signing with the studio most likely to give her creative control .
" what for me is most important , and what disturbs especially the americans , is that i do n't talk about money , " she said .
" i could do a bidding war , but i do n't want to , because the only thing that interests me is creative control , and they do n't like that . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.03.2004 kerry promises a kinder , gentler foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry wants to see a " new era of alliances . "
now that john kerry has locked up the democratic nomination , the next stage begins in his fight against george w. bush .
kerry says if elected he 'll change u.s. foreign policy and renew frayed alliances . kerry 's coast-to-coast victories in the super tuesday primaries and caucuses means the 60-year-old democratic senator from massachusetts will be george w. bush 's opponent in the november election .
but even before cementing the nomination , kerry has been laying out a vision of international affairs that lies in stark contrast to the one pursued by president bush and which europeans and much of the world will probably find more to their liking . while the bush campaign will focus on the danger of terrorism and the president 's role as commander-in-chief during the election fight , kerry seems determined not to let the republicans gain the advantage on security and international affairs .
he has been relentless in his criticism of white house foreign policy . " the bush administration has run the most inept , reckless , arrogant and ideological foreign policy in the modern history of our country , " kerry often says on the stump . kerry has continued to paint a bleak picture of bush 's foreign policy and his approach to terrorism in his speeches in recent weeks and says he would take a radically different approach to fighting the danger of terrorism and ensuring america 's security . " no matter how much power we have , we can not prevail single-handedly , " he has said .
" we have to work with the international community to define a global strategy that is inclusive , not exclusive , collective and not imperial . " rebuilding bridges kerry says he would break with several tenets of the bush administration , which he accuses of abandoning belief in collective security , respect for international institutions , international law and multilateral engagement . kerry promises a " new era of alliances " and says he would make an aggressive effort to rebuild " frayed and shredded " relationships , especially with nato allies .
he says he would call an international summit to draw up a common anti-terrorism and security agenda and pledges to return to the use of diplomacy as a tool for foreign policy and treat the un as a " full partner . " " we will renew our alliances and we will build new alliances because they are essential to the final victory and success of a war on terror , " he told supporters in one speech . a kerry administration would reengage the u.s. in the fight against global warming , the candidate has said , in sharp contrast to the bush white house , which turned its back on the kyoto protocol on climate change three years ago . putting the stress on dialog bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john kerry in 1969 with members of his crew aboard pcf-31 in the mekong delta during the war in vietnam .
kerry , who is a both a vietnam veteran and former anti-war protester and worked toward normalization of ties with hanoi , says he understands the importance of dialog and diplomacy and the dangers of bullying with a big stick . he says once in office , he will put the united nations in charge of rebuilding iraq and establish a " reasonable plan and specific timetable " for restoring self-government and not engage in a rush to hand back power . in a speech last friday in los angeles , kerry vowed that if elected , he will revamp u.s. intelligence agencies and begin diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing islamic youth from embracing radicalism . ties to europe kerry 's vision of his administration 's foreign policy have been greeted with enthusiasm from many in europe , where anti-bush sentiment is high .
the bush administration has alienated many of its closest allies , particularly france and germany , over the iraq war and its dismissive attitude toward the " old world . "
though bush and chancellor gerhard schröder recently met at the white house and publicly put their differences over iraq behind them , relations between them can not be described as close . while bush has had limited foreign travel experience - when he was 21 he listed his only foreign travel as a vacation trip to scotland - kerry attended a swiss boarding school and when he receives envoys from paris in washington , he chats with them in fluent french .
his wife , teresa heinz kerry , was born in mozambique , studied in south africa and switzerland and is fluent in five languages herself . " bush has managed to offend everybody , " said ruth oldenziel , an american history professor at the university of amsterdam , in an interview with dutch radio .
" kerry is well travelled , he has been to vietnam , he 's very well read , he has a sense of belonging , and has a background in europe , so i think to europeans he 's going to be a welcome change .

"
now that john kerry has locked up the democratic nomination , the next stage begins in his fight against george w. bush .
kerry says if elected he 'll change u.s. foreign policy and renew frayed alliances . kerry 's coast-to-coast victories in the super tuesday primaries and caucuses means the 60-year-old democratic senator from massachusetts will be george w. bush 's opponent in the november election .
but even before cementing the nomination , kerry has been laying out a vision of international affairs that lies in stark contrast to the one pursued by president bush and which europeans and much of the world will probably find more to their liking . while the bush campaign will focus on the danger of terrorism and the president 's role as commander-in-chief during the election fight , kerry seems determined not to let the republicans gain the advantage on security and international affairs .
he has been relentless in his criticism of white house foreign policy . " the bush administration has run the most inept , reckless , arrogant and ideological foreign policy in the modern history of our country , " kerry often says on the stump . kerry has continued to paint a bleak picture of bush 's foreign policy and his approach to terrorism in his speeches in recent weeks and says he would take a radically different approach to fighting the danger of terrorism and ensuring america 's security . " no matter how much power we have , we can not prevail single-handedly , " he has said .
" we have to work with the international community to define a global strategy that is inclusive , not exclusive , collective and not imperial . " rebuilding bridges kerry says he would break with several tenets of the bush administration , which he accuses of abandoning belief in collective security , respect for international institutions , international law and multilateral engagement . kerry promises a " new era of alliances " and says he would make an aggressive effort to rebuild " frayed and shredded " relationships , especially with nato allies .
he says he would call an international summit to draw up a common anti-terrorism and security agenda and pledges to return to the use of diplomacy as a tool for foreign policy and treat the un as a " full partner . " " we will renew our alliances and we will build new alliances because they are essential to the final victory and success of a war on terror , " he told supporters in one speech . a kerry administration would reengage the u.s. in the fight against global warming , the candidate has said , in sharp contrast to the bush white house , which turned its back on the kyoto protocol on climate change three years ago . putting the stress on dialog bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john kerry in 1969 with members of his crew aboard pcf-31 in the mekong delta during the war in vietnam .
kerry , who is a both a vietnam veteran and former anti-war protester and worked toward normalization of ties with hanoi , says he understands the importance of dialog and diplomacy and the dangers of bullying with a big stick . he says once in office , he will put the united nations in charge of rebuilding iraq and establish a " reasonable plan and specific timetable " for restoring self-government and not engage in a rush to hand back power . in a speech last friday in los angeles , kerry vowed that if elected , he will revamp u.s. intelligence agencies and begin diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing islamic youth from embracing radicalism . ties to europe kerry 's vision of his administration 's foreign policy have been greeted with enthusiasm from many in europe , where anti-bush sentiment is high .
the bush administration has alienated many of its closest allies , particularly france and germany , over the iraq war and its dismissive attitude toward the " old world . "
though bush and chancellor gerhard schröder recently met at the white house and publicly put their differences over iraq behind them , relations between them can not be described as close . while bush has had limited foreign travel experience - when he was 21 he listed his only foreign travel as a vacation trip to scotland - kerry attended a swiss boarding school and when he receives envoys from paris in washington , he chats with them in fluent french .
his wife , teresa heinz kerry , was born in mozambique , studied in south africa and switzerland and is fluent in five languages herself . " bush has managed to offend everybody , " said ruth oldenziel , an american history professor at the university of amsterdam , in an interview with dutch radio .
" kerry is well travelled , he has been to vietnam , he 's very well read , he has a sense of belonging , and has a background in europe , so i think to europeans he 's going to be a welcome change .

almost two years after a school massacre killed 16 people , one of the victims ' partners has taken state authorities to court for not having done enough to save lives .
it 's reopened questions underlying the tragedy . on april 26 , 2002 , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser gunned down 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman within minutes at his former high school in the eastern german town of erfurt .
he then shot himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police at the erfurt high school shooting the bloodbath stunned the nation and left a stain on the sleepy german town in the state of thuringia .
a national debate broke out on the link between vicious computer games , which steinhäuser was addicted to , and increasing violence among teenagers .
at the time , critical voices were also raised about the role of the local police and whether they had done enough to save victims ' lives . now , almost two years later , erfurt lawyer eric langer , who lost his partner , an art teacher , during the massacre , is ensuring that the same questions are kept alive .
langer filed a case against the state of thuringia this week , accusing those responsible for the police action on the day of the shoot-out , of acting too late or irresponsibly in five cases .
langer , who has carried out his own research into the incident and personally spoken to about 70 witnesses , believes that three teachers and two students died only one to two hours after they were fatally injured by steinhäuser .
though there is no way of knowing if they could have been saved , langer says it 's incomprehensible that no attempt was made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lawyer has also accused the various emergency services of disastrous coordination efforts .
" each emergency service waited for the next one with the result that the entire deployment was paralysed , " langer told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . langer also described the entire operation as " entirely chaotic , " with several students and police officers not even aware that paramedics had been allowed to enter the school building .
langer 's own partner , birgit dettke , is said to have laid crying in vain for help for almost an hour and a half in the schoolyard , just meters away from policemen . no mention of police failures a 43-page investigative report compiled by thuringia 's interior ministry two months after the massacre , however , assumed that , " all victims would have had no chance of survival even if they had undergone an immediate emergency operation . "
langer has slammed the report for ignoring the alleged failures of the police operation . nor had the report , which was originally meant to be just an interim assessment , been pursued further .
it was only in january this year that thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , commissioned his justice minister to open a detailed probe into the massacre after facing pressure from an opposition political parties and langer 's threat to take the matter to the court . bodo ramelow of the party of democratic socialism is also pushing the government to implement a tighter weapons law than the existing one , introduce school reforms and make more provisions for traumatized victims . book on massacre causes controversy the issue has been lent urgency with the publication of the controversial part-fiction book " das reicht für heute " -lrb- that 's enough for today -rrb- by german author ines geipel .
geipel , who wrote the story through the perspective of a fictitious former student , has accused the police of inaction and criticized efforts by the thuringia government to bury fundamental debates and questions that sprung up in the aftermath of the shooting . geipel , however , has been publicly slammed by both teachers and students from the high school where the massacre took place as a sensation-seeker .

new line cinema has acquired the film rights to best-selling german children 's author cornelia funke 's fantasy novel " inkheart . "
it 's an unprecedented success for a german writer . many writers dream that one day they 'll hit the hollywood jackpot , with movie moguls slugging it out to see which top studio snags the rights to the big-screen version of their book .
britain 's j.k.rowling did it with her famous " harry potter " series , but german writers generally do n't make much of a splash in tinseltown .
that may be changing , thanks to the hamburg-based writer cornelia funke . in recent months the 44-year-old mother of two has found herself in the middle of a frantic tussle between heyday films and new line cinema , both desperate to secure movie rights to her book " inkheart . "
new line cinema has won and has signed her up for a three-movie deal - similar to the hugely successful harry potter series produced by heyday films - which will also cover the subsequent two volumes in funke 's planned trilogy .
the second part of the series is due for publication in germany later this year .
in an interview with dw-tv , funke was still reeling from her sudden a-list status , saying " all these famous names were being bandied around … .tom hanks … .brad pitt … the names kept on coming at me , they talked about taking $ 50 million in the first weekend … it was everything you imagine hollywood to be . "
runaway success at home and abroad cornelia funke is germany 's bestselling children 's author after j. k. rowling and r. l. stine .
born in 1958 , she began her career as an illustrator , but soon became bored of the books she was working with and decided to go it alone .
she published her first novel at the age of 28 and now has some 40 titles to her name .
german publisher cecilie dressler verlag has sold some 2.5 million of her books in germany alone , and she 's been translated into around 26 languages .
a slow-burning success at home as well as in far-flung countries such as japan and sweden , she still had to wait a while to be noticed by english-language publishers .
with english-language markets notoriously slow to pick up on foreign fiction , it was n't until 2002 that the prolific author made her debut in the u.k. and the u.s. with " the thief lord , " which fast became a new york times bestseller and scooped several european children 's literature awards .
it 's also the first of funke 's novels to get a movie treatment , with filming set to begin in venice this spring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publishers then wasted no time releasing " inkheart " in late 2003 .
still no .
7 after 20 weeks on the new york times bestseller list , it 's even giving illustrious rival authors such as rowling and lemony snicket a run for their money .
scholastic promptly rushed out funke 's " the princess knight " in february , and is now eagerly awaiting the second part of the inkheart trilogy , " inkblood " , which was recently delivered for english translation and will be published world-wide next year .
following the footsteps of j.k. rowling fêted by the english-language press , funke realized it would n't be long before hollywood came knocking .
fortunately for her , her brand of fantasy fiction seemed to capture the zeitgeist perfectly , and the studios were soon queuing up to get in on the act .
with its " lord of the rings " trilogy down and dusted - and currently basking in oscar glory - , new line in particular was looking around for another fantasy franchise .
" inkheart " is a fast-paced adventure story about a young girl whose father has the power to bring characters from books to life .
when he 's kidnapped by a power-hungry villain from a rare children 's fable , his daughter gets together with a group of friends both real and imagined to set things right .
in an interview with the guardian last october , funke stressed that she would be signing with the studio most likely to give her creative control .
" what for me is most important , and what disturbs especially the americans , is that i do n't talk about money , " she said .
" i could do a bidding war , but i do n't want to , because the only thing that interests me is creative control , and they do n't like that . "
however , now that funke has clinched the deal , she seems to be content that the studio " will stay true to my book .

almost two years after a school massacre killed 16 people , one of the victims ' partners has taken state authorities to court for not having done enough to save lives .
it 's reopened questions underlying the tragedy . on april 26 , 2002 , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser gunned down 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman within minutes at his former high school in the eastern german town of erfurt .
he then shot himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police at the erfurt high school shooting the bloodbath stunned the nation and left a stain on the sleepy german town in the state of thuringia .
a national debate broke out on the link between vicious computer games , which steinhäuser was addicted to , and increasing violence among teenagers .
at the time , critical voices were also raised about the role of the local police and whether they had done enough to save victims ' lives . now , almost two years later , erfurt lawyer eric langer , who lost his partner , an art teacher , during the massacre , is ensuring that the same questions are kept alive .
langer filed a case against the state of thuringia this week , accusing those responsible for the police action on the day of the shoot-out , of acting too late or irresponsibly in five cases .
langer , who has carried out his own research into the incident and personally spoken to about 70 witnesses , believes that three teachers and two students died only one to two hours after they were fatally injured by steinhäuser .
though there is no way of knowing if they could have been saved , langer says it 's incomprehensible that no attempt was made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lawyer has also accused the various emergency services of disastrous coordination efforts .
" each emergency service waited for the next one with the result that the entire deployment was paralysed , " langer told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . langer also described the entire operation as " entirely chaotic , " with several students and police officers not even aware that paramedics had been allowed to enter the school building .
langer 's own partner , birgit dettke , is said to have laid crying in vain for help for almost an hour and a half in the schoolyard , just meters away from policemen . no mention of police failures a 43-page investigative report compiled by thuringia 's interior ministry two months after the massacre , however , assumed that , " all victims would have had no chance of survival even if they had undergone an immediate emergency operation . "
langer has slammed the report for ignoring the alleged failures of the police operation . nor had the report , which was originally meant to be just an interim assessment , been pursued further .
it was only in january this year that thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , commissioned his justice minister to open a detailed probe into the massacre after facing pressure from an opposition political parties and langer 's threat to take the matter to the court . bodo ramelow of the party of democratic socialism is also pushing the government to implement a tighter weapons law than the existing one , introduce school reforms and make more provisions for traumatized victims . book on massacre causes controversy the issue has been lent urgency with the publication of the controversial part-fiction book " das reicht für heute " -lrb- that 's enough for today -rrb- by german author ines geipel .
geipel , who wrote the story through the perspective of a fictitious former student , has accused the police of inaction and criticized efforts by the thuringia government to bury fundamental debates and questions that sprung up in the aftermath of the shooting . geipel , however , has been publicly slammed by both teachers and students from the high school where the massacre took place as a sensation-seeker .

the largest price disparity concerns the vw passat , which is 39 percent more expensive in germany than in greece .
" after the addition of value-added tax , a german consumer who buys his passat in greece can save € 5,700 -lrb- $ 6,975 -rrb- , " the paper on pre-tax tax prices of the most-sold car models said .
within the eu , car prices are lowest in denmark , finland and greece .
the european commission has concluded that pre-tax prices of cars within the eu are gradually reaching uniform levels .
the body expects the trend to accelerate when , from october 2005 , eu car dealers will be allowed to open showrooms throughout the bloc , not just in their home countries .
currently manufacturers define dealers ' sales territories , which , for example , prevents athens ' dealers from selling passats in berlin and offering germans greek prices . more briefs 03.03.2004 -pipe- eu expansion benefits german economy 03.03.2004 -pipe- growth in german service industry slows 03.03.2004 -pipe- deutsche bahn on selling spree 02.03.2004 -pipe- sale of state savings bank put on hold 02.03.2004 -pipe- hsbc not interested in buying german bank 02.03.2004 -pipe- german retail sales bounce back 02.03.2004 -pipe- mcdonald 's germany to focus on healthy fare 01.03.2004 -pipe- subway takes on fast-food kings in germany radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

almost two years after a school massacre killed 16 people , one of the victims ' partners has taken state authorities to court for not having done enough to save lives .
it 's reopened questions underlying the tragedy . on april 26 , 2002 , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser gunned down 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman within minutes at his former high school in the eastern german town of erfurt .
he then shot himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police at the erfurt high school shooting the bloodbath stunned the nation and left a stain on the sleepy german town in the state of thuringia .
a national debate broke out on the link between vicious computer games , which steinhäuser was addicted to , and increasing violence among teenagers .
at the time , critical voices were also raised about the role of the local police and whether they had done enough to save victims ' lives . now , almost two years later , erfurt lawyer eric langer , who lost his partner , an art teacher , during the massacre , is ensuring that the same questions are kept alive .
langer filed a case against the state of thuringia this week , accusing those responsible for the police action on the day of the shoot-out , of acting too late or irresponsibly in five cases .
langer , who has carried out his own research into the incident and personally spoken to about 70 witnesses , believes that three teachers and two students died only one to two hours after they were fatally injured by steinhäuser .
though there is no way of knowing if they could have been saved , langer says it 's incomprehensible that no attempt was made .

" each emergency service waited for the next one with the result that the entire deployment was paralysed , " langer told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . langer also described the entire operation as " entirely chaotic , " with several students and police officers not even aware that paramedics had been allowed to enter the school building .
langer 's own partner , birgit dettke , is said to have laid crying in vain for help for almost an hour and a half in the schoolyard , just meters away from policemen . no mention of police failures a 43-page investigative report compiled by thuringia 's interior ministry two months after the massacre , however , assumed that , " all victims would have had no chance of survival even if they had undergone an immediate emergency operation . "
langer has slammed the report for ignoring the alleged failures of the police operation . nor had the report , which was originally meant to be just an interim assessment , been pursued further .

almost two years after a school massacre killed 16 people , one of the victims ' partners has taken state authorities to court for not having done enough to save lives .
it 's reopened questions underlying the tragedy . on april 26 , 2002 , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser gunned down 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman within minutes at his former high school in the eastern german town of erfurt .
he then shot himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police at the erfurt high school shooting the bloodbath stunned the nation and left a stain on the sleepy german town in the state of thuringia .
a national debate broke out on the link between vicious computer games , which steinhäuser was addicted to , and increasing violence among teenagers .
at the time , critical voices were also raised about the role of the local police and whether they had done enough to save victims ' lives . now , almost two years later , erfurt lawyer eric langer , who lost his partner , an art teacher , during the massacre , is ensuring that the same questions are kept alive .
langer filed a case against the state of thuringia this week , accusing those responsible for the police action on the day of the shoot-out , of acting too late or irresponsibly in five cases .
langer , who has carried out his own research into the incident and personally spoken to about 70 witnesses , believes that three teachers and two students died only one to two hours after they were fatally injured by steinhäuser .
though there is no way of knowing if they could have been saved , langer says it 's incomprehensible that no attempt was made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lawyer has also accused the various emergency services of disastrous coordination efforts .
" each emergency service waited for the next one with the result that the entire deployment was paralysed , " langer told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . langer also described the entire operation as " entirely chaotic , " with several students and police officers not even aware that paramedics had been allowed to enter the school building .
langer 's own partner , birgit dettke , is said to have laid crying in vain for help for almost an hour and a half in the schoolyard , just meters away from policemen . no mention of police failures a 43-page investigative report compiled by thuringia 's interior ministry two months after the massacre , however , assumed that , " all victims would have had no chance of survival even if they had undergone an immediate emergency operation . "
langer has slammed the report for ignoring the alleged failures of the police operation . nor had the report , which was originally meant to be just an interim assessment , been pursued further .
it was only in january this year that thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , commissioned his justice minister to open a detailed probe into the massacre after facing pressure from an opposition political parties and langer 's threat to take the matter to the court . bodo ramelow of the party of democratic socialism is also pushing the government to implement a tighter weapons law than the existing one , introduce school reforms and make more provisions for traumatized victims . book on massacre causes controversy the issue has been lent urgency with the publication of the controversial part-fiction book " das reicht für heute " -lrb- that 's enough for today -rrb- by german author ines geipel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.03.2004 hollywood snaps up rights to german children 's book großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia funke is germany 's most celebrated children 's writer , and she 's hot property in hollywood too .
new line cinema has acquired the film rights to best-selling german children 's author cornelia funke 's fantasy novel " inkheart . "
it 's an unprecedented success for a german writer . many writers dream that one day they 'll hit the hollywood jackpot , with movie moguls slugging it out to see which top studio snags the rights to the big-screen version of their book .
britain 's j.k.rowling did it with her famous " harry potter " series , but german writers generally do n't make much of a splash in tinseltown .
that may be changing , thanks to the hamburg-based writer cornelia funke . in recent months the 44-year-old mother of two has found herself in the middle of a frantic tussle between heyday films and new line cinema , both desperate to secure movie rights to her book " inkheart . "
new line cinema has won and has signed her up for a three-movie deal - similar to the hugely successful harry potter series produced by heyday films - which will also cover the subsequent two volumes in funke 's planned trilogy .
the second part of the series is due for publication in germany later this year .
in an interview with dw-tv , funke was still reeling from her sudden a-list status , saying " all these famous names were being bandied around … .tom hanks … .brad pitt … the names kept on coming at me , they talked about taking $ 50 million in the first weekend … it was everything you imagine hollywood to be . "
runaway success at home and abroad cornelia funke is germany 's bestselling children 's author after j. k. rowling and r. l. stine .
born in 1958 , she began her career as an illustrator , but soon became bored of the books she was working with and decided to go it alone .
she published her first novel at the age of 28 and now has some 40 titles to her name .
german publisher cecilie dressler verlag has sold some 2.5 million of her books in germany alone , and she 's been translated into around 26 languages .
a slow-burning success at home as well as in far-flung countries such as japan and sweden , she still had to wait a while to be noticed by english-language publishers .
with english-language markets notoriously slow to pick up on foreign fiction , it was n't until 2002 that the prolific author made her debut in the u.k. and the u.s. with " the thief lord , " which fast became a new york times bestseller and scooped several european children 's literature awards .
it 's also the first of funke 's novels to get a movie treatment , with filming set to begin in venice this spring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publishers then wasted no time releasing " inkheart " in late 2003 .
still no .
7 after 20 weeks on the new york times bestseller list , it 's even giving illustrious rival authors such as rowling and lemony snicket a run for their money .

new line cinema has acquired the film rights to best-selling german children 's author cornelia funke 's fantasy novel " inkheart . "
it 's an unprecedented success for a german writer . many writers dream that one day they 'll hit the hollywood jackpot , with movie moguls slugging it out to see which top studio snags the rights to the big-screen version of their book .
britain 's j.k.rowling did it with her famous " harry potter " series , but german writers generally do n't make much of a splash in tinseltown .
that may be changing , thanks to the hamburg-based writer cornelia funke . in recent months the 44-year-old mother of two has found herself in the middle of a frantic tussle between heyday films and new line cinema , both desperate to secure movie rights to her book " inkheart . "
new line cinema has won and has signed her up for a three-movie deal - similar to the hugely successful harry potter series produced by heyday films - which will also cover the subsequent two volumes in funke 's planned trilogy .
the second part of the series is due for publication in germany later this year .
in an interview with dw-tv , funke was still reeling from her sudden a-list status , saying " all these famous names were being bandied around … .tom hanks … .brad pitt … the names kept on coming at me , they talked about taking $ 50 million in the first weekend … it was everything you imagine hollywood to be . "
runaway success at home and abroad cornelia funke is germany 's bestselling children 's author after j. k. rowling and r. l. stine .
born in 1958 , she began her career as an illustrator , but soon became bored of the books she was working with and decided to go it alone .
she published her first novel at the age of 28 and now has some 40 titles to her name .
german publisher cecilie dressler verlag has sold some 2.5 million of her books in germany alone , and she 's been translated into around 26 languages .
a slow-burning success at home as well as in far-flung countries such as japan and sweden , she still had to wait a while to be noticed by english-language publishers .
with english-language markets notoriously slow to pick up on foreign fiction , it was n't until 2002 that the prolific author made her debut in the u.k. and the u.s. with " the thief lord , " which fast became a new york times bestseller and scooped several european children 's literature awards .
it 's also the first of funke 's novels to get a movie treatment , with filming set to begin in venice this spring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publishers then wasted no time releasing " inkheart " in late 2003 .

germany 's highest court ruled on wednesday that telephone surveillance as currently practiced is unconstitutional .
it demanded changes in the six-year old law . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe said the current law that allows authorities to eavesdrop on conversations in private homes was unconstitutional and must be rectified by june 2005 . three politicians from germany 's small fdp party had brought the complaint , even though the liberals were part of former chancellor helmut kohl 's government when the law was passed six years ago . aiming to fight organized crime and terrorism , it was highly controversial at the time , because of the country 's history of the nazi police state , and following decades of surveillance by the east german secret police , the stasi . however , fdp politicians sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , gerhart baum und burkhard hirsch opposed the law on the grounds that it violates constitutional privacy guarantees , and that it has n't helped solve any major cases . new rules according to the latest ruling , bugging of phones in private homes should only be allowed in cases where there is a suspicion of a serious offense that could carry a prison sentence of more than five years . up to now , phone surveillance was allowed in the case of offenses that carried lesser sentences . in addition , surveillance must be immediately cut when the conversation is clearly of a private nature , or when people under surveillance are speaking in their homes to close relatives , doctors , priests or defense lawyers who are not themselves suspects . the court 's decision argues that the protecting private homes is part of protecting human dignity , and that only surveillance that protect human dignity should be permitted . " it is not necessarily a violation of human dignity if someone is put under observation , " court justice hans-juergen papier said , according to a report by the associated press .
" but in such cases , the core area of privacy must be safeguarded . " the german government says eavesdropping is used only as a last resort .
overall , authorities plant bugs in homes in about 30 cases a year . dw staff -lrb- jm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.n. spy allegations widen following allegations that the british government had illegally tapped u.n. secretary general kofi annan 's phone in the run up to the iraq war , sources now say chief weapons inspector hans blix 's phone was also bugged .

while men have 6 hours and 11 minutes a day to themselves , women make do with 5 hours and 43 minutes .
there 's also a major gender divide in the way they spend it : women tend to spend their free time socializing ; men prefer to read newspapers or watch television .
the main reason women are busier is that they still take on the bulk of the burden of cooking , cleaning and childcare , the report said .
women also continue to earn less in full-time jobs than their male counterparts .
in 2003 , female staff in industry , manufacturing , trade , credit and insurance sectors earned an average of € 2,602 -lrb- $ 3,159 -rrb- , some 30 percent less than their male colleagues .
the discrepancy is less pronounced in the eastern german states , where better childcare facilities mean women are less likely to take time off .
the east-west gap in salaries is less extreme in the case of casual workers : with an average of € 1,885 a month , women workers in western germany earned almost 25 percent less then men , whereas in eastern germany salaries of casual women workers were just 22 percent below those of their male counterparts . more briefs 01.03.2004 -pipe- suspected leftist terrorist charged in bomb attack on bus 24.02.2004 -pipe- fewer asylum seekers in germany 16.02.2004 -pipe- banned islamic association re-builds in cologne 06.02.2004 -pipe- protesters hold up berlin film fest opening 02.02.2004 -pipe- german help to rebuild iraqi universities 26.01.2004 -pipe- fischer cool on french call to end china weapons embargo 26.01.2004 -pipe- struck says eurocorps ready for afghan mission 26.01.2004 -pipe- porn star hopes for strong election performance radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.03.2004 hollywood snaps up rights to german children 's book großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia funke is germany 's most celebrated children 's writer , and she 's hot property in hollywood too .
new line cinema has acquired the film rights to best-selling german children 's author cornelia funke 's fantasy novel " inkheart . "
it 's an unprecedented success for a german writer . many writers dream that one day they 'll hit the hollywood jackpot , with movie moguls slugging it out to see which top studio snags the rights to the big-screen version of their book .
britain 's j.k.rowling did it with her famous " harry potter " series , but german writers generally do n't make much of a splash in tinseltown .
that may be changing , thanks to the hamburg-based writer cornelia funke . in recent months the 44-year-old mother of two has found herself in the middle of a frantic tussle between heyday films and new line cinema , both desperate to secure movie rights to her book " inkheart . "
new line cinema has won and has signed her up for a three-movie deal - similar to the hugely successful harry potter series produced by heyday films - which will also cover the subsequent two volumes in funke 's planned trilogy .
the second part of the series is due for publication in germany later this year .
in an interview with dw-tv , funke was still reeling from her sudden a-list status , saying " all these famous names were being bandied around … .tom hanks … .brad pitt … the names kept on coming at me , they talked about taking $ 50 million in the first weekend … it was everything you imagine hollywood to be . "
runaway success at home and abroad cornelia funke is germany 's bestselling children 's author after j. k. rowling and r. l. stine .
born in 1958 , she began her career as an illustrator , but soon became bored of the books she was working with and decided to go it alone .
she published her first novel at the age of 28 and now has some 40 titles to her name .
german publisher cecilie dressler verlag has sold some 2.5 million of her books in germany alone , and she 's been translated into around 26 languages .
a slow-burning success at home as well as in far-flung countries such as japan and sweden , she still had to wait a while to be noticed by english-language publishers .
with english-language markets notoriously slow to pick up on foreign fiction , it was n't until 2002 that the prolific author made her debut in the u.k. and the u.s. with " the thief lord , " which fast became a new york times bestseller and scooped several european children 's literature awards .
it 's also the first of funke 's novels to get a movie treatment , with filming set to begin in venice this spring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publishers then wasted no time releasing " inkheart " in late 2003 .
still no .
7 after 20 weeks on the new york times bestseller list , it 's even giving illustrious rival authors such as rowling and lemony snicket a run for their money .
scholastic promptly rushed out funke 's " the princess knight " in february , and is now eagerly awaiting the second part of the inkheart trilogy , " inkblood " , which was recently delivered for english translation and will be published world-wide next year .
following the footsteps of j.k. rowling fêted by the english-language press , funke realized it would n't be long before hollywood came knocking .
fortunately for her , her brand of fantasy fiction seemed to capture the zeitgeist perfectly , and the studios were soon queuing up to get in on the act .
with its " lord of the rings " trilogy down and dusted - and currently basking in oscar glory - , new line in particular was looking around for another fantasy franchise .
" inkheart " is a fast-paced adventure story about a young girl whose father has the power to bring characters from books to life .
when he 's kidnapped by a power-hungry villain from a rare children 's fable , his daughter gets together with a group of friends both real and imagined to set things right .
in an interview with the guardian last october , funke stressed that she would be signing with the studio most likely to give her creative control .
" what for me is most important , and what disturbs especially the americans , is that i do n't talk about money , " she said .

new line cinema has acquired the film rights to best-selling german children 's author cornelia funke 's fantasy novel " inkheart . "
it 's an unprecedented success for a german writer . many writers dream that one day they 'll hit the hollywood jackpot , with movie moguls slugging it out to see which top studio snags the rights to the big-screen version of their book .
britain 's j.k.rowling did it with her famous " harry potter " series , but german writers generally do n't make much of a splash in tinseltown .
that may be changing , thanks to the hamburg-based writer cornelia funke . in recent months the 44-year-old mother of two has found herself in the middle of a frantic tussle between heyday films and new line cinema , both desperate to secure movie rights to her book " inkheart . "
new line cinema has won and has signed her up for a three-movie deal - similar to the hugely successful harry potter series produced by heyday films - which will also cover the subsequent two volumes in funke 's planned trilogy .
the second part of the series is due for publication in germany later this year .
in an interview with dw-tv , funke was still reeling from her sudden a-list status , saying " all these famous names were being bandied around … .tom hanks … .brad pitt … the names kept on coming at me , they talked about taking $ 50 million in the first weekend … it was everything you imagine hollywood to be . "
runaway success at home and abroad cornelia funke is germany 's bestselling children 's author after j. k. rowling and r. l. stine .
born in 1958 , she began her career as an illustrator , but soon became bored of the books she was working with and decided to go it alone .
she published her first novel at the age of 28 and now has some 40 titles to her name .
german publisher cecilie dressler verlag has sold some 2.5 million of her books in germany alone , and she 's been translated into around 26 languages .
a slow-burning success at home as well as in far-flung countries such as japan and sweden , she still had to wait a while to be noticed by english-language publishers .
with english-language markets notoriously slow to pick up on foreign fiction , it was n't until 2002 that the prolific author made her debut in the u.k. and the u.s. with " the thief lord , " which fast became a new york times bestseller and scooped several european children 's literature awards .
it 's also the first of funke 's novels to get a movie treatment , with filming set to begin in venice this spring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publishers then wasted no time releasing " inkheart " in late 2003 .
still no .
7 after 20 weeks on the new york times bestseller list , it 's even giving illustrious rival authors such as rowling and lemony snicket a run for their money .
scholastic promptly rushed out funke 's " the princess knight " in february , and is now eagerly awaiting the second part of the inkheart trilogy , " inkblood " , which was recently delivered for english translation and will be published world-wide next year .
following the footsteps of j.k. rowling fêted by the english-language press , funke realized it would n't be long before hollywood came knocking .
fortunately for her , her brand of fantasy fiction seemed to capture the zeitgeist perfectly , and the studios were soon queuing up to get in on the act .
with its " lord of the rings " trilogy down and dusted - and currently basking in oscar glory - , new line in particular was looking around for another fantasy franchise .
" inkheart " is a fast-paced adventure story about a young girl whose father has the power to bring characters from books to life .
when he 's kidnapped by a power-hungry villain from a rare children 's fable , his daughter gets together with a group of friends both real and imagined to set things right .
in an interview with the guardian last october , funke stressed that she would be signing with the studio most likely to give her creative control .
" what for me is most important , and what disturbs especially the americans , is that i do n't talk about money , " she said .
" i could do a bidding war , but i do n't want to , because the only thing that interests me is creative control , and they do n't like that . "

almost two years after a school massacre killed 16 people , one of the victims ' partners has taken state authorities to court for not having done enough to save lives .
it 's reopened questions underlying the tragedy . on april 26 , 2002 , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser gunned down 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman within minutes at his former high school in the eastern german town of erfurt .
he then shot himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police at the erfurt high school shooting the bloodbath stunned the nation and left a stain on the sleepy german town in the state of thuringia .
a national debate broke out on the link between vicious computer games , which steinhäuser was addicted to , and increasing violence among teenagers .
at the time , critical voices were also raised about the role of the local police and whether they had done enough to save victims ' lives . now , almost two years later , erfurt lawyer eric langer , who lost his partner , an art teacher , during the massacre , is ensuring that the same questions are kept alive .
langer filed a case against the state of thuringia this week , accusing those responsible for the police action on the day of the shoot-out , of acting too late or irresponsibly in five cases .
langer , who has carried out his own research into the incident and personally spoken to about 70 witnesses , believes that three teachers and two students died only one to two hours after they were fatally injured by steinhäuser .
though there is no way of knowing if they could have been saved , langer says it 's incomprehensible that no attempt was made .

langer 's own partner , birgit dettke , is said to have laid crying in vain for help for almost an hour and a half in the schoolyard , just meters away from policemen . no mention of police failures a 43-page investigative report compiled by thuringia 's interior ministry two months after the massacre , however , assumed that , " all victims would have had no chance of survival even if they had undergone an immediate emergency operation . "
langer has slammed the report for ignoring the alleged failures of the police operation . nor had the report , which was originally meant to be just an interim assessment , been pursued further .
it was only in january this year that thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , commissioned his justice minister to open a detailed probe into the massacre after facing pressure from an opposition political parties and langer 's threat to take the matter to the court . bodo ramelow of the party of democratic socialism is also pushing the government to implement a tighter weapons law than the existing one , introduce school reforms and make more provisions for traumatized victims . book on massacre causes controversy the issue has been lent urgency with the publication of the controversial part-fiction book " das reicht für heute " -lrb- that 's enough for today -rrb- by german author ines geipel .
geipel , who wrote the story through the perspective of a fictitious former student , has accused the police of inaction and criticized efforts by the thuringia government to bury fundamental debates and questions that sprung up in the aftermath of the shooting . geipel , however , has been publicly slammed by both teachers and students from the high school where the massacre took place as a sensation-seeker .

he then shot himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police at the erfurt high school shooting the bloodbath stunned the nation and left a stain on the sleepy german town in the state of thuringia .
a national debate broke out on the link between vicious computer games , which steinhäuser was addicted to , and increasing violence among teenagers .
at the time , critical voices were also raised about the role of the local police and whether they had done enough to save victims ' lives . now , almost two years later , erfurt lawyer eric langer , who lost his partner , an art teacher , during the massacre , is ensuring that the same questions are kept alive .
langer filed a case against the state of thuringia this week , accusing those responsible for the police action on the day of the shoot-out , of acting too late or irresponsibly in five cases .
langer , who has carried out his own research into the incident and personally spoken to about 70 witnesses , believes that three teachers and two students died only one to two hours after they were fatally injured by steinhäuser .
though there is no way of knowing if they could have been saved , langer says it 's incomprehensible that no attempt was made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lawyer has also accused the various emergency services of disastrous coordination efforts .
" each emergency service waited for the next one with the result that the entire deployment was paralysed , " langer told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . langer also described the entire operation as " entirely chaotic , " with several students and police officers not even aware that paramedics had been allowed to enter the school building .
langer 's own partner , birgit dettke , is said to have laid crying in vain for help for almost an hour and a half in the schoolyard , just meters away from policemen . no mention of police failures a 43-page investigative report compiled by thuringia 's interior ministry two months after the massacre , however , assumed that , " all victims would have had no chance of survival even if they had undergone an immediate emergency operation . "
langer has slammed the report for ignoring the alleged failures of the police operation . nor had the report , which was originally meant to be just an interim assessment , been pursued further .
it was only in january this year that thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , commissioned his justice minister to open a detailed probe into the massacre after facing pressure from an opposition political parties and langer 's threat to take the matter to the court . bodo ramelow of the party of democratic socialism is also pushing the government to implement a tighter weapons law than the existing one , introduce school reforms and make more provisions for traumatized victims . book on massacre causes controversy the issue has been lent urgency with the publication of the controversial part-fiction book " das reicht für heute " -lrb- that 's enough for today -rrb- by german author ines geipel .
geipel , who wrote the story through the perspective of a fictitious former student , has accused the police of inaction and criticized efforts by the thuringia government to bury fundamental debates and questions that sprung up in the aftermath of the shooting . geipel , however , has been publicly slammed by both teachers and students from the high school where the massacre took place as a sensation-seeker .

germany 's highest court ruled on wednesday that telephone surveillance as currently practiced is unconstitutional .

" it is not necessarily a violation of human dignity if someone is put under observation , " court justice hans-juergen papier said , according to a report by the associated press .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.03.2004 -pipe- 18:00 utc men have more free time and earn more men enjoy 30 minutes per day more leisure time than women , according to a report released by the german federal statistics office .
while men have 6 hours and 11 minutes a day to themselves , women make do with 5 hours and 43 minutes .
there 's also a major gender divide in the way they spend it : women tend to spend their free time socializing ; men prefer to read newspapers or watch television .
the main reason women are busier is that they still take on the bulk of the burden of cooking , cleaning and childcare , the report said .
women also continue to earn less in full-time jobs than their male counterparts .
in 2003 , female staff in industry , manufacturing , trade , credit and insurance sectors earned an average of € 2,602 -lrb- $ 3,159 -rrb- , some 30 percent less than their male colleagues .
the discrepancy is less pronounced in the eastern german states , where better childcare facilities mean women are less likely to take time off .
the east-west gap in salaries is less extreme in the case of casual workers : with an average of € 1,885 a month , women workers in western germany earned almost 25 percent less then men , whereas in eastern germany salaries of casual women workers were just 22 percent below those of their male counterparts . more briefs 01.03.2004 -pipe- suspected leftist terrorist charged in bomb attack on bus 24.02.2004 -pipe- fewer asylum seekers in germany 16.02.2004 -pipe- banned islamic association re-builds in cologne 06.02.2004 -pipe- protesters hold up berlin film fest opening 02.02.2004 -pipe- german help to rebuild iraqi universities 26.01.2004 -pipe- fischer cool on french call to end china weapons embargo 26.01.2004 -pipe- struck says eurocorps ready for afghan mission 26.01.2004 -pipe- porn star hopes for strong election performance radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

"
now that john kerry has locked up the democratic nomination , the next stage begins in his fight against george w. bush .
kerry says if elected he 'll change u.s. foreign policy and renew frayed alliances . kerry 's coast-to-coast victories in the super tuesday primaries and caucuses means the 60-year-old democratic senator from massachusetts will be george w. bush 's opponent in the november election .
but even before cementing the nomination , kerry has been laying out a vision of international affairs that lies in stark contrast to the one pursued by president bush and which europeans and much of the world will probably find more to their liking . while the bush campaign will focus on the danger of terrorism and the president 's role as commander-in-chief during the election fight , kerry seems determined not to let the republicans gain the advantage on security and international affairs .
he has been relentless in his criticism of white house foreign policy . " the bush administration has run the most inept , reckless , arrogant and ideological foreign policy in the modern history of our country , " kerry often says on the stump . kerry has continued to paint a bleak picture of bush 's foreign policy and his approach to terrorism in his speeches in recent weeks and says he would take a radically different approach to fighting the danger of terrorism and ensuring america 's security . " no matter how much power we have , we can not prevail single-handedly , " he has said .
" we have to work with the international community to define a global strategy that is inclusive , not exclusive , collective and not imperial . " rebuilding bridges kerry says he would break with several tenets of the bush administration , which he accuses of abandoning belief in collective security , respect for international institutions , international law and multilateral engagement . kerry promises a " new era of alliances " and says he would make an aggressive effort to rebuild " frayed and shredded " relationships , especially with nato allies .
he says he would call an international summit to draw up a common anti-terrorism and security agenda and pledges to return to the use of diplomacy as a tool for foreign policy and treat the un as a " full partner . " " we will renew our alliances and we will build new alliances because they are essential to the final victory and success of a war on terror , " he told supporters in one speech . a kerry administration would reengage the u.s. in the fight against global warming , the candidate has said , in sharp contrast to the bush white house , which turned its back on the kyoto protocol on climate change three years ago . putting the stress on dialog bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john kerry in 1969 with members of his crew aboard pcf-31 in the mekong delta during the war in vietnam .
kerry , who is a both a vietnam veteran and former anti-war protester and worked toward normalization of ties with hanoi , says he understands the importance of dialog and diplomacy and the dangers of bullying with a big stick . he says once in office , he will put the united nations in charge of rebuilding iraq and establish a " reasonable plan and specific timetable " for restoring self-government and not engage in a rush to hand back power . in a speech last friday in los angeles , kerry vowed that if elected , he will revamp u.s. intelligence agencies and begin diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing islamic youth from embracing radicalism . ties to europe kerry 's vision of his administration 's foreign policy have been greeted with enthusiasm from many in europe , where anti-bush sentiment is high .
the bush administration has alienated many of its closest allies , particularly france and germany , over the iraq war and its dismissive attitude toward the " old world . "
though bush and chancellor gerhard schröder recently met at the white house and publicly put their differences over iraq behind them , relations between them can not be described as close . while bush has had limited foreign travel experience - when he was 21 he listed his only foreign travel as a vacation trip to scotland - kerry attended a swiss boarding school and when he receives envoys from paris in washington , he chats with them in fluent french .
his wife , teresa heinz kerry , was born in mozambique , studied in south africa and switzerland and is fluent in five languages herself . " bush has managed to offend everybody , " said ruth oldenziel , an american history professor at the university of amsterdam , in an interview with dutch radio .

new line cinema has acquired the film rights to best-selling german children 's author cornelia funke 's fantasy novel " inkheart . "
it 's an unprecedented success for a german writer . many writers dream that one day they 'll hit the hollywood jackpot , with movie moguls slugging it out to see which top studio snags the rights to the big-screen version of their book .
britain 's j.k.rowling did it with her famous " harry potter " series , but german writers generally do n't make much of a splash in tinseltown .
that may be changing , thanks to the hamburg-based writer cornelia funke . in recent months the 44-year-old mother of two has found herself in the middle of a frantic tussle between heyday films and new line cinema , both desperate to secure movie rights to her book " inkheart . "
new line cinema has won and has signed her up for a three-movie deal - similar to the hugely successful harry potter series produced by heyday films - which will also cover the subsequent two volumes in funke 's planned trilogy .
the second part of the series is due for publication in germany later this year .
in an interview with dw-tv , funke was still reeling from her sudden a-list status , saying " all these famous names were being bandied around … .tom hanks … .brad pitt … the names kept on coming at me , they talked about taking $ 50 million in the first weekend … it was everything you imagine hollywood to be . "
runaway success at home and abroad cornelia funke is germany 's bestselling children 's author after j. k. rowling and r. l. stine .
born in 1958 , she began her career as an illustrator , but soon became bored of the books she was working with and decided to go it alone .
she published her first novel at the age of 28 and now has some 40 titles to her name .
german publisher cecilie dressler verlag has sold some 2.5 million of her books in germany alone , and she 's been translated into around 26 languages .
a slow-burning success at home as well as in far-flung countries such as japan and sweden , she still had to wait a while to be noticed by english-language publishers .
with english-language markets notoriously slow to pick up on foreign fiction , it was n't until 2002 that the prolific author made her debut in the u.k. and the u.s. with " the thief lord , " which fast became a new york times bestseller and scooped several european children 's literature awards .
it 's also the first of funke 's novels to get a movie treatment , with filming set to begin in venice this spring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publishers then wasted no time releasing " inkheart " in late 2003 .
still no .
7 after 20 weeks on the new york times bestseller list , it 's even giving illustrious rival authors such as rowling and lemony snicket a run for their money .
scholastic promptly rushed out funke 's " the princess knight " in february , and is now eagerly awaiting the second part of the inkheart trilogy , " inkblood " , which was recently delivered for english translation and will be published world-wide next year .
following the footsteps of j.k. rowling fêted by the english-language press , funke realized it would n't be long before hollywood came knocking .
fortunately for her , her brand of fantasy fiction seemed to capture the zeitgeist perfectly , and the studios were soon queuing up to get in on the act .
with its " lord of the rings " trilogy down and dusted - and currently basking in oscar glory - , new line in particular was looking around for another fantasy franchise .
" inkheart " is a fast-paced adventure story about a young girl whose father has the power to bring characters from books to life .
when he 's kidnapped by a power-hungry villain from a rare children 's fable , his daughter gets together with a group of friends both real and imagined to set things right .
in an interview with the guardian last october , funke stressed that she would be signing with the studio most likely to give her creative control .
" what for me is most important , and what disturbs especially the americans , is that i do n't talk about money , " she said .
" i could do a bidding war , but i do n't want to , because the only thing that interests me is creative control , and they do n't like that . "
however , now that funke has clinched the deal , she seems to be content that the studio " will stay true to my book .

following the footsteps of j.k. rowling fêted by the english-language press , funke realized it would n't be long before hollywood came knocking .
fortunately for her , her brand of fantasy fiction seemed to capture the zeitgeist perfectly , and the studios were soon queuing up to get in on the act .
with its " lord of the rings " trilogy down and dusted - and currently basking in oscar glory - , new line in particular was looking around for another fantasy franchise .
" inkheart " is a fast-paced adventure story about a young girl whose father has the power to bring characters from books to life .
when he 's kidnapped by a power-hungry villain from a rare children 's fable , his daughter gets together with a group of friends both real and imagined to set things right .
in an interview with the guardian last october , funke stressed that she would be signing with the studio most likely to give her creative control .
" what for me is most important , and what disturbs especially the americans , is that i do n't talk about money , " she said .
" i could do a bidding war , but i do n't want to , because the only thing that interests me is creative control , and they do n't like that . "
however , now that funke has clinched the deal , she seems to be content that the studio " will stay true to my book .

"
now that john kerry has locked up the democratic nomination , the next stage begins in his fight against george w. bush .
kerry says if elected he 'll change u.s. foreign policy and renew frayed alliances . kerry 's coast-to-coast victories in the super tuesday primaries and caucuses means the 60-year-old democratic senator from massachusetts will be george w. bush 's opponent in the november election .
but even before cementing the nomination , kerry has been laying out a vision of international affairs that lies in stark contrast to the one pursued by president bush and which europeans and much of the world will probably find more to their liking . while the bush campaign will focus on the danger of terrorism and the president 's role as commander-in-chief during the election fight , kerry seems determined not to let the republicans gain the advantage on security and international affairs .
he has been relentless in his criticism of white house foreign policy . " the bush administration has run the most inept , reckless , arrogant and ideological foreign policy in the modern history of our country , " kerry often says on the stump . kerry has continued to paint a bleak picture of bush 's foreign policy and his approach to terrorism in his speeches in recent weeks and says he would take a radically different approach to fighting the danger of terrorism and ensuring america 's security . " no matter how much power we have , we can not prevail single-handedly , " he has said .
" we have to work with the international community to define a global strategy that is inclusive , not exclusive , collective and not imperial . " rebuilding bridges kerry says he would break with several tenets of the bush administration , which he accuses of abandoning belief in collective security , respect for international institutions , international law and multilateral engagement . kerry promises a " new era of alliances " and says he would make an aggressive effort to rebuild " frayed and shredded " relationships , especially with nato allies .
he says he would call an international summit to draw up a common anti-terrorism and security agenda and pledges to return to the use of diplomacy as a tool for foreign policy and treat the un as a " full partner . " " we will renew our alliances and we will build new alliances because they are essential to the final victory and success of a war on terror , " he told supporters in one speech . a kerry administration would reengage the u.s. in the fight against global warming , the candidate has said , in sharp contrast to the bush white house , which turned its back on the kyoto protocol on climate change three years ago . putting the stress on dialog bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john kerry in 1969 with members of his crew aboard pcf-31 in the mekong delta during the war in vietnam .
kerry , who is a both a vietnam veteran and former anti-war protester and worked toward normalization of ties with hanoi , says he understands the importance of dialog and diplomacy and the dangers of bullying with a big stick . he says once in office , he will put the united nations in charge of rebuilding iraq and establish a " reasonable plan and specific timetable " for restoring self-government and not engage in a rush to hand back power . in a speech last friday in los angeles , kerry vowed that if elected , he will revamp u.s. intelligence agencies and begin diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing islamic youth from embracing radicalism . ties to europe kerry 's vision of his administration 's foreign policy have been greeted with enthusiasm from many in europe , where anti-bush sentiment is high .
the bush administration has alienated many of its closest allies , particularly france and germany , over the iraq war and its dismissive attitude toward the " old world . "
though bush and chancellor gerhard schröder recently met at the white house and publicly put their differences over iraq behind them , relations between them can not be described as close . while bush has had limited foreign travel experience - when he was 21 he listed his only foreign travel as a vacation trip to scotland - kerry attended a swiss boarding school and when he receives envoys from paris in washington , he chats with them in fluent french .
his wife , teresa heinz kerry , was born in mozambique , studied in south africa and switzerland and is fluent in five languages herself . " bush has managed to offend everybody , " said ruth oldenziel , an american history professor at the university of amsterdam , in an interview with dutch radio .

"
anda did not comment on whether bild reporters would still be allowed to accompany the chancellor on trips abroad but did stress that the paper failed to deliver fair and balanced coverage of the government 's performance .
" the way -lrb- the paper -rrb- approaches berlin 's policies is a combination of malice , baiting and contempt , served up with semi-truths , " anda said .
he should know .- the government spokesperson was himself an editor at bild before he took up his current position in 1998 .
in recent weeks , schröder has repeatedly accused the paper , published by the right-leaning axel-springer-verlag , of running a witch-hunt against his government .
the paper 's editor-in-chief kai diekmann retaliated by saying that " an attempt to cure the red-green coalition 's self-confessed communication problems by withholding information gives us plenty of insight into the way a press spokesperson operates .

"
anda did not comment on whether bild reporters would still be allowed to accompany the chancellor on trips abroad but did stress that the paper failed to deliver fair and balanced coverage of the government 's performance .
" the way -lrb- the paper -rrb- approaches berlin 's policies is a combination of malice , baiting and contempt , served up with semi-truths , " anda said .
he should know .- the government spokesperson was himself an editor at bild before he took up his current position in 1998 .
in recent weeks , schröder has repeatedly accused the paper , published by the right-leaning axel-springer-verlag , of running a witch-hunt against his government .
the paper 's editor-in-chief kai diekmann retaliated by saying that " an attempt to cure the red-green coalition 's self-confessed communication problems by withholding information gives us plenty of insight into the way a press spokesperson operates .

germany 's highest court ruled on wednesday that telephone surveillance as currently practiced is unconstitutional .
it demanded changes in the six-year old law . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe said the current law that allows authorities to eavesdrop on conversations in private homes was unconstitutional and must be rectified by june 2005 . three politicians from germany 's small fdp party had brought the complaint , even though the liberals were part of former chancellor helmut kohl 's government when the law was passed six years ago . aiming to fight organized crime and terrorism , it was highly controversial at the time , because of the country 's history of the nazi police state , and following decades of surveillance by the east german secret police , the stasi . however , fdp politicians sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , gerhart baum und burkhard hirsch opposed the law on the grounds that it violates constitutional privacy guarantees , and that it has n't helped solve any major cases . new rules according to the latest ruling , bugging of phones in private homes should only be allowed in cases where there is a suspicion of a serious offense that could carry a prison sentence of more than five years . up to now , phone surveillance was allowed in the case of offenses that carried lesser sentences . in addition , surveillance must be immediately cut when the conversation is clearly of a private nature , or when people under surveillance are speaking in their homes to close relatives , doctors , priests or defense lawyers who are not themselves suspects . the court 's decision argues that the protecting private homes is part of protecting human dignity , and that only surveillance that protect human dignity should be permitted . " it is not necessarily a violation of human dignity if someone is put under observation , " court justice hans-juergen papier said , according to a report by the associated press .
" but in such cases , the core area of privacy must be safeguarded . " the german government says eavesdropping is used only as a last resort .

it demanded changes in the six-year old law . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe said the current law that allows authorities to eavesdrop on conversations in private homes was unconstitutional and must be rectified by june 2005 . three politicians from germany 's small fdp party had brought the complaint , even though the liberals were part of former chancellor helmut kohl 's government when the law was passed six years ago . aiming to fight organized crime and terrorism , it was highly controversial at the time , because of the country 's history of the nazi police state , and following decades of surveillance by the east german secret police , the stasi . however , fdp politicians sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , gerhart baum und burkhard hirsch opposed the law on the grounds that it violates constitutional privacy guarantees , and that it has n't helped solve any major cases . new rules according to the latest ruling , bugging of phones in private homes should only be allowed in cases where there is a suspicion of a serious offense that could carry a prison sentence of more than five years . up to now , phone surveillance was allowed in the case of offenses that carried lesser sentences . in addition , surveillance must be immediately cut when the conversation is clearly of a private nature , or when people under surveillance are speaking in their homes to close relatives , doctors , priests or defense lawyers who are not themselves suspects . the court 's decision argues that the protecting private homes is part of protecting human dignity , and that only surveillance that protect human dignity should be permitted . " it is not necessarily a violation of human dignity if someone is put under observation , " court justice hans-juergen papier said , according to a report by the associated press .
" but in such cases , the core area of privacy must be safeguarded . " the german government says eavesdropping is used only as a last resort .

"
now that john kerry has locked up the democratic nomination , the next stage begins in his fight against george w. bush .
kerry says if elected he 'll change u.s. foreign policy and renew frayed alliances . kerry 's coast-to-coast victories in the super tuesday primaries and caucuses means the 60-year-old democratic senator from massachusetts will be george w. bush 's opponent in the november election .
but even before cementing the nomination , kerry has been laying out a vision of international affairs that lies in stark contrast to the one pursued by president bush and which europeans and much of the world will probably find more to their liking . while the bush campaign will focus on the danger of terrorism and the president 's role as commander-in-chief during the election fight , kerry seems determined not to let the republicans gain the advantage on security and international affairs .
he has been relentless in his criticism of white house foreign policy . " the bush administration has run the most inept , reckless , arrogant and ideological foreign policy in the modern history of our country , " kerry often says on the stump . kerry has continued to paint a bleak picture of bush 's foreign policy and his approach to terrorism in his speeches in recent weeks and says he would take a radically different approach to fighting the danger of terrorism and ensuring america 's security . " no matter how much power we have , we can not prevail single-handedly , " he has said .
" we have to work with the international community to define a global strategy that is inclusive , not exclusive , collective and not imperial . " rebuilding bridges kerry says he would break with several tenets of the bush administration , which he accuses of abandoning belief in collective security , respect for international institutions , international law and multilateral engagement . kerry promises a " new era of alliances " and says he would make an aggressive effort to rebuild " frayed and shredded " relationships , especially with nato allies .
he says he would call an international summit to draw up a common anti-terrorism and security agenda and pledges to return to the use of diplomacy as a tool for foreign policy and treat the un as a " full partner . " " we will renew our alliances and we will build new alliances because they are essential to the final victory and success of a war on terror , " he told supporters in one speech . a kerry administration would reengage the u.s. in the fight against global warming , the candidate has said , in sharp contrast to the bush white house , which turned its back on the kyoto protocol on climate change three years ago . putting the stress on dialog bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john kerry in 1969 with members of his crew aboard pcf-31 in the mekong delta during the war in vietnam .
kerry , who is a both a vietnam veteran and former anti-war protester and worked toward normalization of ties with hanoi , says he understands the importance of dialog and diplomacy and the dangers of bullying with a big stick . he says once in office , he will put the united nations in charge of rebuilding iraq and establish a " reasonable plan and specific timetable " for restoring self-government and not engage in a rush to hand back power . in a speech last friday in los angeles , kerry vowed that if elected , he will revamp u.s. intelligence agencies and begin diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing islamic youth from embracing radicalism . ties to europe kerry 's vision of his administration 's foreign policy have been greeted with enthusiasm from many in europe , where anti-bush sentiment is high .
the bush administration has alienated many of its closest allies , particularly france and germany , over the iraq war and its dismissive attitude toward the " old world . "
though bush and chancellor gerhard schröder recently met at the white house and publicly put their differences over iraq behind them , relations between them can not be described as close . while bush has had limited foreign travel experience - when he was 21 he listed his only foreign travel as a vacation trip to scotland - kerry attended a swiss boarding school and when he receives envoys from paris in washington , he chats with them in fluent french .
his wife , teresa heinz kerry , was born in mozambique , studied in south africa and switzerland and is fluent in five languages herself . " bush has managed to offend everybody , " said ruth oldenziel , an american history professor at the university of amsterdam , in an interview with dutch radio .

" the bush administration has run the most inept , reckless , arrogant and ideological foreign policy in the modern history of our country , " kerry often says on the stump . kerry has continued to paint a bleak picture of bush 's foreign policy and his approach to terrorism in his speeches in recent weeks and says he would take a radically different approach to fighting the danger of terrorism and ensuring america 's security .

he says he would call an international summit to draw up a common anti-terrorism and security agenda and pledges to return to the use of diplomacy as a tool for foreign policy and treat the un as a " full partner . " " we will renew our alliances and we will build new alliances because they are essential to the final victory and success of a war on terror , " he told supporters in one speech . a kerry administration would reengage the u.s. in the fight against global warming , the candidate has said , in sharp contrast to the bush white house , which turned its back on the kyoto protocol on climate change three years ago . putting the stress on dialog bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john kerry in 1969 with members of his crew aboard pcf-31 in the mekong delta during the war in vietnam .

the bush administration has alienated many of its closest allies , particularly france and germany , over the iraq war and its dismissive attitude toward the " old world . "
though bush and chancellor gerhard schröder recently met at the white house and publicly put their differences over iraq behind them , relations between them can not be described as close . while bush has had limited foreign travel experience - when he was 21 he listed his only foreign travel as a vacation trip to scotland - kerry attended a swiss boarding school and when he receives envoys from paris in washington , he chats with them in fluent french .

now that john kerry has locked up the democratic nomination , the next stage begins in his fight against george w. bush .
kerry says if elected he 'll change u.s. foreign policy and renew frayed alliances . kerry 's coast-to-coast victories in the super tuesday primaries and caucuses means the 60-year-old democratic senator from massachusetts will be george w. bush 's opponent in the november election .

almost two years after a school massacre killed 16 people , one of the victims ' partners has taken state authorities to court for not having done enough to save lives .
it 's reopened questions underlying the tragedy . on april 26 , 2002 , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser gunned down 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman within minutes at his former high school in the eastern german town of erfurt .
he then shot himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police at the erfurt high school shooting the bloodbath stunned the nation and left a stain on the sleepy german town in the state of thuringia .
a national debate broke out on the link between vicious computer games , which steinhäuser was addicted to , and increasing violence among teenagers .
at the time , critical voices were also raised about the role of the local police and whether they had done enough to save victims ' lives . now , almost two years later , erfurt lawyer eric langer , who lost his partner , an art teacher , during the massacre , is ensuring that the same questions are kept alive .
langer filed a case against the state of thuringia this week , accusing those responsible for the police action on the day of the shoot-out , of acting too late or irresponsibly in five cases .
langer , who has carried out his own research into the incident and personally spoken to about 70 witnesses , believes that three teachers and two students died only one to two hours after they were fatally injured by steinhäuser .
though there is no way of knowing if they could have been saved , langer says it 's incomprehensible that no attempt was made .

langer has slammed the report for ignoring the alleged failures of the police operation . nor had the report , which was originally meant to be just an interim assessment , been pursued further .

almost two years after a school massacre killed 16 people , one of the victims ' partners has taken state authorities to court for not having done enough to save lives .
it 's reopened questions underlying the tragedy . on april 26 , 2002 , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser gunned down 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman within minutes at his former high school in the eastern german town of erfurt .
he then shot himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police at the erfurt high school shooting the bloodbath stunned the nation and left a stain on the sleepy german town in the state of thuringia .
a national debate broke out on the link between vicious computer games , which steinhäuser was addicted to , and increasing violence among teenagers .
at the time , critical voices were also raised about the role of the local police and whether they had done enough to save victims ' lives . now , almost two years later , erfurt lawyer eric langer , who lost his partner , an art teacher , during the massacre , is ensuring that the same questions are kept alive .
langer filed a case against the state of thuringia this week , accusing those responsible for the police action on the day of the shoot-out , of acting too late or irresponsibly in five cases .
langer , who has carried out his own research into the incident and personally spoken to about 70 witnesses , believes that three teachers and two students died only one to two hours after they were fatally injured by steinhäuser .
though there is no way of knowing if they could have been saved , langer says it 's incomprehensible that no attempt was made .

" each emergency service waited for the next one with the result that the entire deployment was paralysed , " langer told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . langer also described the entire operation as " entirely chaotic , " with several students and police officers not even aware that paramedics had been allowed to enter the school building .

"
langer has slammed the report for ignoring the alleged failures of the police operation . nor had the report , which was originally meant to be just an interim assessment , been pursued further .
it was only in january this year that thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , commissioned his justice minister to open a detailed probe into the massacre after facing pressure from an opposition political parties and langer 's threat to take the matter to the court . bodo ramelow of the party of democratic socialism is also pushing the government to implement a tighter weapons law than the existing one , introduce school reforms and make more provisions for traumatized victims . book on massacre causes controversy the issue has been lent urgency with the publication of the controversial part-fiction book " das reicht für heute " -lrb- that 's enough for today -rrb- by german author ines geipel .
geipel , who wrote the story through the perspective of a fictitious former student , has accused the police of inaction and criticized efforts by the thuringia government to bury fundamental debates and questions that sprung up in the aftermath of the shooting . geipel , however , has been publicly slammed by both teachers and students from the high school where the massacre took place as a sensation-seeker .

new line cinema has acquired the film rights to best-selling german children 's author cornelia funke 's fantasy novel " inkheart . "
it 's an unprecedented success for a german writer . many writers dream that one day they 'll hit the hollywood jackpot , with movie moguls slugging it out to see which top studio snags the rights to the big-screen version of their book .
britain 's j.k.rowling did it with her famous " harry potter " series , but german writers generally do n't make much of a splash in tinseltown .
that may be changing , thanks to the hamburg-based writer cornelia funke . in recent months the 44-year-old mother of two has found herself in the middle of a frantic tussle between heyday films and new line cinema , both desperate to secure movie rights to her book " inkheart . "
new line cinema has won and has signed her up for a three-movie deal - similar to the hugely successful harry potter series produced by heyday films - which will also cover the subsequent two volumes in funke 's planned trilogy .
the second part of the series is due for publication in germany later this year .
in an interview with dw-tv , funke was still reeling from her sudden a-list status , saying " all these famous names were being bandied around … .tom hanks … .brad pitt … the names kept on coming at me , they talked about taking $ 50 million in the first weekend … it was everything you imagine hollywood to be . "
runaway success at home and abroad cornelia funke is germany 's bestselling children 's author after j. k. rowling and r. l. stine .
born in 1958 , she began her career as an illustrator , but soon became bored of the books she was working with and decided to go it alone .
she published her first novel at the age of 28 and now has some 40 titles to her name .
german publisher cecilie dressler verlag has sold some 2.5 million of her books in germany alone , and she 's been translated into around 26 languages .
a slow-burning success at home as well as in far-flung countries such as japan and sweden , she still had to wait a while to be noticed by english-language publishers .
with english-language markets notoriously slow to pick up on foreign fiction , it was n't until 2002 that the prolific author made her debut in the u.k. and the u.s. with " the thief lord , " which fast became a new york times bestseller and scooped several european children 's literature awards .
it 's also the first of funke 's novels to get a movie treatment , with filming set to begin in venice this spring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publishers then wasted no time releasing " inkheart " in late 2003 .
still no .
7 after 20 weeks on the new york times bestseller list , it 's even giving illustrious rival authors such as rowling and lemony snicket a run for their money .
scholastic promptly rushed out funke 's " the princess knight " in february , and is now eagerly awaiting the second part of the inkheart trilogy , " inkblood " , which was recently delivered for english translation and will be published world-wide next year .
following the footsteps of j.k. rowling fêted by the english-language press , funke realized it would n't be long before hollywood came knocking .
fortunately for her , her brand of fantasy fiction seemed to capture the zeitgeist perfectly , and the studios were soon queuing up to get in on the act .
with its " lord of the rings " trilogy down and dusted - and currently basking in oscar glory - , new line in particular was looking around for another fantasy franchise .
" inkheart " is a fast-paced adventure story about a young girl whose father has the power to bring characters from books to life .
when he 's kidnapped by a power-hungry villain from a rare children 's fable , his daughter gets together with a group of friends both real and imagined to set things right .
in an interview with the guardian last october , funke stressed that she would be signing with the studio most likely to give her creative control .
" what for me is most important , and what disturbs especially the americans , is that i do n't talk about money , " she said .
" i could do a bidding war , but i do n't want to , because the only thing that interests me is creative control , and they do n't like that . "
however , now that funke has clinched the deal , she seems to be content that the studio " will stay true to my book .

new line cinema has acquired the film rights to best-selling german children 's author cornelia funke 's fantasy novel " inkheart . "
it 's an unprecedented success for a german writer . many writers dream that one day they 'll hit the hollywood jackpot , with movie moguls slugging it out to see which top studio snags the rights to the big-screen version of their book .
britain 's j.k.rowling did it with her famous " harry potter " series , but german writers generally do n't make much of a splash in tinseltown .
that may be changing , thanks to the hamburg-based writer cornelia funke . in recent months the 44-year-old mother of two has found herself in the middle of a frantic tussle between heyday films and new line cinema , both desperate to secure movie rights to her book " inkheart . "
new line cinema has won and has signed her up for a three-movie deal - similar to the hugely successful harry potter series produced by heyday films - which will also cover the subsequent two volumes in funke 's planned trilogy .
the second part of the series is due for publication in germany later this year .
in an interview with dw-tv , funke was still reeling from her sudden a-list status , saying " all these famous names were being bandied around … .tom hanks … .brad pitt … the names kept on coming at me , they talked about taking $ 50 million in the first weekend … it was everything you imagine hollywood to be . "
runaway success at home and abroad cornelia funke is germany 's bestselling children 's author after j. k. rowling and r. l. stine .
born in 1958 , she began her career as an illustrator , but soon became bored of the books she was working with and decided to go it alone .
she published her first novel at the age of 28 and now has some 40 titles to her name .
german publisher cecilie dressler verlag has sold some 2.5 million of her books in germany alone , and she 's been translated into around 26 languages .
a slow-burning success at home as well as in far-flung countries such as japan and sweden , she still had to wait a while to be noticed by english-language publishers .
with english-language markets notoriously slow to pick up on foreign fiction , it was n't until 2002 that the prolific author made her debut in the u.k. and the u.s. with " the thief lord , " which fast became a new york times bestseller and scooped several european children 's literature awards .
it 's also the first of funke 's novels to get a movie treatment , with filming set to begin in venice this spring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publishers then wasted no time releasing " inkheart " in late 2003 .

"
now that john kerry has locked up the democratic nomination , the next stage begins in his fight against george w. bush .
kerry says if elected he 'll change u.s. foreign policy and renew frayed alliances . kerry 's coast-to-coast victories in the super tuesday primaries and caucuses means the 60-year-old democratic senator from massachusetts will be george w. bush 's opponent in the november election .
but even before cementing the nomination , kerry has been laying out a vision of international affairs that lies in stark contrast to the one pursued by president bush and which europeans and much of the world will probably find more to their liking . while the bush campaign will focus on the danger of terrorism and the president 's role as commander-in-chief during the election fight , kerry seems determined not to let the republicans gain the advantage on security and international affairs .
he has been relentless in his criticism of white house foreign policy . " the bush administration has run the most inept , reckless , arrogant and ideological foreign policy in the modern history of our country , " kerry often says on the stump . kerry has continued to paint a bleak picture of bush 's foreign policy and his approach to terrorism in his speeches in recent weeks and says he would take a radically different approach to fighting the danger of terrorism and ensuring america 's security . " no matter how much power we have , we can not prevail single-handedly , " he has said .
" we have to work with the international community to define a global strategy that is inclusive , not exclusive , collective and not imperial . " rebuilding bridges kerry says he would break with several tenets of the bush administration , which he accuses of abandoning belief in collective security , respect for international institutions , international law and multilateral engagement . kerry promises a " new era of alliances " and says he would make an aggressive effort to rebuild " frayed and shredded " relationships , especially with nato allies .
he says he would call an international summit to draw up a common anti-terrorism and security agenda and pledges to return to the use of diplomacy as a tool for foreign policy and treat the un as a " full partner . " " we will renew our alliances and we will build new alliances because they are essential to the final victory and success of a war on terror , " he told supporters in one speech . a kerry administration would reengage the u.s. in the fight against global warming , the candidate has said , in sharp contrast to the bush white house , which turned its back on the kyoto protocol on climate change three years ago . putting the stress on dialog bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john kerry in 1969 with members of his crew aboard pcf-31 in the mekong delta during the war in vietnam .
kerry , who is a both a vietnam veteran and former anti-war protester and worked toward normalization of ties with hanoi , says he understands the importance of dialog and diplomacy and the dangers of bullying with a big stick . he says once in office , he will put the united nations in charge of rebuilding iraq and establish a " reasonable plan and specific timetable " for restoring self-government and not engage in a rush to hand back power . in a speech last friday in los angeles , kerry vowed that if elected , he will revamp u.s. intelligence agencies and begin diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing islamic youth from embracing radicalism . ties to europe kerry 's vision of his administration 's foreign policy have been greeted with enthusiasm from many in europe , where anti-bush sentiment is high .

germany 's highest court ruled on wednesday that telephone surveillance as currently practiced is unconstitutional .
it demanded changes in the six-year old law . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe said the current law that allows authorities to eavesdrop on conversations in private homes was unconstitutional and must be rectified by june 2005 . three politicians from germany 's small fdp party had brought the complaint , even though the liberals were part of former chancellor helmut kohl 's government when the law was passed six years ago . aiming to fight organized crime and terrorism , it was highly controversial at the time , because of the country 's history of the nazi police state , and following decades of surveillance by the east german secret police , the stasi . however , fdp politicians sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , gerhart baum und burkhard hirsch opposed the law on the grounds that it violates constitutional privacy guarantees , and that it has n't helped solve any major cases . new rules according to the latest ruling , bugging of phones in private homes should only be allowed in cases where there is a suspicion of a serious offense that could carry a prison sentence of more than five years . up to now , phone surveillance was allowed in the case of offenses that carried lesser sentences . in addition , surveillance must be immediately cut when the conversation is clearly of a private nature , or when people under surveillance are speaking in their homes to close relatives , doctors , priests or defense lawyers who are not themselves suspects . the court 's decision argues that the protecting private homes is part of protecting human dignity , and that only surveillance that protect human dignity should be permitted . " it is not necessarily a violation of human dignity if someone is put under observation , " court justice hans-juergen papier said , according to a report by the associated press .
" but in such cases , the core area of privacy must be safeguarded . " the german government says eavesdropping is used only as a last resort .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.03.2004 kerry promises a kinder , gentler foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry wants to see a " new era of alliances . "
now that john kerry has locked up the democratic nomination , the next stage begins in his fight against george w. bush .
kerry says if elected he 'll change u.s. foreign policy and renew frayed alliances . kerry 's coast-to-coast victories in the super tuesday primaries and caucuses means the 60-year-old democratic senator from massachusetts will be george w. bush 's opponent in the november election .
but even before cementing the nomination , kerry has been laying out a vision of international affairs that lies in stark contrast to the one pursued by president bush and which europeans and much of the world will probably find more to their liking . while the bush campaign will focus on the danger of terrorism and the president 's role as commander-in-chief during the election fight , kerry seems determined not to let the republicans gain the advantage on security and international affairs .
he has been relentless in his criticism of white house foreign policy . " the bush administration has run the most inept , reckless , arrogant and ideological foreign policy in the modern history of our country , " kerry often says on the stump . kerry has continued to paint a bleak picture of bush 's foreign policy and his approach to terrorism in his speeches in recent weeks and says he would take a radically different approach to fighting the danger of terrorism and ensuring america 's security . " no matter how much power we have , we can not prevail single-handedly , " he has said .
" we have to work with the international community to define a global strategy that is inclusive , not exclusive , collective and not imperial . " rebuilding bridges kerry says he would break with several tenets of the bush administration , which he accuses of abandoning belief in collective security , respect for international institutions , international law and multilateral engagement . kerry promises a " new era of alliances " and says he would make an aggressive effort to rebuild " frayed and shredded " relationships , especially with nato allies .
he says he would call an international summit to draw up a common anti-terrorism and security agenda and pledges to return to the use of diplomacy as a tool for foreign policy and treat the un as a " full partner . " " we will renew our alliances and we will build new alliances because they are essential to the final victory and success of a war on terror , " he told supporters in one speech . a kerry administration would reengage the u.s. in the fight against global warming , the candidate has said , in sharp contrast to the bush white house , which turned its back on the kyoto protocol on climate change three years ago . putting the stress on dialog bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john kerry in 1969 with members of his crew aboard pcf-31 in the mekong delta during the war in vietnam .
kerry , who is a both a vietnam veteran and former anti-war protester and worked toward normalization of ties with hanoi , says he understands the importance of dialog and diplomacy and the dangers of bullying with a big stick . he says once in office , he will put the united nations in charge of rebuilding iraq and establish a " reasonable plan and specific timetable " for restoring self-government and not engage in a rush to hand back power . in a speech last friday in los angeles , kerry vowed that if elected , he will revamp u.s. intelligence agencies and begin diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing islamic youth from embracing radicalism . ties to europe kerry 's vision of his administration 's foreign policy have been greeted with enthusiasm from many in europe , where anti-bush sentiment is high .
the bush administration has alienated many of its closest allies , particularly france and germany , over the iraq war and its dismissive attitude toward the " old world . "
though bush and chancellor gerhard schröder recently met at the white house and publicly put their differences over iraq behind them , relations between them can not be described as close . while bush has had limited foreign travel experience - when he was 21 he listed his only foreign travel as a vacation trip to scotland - kerry attended a swiss boarding school and when he receives envoys from paris in washington , he chats with them in fluent french .
his wife , teresa heinz kerry , was born in mozambique , studied in south africa and switzerland and is fluent in five languages herself . " bush has managed to offend everybody , " said ruth oldenziel , an american history professor at the university of amsterdam , in an interview with dutch radio .
" kerry is well travelled , he has been to vietnam , he 's very well read , he has a sense of belonging , and has a background in europe , so i think to europeans he 's going to be a welcome change .

u.s. senator john kerry is on course to become george w. bush ’ s democratic challenger in the 2004 presidential election .

almost two years after a school massacre killed 16 people , one of the victims ' partners has taken state authorities to court for not having done enough to save lives .
it 's reopened questions underlying the tragedy . on april 26 , 2002 , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser gunned down 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman within minutes at his former high school in the eastern german town of erfurt .
he then shot himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police at the erfurt high school shooting the bloodbath stunned the nation and left a stain on the sleepy german town in the state of thuringia .
a national debate broke out on the link between vicious computer games , which steinhäuser was addicted to , and increasing violence among teenagers .
at the time , critical voices were also raised about the role of the local police and whether they had done enough to save victims ' lives . now , almost two years later , erfurt lawyer eric langer , who lost his partner , an art teacher , during the massacre , is ensuring that the same questions are kept alive .
langer filed a case against the state of thuringia this week , accusing those responsible for the police action on the day of the shoot-out , of acting too late or irresponsibly in five cases .
langer , who has carried out his own research into the incident and personally spoken to about 70 witnesses , believes that three teachers and two students died only one to two hours after they were fatally injured by steinhäuser .
though there is no way of knowing if they could have been saved , langer says it 's incomprehensible that no attempt was made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lawyer has also accused the various emergency services of disastrous coordination efforts .
" each emergency service waited for the next one with the result that the entire deployment was paralysed , " langer told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . langer also described the entire operation as " entirely chaotic , " with several students and police officers not even aware that paramedics had been allowed to enter the school building .
langer 's own partner , birgit dettke , is said to have laid crying in vain for help for almost an hour and a half in the schoolyard , just meters away from policemen . no mention of police failures a 43-page investigative report compiled by thuringia 's interior ministry two months after the massacre , however , assumed that , " all victims would have had no chance of survival even if they had undergone an immediate emergency operation . "
langer has slammed the report for ignoring the alleged failures of the police operation . nor had the report , which was originally meant to be just an interim assessment , been pursued further .
it was only in january this year that thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , commissioned his justice minister to open a detailed probe into the massacre after facing pressure from an opposition political parties and langer 's threat to take the matter to the court . bodo ramelow of the party of democratic socialism is also pushing the government to implement a tighter weapons law than the existing one , introduce school reforms and make more provisions for traumatized victims . book on massacre causes controversy the issue has been lent urgency with the publication of the controversial part-fiction book " das reicht für heute " -lrb- that 's enough for today -rrb- by german author ines geipel .
geipel , who wrote the story through the perspective of a fictitious former student , has accused the police of inaction and criticized efforts by the thuringia government to bury fundamental debates and questions that sprung up in the aftermath of the shooting . geipel , however , has been publicly slammed by both teachers and students from the high school where the massacre took place as a sensation-seeker .

new line cinema has acquired the film rights to best-selling german children 's author cornelia funke 's fantasy novel " inkheart . "
it 's an unprecedented success for a german writer . many writers dream that one day they 'll hit the hollywood jackpot , with movie moguls slugging it out to see which top studio snags the rights to the big-screen version of their book .
britain 's j.k.rowling did it with her famous " harry potter " series , but german writers generally do n't make much of a splash in tinseltown .
that may be changing , thanks to the hamburg-based writer cornelia funke . in recent months the 44-year-old mother of two has found herself in the middle of a frantic tussle between heyday films and new line cinema , both desperate to secure movie rights to her book " inkheart . "
new line cinema has won and has signed her up for a three-movie deal - similar to the hugely successful harry potter series produced by heyday films - which will also cover the subsequent two volumes in funke 's planned trilogy .
the second part of the series is due for publication in germany later this year .
in an interview with dw-tv , funke was still reeling from her sudden a-list status , saying " all these famous names were being bandied around … .tom hanks … .brad pitt … the names kept on coming at me , they talked about taking $ 50 million in the first weekend … it was everything you imagine hollywood to be . "
runaway success at home and abroad cornelia funke is germany 's bestselling children 's author after j. k. rowling and r. l. stine .
born in 1958 , she began her career as an illustrator , but soon became bored of the books she was working with and decided to go it alone .
she published her first novel at the age of 28 and now has some 40 titles to her name .
german publisher cecilie dressler verlag has sold some 2.5 million of her books in germany alone , and she 's been translated into around 26 languages .
a slow-burning success at home as well as in far-flung countries such as japan and sweden , she still had to wait a while to be noticed by english-language publishers .
with english-language markets notoriously slow to pick up on foreign fiction , it was n't until 2002 that the prolific author made her debut in the u.k. and the u.s. with " the thief lord , " which fast became a new york times bestseller and scooped several european children 's literature awards .
it 's also the first of funke 's novels to get a movie treatment , with filming set to begin in venice this spring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publishers then wasted no time releasing " inkheart " in late 2003 .
still no .
7 after 20 weeks on the new york times bestseller list , it 's even giving illustrious rival authors such as rowling and lemony snicket a run for their money .
scholastic promptly rushed out funke 's " the princess knight " in february , and is now eagerly awaiting the second part of the inkheart trilogy , " inkblood " , which was recently delivered for english translation and will be published world-wide next year .
following the footsteps of j.k. rowling fêted by the english-language press , funke realized it would n't be long before hollywood came knocking .
fortunately for her , her brand of fantasy fiction seemed to capture the zeitgeist perfectly , and the studios were soon queuing up to get in on the act .
with its " lord of the rings " trilogy down and dusted - and currently basking in oscar glory - , new line in particular was looking around for another fantasy franchise .
" inkheart " is a fast-paced adventure story about a young girl whose father has the power to bring characters from books to life .
when he 's kidnapped by a power-hungry villain from a rare children 's fable , his daughter gets together with a group of friends both real and imagined to set things right .
in an interview with the guardian last october , funke stressed that she would be signing with the studio most likely to give her creative control .
" what for me is most important , and what disturbs especially the americans , is that i do n't talk about money , " she said .
" i could do a bidding war , but i do n't want to , because the only thing that interests me is creative control , and they do n't like that . "

new line cinema has acquired the film rights to best-selling german children 's author cornelia funke 's fantasy novel " inkheart . "
it 's an unprecedented success for a german writer . many writers dream that one day they 'll hit the hollywood jackpot , with movie moguls slugging it out to see which top studio snags the rights to the big-screen version of their book .
britain 's j.k.rowling did it with her famous " harry potter " series , but german writers generally do n't make much of a splash in tinseltown .
that may be changing , thanks to the hamburg-based writer cornelia funke . in recent months the 44-year-old mother of two has found herself in the middle of a frantic tussle between heyday films and new line cinema , both desperate to secure movie rights to her book " inkheart . "
new line cinema has won and has signed her up for a three-movie deal - similar to the hugely successful harry potter series produced by heyday films - which will also cover the subsequent two volumes in funke 's planned trilogy .
the second part of the series is due for publication in germany later this year .
in an interview with dw-tv , funke was still reeling from her sudden a-list status , saying " all these famous names were being bandied around … .tom hanks … .brad pitt … the names kept on coming at me , they talked about taking $ 50 million in the first weekend … it was everything you imagine hollywood to be . "
runaway success at home and abroad cornelia funke is germany 's bestselling children 's author after j. k. rowling and r. l. stine .
born in 1958 , she began her career as an illustrator , but soon became bored of the books she was working with and decided to go it alone .
she published her first novel at the age of 28 and now has some 40 titles to her name .
german publisher cecilie dressler verlag has sold some 2.5 million of her books in germany alone , and she 's been translated into around 26 languages .
a slow-burning success at home as well as in far-flung countries such as japan and sweden , she still had to wait a while to be noticed by english-language publishers .
with english-language markets notoriously slow to pick up on foreign fiction , it was n't until 2002 that the prolific author made her debut in the u.k. and the u.s. with " the thief lord , " which fast became a new york times bestseller and scooped several european children 's literature awards .
it 's also the first of funke 's novels to get a movie treatment , with filming set to begin in venice this spring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publishers then wasted no time releasing " inkheart " in late 2003 .

almost two years after a school massacre killed 16 people , one of the victims ' partners has taken state authorities to court for not having done enough to save lives .
it 's reopened questions underlying the tragedy . on april 26 , 2002 , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser gunned down 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman within minutes at his former high school in the eastern german town of erfurt .
he then shot himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police at the erfurt high school shooting the bloodbath stunned the nation and left a stain on the sleepy german town in the state of thuringia .
a national debate broke out on the link between vicious computer games , which steinhäuser was addicted to , and increasing violence among teenagers .
at the time , critical voices were also raised about the role of the local police and whether they had done enough to save victims ' lives . now , almost two years later , erfurt lawyer eric langer , who lost his partner , an art teacher , during the massacre , is ensuring that the same questions are kept alive .
langer filed a case against the state of thuringia this week , accusing those responsible for the police action on the day of the shoot-out , of acting too late or irresponsibly in five cases .
langer , who has carried out his own research into the incident and personally spoken to about 70 witnesses , believes that three teachers and two students died only one to two hours after they were fatally injured by steinhäuser .
though there is no way of knowing if they could have been saved , langer says it 's incomprehensible that no attempt was made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lawyer has also accused the various emergency services of disastrous coordination efforts .
" each emergency service waited for the next one with the result that the entire deployment was paralysed , " langer told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . langer also described the entire operation as " entirely chaotic , " with several students and police officers not even aware that paramedics had been allowed to enter the school building .
langer 's own partner , birgit dettke , is said to have laid crying in vain for help for almost an hour and a half in the schoolyard , just meters away from policemen . no mention of police failures a 43-page investigative report compiled by thuringia 's interior ministry two months after the massacre , however , assumed that , " all victims would have had no chance of survival even if they had undergone an immediate emergency operation . "
langer has slammed the report for ignoring the alleged failures of the police operation . nor had the report , which was originally meant to be just an interim assessment , been pursued further .
it was only in january this year that thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , commissioned his justice minister to open a detailed probe into the massacre after facing pressure from an opposition political parties and langer 's threat to take the matter to the court . bodo ramelow of the party of democratic socialism is also pushing the government to implement a tighter weapons law than the existing one , introduce school reforms and make more provisions for traumatized victims . book on massacre causes controversy the issue has been lent urgency with the publication of the controversial part-fiction book " das reicht für heute " -lrb- that 's enough for today -rrb- by german author ines geipel .
geipel , who wrote the story through the perspective of a fictitious former student , has accused the police of inaction and criticized efforts by the thuringia government to bury fundamental debates and questions that sprung up in the aftermath of the shooting . geipel , however , has been publicly slammed by both teachers and students from the high school where the massacre took place as a sensation-seeker .

almost two years after a school massacre killed 16 people , one of the victims ' partners has taken state authorities to court for not having done enough to save lives .
it 's reopened questions underlying the tragedy . on april 26 , 2002 , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser gunned down 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman within minutes at his former high school in the eastern german town of erfurt .
he then shot himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police at the erfurt high school shooting the bloodbath stunned the nation and left a stain on the sleepy german town in the state of thuringia .
a national debate broke out on the link between vicious computer games , which steinhäuser was addicted to , and increasing violence among teenagers .
at the time , critical voices were also raised about the role of the local police and whether they had done enough to save victims ' lives . now , almost two years later , erfurt lawyer eric langer , who lost his partner , an art teacher , during the massacre , is ensuring that the same questions are kept alive .
langer filed a case against the state of thuringia this week , accusing those responsible for the police action on the day of the shoot-out , of acting too late or irresponsibly in five cases .
langer , who has carried out his own research into the incident and personally spoken to about 70 witnesses , believes that three teachers and two students died only one to two hours after they were fatally injured by steinhäuser .
though there is no way of knowing if they could have been saved , langer says it 's incomprehensible that no attempt was made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lawyer has also accused the various emergency services of disastrous coordination efforts .
" each emergency service waited for the next one with the result that the entire deployment was paralysed , " langer told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . langer also described the entire operation as " entirely chaotic , " with several students and police officers not even aware that paramedics had been allowed to enter the school building .
langer 's own partner , birgit dettke , is said to have laid crying in vain for help for almost an hour and a half in the schoolyard , just meters away from policemen . no mention of police failures a 43-page investigative report compiled by thuringia 's interior ministry two months after the massacre , however , assumed that , " all victims would have had no chance of survival even if they had undergone an immediate emergency operation . "
langer has slammed the report for ignoring the alleged failures of the police operation . nor had the report , which was originally meant to be just an interim assessment , been pursued further .
it was only in january this year that thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , commissioned his justice minister to open a detailed probe into the massacre after facing pressure from an opposition political parties and langer 's threat to take the matter to the court . bodo ramelow of the party of democratic socialism is also pushing the government to implement a tighter weapons law than the existing one , introduce school reforms and make more provisions for traumatized victims . book on massacre causes controversy the issue has been lent urgency with the publication of the controversial part-fiction book " das reicht für heute " -lrb- that 's enough for today -rrb- by german author ines geipel .
geipel , who wrote the story through the perspective of a fictitious former student , has accused the police of inaction and criticized efforts by the thuringia government to bury fundamental debates and questions that sprung up in the aftermath of the shooting . geipel , however , has been publicly slammed by both teachers and students from the high school where the massacre took place as a sensation-seeker .

new line cinema has acquired the film rights to best-selling german children 's author cornelia funke 's fantasy novel " inkheart . "
it 's an unprecedented success for a german writer . many writers dream that one day they 'll hit the hollywood jackpot , with movie moguls slugging it out to see which top studio snags the rights to the big-screen version of their book .
britain 's j.k.rowling did it with her famous " harry potter " series , but german writers generally do n't make much of a splash in tinseltown .
that may be changing , thanks to the hamburg-based writer cornelia funke . in recent months the 44-year-old mother of two has found herself in the middle of a frantic tussle between heyday films and new line cinema , both desperate to secure movie rights to her book " inkheart . "
new line cinema has won and has signed her up for a three-movie deal - similar to the hugely successful harry potter series produced by heyday films - which will also cover the subsequent two volumes in funke 's planned trilogy .
the second part of the series is due for publication in germany later this year .
in an interview with dw-tv , funke was still reeling from her sudden a-list status , saying " all these famous names were being bandied around … .tom hanks … .brad pitt … the names kept on coming at me , they talked about taking $ 50 million in the first weekend … it was everything you imagine hollywood to be . "
runaway success at home and abroad cornelia funke is germany 's bestselling children 's author after j. k. rowling and r. l. stine .
born in 1958 , she began her career as an illustrator , but soon became bored of the books she was working with and decided to go it alone .
she published her first novel at the age of 28 and now has some 40 titles to her name .
german publisher cecilie dressler verlag has sold some 2.5 million of her books in germany alone , and she 's been translated into around 26 languages .
a slow-burning success at home as well as in far-flung countries such as japan and sweden , she still had to wait a while to be noticed by english-language publishers .
with english-language markets notoriously slow to pick up on foreign fiction , it was n't until 2002 that the prolific author made her debut in the u.k. and the u.s. with " the thief lord , " which fast became a new york times bestseller and scooped several european children 's literature awards .
it 's also the first of funke 's novels to get a movie treatment , with filming set to begin in venice this spring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publishers then wasted no time releasing " inkheart " in late 2003 .
still no .
7 after 20 weeks on the new york times bestseller list , it 's even giving illustrious rival authors such as rowling and lemony snicket a run for their money .
scholastic promptly rushed out funke 's " the princess knight " in february , and is now eagerly awaiting the second part of the inkheart trilogy , " inkblood " , which was recently delivered for english translation and will be published world-wide next year .
following the footsteps of j.k. rowling fêted by the english-language press , funke realized it would n't be long before hollywood came knocking .
fortunately for her , her brand of fantasy fiction seemed to capture the zeitgeist perfectly , and the studios were soon queuing up to get in on the act .
with its " lord of the rings " trilogy down and dusted - and currently basking in oscar glory - , new line in particular was looking around for another fantasy franchise .
" inkheart " is a fast-paced adventure story about a young girl whose father has the power to bring characters from books to life .
when he 's kidnapped by a power-hungry villain from a rare children 's fable , his daughter gets together with a group of friends both real and imagined to set things right .
in an interview with the guardian last october , funke stressed that she would be signing with the studio most likely to give her creative control .
" what for me is most important , and what disturbs especially the americans , is that i do n't talk about money , " she said .
" i could do a bidding war , but i do n't want to , because the only thing that interests me is creative control , and they do n't like that . "
however , now that funke has clinched the deal , she seems to be content that the studio " will stay true to my book .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.03.2004 kerry promises a kinder , gentler foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry wants to see a " new era of alliances . "
now that john kerry has locked up the democratic nomination , the next stage begins in his fight against george w. bush .
kerry says if elected he 'll change u.s. foreign policy and renew frayed alliances . kerry 's coast-to-coast victories in the super tuesday primaries and caucuses means the 60-year-old democratic senator from massachusetts will be george w. bush 's opponent in the november election .
but even before cementing the nomination , kerry has been laying out a vision of international affairs that lies in stark contrast to the one pursued by president bush and which europeans and much of the world will probably find more to their liking . while the bush campaign will focus on the danger of terrorism and the president 's role as commander-in-chief during the election fight , kerry seems determined not to let the republicans gain the advantage on security and international affairs .
he has been relentless in his criticism of white house foreign policy . " the bush administration has run the most inept , reckless , arrogant and ideological foreign policy in the modern history of our country , " kerry often says on the stump . kerry has continued to paint a bleak picture of bush 's foreign policy and his approach to terrorism in his speeches in recent weeks and says he would take a radically different approach to fighting the danger of terrorism and ensuring america 's security . " no matter how much power we have , we can not prevail single-handedly , " he has said .
" we have to work with the international community to define a global strategy that is inclusive , not exclusive , collective and not imperial . " rebuilding bridges kerry says he would break with several tenets of the bush administration , which he accuses of abandoning belief in collective security , respect for international institutions , international law and multilateral engagement . kerry promises a " new era of alliances " and says he would make an aggressive effort to rebuild " frayed and shredded " relationships , especially with nato allies .
he says he would call an international summit to draw up a common anti-terrorism and security agenda and pledges to return to the use of diplomacy as a tool for foreign policy and treat the un as a " full partner . " " we will renew our alliances and we will build new alliances because they are essential to the final victory and success of a war on terror , " he told supporters in one speech . a kerry administration would reengage the u.s. in the fight against global warming , the candidate has said , in sharp contrast to the bush white house , which turned its back on the kyoto protocol on climate change three years ago . putting the stress on dialog bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john kerry in 1969 with members of his crew aboard pcf-31 in the mekong delta during the war in vietnam .
kerry , who is a both a vietnam veteran and former anti-war protester and worked toward normalization of ties with hanoi , says he understands the importance of dialog and diplomacy and the dangers of bullying with a big stick . he says once in office , he will put the united nations in charge of rebuilding iraq and establish a " reasonable plan and specific timetable " for restoring self-government and not engage in a rush to hand back power . in a speech last friday in los angeles , kerry vowed that if elected , he will revamp u.s. intelligence agencies and begin diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing islamic youth from embracing radicalism . ties to europe kerry 's vision of his administration 's foreign policy have been greeted with enthusiasm from many in europe , where anti-bush sentiment is high .
the bush administration has alienated many of its closest allies , particularly france and germany , over the iraq war and its dismissive attitude toward the " old world . "

"
now that john kerry has locked up the democratic nomination , the next stage begins in his fight against george w. bush .
kerry says if elected he 'll change u.s. foreign policy and renew frayed alliances . kerry 's coast-to-coast victories in the super tuesday primaries and caucuses means the 60-year-old democratic senator from massachusetts will be george w. bush 's opponent in the november election .
but even before cementing the nomination , kerry has been laying out a vision of international affairs that lies in stark contrast to the one pursued by president bush and which europeans and much of the world will probably find more to their liking . while the bush campaign will focus on the danger of terrorism and the president 's role as commander-in-chief during the election fight , kerry seems determined not to let the republicans gain the advantage on security and international affairs .
he has been relentless in his criticism of white house foreign policy . " the bush administration has run the most inept , reckless , arrogant and ideological foreign policy in the modern history of our country , " kerry often says on the stump . kerry has continued to paint a bleak picture of bush 's foreign policy and his approach to terrorism in his speeches in recent weeks and says he would take a radically different approach to fighting the danger of terrorism and ensuring america 's security . " no matter how much power we have , we can not prevail single-handedly , " he has said .
" we have to work with the international community to define a global strategy that is inclusive , not exclusive , collective and not imperial . " rebuilding bridges kerry says he would break with several tenets of the bush administration , which he accuses of abandoning belief in collective security , respect for international institutions , international law and multilateral engagement . kerry promises a " new era of alliances " and says he would make an aggressive effort to rebuild " frayed and shredded " relationships , especially with nato allies .
he says he would call an international summit to draw up a common anti-terrorism and security agenda and pledges to return to the use of diplomacy as a tool for foreign policy and treat the un as a " full partner . " " we will renew our alliances and we will build new alliances because they are essential to the final victory and success of a war on terror , " he told supporters in one speech . a kerry administration would reengage the u.s. in the fight against global warming , the candidate has said , in sharp contrast to the bush white house , which turned its back on the kyoto protocol on climate change three years ago . putting the stress on dialog bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john kerry in 1969 with members of his crew aboard pcf-31 in the mekong delta during the war in vietnam .
kerry , who is a both a vietnam veteran and former anti-war protester and worked toward normalization of ties with hanoi , says he understands the importance of dialog and diplomacy and the dangers of bullying with a big stick . he says once in office , he will put the united nations in charge of rebuilding iraq and establish a " reasonable plan and specific timetable " for restoring self-government and not engage in a rush to hand back power . in a speech last friday in los angeles , kerry vowed that if elected , he will revamp u.s. intelligence agencies and begin diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing islamic youth from embracing radicalism . ties to europe kerry 's vision of his administration 's foreign policy have been greeted with enthusiasm from many in europe , where anti-bush sentiment is high .
the bush administration has alienated many of its closest allies , particularly france and germany , over the iraq war and its dismissive attitude toward the " old world . "

it demanded changes in the six-year old law . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe said the current law that allows authorities to eavesdrop on conversations in private homes was unconstitutional and must be rectified by june 2005 . three politicians from germany 's small fdp party had brought the complaint , even though the liberals were part of former chancellor helmut kohl 's government when the law was passed six years ago . aiming to fight organized crime and terrorism , it was highly controversial at the time , because of the country 's history of the nazi police state , and following decades of surveillance by the east german secret police , the stasi . however , fdp politicians sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , gerhart baum und burkhard hirsch opposed the law on the grounds that it violates constitutional privacy guarantees , and that it has n't helped solve any major cases . new rules according to the latest ruling , bugging of phones in private homes should only be allowed in cases where there is a suspicion of a serious offense that could carry a prison sentence of more than five years . up to now , phone surveillance was allowed in the case of offenses that carried lesser sentences . in addition , surveillance must be immediately cut when the conversation is clearly of a private nature , or when people under surveillance are speaking in their homes to close relatives , doctors , priests or defense lawyers who are not themselves suspects . the court 's decision argues that the protecting private homes is part of protecting human dignity , and that only surveillance that protect human dignity should be permitted . " it is not necessarily a violation of human dignity if someone is put under observation , " court justice hans-juergen papier said , according to a report by the associated press .
" but in such cases , the core area of privacy must be safeguarded . " the german government says eavesdropping is used only as a last resort .

"
now that john kerry has locked up the democratic nomination , the next stage begins in his fight against george w. bush .
kerry says if elected he 'll change u.s. foreign policy and renew frayed alliances . kerry 's coast-to-coast victories in the super tuesday primaries and caucuses means the 60-year-old democratic senator from massachusetts will be george w. bush 's opponent in the november election .
but even before cementing the nomination , kerry has been laying out a vision of international affairs that lies in stark contrast to the one pursued by president bush and which europeans and much of the world will probably find more to their liking . while the bush campaign will focus on the danger of terrorism and the president 's role as commander-in-chief during the election fight , kerry seems determined not to let the republicans gain the advantage on security and international affairs .
he has been relentless in his criticism of white house foreign policy . " the bush administration has run the most inept , reckless , arrogant and ideological foreign policy in the modern history of our country , " kerry often says on the stump . kerry has continued to paint a bleak picture of bush 's foreign policy and his approach to terrorism in his speeches in recent weeks and says he would take a radically different approach to fighting the danger of terrorism and ensuring america 's security . " no matter how much power we have , we can not prevail single-handedly , " he has said .
" we have to work with the international community to define a global strategy that is inclusive , not exclusive , collective and not imperial . " rebuilding bridges kerry says he would break with several tenets of the bush administration , which he accuses of abandoning belief in collective security , respect for international institutions , international law and multilateral engagement . kerry promises a " new era of alliances " and says he would make an aggressive effort to rebuild " frayed and shredded " relationships , especially with nato allies .
he says he would call an international summit to draw up a common anti-terrorism and security agenda and pledges to return to the use of diplomacy as a tool for foreign policy and treat the un as a " full partner . " " we will renew our alliances and we will build new alliances because they are essential to the final victory and success of a war on terror , " he told supporters in one speech . a kerry administration would reengage the u.s. in the fight against global warming , the candidate has said , in sharp contrast to the bush white house , which turned its back on the kyoto protocol on climate change three years ago . putting the stress on dialog bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john kerry in 1969 with members of his crew aboard pcf-31 in the mekong delta during the war in vietnam .
kerry , who is a both a vietnam veteran and former anti-war protester and worked toward normalization of ties with hanoi , says he understands the importance of dialog and diplomacy and the dangers of bullying with a big stick . he says once in office , he will put the united nations in charge of rebuilding iraq and establish a " reasonable plan and specific timetable " for restoring self-government and not engage in a rush to hand back power . in a speech last friday in los angeles , kerry vowed that if elected , he will revamp u.s. intelligence agencies and begin diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing islamic youth from embracing radicalism . ties to europe kerry 's vision of his administration 's foreign policy have been greeted with enthusiasm from many in europe , where anti-bush sentiment is high .
the bush administration has alienated many of its closest allies , particularly france and germany , over the iraq war and its dismissive attitude toward the " old world . "
though bush and chancellor gerhard schröder recently met at the white house and publicly put their differences over iraq behind them , relations between them can not be described as close . while bush has had limited foreign travel experience - when he was 21 he listed his only foreign travel as a vacation trip to scotland - kerry attended a swiss boarding school and when he receives envoys from paris in washington , he chats with them in fluent french .
his wife , teresa heinz kerry , was born in mozambique , studied in south africa and switzerland and is fluent in five languages herself . " bush has managed to offend everybody , " said ruth oldenziel , an american history professor at the university of amsterdam , in an interview with dutch radio .

almost two years after a school massacre killed 16 people , one of the victims ' partners has taken state authorities to court for not having done enough to save lives .
it 's reopened questions underlying the tragedy . on april 26 , 2002 , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser gunned down 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman within minutes at his former high school in the eastern german town of erfurt .
he then shot himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police at the erfurt high school shooting the bloodbath stunned the nation and left a stain on the sleepy german town in the state of thuringia .
a national debate broke out on the link between vicious computer games , which steinhäuser was addicted to , and increasing violence among teenagers .
at the time , critical voices were also raised about the role of the local police and whether they had done enough to save victims ' lives . now , almost two years later , erfurt lawyer eric langer , who lost his partner , an art teacher , during the massacre , is ensuring that the same questions are kept alive .
langer filed a case against the state of thuringia this week , accusing those responsible for the police action on the day of the shoot-out , of acting too late or irresponsibly in five cases .
langer , who has carried out his own research into the incident and personally spoken to about 70 witnesses , believes that three teachers and two students died only one to two hours after they were fatally injured by steinhäuser .
though there is no way of knowing if they could have been saved , langer says it 's incomprehensible that no attempt was made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lawyer has also accused the various emergency services of disastrous coordination efforts .
" each emergency service waited for the next one with the result that the entire deployment was paralysed , " langer told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . langer also described the entire operation as " entirely chaotic , " with several students and police officers not even aware that paramedics had been allowed to enter the school building .
langer 's own partner , birgit dettke , is said to have laid crying in vain for help for almost an hour and a half in the schoolyard , just meters away from policemen . no mention of police failures a 43-page investigative report compiled by thuringia 's interior ministry two months after the massacre , however , assumed that , " all victims would have had no chance of survival even if they had undergone an immediate emergency operation . "
langer has slammed the report for ignoring the alleged failures of the police operation . nor had the report , which was originally meant to be just an interim assessment , been pursued further .
it was only in january this year that thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , commissioned his justice minister to open a detailed probe into the massacre after facing pressure from an opposition political parties and langer 's threat to take the matter to the court . bodo ramelow of the party of democratic socialism is also pushing the government to implement a tighter weapons law than the existing one , introduce school reforms and make more provisions for traumatized victims . book on massacre causes controversy the issue has been lent urgency with the publication of the controversial part-fiction book " das reicht für heute " -lrb- that 's enough for today -rrb- by german author ines geipel .
geipel , who wrote the story through the perspective of a fictitious former student , has accused the police of inaction and criticized efforts by the thuringia government to bury fundamental debates and questions that sprung up in the aftermath of the shooting . geipel , however , has been publicly slammed by both teachers and students from the high school where the massacre took place as a sensation-seeker .

langer , who has carried out his own research into the incident and personally spoken to about 70 witnesses , believes that three teachers and two students died only one to two hours after they were fatally injured by steinhäuser .
though there is no way of knowing if they could have been saved , langer says it 's incomprehensible that no attempt was made .

langer 's own partner , birgit dettke , is said to have laid crying in vain for help for almost an hour and a half in the schoolyard , just meters away from policemen . no mention of police failures a 43-page investigative report compiled by thuringia 's interior ministry two months after the massacre , however , assumed that , " all victims would have had no chance of survival even if they had undergone an immediate emergency operation .

langer has slammed the report for ignoring the alleged failures of the police operation . nor had the report , which was originally meant to be just an interim assessment , been pursued further .

"
now that john kerry has locked up the democratic nomination , the next stage begins in his fight against george w. bush .
kerry says if elected he 'll change u.s. foreign policy and renew frayed alliances . kerry 's coast-to-coast victories in the super tuesday primaries and caucuses means the 60-year-old democratic senator from massachusetts will be george w. bush 's opponent in the november election .
but even before cementing the nomination , kerry has been laying out a vision of international affairs that lies in stark contrast to the one pursued by president bush and which europeans and much of the world will probably find more to their liking . while the bush campaign will focus on the danger of terrorism and the president 's role as commander-in-chief during the election fight , kerry seems determined not to let the republicans gain the advantage on security and international affairs .
he has been relentless in his criticism of white house foreign policy . " the bush administration has run the most inept , reckless , arrogant and ideological foreign policy in the modern history of our country , " kerry often says on the stump . kerry has continued to paint a bleak picture of bush 's foreign policy and his approach to terrorism in his speeches in recent weeks and says he would take a radically different approach to fighting the danger of terrorism and ensuring america 's security . " no matter how much power we have , we can not prevail single-handedly , " he has said .
" we have to work with the international community to define a global strategy that is inclusive , not exclusive , collective and not imperial . " rebuilding bridges kerry says he would break with several tenets of the bush administration , which he accuses of abandoning belief in collective security , respect for international institutions , international law and multilateral engagement . kerry promises a " new era of alliances " and says he would make an aggressive effort to rebuild " frayed and shredded " relationships , especially with nato allies .
he says he would call an international summit to draw up a common anti-terrorism and security agenda and pledges to return to the use of diplomacy as a tool for foreign policy and treat the un as a " full partner . " " we will renew our alliances and we will build new alliances because they are essential to the final victory and success of a war on terror , " he told supporters in one speech . a kerry administration would reengage the u.s. in the fight against global warming , the candidate has said , in sharp contrast to the bush white house , which turned its back on the kyoto protocol on climate change three years ago . putting the stress on dialog bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john kerry in 1969 with members of his crew aboard pcf-31 in the mekong delta during the war in vietnam .
kerry , who is a both a vietnam veteran and former anti-war protester and worked toward normalization of ties with hanoi , says he understands the importance of dialog and diplomacy and the dangers of bullying with a big stick . he says once in office , he will put the united nations in charge of rebuilding iraq and establish a " reasonable plan and specific timetable " for restoring self-government and not engage in a rush to hand back power . in a speech last friday in los angeles , kerry vowed that if elected , he will revamp u.s. intelligence agencies and begin diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing islamic youth from embracing radicalism . ties to europe kerry 's vision of his administration 's foreign policy have been greeted with enthusiasm from many in europe , where anti-bush sentiment is high .
the bush administration has alienated many of its closest allies , particularly france and germany , over the iraq war and its dismissive attitude toward the " old world . "
though bush and chancellor gerhard schröder recently met at the white house and publicly put their differences over iraq behind them , relations between them can not be described as close . while bush has had limited foreign travel experience - when he was 21 he listed his only foreign travel as a vacation trip to scotland - kerry attended a swiss boarding school and when he receives envoys from paris in washington , he chats with them in fluent french .
his wife , teresa heinz kerry , was born in mozambique , studied in south africa and switzerland and is fluent in five languages herself . " bush has managed to offend everybody , " said ruth oldenziel , an american history professor at the university of amsterdam , in an interview with dutch radio .
" kerry is well travelled , he has been to vietnam , he 's very well read , he has a sense of belonging , and has a background in europe , so i think to europeans he 's going to be a welcome change .

almost two years after a school massacre killed 16 people , one of the victims ' partners has taken state authorities to court for not having done enough to save lives .
it 's reopened questions underlying the tragedy . on april 26 , 2002 , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser gunned down 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman within minutes at his former high school in the eastern german town of erfurt .
he then shot himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police at the erfurt high school shooting the bloodbath stunned the nation and left a stain on the sleepy german town in the state of thuringia .

germany 's highest court ruled on wednesday that telephone surveillance as currently practiced is unconstitutional .
it demanded changes in the six-year old law . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe said the current law that allows authorities to eavesdrop on conversations in private homes was unconstitutional and must be rectified by june 2005 . three politicians from germany 's small fdp party had brought the complaint , even though the liberals were part of former chancellor helmut kohl 's government when the law was passed six years ago . aiming to fight organized crime and terrorism , it was highly controversial at the time , because of the country 's history of the nazi police state , and following decades of surveillance by the east german secret police , the stasi . however , fdp politicians sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , gerhart baum und burkhard hirsch opposed the law on the grounds that it violates constitutional privacy guarantees , and that it has n't helped solve any major cases . new rules according to the latest ruling , bugging of phones in private homes should only be allowed in cases where there is a suspicion of a serious offense that could carry a prison sentence of more than five years . up to now , phone surveillance was allowed in the case of offenses that carried lesser sentences . in addition , surveillance must be immediately cut when the conversation is clearly of a private nature , or when people under surveillance are speaking in their homes to close relatives , doctors , priests or defense lawyers who are not themselves suspects . the court 's decision argues that the protecting private homes is part of protecting human dignity , and that only surveillance that protect human dignity should be permitted . " it is not necessarily a violation of human dignity if someone is put under observation , " court justice hans-juergen papier said , according to a report by the associated press .
" but in such cases , the core area of privacy must be safeguarded . " the german government says eavesdropping is used only as a last resort .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.03.2004 kerry promises a kinder , gentler foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kerry wants to see a " new era of alliances . "
now that john kerry has locked up the democratic nomination , the next stage begins in his fight against george w. bush .
kerry says if elected he 'll change u.s. foreign policy and renew frayed alliances . kerry 's coast-to-coast victories in the super tuesday primaries and caucuses means the 60-year-old democratic senator from massachusetts will be george w. bush 's opponent in the november election .
but even before cementing the nomination , kerry has been laying out a vision of international affairs that lies in stark contrast to the one pursued by president bush and which europeans and much of the world will probably find more to their liking . while the bush campaign will focus on the danger of terrorism and the president 's role as commander-in-chief during the election fight , kerry seems determined not to let the republicans gain the advantage on security and international affairs .
he has been relentless in his criticism of white house foreign policy . " the bush administration has run the most inept , reckless , arrogant and ideological foreign policy in the modern history of our country , " kerry often says on the stump . kerry has continued to paint a bleak picture of bush 's foreign policy and his approach to terrorism in his speeches in recent weeks and says he would take a radically different approach to fighting the danger of terrorism and ensuring america 's security . " no matter how much power we have , we can not prevail single-handedly , " he has said .
" we have to work with the international community to define a global strategy that is inclusive , not exclusive , collective and not imperial . " rebuilding bridges kerry says he would break with several tenets of the bush administration , which he accuses of abandoning belief in collective security , respect for international institutions , international law and multilateral engagement . kerry promises a " new era of alliances " and says he would make an aggressive effort to rebuild " frayed and shredded " relationships , especially with nato allies .
he says he would call an international summit to draw up a common anti-terrorism and security agenda and pledges to return to the use of diplomacy as a tool for foreign policy and treat the un as a " full partner . " " we will renew our alliances and we will build new alliances because they are essential to the final victory and success of a war on terror , " he told supporters in one speech . a kerry administration would reengage the u.s. in the fight against global warming , the candidate has said , in sharp contrast to the bush white house , which turned its back on the kyoto protocol on climate change three years ago . putting the stress on dialog bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john kerry in 1969 with members of his crew aboard pcf-31 in the mekong delta during the war in vietnam .
kerry , who is a both a vietnam veteran and former anti-war protester and worked toward normalization of ties with hanoi , says he understands the importance of dialog and diplomacy and the dangers of bullying with a big stick . he says once in office , he will put the united nations in charge of rebuilding iraq and establish a " reasonable plan and specific timetable " for restoring self-government and not engage in a rush to hand back power . in a speech last friday in los angeles , kerry vowed that if elected , he will revamp u.s. intelligence agencies and begin diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing islamic youth from embracing radicalism . ties to europe kerry 's vision of his administration 's foreign policy have been greeted with enthusiasm from many in europe , where anti-bush sentiment is high .
the bush administration has alienated many of its closest allies , particularly france and germany , over the iraq war and its dismissive attitude toward the " old world . "
though bush and chancellor gerhard schröder recently met at the white house and publicly put their differences over iraq behind them , relations between them can not be described as close . while bush has had limited foreign travel experience - when he was 21 he listed his only foreign travel as a vacation trip to scotland - kerry attended a swiss boarding school and when he receives envoys from paris in washington , he chats with them in fluent french .
his wife , teresa heinz kerry , was born in mozambique , studied in south africa and switzerland and is fluent in five languages herself . " bush has managed to offend everybody , " said ruth oldenziel , an american history professor at the university of amsterdam , in an interview with dutch radio .
" kerry is well travelled , he has been to vietnam , he 's very well read , he has a sense of belonging , and has a background in europe , so i think to europeans he 's going to be a welcome change .

almost two years after a school massacre killed 16 people , one of the victims ' partners has taken state authorities to court for not having done enough to save lives .
it 's reopened questions underlying the tragedy . on april 26 , 2002 , 19-year-old robert steinhäuser gunned down 12 teachers , two students , a secretary and a policeman within minutes at his former high school in the eastern german town of erfurt .
he then shot himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police at the erfurt high school shooting the bloodbath stunned the nation and left a stain on the sleepy german town in the state of thuringia .
a national debate broke out on the link between vicious computer games , which steinhäuser was addicted to , and increasing violence among teenagers .
at the time , critical voices were also raised about the role of the local police and whether they had done enough to save victims ' lives . now , almost two years later , erfurt lawyer eric langer , who lost his partner , an art teacher , during the massacre , is ensuring that the same questions are kept alive .
langer filed a case against the state of thuringia this week , accusing those responsible for the police action on the day of the shoot-out , of acting too late or irresponsibly in five cases .
langer , who has carried out his own research into the incident and personally spoken to about 70 witnesses , believes that three teachers and two students died only one to two hours after they were fatally injured by steinhäuser .
though there is no way of knowing if they could have been saved , langer says it 's incomprehensible that no attempt was made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lawyer has also accused the various emergency services of disastrous coordination efforts .
" each emergency service waited for the next one with the result that the entire deployment was paralysed , " langer told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . langer also described the entire operation as " entirely chaotic , " with several students and police officers not even aware that paramedics had been allowed to enter the school building .
langer 's own partner , birgit dettke , is said to have laid crying in vain for help for almost an hour and a half in the schoolyard , just meters away from policemen . no mention of police failures a 43-page investigative report compiled by thuringia 's interior ministry two months after the massacre , however , assumed that , " all victims would have had no chance of survival even if they had undergone an immediate emergency operation . "
langer has slammed the report for ignoring the alleged failures of the police operation . nor had the report , which was originally meant to be just an interim assessment , been pursued further .
it was only in january this year that thuringia 's premier , dieter althaus , commissioned his justice minister to open a detailed probe into the massacre after facing pressure from an opposition political parties and langer 's threat to take the matter to the court . bodo ramelow of the party of democratic socialism is also pushing the government to implement a tighter weapons law than the existing one , introduce school reforms and make more provisions for traumatized victims . book on massacre causes controversy the issue has been lent urgency with the publication of the controversial part-fiction book " das reicht für heute " -lrb- that 's enough for today -rrb- by german author ines geipel .
geipel , who wrote the story through the perspective of a fictitious former student , has accused the police of inaction and criticized efforts by the thuringia government to bury fundamental debates and questions that sprung up in the aftermath of the shooting . geipel , however , has been publicly slammed by both teachers and students from the high school where the massacre took place as a sensation-seeker .

new line cinema has acquired the film rights to best-selling german children 's author cornelia funke 's fantasy novel " inkheart . "
it 's an unprecedented success for a german writer . many writers dream that one day they 'll hit the hollywood jackpot , with movie moguls slugging it out to see which top studio snags the rights to the big-screen version of their book .
britain 's j.k.rowling did it with her famous " harry potter " series , but german writers generally do n't make much of a splash in tinseltown .
that may be changing , thanks to the hamburg-based writer cornelia funke . in recent months the 44-year-old mother of two has found herself in the middle of a frantic tussle between heyday films and new line cinema , both desperate to secure movie rights to her book " inkheart . "
new line cinema has won and has signed her up for a three-movie deal - similar to the hugely successful harry potter series produced by heyday films - which will also cover the subsequent two volumes in funke 's planned trilogy .
the second part of the series is due for publication in germany later this year .
in an interview with dw-tv , funke was still reeling from her sudden a-list status , saying " all these famous names were being bandied around … .tom hanks … .brad pitt … the names kept on coming at me , they talked about taking $ 50 million in the first weekend … it was everything you imagine hollywood to be . "
runaway success at home and abroad cornelia funke is germany 's bestselling children 's author after j. k. rowling and r. l. stine .
born in 1958 , she began her career as an illustrator , but soon became bored of the books she was working with and decided to go it alone .
she published her first novel at the age of 28 and now has some 40 titles to her name .
german publisher cecilie dressler verlag has sold some 2.5 million of her books in germany alone , and she 's been translated into around 26 languages .
a slow-burning success at home as well as in far-flung countries such as japan and sweden , she still had to wait a while to be noticed by english-language publishers .
with english-language markets notoriously slow to pick up on foreign fiction , it was n't until 2002 that the prolific author made her debut in the u.k. and the u.s. with " the thief lord , " which fast became a new york times bestseller and scooped several european children 's literature awards .
it 's also the first of funke 's novels to get a movie treatment , with filming set to begin in venice this spring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publishers then wasted no time releasing " inkheart " in late 2003 .
still no .

new line cinema has acquired the film rights to best-selling german children 's author cornelia funke 's fantasy novel " inkheart . "
it 's an unprecedented success for a german writer . many writers dream that one day they 'll hit the hollywood jackpot , with movie moguls slugging it out to see which top studio snags the rights to the big-screen version of their book .
britain 's j.k.rowling did it with her famous " harry potter " series , but german writers generally do n't make much of a splash in tinseltown .
that may be changing , thanks to the hamburg-based writer cornelia funke . in recent months the 44-year-old mother of two has found herself in the middle of a frantic tussle between heyday films and new line cinema , both desperate to secure movie rights to her book " inkheart . "
new line cinema has won and has signed her up for a three-movie deal - similar to the hugely successful harry potter series produced by heyday films - which will also cover the subsequent two volumes in funke 's planned trilogy .
the second part of the series is due for publication in germany later this year .
in an interview with dw-tv , funke was still reeling from her sudden a-list status , saying " all these famous names were being bandied around … .tom hanks … .brad pitt … the names kept on coming at me , they talked about taking $ 50 million in the first weekend … it was everything you imagine hollywood to be . "
runaway success at home and abroad cornelia funke is germany 's bestselling children 's author after j. k. rowling and r. l. stine .
born in 1958 , she began her career as an illustrator , but soon became bored of the books she was working with and decided to go it alone .
she published her first novel at the age of 28 and now has some 40 titles to her name .
german publisher cecilie dressler verlag has sold some 2.5 million of her books in germany alone , and she 's been translated into around 26 languages .
a slow-burning success at home as well as in far-flung countries such as japan and sweden , she still had to wait a while to be noticed by english-language publishers .
with english-language markets notoriously slow to pick up on foreign fiction , it was n't until 2002 that the prolific author made her debut in the u.k. and the u.s. with " the thief lord , " which fast became a new york times bestseller and scooped several european children 's literature awards .
it 's also the first of funke 's novels to get a movie treatment , with filming set to begin in venice this spring .

germany 's highest court ruled on wednesday that telephone surveillance as currently practiced is unconstitutional .
it demanded changes in the six-year old law . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe said the current law that allows authorities to eavesdrop on conversations in private homes was unconstitutional and must be rectified by june 2005 . three politicians from germany 's small fdp party had brought the complaint , even though the liberals were part of former chancellor helmut kohl 's government when the law was passed six years ago . aiming to fight organized crime and terrorism , it was highly controversial at the time , because of the country 's history of the nazi police state , and following decades of surveillance by the east german secret police , the stasi . however , fdp politicians sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , gerhart baum und burkhard hirsch opposed the law on the grounds that it violates constitutional privacy guarantees , and that it has n't helped solve any major cases . new rules according to the latest ruling , bugging of phones in private homes should only be allowed in cases where there is a suspicion of a serious offense that could carry a prison sentence of more than five years . up to now , phone surveillance was allowed in the case of offenses that carried lesser sentences . in addition , surveillance must be immediately cut when the conversation is clearly of a private nature , or when people under surveillance are speaking in their homes to close relatives , doctors , priests or defense lawyers who are not themselves suspects . the court 's decision argues that the protecting private homes is part of protecting human dignity , and that only surveillance that protect human dignity should be permitted . " it is not necessarily a violation of human dignity if someone is put under observation , " court justice hans-juergen papier said , according to a report by the associated press .
" but in such cases , the core area of privacy must be safeguarded . " the german government says eavesdropping is used only as a last resort .

new line cinema has acquired the film rights to best-selling german children 's author cornelia funke 's fantasy novel " inkheart . "
it 's an unprecedented success for a german writer . many writers dream that one day they 'll hit the hollywood jackpot , with movie moguls slugging it out to see which top studio snags the rights to the big-screen version of their book .
britain 's j.k.rowling did it with her famous " harry potter " series , but german writers generally do n't make much of a splash in tinseltown .
that may be changing , thanks to the hamburg-based writer cornelia funke . in recent months the 44-year-old mother of two has found herself in the middle of a frantic tussle between heyday films and new line cinema , both desperate to secure movie rights to her book " inkheart . "
new line cinema has won and has signed her up for a three-movie deal - similar to the hugely successful harry potter series produced by heyday films - which will also cover the subsequent two volumes in funke 's planned trilogy .
the second part of the series is due for publication in germany later this year .
in an interview with dw-tv , funke was still reeling from her sudden a-list status , saying " all these famous names were being bandied around … .tom hanks … .brad pitt … the names kept on coming at me , they talked about taking $ 50 million in the first weekend … it was everything you imagine hollywood to be . "
runaway success at home and abroad cornelia funke is germany 's bestselling children 's author after j. k. rowling and r. l. stine .
born in 1958 , she began her career as an illustrator , but soon became bored of the books she was working with and decided to go it alone .
she published her first novel at the age of 28 and now has some 40 titles to her name .
german publisher cecilie dressler verlag has sold some 2.5 million of her books in germany alone , and she 's been translated into around 26 languages .
a slow-burning success at home as well as in far-flung countries such as japan and sweden , she still had to wait a while to be noticed by english-language publishers .
with english-language markets notoriously slow to pick up on foreign fiction , it was n't until 2002 that the prolific author made her debut in the u.k. and the u.s. with " the thief lord , " which fast became a new york times bestseller and scooped several european children 's literature awards .
it 's also the first of funke 's novels to get a movie treatment , with filming set to begin in venice this spring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publishers then wasted no time releasing " inkheart " in late 2003 .
still no .
7 after 20 weeks on the new york times bestseller list , it 's even giving illustrious rival authors such as rowling and lemony snicket a run for their money .
scholastic promptly rushed out funke 's " the princess knight " in february , and is now eagerly awaiting the second part of the inkheart trilogy , " inkblood " , which was recently delivered for english translation and will be published world-wide next year .
following the footsteps of j.k. rowling fêted by the english-language press , funke realized it would n't be long before hollywood came knocking .
fortunately for her , her brand of fantasy fiction seemed to capture the zeitgeist perfectly , and the studios were soon queuing up to get in on the act .
with its " lord of the rings " trilogy down and dusted - and currently basking in oscar glory - , new line in particular was looking around for another fantasy franchise .
" inkheart " is a fast-paced adventure story about a young girl whose father has the power to bring characters from books to life .
when he 's kidnapped by a power-hungry villain from a rare children 's fable , his daughter gets together with a group of friends both real and imagined to set things right .
in an interview with the guardian last october , funke stressed that she would be signing with the studio most likely to give her creative control .
" what for me is most important , and what disturbs especially the americans , is that i do n't talk about money , " she said .
" i could do a bidding war , but i do n't want to , because the only thing that interests me is creative control , and they do n't like that . "
however , now that funke has clinched the deal , she seems to be content that the studio " will stay true to my book .

prime minister abdullah badawi made the announcement in a brief statement through national news agency bernama .
a final date for the vote has yet to be set , but it is widely expected to be on 20 or 21 march .
the polls - malaysia 's 11th general election - are widely seen as a referendum on the agenda set by the country 's new leader .
the campaign is not likely to begin in earnest until nominations close .
it is predicted that will happen just eight days before the polls , which would make this the shortest contest in malaysia 's history .
margin critical when the country last voted in 1999 , the coalition government suffered one of its worst setbacks in its 47 years in power .
however , this time , the opposition can expect a much tougher task .
the economy is in far better shape than it was four-and-a-half years ago and the issue of the arrest and jailing of the former deputy prime minister , anwar ibrahim , no longer looms as large .
they also face a new prime minister and malaysians have historically swung behind incoming leaders .
the government-controlled media is unlikely to devote much space to opposition views and the police are generally slow to give the government 's opponents permission to organise meetings .
though the government is almost certain to win , the margin of victory will be critical .
without strong gains , the new prime minister is unlikely to be able to see through his anti-corruption campaign .

to some extent , one could have anticipated this .
no candidate in the modern era has ever been so far ahead as mr kerry and gone on to lose .
the real question was when john kerry would win - not whether he would win .
john edwards would have had to win in at least two or three states to justify staying in the race .
he particularly needed to do well in georgia - the only southern state voting on tuesday - because his campaign was based on the idea that he could win in the south where the democrats have had so much trouble in the last two decades .
the writing was on the wall , and many people in the democratic party were saying to mr edwards that he could not keep running if he kept coming in second .
instead of mr edwards winning two or three states , john kerry rolled to victory winning in nine of the 10 super tuesday states .
long road ahead on the one hand , there is no doubt that winning on super tuesday has been great for john kerry .
many democrats see a kerry-edwards ticket as a ' dream team ' in the first place , the candidate is tired .
people have said that he is hoarse , that he looked like he needed a rest .
he really wanted to put this nomination to rest just so that he could recharge his batteries .
perhaps , more importantly , he was very anxious to conserve his funds because it was costing him a lot of money to continue campaigning against his democratic challengers .
money is not in large supply for senator kerry , and president bush is going to be the best financed candidate in the history of american presidential elections .
however , there is a theory amongst some in the democratic party that there is a downside to senator kerry winning so early .
the downside is that it gives president bush a long time - six months - to define senator kerry , to attack him , to use his huge war chest to go after him .
although the kerry campaign is very relieved to have this nomination battle out of the way , it now means that they will be open for many months to attacks from the republicans .
the bush white house will not waste any time with this - those attacks will start later this week .
picking a winning ticket and with the nomination battle over , pundits quickly turned to handicapping mr kerry 's choice for a running mate .
the kerry campaign has said it is that the most important thing in choosing a vice president is finding someone that mr kerry feels could take over the most powerful political job in the world should something happen to him .
kerry and edwards are not reported to get along especially well further down the list , mr kerry will consider how well he gets along personally with a potential running mate and what political advantage that person might bring .
that could be code for saying that mr edwards would not be the top choice .
after all , mr kerry has criticised him on the campaign for not being experienced enough - certainly in the area of foreign affairs .
but the kerry campaign is keeping its options open .
one thing that many democratic party activists say is that mr kerry should choose someone who could guarantee him winning a state in the general election .
perhaps , for example , he might choose senator bob graham of florida because winning that state will be key to winning the election .
others have suggested governor bill richardson of new mexico , who could help mr kerry win not only in new mexico but who might also help him win the hispanic vote in several key states .
and some have even suggested that mr kerry should pick another former primary opponent , dick gephardt , because it would help him in missouri , a key battleground state in the midwest .
but there is a feeling in washington that mr kerry has not made these decisions yet .
he has not closed the option to choosing mr edwards , although they are reported not to get on especially well .
in the end , he will make the decision based on who would help him win the election in november .
and a lot of people think that person would be his former foe , john edwards .

nigeria has been blamed for most of the 419 e-mail scams tracey logan : what has been the impact of the internet on the 419-type of fraud ?
nuhu ribadu : massive because fraudsters can send you something , get you to believe what they are sending and get you to send your money .
they used to do it by telephone or fax , or sending a bogus letter .
the development of the internet makes it a lot easier for them .
they can send thousands and thousands of messages all over the world and get someone hooked .
it has simplified the whole process for them .
the internet is now 80 to 90 % of the way they use to transmit those scam letters .
tl : these scams are widely referred to as the nigerian 419 fraud .
do you accept that it is largely nigerian criminals that are doing this sort of thing ?
nr : it is going on all over the world .
but this particular one has become very popular in nigeria , probably we had this difficulty in bringing people to justice .
it became a successful thing in nigeria and people were making money out of it .
somehow we failed to address the problem .
we failed to stop it .
handful of scammers tl : are the scams run by organised crime ?
nr : it is wrong to say it is organised .
it is a thing that is being done by individuals .
it is an individual thing to do that is easy to do and find very gullible victims , and probably greedy people , who believe they are going to make money out of the thing and in the process lost their money .
we are fighting to ensure their is rule of law in the country .
we do n't want the place to be a haven for criminals nuhu ribadu , economic and financial crimes commission scam victim counts his losses tl : how big a force is the economic and financial crimes commission ?
nr : when we started , the law gave us leverage to bring in people from sister agencies , so we got people seconded to the commission .
right now we are about 200 to 250 people .
when we started the work , we realised there was so much to it , it was unbelievable .
we realised we would have to prioritise .
and we found first that what we ought to concern ourselves with was this 419 thing .
tl : how much has it damaged nigeria 's reputation ?
nr : it has done so much damage to our credibility , our image , our honour .
and there are just a few individuals doing this .
we have some 130 million people in nigeria and i can assure that there are only between 50,000 and 100,000 people involved in this thing .
fraud frontline tl : now a lot of people in nigeria do n't have their own computer and use internet cafes .
do you have enough collaboration from internet cafes themselves ?
nr : we are proposing an amendment to the fraud law .
at the time the law was passed in 1995 , the internet was not too popular and not very widely used as it is today .
so the law did not address the use of the internet .
we are proposing an amendment that will give us adequate authority and power to oversee the internet cafes , banking sector and telecoms companies .
what we intend to do is to tell them that they must police their facilities and not allow them to be used by criminals to defraud and cheat people .
if you allow it , you will be personally liable .
it is the same with the banking sector .
if you allow your bank to dupe someone , you will be personally liable , you will be asked to pay back this money .
tl : you are quite a small force .
how will you face up to the fraudsters ?
nr : no doubt we will have a fight in front of us .
the good thing is we are ready .
we are not going to run away from that .
we are ready to fight .
we look at the work as national service .
we are out there and there is a war going on .
there is no alternative .
we want to show to the whole world that most of us are really concerned about this problem .
we are good people in nigeria .
we are fighting to ensure there is rule of law in the country .

nigeria has been blamed for most of the 419 e-mail scams tracey logan : what has been the impact of the internet on the 419-type of fraud ?
nuhu ribadu : massive because fraudsters can send you something , get you to believe what they are sending and get you to send your money .
they used to do it by telephone or fax , or sending a bogus letter .
the development of the internet makes it a lot easier for them .
they can send thousands and thousands of messages all over the world and get someone hooked .
it has simplified the whole process for them .
the internet is now 80 to 90 % of the way they use to transmit those scam letters .
tl : these scams are widely referred to as the nigerian 419 fraud .
do you accept that it is largely nigerian criminals that are doing this sort of thing ?
nr : it is going on all over the world .
but this particular one has become very popular in nigeria , probably we had this difficulty in bringing people to justice .
it became a successful thing in nigeria and people were making money out of it .
somehow we failed to address the problem .
we failed to stop it .
handful of scammers tl : are the scams run by organised crime ?
nr : it is wrong to say it is organised .
it is a thing that is being done by individuals .
it is an individual thing to do that is easy to do and find very gullible victims , and probably greedy people , who believe they are going to make money out of the thing and in the process lost their money .
we are fighting to ensure their is rule of law in the country .
we do n't want the place to be a haven for criminals nuhu ribadu , economic and financial crimes commission scam victim counts his losses tl : how big a force is the economic and financial crimes commission ?
nr : when we started , the law gave us leverage to bring in people from sister agencies , so we got people seconded to the commission .
right now we are about 200 to 250 people .
when we started the work , we realised there was so much to it , it was unbelievable .
we realised we would have to prioritise .
and we found first that what we ought to concern ourselves with was this 419 thing .
tl : how much has it damaged nigeria 's reputation ?
nr : it has done so much damage to our credibility , our image , our honour .
and there are just a few individuals doing this .
we have some 130 million people in nigeria and i can assure that there are only between 50,000 and 100,000 people involved in this thing .
fraud frontline tl : now a lot of people in nigeria do n't have their own computer and use internet cafes .
do you have enough collaboration from internet cafes themselves ?
nr : we are proposing an amendment to the fraud law .
at the time the law was passed in 1995 , the internet was not too popular and not very widely used as it is today .
so the law did not address the use of the internet .
we are proposing an amendment that will give us adequate authority and power to oversee the internet cafes , banking sector and telecoms companies .
what we intend to do is to tell them that they must police their facilities and not allow them to be used by criminals to defraud and cheat people .
if you allow it , you will be personally liable .
it is the same with the banking sector .
if you allow your bank to dupe someone , you will be personally liable , you will be asked to pay back this money .
tl : you are quite a small force .
how will you face up to the fraudsters ?
nr : no doubt we will have a fight in front of us .
the good thing is we are ready .
we are not going to run away from that .
we are ready to fight .
we look at the work as national service .
we are out there and there is a war going on .
there is no alternative .
we want to show to the whole world that most of us are really concerned about this problem .
we are good people in nigeria .
we are fighting to ensure there is rule of law in the country .
we do n't want the place to be a haven for criminals .
