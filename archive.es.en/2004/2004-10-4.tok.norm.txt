program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 bringing the tropics to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the park will be housed in the world 's largest freestanding dome long famous for its tasty cucumbers , the spreewald region just south of berlin is about to become well-known for rather more exotic flora : asian investors are converting a zeppelin hangar into a tropical rainforest . the denizens of brand , a small community 60 kilometers outside of the german capital berlin , probably think they 've seen it all .
during the cold war their tiny village bordered one of the soviet union 's largest foreign airbases .
then came cargolifter , a company hoping to build commercial heavy-lift zeppelins on the 500 hectare base after the russians left .
that project failed in 2002 , but it left behind a colossal 107-meter high airship hangar subsidized by taxpayers .
until recently , the most exciting thing to do in the area was to take a canoe ride and enjoy some of the spreewald 's popular cucumbers .
but colin au , a singapore-based malaysian multi-millionaire , is aiming to change all that .
this december , au and his partners at the malaysian conglomerate tanjong plc will open a € 70-million -lrb- $ 86.8-million -rrb- tropical rainforest theme park on the former cargolifter grounds .
" this concept could work anywhere it is cold , but germans really love the sun , " au told dw-world , as he pointed out where the hangar 's unfinished concrete floor will be transformed into white sandy beaches and heated lagoons .
thousands of plants when complete , the 360-meter long silver structure will be refashioned into a unique venue for thousands of tropical plants and cruise ship-like entertainment .
the park , known as tropical islands , will not only be home to orchids and palm trees ; it will also have several types of " villages " from tropical cultures , including borneo , congo and the amazon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer simulation of the tropical island beach .
in the depths of winter , the air temperature in the park will be a balmy 25 degrees celsius and the water in the pools an even warmer 30 degrees .
a special foil on the south side of the dome - the world 's largest freestanding construction of its kind - will let in almost 100 percent of the sun 's rays .
" if people do n't use sunscreen in the summer they 'll definitely get sunburn , " said tropical islands spokeswoman vivian kreft .
if successful , the resort in brand will become the flagship of a chain of similar parks around the world .
but none would be built on such a mammoth scale as the dome in germany .
au and tanjong were able to snap it up for a measly € 17.5 million - a fraction of what it cost cargolifter - during insolvency proceedings last year .
enough visitors ?
despite the proclivity of germans to flee their own inclement weather , it 's still uncertain if the park can really attract over two million visitors a year as planned .
only last week , the space center , a comic-themed amusement park in the northern city of bremen , closed its doors after opening earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first trees arrive .
but au dismissed worries that tropical islands could run into similar trouble .
" our concept is really much closer to a resort than an amusement park , " he said .
" it really should be attractive to a broad range of people . "
the project certainly was attractive to the government of the depressed eastern german state of brandenburg , which was relieved to find investors with a viable concept for the cargolifter hall .
with unemployment in brandenburg near 20 percent , the park will create 500 desperately needed new jobs for the region .
it 's the poor economy , though , that could present the biggest risk to the project , since down-on-their-luck germans have become notoriously stingy in recent years .
the amount of disposable income of many eastern germans will be further cut next year when unpopular reforms reduce the benefits of long-term unemployed to the level of welfare payments .
original concept is key harmut mertens , an economist at bankgesellschaft berlin , admitted the region is going through some tough times , but he remained optimistic tropical islands could be a success .
" they seem to have a pretty original concept there , " mertens told dw-world .
" the problem with the space center in bremen was that they put a lot of emphasis on shopping .
that 's not the case with the tropics park . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cargolifter building the dome .
the locals from brand , however , are more cautious after seeing both the soviets and the zeppelin makers come and go .
" i 'm a little skeptical , " said carola seidenfeudel , who runs a snack shop not far from the dome .
she said her family sold drinks and food to cargolifter employees for years before the company went bankrupt .
only after construction started for tropical island this spring did they return to their familiar corner next to brand 's tiny railway station .
" it 'll be great if it works , but we 've been burned before , " she said . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cargolifter goes way of hindenburg once a boutique project of nascent eastern german entrepreneurialism , airship developer cargolifter declares insolvency .

that project failed in 2002 , but it left behind a colossal 107-meter high airship hangar subsidized by taxpayers .
until recently , the most exciting thing to do in the area was to take a canoe ride and enjoy some of the spreewald 's popular cucumbers .
but colin au , a singapore-based malaysian multi-millionaire , is aiming to change all that .
this december , au and his partners at the malaysian conglomerate tanjong plc will open a € 70-million -lrb- $ 86.8-million -rrb- tropical rainforest theme park on the former cargolifter grounds .
" this concept could work anywhere it is cold , but germans really love the sun , " au told dw-world , as he pointed out where the hangar 's unfinished concrete floor will be transformed into white sandy beaches and heated lagoons .
thousands of plants when complete , the 360-meter long silver structure will be refashioned into a unique venue for thousands of tropical plants and cruise ship-like entertainment .
the park , known as tropical islands , will not only be home to orchids and palm trees ; it will also have several types of " villages " from tropical cultures , including borneo , congo and the amazon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer simulation of the tropical island beach .
in the depths of winter , the air temperature in the park will be a balmy 25 degrees celsius and the water in the pools an even warmer 30 degrees .
a special foil on the south side of the dome - the world 's largest freestanding construction of its kind - will let in almost 100 percent of the sun 's rays .
" if people do n't use sunscreen in the summer they 'll definitely get sunburn , " said tropical islands spokeswoman vivian kreft .
if successful , the resort in brand will become the flagship of a chain of similar parks around the world .
but none would be built on such a mammoth scale as the dome in germany .
au and tanjong were able to snap it up for a measly € 17.5 million - a fraction of what it cost cargolifter - during insolvency proceedings last year .
enough visitors ?
despite the proclivity of germans to flee their own inclement weather , it 's still uncertain if the park can really attract over two million visitors a year as planned .
only last week , the space center , a comic-themed amusement park in the northern city of bremen , closed its doors after opening earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first trees arrive .
but au dismissed worries that tropical islands could run into similar trouble .
" our concept is really much closer to a resort than an amusement park , " he said .
" it really should be attractive to a broad range of people . "
the project certainly was attractive to the government of the depressed eastern german state of brandenburg , which was relieved to find investors with a viable concept for the cargolifter hall .
with unemployment in brandenburg near 20 percent , the park will create 500 desperately needed new jobs for the region .
it 's the poor economy , though , that could present the biggest risk to the project , since down-on-their-luck germans have become notoriously stingy in recent years .
the amount of disposable income of many eastern germans will be further cut next year when unpopular reforms reduce the benefits of long-term unemployed to the level of welfare payments .
original concept is key harmut mertens , an economist at bankgesellschaft berlin , admitted the region is going through some tough times , but he remained optimistic tropical islands could be a success .
" they seem to have a pretty original concept there , " mertens told dw-world .
" the problem with the space center in bremen was that they put a lot of emphasis on shopping .

the locals from brand , however , are more cautious after seeing both the soviets and the zeppelin makers come and go .

she said her family sold drinks and food to cargolifter employees for years before the company went bankrupt .

this december , au and his partners at the malaysian conglomerate tanjong plc will open a € 70-million -lrb- $ 86.8-million -rrb- tropical rainforest theme park on the former cargolifter grounds .
" this concept could work anywhere it is cold , but germans really love the sun , " au told dw-world , as he pointed out where the hangar 's unfinished concrete floor will be transformed into white sandy beaches and heated lagoons .
thousands of plants when complete , the 360-meter long silver structure will be refashioned into a unique venue for thousands of tropical plants and cruise ship-like entertainment .
the park , known as tropical islands , will not only be home to orchids and palm trees ; it will also have several types of " villages " from tropical cultures , including borneo , congo and the amazon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer simulation of the tropical island beach .
in the depths of winter , the air temperature in the park will be a balmy 25 degrees celsius and the water in the pools an even warmer 30 degrees .
a special foil on the south side of the dome - the world 's largest freestanding construction of its kind - will let in almost 100 percent of the sun 's rays .
" if people do n't use sunscreen in the summer they 'll definitely get sunburn , " said tropical islands spokeswoman vivian kreft .
if successful , the resort in brand will become the flagship of a chain of similar parks around the world .
but none would be built on such a mammoth scale as the dome in germany .
au and tanjong were able to snap it up for a measly € 17.5 million - a fraction of what it cost cargolifter - during insolvency proceedings last year .
enough visitors ?
despite the proclivity of germans to flee their own inclement weather , it 's still uncertain if the park can really attract over two million visitors a year as planned .
only last week , the space center , a comic-themed amusement park in the northern city of bremen , closed its doors after opening earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first trees arrive .
but au dismissed worries that tropical islands could run into similar trouble .
" our concept is really much closer to a resort than an amusement park , " he said .
" it really should be attractive to a broad range of people . "
the project certainly was attractive to the government of the depressed eastern german state of brandenburg , which was relieved to find investors with a viable concept for the cargolifter hall .
with unemployment in brandenburg near 20 percent , the park will create 500 desperately needed new jobs for the region .
it 's the poor economy , though , that could present the biggest risk to the project , since down-on-their-luck germans have become notoriously stingy in recent years .
the amount of disposable income of many eastern germans will be further cut next year when unpopular reforms reduce the benefits of long-term unemployed to the level of welfare payments .
original concept is key harmut mertens , an economist at bankgesellschaft berlin , admitted the region is going through some tough times , but he remained optimistic tropical islands could be a success .
" they seem to have a pretty original concept there , " mertens told dw-world .
" the problem with the space center in bremen was that they put a lot of emphasis on shopping .
that 's not the case with the tropics park . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cargolifter building the dome .
the locals from brand , however , are more cautious after seeing both the soviets and the zeppelin makers come and go .
" i 'm a little skeptical , " said carola seidenfeudel , who runs a snack shop not far from the dome .
she said her family sold drinks and food to cargolifter employees for years before the company went bankrupt .
only after construction started for tropical island this spring did they return to their familiar corner next to brand 's tiny railway station .
" it 'll be great if it works , but we 've been burned before , " she said . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cargolifter goes way of hindenburg once a boutique project of nascent eastern german entrepreneurialism , airship developer cargolifter declares insolvency .

he then heard of other stories , got his hands on a manuscript from syria and presented european readers with the first volume of " thousand and one nights " in 1704 .
the book 's popularity was like nothing ever seen before : overnight the stories took the west by storm , making hearts that shortly before had quaked in fear of the enemy from the east flutter in rapture for the enchanted orient .

the original 15th-century fragment discovered by galland , which included 282 nights , is not only older , but also told in a particularly lively fashion , since , despite the authors ' efforts to stick to " correct " written arabic , colloquialisms keep breaking through – making for a different , more vernacular tone .

but researchers at the renowned allensbach opinion research institute have published a study which reaches very different conclusions . to rita barwitzki , a 26-year-old from leipzig , the fall of the berlin wall almost 15 years ago could n't have come at a better time . " i had to shed part of my identity , " she explained , " but i could n't wait to discover new things . " " i did n't want to get stuck in the old ways - after all a new system had arrived that gave me more freedom and independence . " rita believes she benefited from having lived both behind the iron curtain and in reunited germany .
she has childhood memories of life under honecker , but it was the west that shaped her life as a teenager . her self-confidence is typical of the under-30s in eastern germany , who are more enterprising than the older generation , and many of their contemporaries in the west . empty prejudice when the ifd-allensbach questioned a sample of 2000 eastern germans , it was the young people who made the best impression . " we 'd always heard that the younger east germans felt they had no future , that they were lacking in motivation , " explained project manager thomas petersen .
" there were no opportunities , and the more capable ones left for the west - those are some of the clichés . " they proved to be empty prejudices .
" there 's a new generation emerging in our statistics that 's quite different , " observed petersen .
" they do n't just sit around feeling sorry for themselves , they take the initiative and they 're brimming with optimism . " shaping their own destiny 52 percent of young eastern germans say they are in control of their lives , while only a third of older eastern germans can match their self-belief .
in western germany , 45 percent believe that destiny is something you shape yourself , regardless of external circumstances . how do the researchers explain this ?
with the east german dictatorship an increasingly distant memory , a new generation has grown up that does not share the values of its parents .
a similar phenomenon was observed in post-war west germany and in the early 1990s in spain , 15 years after the death of franco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1973 , east berlin hosted the 10th world youth games .
" this younger generation hardly knew east germany , pointed out thomas petersen .
" they grew up in freedom and have been exposed to a world quite different to that in which their parents lived . " " there were differences in language , how one behaves in public and in private , what one can say , what one ca n't say , even how one keeps an eye on the neighbours .
these things were very different in a dictatorship . " the advantages of adversity thomas petersen also points out that eastern germans growing up in cities and towns with a 20 percent unemployment rate have experienced hardship from an early age . almost everybody in eastern germany knows someone who has lost their job and who 's suffering from financial or psychological problems . it 's a different story in western germany .
but in the long-term , petersen believes , the energy and optimism of young eastern germans could start to spill over into the west . christiane hoffman -lrb- dw staff -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fewer germans moving from east to west the wave of migration from eastern to western germany is starting to subside .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.10.2004 poland to reduce force in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish soldiers will go home next year poland will significantly reduce its number of troops in iraq by the end of 2005 , the country 's defense minister said on monday .
the move could reflect some poles ' increasing dissatisfaction with american policies . in the run-up to the us-led invasion of iraq , poland was one of america 's staunchest supporters .
all of poland 's major political parties supported the war and 2,500 troops were sent to help with the war effort .
those soldiers now lead an 8,000 strong multinational force , which controls south-central iraq .
but poland 's defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski was quoted in monday 's issue of the polish daily gazeta wyborcza as saying that poland would significantly reduce its commitment to the region .
according to the report , poland will reduce its forces in iraq by 40 percent - from 2,500 to 1,500 - by the end of 2005 .
government under pressure the deadline to pull out troops will coincide with the expiration of the united nations security council resolution 1546 at the end of 2005 , which authorized the upcoming elections .
" that does not mean , however , that if a stabilization mission was continued , polish troops would be completely pulled out from iraq , " said szmajdzinkski .
" a group of officers at the headquarters , training centers , maybe a group of observers could still remain . "
the decision to reduce poland 's deployment in iraq came at the request of the current left-wing government 's junior coalition party , the labor union -lrb- up -rrb- .
polish prime minister marek belka 's government faces a parliamentary vote of confidence later this month , and general parliamentary elections are due to be held in mid-2005 .
both will take place amid a growing backdrop of disenchantment with american foreign policy .
america 's image tarnished poland has long been one of the united states ' staunchest supporters .
largely due to the legacy of communism , even the liberals among poland 's political elite shared us policy-makers ' view that tyranny should be met with force .
but as the situation in iraq degenerated over the past year , poles - both the media and the average citizen alike - have started to question the price poland pays for its unwavering support for its unwavering support of the united states .
indeed , 17 poles have died in iraq , but the political costs have also been high .
by allying itself with the us in the hopes of becoming a leader of so-called " new europe , " poland entered the eu on may 1st of this year at odds with germany and france .
and poles are questioning whether the current us administration truly intends to make good on its promise to deliver a credible democracy in iraq , the basis upon which they supported the invasion .
what 's more , the united states has not delivered many of the rewards promised to poland in exchange for its support , including lucrative reconstruction contracts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kwasniewski , pictured with us president bush , is getting tough with washington .
all of the above has led to a growing backlash .
earlier this month , even poland 's president aleksander kwasniewski offered his own voice to the growing chorus of dissent .
he told the new york times that the united states needed to become " more flexible , more gracious , " and that the bush administration should abandon its " neoconservative divide-and-rule policy . "
in june , spain withdrew its 1,300 troops after the socialists replaced the conservative government of jose maria aznar in national elections .
the new spanish prime minister , jose luis zapatero , has called the war iraq illegal under international law . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lech walesa : germany and france share blame for iraq war the former polish president and nobel peace prize winner says germany and france are partially to blame for the iraq war , because they failed to convince other eu members of their case against invasion .

but researchers at the renowned allensbach opinion research institute have published a study which reaches very different conclusions . to rita barwitzki , a 26-year-old from leipzig , the fall of the berlin wall almost 15 years ago could n't have come at a better time . " i had to shed part of my identity , " she explained , " but i could n't wait to discover new things . " " i did n't want to get stuck in the old ways - after all a new system had arrived that gave me more freedom and independence . " rita believes she benefited from having lived both behind the iron curtain and in reunited germany .
she has childhood memories of life under honecker , but it was the west that shaped her life as a teenager . her self-confidence is typical of the under-30s in eastern germany , who are more enterprising than the older generation , and many of their contemporaries in the west . empty prejudice when the ifd-allensbach questioned a sample of 2000 eastern germans , it was the young people who made the best impression . " we 'd always heard that the younger east germans felt they had no future , that they were lacking in motivation , " explained project manager thomas petersen .
" there were no opportunities , and the more capable ones left for the west - those are some of the clichés . " they proved to be empty prejudices .
" there 's a new generation emerging in our statistics that 's quite different , " observed petersen .
" they do n't just sit around feeling sorry for themselves , they take the initiative and they 're brimming with optimism . " shaping their own destiny 52 percent of young eastern germans say they are in control of their lives , while only a third of older eastern germans can match their self-belief .
in western germany , 45 percent believe that destiny is something you shape yourself , regardless of external circumstances . how do the researchers explain this ?
with the east german dictatorship an increasingly distant memory , a new generation has grown up that does not share the values of its parents .
a similar phenomenon was observed in post-war west germany and in the early 1990s in spain , 15 years after the death of franco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1973 , east berlin hosted the 10th world youth games .
" this younger generation hardly knew east germany , pointed out thomas petersen .
" they grew up in freedom and have been exposed to a world quite different to that in which their parents lived . " " there were differences in language , how one behaves in public and in private , what one can say , what one ca n't say , even how one keeps an eye on the neighbours .
these things were very different in a dictatorship . " the advantages of adversity thomas petersen also points out that eastern germans growing up in cities and towns with a 20 percent unemployment rate have experienced hardship from an early age . almost everybody in eastern germany knows someone who has lost their job and who 's suffering from financial or psychological problems . it 's a different story in western germany .

but researchers at the renowned allensbach opinion research institute have published a study which reaches very different conclusions . to rita barwitzki , a 26-year-old from leipzig , the fall of the berlin wall almost 15 years ago could n't have come at a better time . " i had to shed part of my identity , " she explained , " but i could n't wait to discover new things . " " i did n't want to get stuck in the old ways - after all a new system had arrived that gave me more freedom and independence . " rita believes she benefited from having lived both behind the iron curtain and in reunited germany .
she has childhood memories of life under honecker , but it was the west that shaped her life as a teenager . her self-confidence is typical of the under-30s in eastern germany , who are more enterprising than the older generation , and many of their contemporaries in the west . empty prejudice when the ifd-allensbach questioned a sample of 2000 eastern germans , it was the young people who made the best impression . " we 'd always heard that the younger east germans felt they had no future , that they were lacking in motivation , " explained project manager thomas petersen .
" there were no opportunities , and the more capable ones left for the west - those are some of the clichés . " they proved to be empty prejudices .
" there 's a new generation emerging in our statistics that 's quite different , " observed petersen .
" they do n't just sit around feeling sorry for themselves , they take the initiative and they 're brimming with optimism . " shaping their own destiny 52 percent of young eastern germans say they are in control of their lives , while only a third of older eastern germans can match their self-belief .
in western germany , 45 percent believe that destiny is something you shape yourself , regardless of external circumstances . how do the researchers explain this ?
with the east german dictatorship an increasingly distant memory , a new generation has grown up that does not share the values of its parents .
a similar phenomenon was observed in post-war west germany and in the early 1990s in spain , 15 years after the death of franco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1973 , east berlin hosted the 10th world youth games .
" this younger generation hardly knew east germany , pointed out thomas petersen .
" they grew up in freedom and have been exposed to a world quite different to that in which their parents lived . " " there were differences in language , how one behaves in public and in private , what one can say , what one ca n't say , even how one keeps an eye on the neighbours .
these things were very different in a dictatorship . " the advantages of adversity thomas petersen also points out that eastern germans growing up in cities and towns with a 20 percent unemployment rate have experienced hardship from an early age . almost everybody in eastern germany knows someone who has lost their job and who 's suffering from financial or psychological problems . it 's a different story in western germany .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the unknown guest of honor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2004 frankfurt book fair 2004 focuses on the arab world in beirut 's cultural scene nobody seems to know about the book fair in frankfurt .
lebanese authors are worried , but also get their hopes up . beirut ’ s young cultural scene is thriving : during the last year , tens of galleries have opened in the rebuild saifi village close to the city center , new cafes and jazz bars popped up in the gentrified areas of east beirut , where djs play the newest sound from europe and young musicians rap in the lebanese dialect .
at an abandoned train station , some musicians were recently organizing a techno party .
on this rave , ronja was handing out flyers inviting to a poetry slam at a private culture center .
" book fair in frankfurt ?
never heard of it , " she said .
she grew up in sweden and can ’ t read arabic well .
thus , she doesn ’ t follow the arab press .
rawan and sara go often to such events but haven ’ t heard about the book fair .
sara said those things don ’ t interest her .
" i work and work and hardly make $ 250 -lrb- € 200 -rrb- , " she said .
" i can ’ t go to europe , anyhow . "

mamlaka as-sarasir -lrb- cachroche kingdom -rrb- came out three years ago .
the 31-year-old said he had heard about a large book fair taking place every year in frankfurt , but not about the arab world being the guest of honor .
" we are not in a luxury period here , " he says , " so people in general are not interested in culture . "
he hopes that such an event will not be turned into a political stage .
" it should just be for the intellectual aspect , " he said .
" we can ’ t solve our problems this way .
you can ’ t cover a hole in the table with a table cloth .
if the arab world wants to carry a message , i ask what message could that be ? "
but bashar haidar , a philosophy professor who was having a drink at a bistro with a colleague , said he had heard great things about the frankfurt book fair , but nothing about this year ’ s focus .
" that sounds fantastic , " he said .
" we should book tickets and go , " he told his colleague .
mixed feelings the lebanese authors who are invited to the fair were not quite as enthusiastic .
" since early 2004 , everything i read was criticism , " says emily nasrallah , who has had three novels and one children 's book translated into german .
" i haven ’ t read anything positive .
there was this delay , which also delayed the translation of books before the book fair .
but this is something for the governments to answer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut ´ s skyline , libanon she said she doesn ’ t expect anything , " but i hope they will succeed , because we have a lot to show . "
she said she hoped this could be a push for arab literature .
" i am also very happy that it is happening in germany , because from my experience i feel they respect us very much , " she said .
" but it ’ s not only germany .
it is also the frankfurt book fair .
when i am asked by journalists here , whether i don ’ t think that the book is dead , i always tell them to go to frankfurt and see for themselves . "
iman humaidan will have her second novel translated into german just in time for the book fair .
she said she is excited to go .
" i am looking forward to it , " she said .
" i hear everybody around me saying it ’ s going to be a scandal because we have nothing to present .
of course , we have !
the problem is we are not proud of what we have . "
lost images image is another problem .
" they were lost , because they lost their image , " humaidan said .
" the great ideologies have died .
what ’ s left is fundamentalism and the old regimes .
people like us are marginalized .
my first reaction was to ask : how can we access this space between those two sides ? "
she said she thinks the book fair should be different from those events " when the west thinks of dialogue with the arab world as a dialogue with fundamentalists .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the healing power of storytelling the new german translation of thousand and one nights -lrb- arabian nights -rrb- makes the oldest arabic version of this famed collection of oriental tales available for german readers for the first time . three hundred years ago , librarian antoine galland translated the story of " sindbad the sailor " for a noble woman .
he then heard of other stories , got his hands on a manuscript from syria and presented european readers with the first volume of " thousand and one nights " in 1704 .
the book 's popularity was like nothing ever seen before : overnight the stories took the west by storm , making hearts that shortly before had quaked in fear of the enemy from the east flutter in rapture for the enchanted orient .
literary triumph today the fabulous narratives even find favor with those more intellectual arabs who once dismissed the folktales as " pathetic prattle ; " only the eternally sanctimonious still take offence at the tales ' provocative sensuality .
galland had managed to uncover one of the world 's great literary treasures .
he translated the tales with a large measure of poetic freedom , in the style of his times , which probably only enhanced the work 's success .
there has since been no lack of alternative translations , including famous editions like that of enno littmann -lrb- 1921-1928 -rrb- .
but these have all been based on more recent manuscripts .
the original 15th-century fragment discovered by galland , which included 282 nights , is not only older , but also told in a particularly lively fashion , since , despite the authors ' efforts to stick to " correct " written arabic , colloquialisms keep breaking through – making for a different , more vernacular tone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of " thousand and one night " moves people from young to old in 1984 this original manuscript was published by muhsin mahdi .
and now , to mark the 300th anniversary of the first publication of the tales , arabic scholar claudia ott has produced a new translation - unlike galland keeping very close to the original text .
freed from the imposed patina of the european fairytale idiom , the " delectable " adventures of kings and beggars , slaves , demons and the " dead drunk " hunchback shine fresher than ever before .
ott effortlessly orchestrates the changes in register between the coarse tone of some of the spoken exchanges and the nicely turned phrases of the rhymed prose .
storytelling as last resort perhaps , more than the individual stories , it is the arrangement of the whole that is the stroke of genius , tying all the tales together : the fact that each story can act as a framework for further stories told within it , with the whole then subsumed under the wondrous tale of sheherazade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : never was the healing power of storytelling presented in a more beautiful way , like it is in the " arabian nights " the drama begins with the trauma of one man : sultan shahryar , a ruler in the island kingdom of india and china , discovers that his beloved wife is cheating on him every time he turns his back with a black slave .
when , on his flight from this horrendous scene , the wife and captive booty of a demon forces him to sleep with her in order to cuckold her hated demon husband , ifrit , he has had more than enough : shahryar decides from then on to kill each of his wives after their first night of lovemaking .
night after night .
in this brutal manner , the battle of the sexes culminates in a series of fatal one-night stands .
enter sheherazade , the daughter of the wazir .
this well-read and educated young woman has a plan : she will tell stories to save herself , the king , and the world .
she proceeds to tell tales just like every tv series does – so enthralling that , each night when the sun goes down , a cliffhanger will make the sultan desperate to hear what happens next -lrb- " and the jinni drew his sword to strike … " -rrb- , postponing her death until the beautiful storyteller is able to bear the sultan a child and thus change his mind about the wiles of womanhood . ludwig ammann , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de connecting the cultural dots dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing .

the move could reflect some poles ' increasing dissatisfaction with american policies . in the run-up to the us-led invasion of iraq , poland was one of america 's staunchest supporters .
all of poland 's major political parties supported the war and 2,500 troops were sent to help with the war effort .
those soldiers now lead an 8,000 strong multinational force , which controls south-central iraq .
but poland 's defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski was quoted in monday 's issue of the polish daily gazeta wyborcza as saying that poland would significantly reduce its commitment to the region .
according to the report , poland will reduce its forces in iraq by 40 percent - from 2,500 to 1,500 - by the end of 2005 .
government under pressure the deadline to pull out troops will coincide with the expiration of the united nations security council resolution 1546 at the end of 2005 , which authorized the upcoming elections .
" that does not mean , however , that if a stabilization mission was continued , polish troops would be completely pulled out from iraq , " said szmajdzinkski .
" a group of officers at the headquarters , training centers , maybe a group of observers could still remain . "
the decision to reduce poland 's deployment in iraq came at the request of the current left-wing government 's junior coalition party , the labor union -lrb- up -rrb- .
polish prime minister marek belka 's government faces a parliamentary vote of confidence later this month , and general parliamentary elections are due to be held in mid-2005 .
both will take place amid a growing backdrop of disenchantment with american foreign policy .
america 's image tarnished poland has long been one of the united states ' staunchest supporters .
largely due to the legacy of communism , even the liberals among poland 's political elite shared us policy-makers ' view that tyranny should be met with force .
but as the situation in iraq degenerated over the past year , poles - both the media and the average citizen alike - have started to question the price poland pays for its unwavering support for its unwavering support of the united states .
indeed , 17 poles have died in iraq , but the political costs have also been high .
by allying itself with the us in the hopes of becoming a leader of so-called " new europe , " poland entered the eu on may 1st of this year at odds with germany and france .
and poles are questioning whether the current us administration truly intends to make good on its promise to deliver a credible democracy in iraq , the basis upon which they supported the invasion .
what 's more , the united states has not delivered many of the rewards promised to poland in exchange for its support , including lucrative reconstruction contracts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kwasniewski , pictured with us president bush , is getting tough with washington .
all of the above has led to a growing backlash .
earlier this month , even poland 's president aleksander kwasniewski offered his own voice to the growing chorus of dissent .
he told the new york times that the united states needed to become " more flexible , more gracious , " and that the bush administration should abandon its " neoconservative divide-and-rule policy . "
in june , spain withdrew its 1,300 troops after the socialists replaced the conservative government of jose maria aznar in national elections .
the new spanish prime minister , jose luis zapatero , has called the war iraq illegal under international law . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lech walesa : germany and france share blame for iraq war the former polish president and nobel peace prize winner says germany and france are partially to blame for the iraq war , because they failed to convince other eu members of their case against invasion .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the unknown guest of honor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2004 frankfurt book fair 2004 focuses on the arab world in beirut 's cultural scene nobody seems to know about the book fair in frankfurt .
lebanese authors are worried , but also get their hopes up . beirut ’ s young cultural scene is thriving : during the last year , tens of galleries have opened in the rebuild saifi village close to the city center , new cafes and jazz bars popped up in the gentrified areas of east beirut , where djs play the newest sound from europe and young musicians rap in the lebanese dialect .
at an abandoned train station , some musicians were recently organizing a techno party .
on this rave , ronja was handing out flyers inviting to a poetry slam at a private culture center .
" book fair in frankfurt ?
never heard of it , " she said .
she grew up in sweden and can ’ t read arabic well .
thus , she doesn ’ t follow the arab press .
rawan and sara go often to such events but haven ’ t heard about the book fair .
sara said those things don ’ t interest her .
" i work and work and hardly make $ 250 -lrb- € 200 -rrb- , " she said .
" i can ’ t go to europe , anyhow . "
no time for luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arabic rappers , from right to left , dj charley shaby , 25 , richy shaby , 20 , wassim akar , 22 , and mahmoud shalaby , 20 simon khuan was reading poems he has already published .
mamlaka as-sarasir -lrb- cachroche kingdom -rrb- came out three years ago .
the 31-year-old said he had heard about a large book fair taking place every year in frankfurt , but not about the arab world being the guest of honor .
" we are not in a luxury period here , " he says , " so people in general are not interested in culture . "
he hopes that such an event will not be turned into a political stage .
" it should just be for the intellectual aspect , " he said .
" we can ’ t solve our problems this way .
you can ’ t cover a hole in the table with a table cloth .
if the arab world wants to carry a message , i ask what message could that be ? "
but bashar haidar , a philosophy professor who was having a drink at a bistro with a colleague , said he had heard great things about the frankfurt book fair , but nothing about this year ’ s focus .
" that sounds fantastic , " he said .
" we should book tickets and go , " he told his colleague .
mixed feelings the lebanese authors who are invited to the fair were not quite as enthusiastic .
" since early 2004 , everything i read was criticism , " says emily nasrallah , who has had three novels and one children 's book translated into german .
" i haven ’ t read anything positive .
there was this delay , which also delayed the translation of books before the book fair .
but this is something for the governments to answer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut ´ s skyline , libanon she said she doesn ’ t expect anything , " but i hope they will succeed , because we have a lot to show . "
she said she hoped this could be a push for arab literature .
" i am also very happy that it is happening in germany , because from my experience i feel they respect us very much , " she said .
" but it ’ s not only germany .
it is also the frankfurt book fair .
when i am asked by journalists here , whether i don ’ t think that the book is dead , i always tell them to go to frankfurt and see for themselves . "
iman humaidan will have her second novel translated into german just in time for the book fair .
she said she is excited to go .
" i am looking forward to it , " she said .
" i hear everybody around me saying it ’ s going to be a scandal because we have nothing to present .
of course , we have !
the problem is we are not proud of what we have . "
lost images image is another problem .
" they were lost , because they lost their image , " humaidan said .
" the great ideologies have died .
what ’ s left is fundamentalism and the old regimes .
people like us are marginalized .
my first reaction was to ask : how can we access this space between those two sides ? "
she said she thinks the book fair should be different from those events " when the west thinks of dialogue with the arab world as a dialogue with fundamentalists .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the healing power of storytelling the new german translation of thousand and one nights -lrb- arabian nights -rrb- makes the oldest arabic version of this famed collection of oriental tales available for german readers for the first time . three hundred years ago , librarian antoine galland translated the story of " sindbad the sailor " for a noble woman .
he then heard of other stories , got his hands on a manuscript from syria and presented european readers with the first volume of " thousand and one nights " in 1704 .
the book 's popularity was like nothing ever seen before : overnight the stories took the west by storm , making hearts that shortly before had quaked in fear of the enemy from the east flutter in rapture for the enchanted orient .
literary triumph today the fabulous narratives even find favor with those more intellectual arabs who once dismissed the folktales as " pathetic prattle ; " only the eternally sanctimonious still take offence at the tales ' provocative sensuality .
galland had managed to uncover one of the world 's great literary treasures .
he translated the tales with a large measure of poetic freedom , in the style of his times , which probably only enhanced the work 's success .
there has since been no lack of alternative translations , including famous editions like that of enno littmann -lrb- 1921-1928 -rrb- .
but these have all been based on more recent manuscripts .
the original 15th-century fragment discovered by galland , which included 282 nights , is not only older , but also told in a particularly lively fashion , since , despite the authors ' efforts to stick to " correct " written arabic , colloquialisms keep breaking through – making for a different , more vernacular tone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of " thousand and one night " moves people from young to old in 1984 this original manuscript was published by muhsin mahdi .
and now , to mark the 300th anniversary of the first publication of the tales , arabic scholar claudia ott has produced a new translation - unlike galland keeping very close to the original text .
freed from the imposed patina of the european fairytale idiom , the " delectable " adventures of kings and beggars , slaves , demons and the " dead drunk " hunchback shine fresher than ever before .
ott effortlessly orchestrates the changes in register between the coarse tone of some of the spoken exchanges and the nicely turned phrases of the rhymed prose .
storytelling as last resort perhaps , more than the individual stories , it is the arrangement of the whole that is the stroke of genius , tying all the tales together : the fact that each story can act as a framework for further stories told within it , with the whole then subsumed under the wondrous tale of sheherazade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : never was the healing power of storytelling presented in a more beautiful way , like it is in the " arabian nights " the drama begins with the trauma of one man : sultan shahryar , a ruler in the island kingdom of india and china , discovers that his beloved wife is cheating on him every time he turns his back with a black slave .
when , on his flight from this horrendous scene , the wife and captive booty of a demon forces him to sleep with her in order to cuckold her hated demon husband , ifrit , he has had more than enough : shahryar decides from then on to kill each of his wives after their first night of lovemaking .
night after night .
in this brutal manner , the battle of the sexes culminates in a series of fatal one-night stands .
enter sheherazade , the daughter of the wazir .
this well-read and educated young woman has a plan : she will tell stories to save herself , the king , and the world .
she proceeds to tell tales just like every tv series does – so enthralling that , each night when the sun goes down , a cliffhanger will make the sultan desperate to hear what happens next -lrb- " and the jinni drew his sword to strike … " -rrb- , postponing her death until the beautiful storyteller is able to bear the sultan a child and thus change his mind about the wiles of womanhood . ludwig ammann , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de connecting the cultural dots dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the unknown guest of honor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2004 frankfurt book fair 2004 focuses on the arab world in beirut 's cultural scene nobody seems to know about the book fair in frankfurt .
lebanese authors are worried , but also get their hopes up . beirut ’ s young cultural scene is thriving : during the last year , tens of galleries have opened in the rebuild saifi village close to the city center , new cafes and jazz bars popped up in the gentrified areas of east beirut , where djs play the newest sound from europe and young musicians rap in the lebanese dialect .
at an abandoned train station , some musicians were recently organizing a techno party .
on this rave , ronja was handing out flyers inviting to a poetry slam at a private culture center .
" book fair in frankfurt ?
never heard of it , " she said .
she grew up in sweden and can ’ t read arabic well .
thus , she doesn ’ t follow the arab press .
rawan and sara go often to such events but haven ’ t heard about the book fair .

" the -lrb- german -rrb- government will not support the individual demands for compensation in connection with the second world war in national or international courts , " schröder told the czech newspaper hospodarske noviny monday , referring to similar claims by germans who were expelled from poland after 1945 . " that naturally also applies to the czech republic , " schröder said in an interview . during his visit schröder also met with the czech republic 's new prime minister stanislav gross . dozens of sudeten germans are seeking to take their case for compensation to the european court of human rights in strasbourg . polish-german legal defense council their initiative mirrors the campaign to win damages being mounted by some germans expelled from territories in eastern germany that became polish after 1945 .

" we do not want to burden our relationship with political and legal questions dating from the past , we want to point them to the future . " schröder said the sudeten germans ' claims were " devoid of any legal basis .

the move could reflect some poles ' increasing dissatisfaction with american policies . in the run-up to the us-led invasion of iraq , poland was one of america 's staunchest supporters .
all of poland 's major political parties supported the war and 2,500 troops were sent to help with the war effort .
those soldiers now lead an 8,000 strong multinational force , which controls south-central iraq .
but poland 's defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski was quoted in monday 's issue of the polish daily gazeta wyborcza as saying that poland would significantly reduce its commitment to the region .
according to the report , poland will reduce its forces in iraq by 40 percent - from 2,500 to 1,500 - by the end of 2005 .
government under pressure the deadline to pull out troops will coincide with the expiration of the united nations security council resolution 1546 at the end of 2005 , which authorized the upcoming elections .
" that does not mean , however , that if a stabilization mission was continued , polish troops would be completely pulled out from iraq , " said szmajdzinkski .
" a group of officers at the headquarters , training centers , maybe a group of observers could still remain . "
the decision to reduce poland 's deployment in iraq came at the request of the current left-wing government 's junior coalition party , the labor union -lrb- up -rrb- .
polish prime minister marek belka 's government faces a parliamentary vote of confidence later this month , and general parliamentary elections are due to be held in mid-2005 .
both will take place amid a growing backdrop of disenchantment with american foreign policy .
america 's image tarnished poland has long been one of the united states ' staunchest supporters .
largely due to the legacy of communism , even the liberals among poland 's political elite shared us policy-makers ' view that tyranny should be met with force .
but as the situation in iraq degenerated over the past year , poles - both the media and the average citizen alike - have started to question the price poland pays for its unwavering support for its unwavering support of the united states .
indeed , 17 poles have died in iraq , but the political costs have also been high .
by allying itself with the us in the hopes of becoming a leader of so-called " new europe , " poland entered the eu on may 1st of this year at odds with germany and france .
and poles are questioning whether the current us administration truly intends to make good on its promise to deliver a credible democracy in iraq , the basis upon which they supported the invasion .
what 's more , the united states has not delivered many of the rewards promised to poland in exchange for its support , including lucrative reconstruction contracts .

he told the new york times that the united states needed to become " more flexible , more gracious , " and that the bush administration should abandon its " neoconservative divide-and-rule policy . "

the move could reflect some poles ' increasing dissatisfaction with american policies . in the run-up to the us-led invasion of iraq , poland was one of america 's staunchest supporters .
all of poland 's major political parties supported the war and 2,500 troops were sent to help with the war effort .
those soldiers now lead an 8,000 strong multinational force , which controls south-central iraq .
but poland 's defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski was quoted in monday 's issue of the polish daily gazeta wyborcza as saying that poland would significantly reduce its commitment to the region .
according to the report , poland will reduce its forces in iraq by 40 percent - from 2,500 to 1,500 - by the end of 2005 .
government under pressure the deadline to pull out troops will coincide with the expiration of the united nations security council resolution 1546 at the end of 2005 , which authorized the upcoming elections .
" that does not mean , however , that if a stabilization mission was continued , polish troops would be completely pulled out from iraq , " said szmajdzinkski .
" a group of officers at the headquarters , training centers , maybe a group of observers could still remain . "
the decision to reduce poland 's deployment in iraq came at the request of the current left-wing government 's junior coalition party , the labor union -lrb- up -rrb- .
polish prime minister marek belka 's government faces a parliamentary vote of confidence later this month , and general parliamentary elections are due to be held in mid-2005 .
both will take place amid a growing backdrop of disenchantment with american foreign policy .
america 's image tarnished poland has long been one of the united states ' staunchest supporters .
largely due to the legacy of communism , even the liberals among poland 's political elite shared us policy-makers ' view that tyranny should be met with force .
but as the situation in iraq degenerated over the past year , poles - both the media and the average citizen alike - have started to question the price poland pays for its unwavering support for its unwavering support of the united states .
indeed , 17 poles have died in iraq , but the political costs have also been high .
by allying itself with the us in the hopes of becoming a leader of so-called " new europe , " poland entered the eu on may 1st of this year at odds with germany and france .
and poles are questioning whether the current us administration truly intends to make good on its promise to deliver a credible democracy in iraq , the basis upon which they supported the invasion .
what 's more , the united states has not delivered many of the rewards promised to poland in exchange for its support , including lucrative reconstruction contracts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kwasniewski , pictured with us president bush , is getting tough with washington .
all of the above has led to a growing backlash .
earlier this month , even poland 's president aleksander kwasniewski offered his own voice to the growing chorus of dissent .
he told the new york times that the united states needed to become " more flexible , more gracious , " and that the bush administration should abandon its " neoconservative divide-and-rule policy . "
in june , spain withdrew its 1,300 troops after the socialists replaced the conservative government of jose maria aznar in national elections .
the new spanish prime minister , jose luis zapatero , has called the war iraq illegal under international law . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lech walesa : germany and france share blame for iraq war the former polish president and nobel peace prize winner says germany and france are partially to blame for the iraq war , because they failed to convince other eu members of their case against invasion .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the healing power of storytelling the new german translation of thousand and one nights -lrb- arabian nights -rrb- makes the oldest arabic version of this famed collection of oriental tales available for german readers for the first time . three hundred years ago , librarian antoine galland translated the story of " sindbad the sailor " for a noble woman .
he then heard of other stories , got his hands on a manuscript from syria and presented european readers with the first volume of " thousand and one nights " in 1704 .
the book 's popularity was like nothing ever seen before : overnight the stories took the west by storm , making hearts that shortly before had quaked in fear of the enemy from the east flutter in rapture for the enchanted orient .
literary triumph today the fabulous narratives even find favor with those more intellectual arabs who once dismissed the folktales as " pathetic prattle ; " only the eternally sanctimonious still take offence at the tales ' provocative sensuality .
galland had managed to uncover one of the world 's great literary treasures .
he translated the tales with a large measure of poetic freedom , in the style of his times , which probably only enhanced the work 's success .
there has since been no lack of alternative translations , including famous editions like that of enno littmann -lrb- 1921-1928 -rrb- .
but these have all been based on more recent manuscripts .
the original 15th-century fragment discovered by galland , which included 282 nights , is not only older , but also told in a particularly lively fashion , since , despite the authors ' efforts to stick to " correct " written arabic , colloquialisms keep breaking through – making for a different , more vernacular tone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of " thousand and one night " moves people from young to old in 1984 this original manuscript was published by muhsin mahdi .
and now , to mark the 300th anniversary of the first publication of the tales , arabic scholar claudia ott has produced a new translation - unlike galland keeping very close to the original text .
freed from the imposed patina of the european fairytale idiom , the " delectable " adventures of kings and beggars , slaves , demons and the " dead drunk " hunchback shine fresher than ever before .
ott effortlessly orchestrates the changes in register between the coarse tone of some of the spoken exchanges and the nicely turned phrases of the rhymed prose .
storytelling as last resort perhaps , more than the individual stories , it is the arrangement of the whole that is the stroke of genius , tying all the tales together : the fact that each story can act as a framework for further stories told within it , with the whole then subsumed under the wondrous tale of sheherazade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : never was the healing power of storytelling presented in a more beautiful way , like it is in the " arabian nights " the drama begins with the trauma of one man : sultan shahryar , a ruler in the island kingdom of india and china , discovers that his beloved wife is cheating on him every time he turns his back with a black slave .
when , on his flight from this horrendous scene , the wife and captive booty of a demon forces him to sleep with her in order to cuckold her hated demon husband , ifrit , he has had more than enough : shahryar decides from then on to kill each of his wives after their first night of lovemaking .
night after night .
in this brutal manner , the battle of the sexes culminates in a series of fatal one-night stands .
enter sheherazade , the daughter of the wazir .
this well-read and educated young woman has a plan : she will tell stories to save herself , the king , and the world .
she proceeds to tell tales just like every tv series does – so enthralling that , each night when the sun goes down , a cliffhanger will make the sultan desperate to hear what happens next -lrb- " and the jinni drew his sword to strike … " -rrb- , postponing her death until the beautiful storyteller is able to bear the sultan a child and thus change his mind about the wiles of womanhood . ludwig ammann , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de connecting the cultural dots dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.10.2004 -pipe- 11:00 utc eu report : press freedom problems in romania according to the bbc , the draft report on romania criticizes attempts to curb media freedom , as well as looking at the widespread corruption in the country .
the report emphasizes that economic pressure has been put on the press as well as noting cases of physical attacks against journalists .
the attacks have mainly concerned journalists with the local press – and the number of cases has risen recently , something which the report calls an alarming tendency .
the debate over the freedom of the romanian press has been fuelled by recent alleged attempts to influence the work of journalists in a number of independent romanian newspapers .
two big newspapers , evenime ntul zilei and romania libera , protested at alleged undue interference by their western owners in their editorial content .
both the swiss group ringier and the german owner waz , owners of the two dailies , have denied influencing editorial policy .
the report is due to be published on wednesday and will be a key document on romania 's readiness to join the eu in 2007 .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the unknown guest of honor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2004 frankfurt book fair 2004 focuses on the arab world in beirut 's cultural scene nobody seems to know about the book fair in frankfurt .
lebanese authors are worried , but also get their hopes up . beirut ’ s young cultural scene is thriving : during the last year , tens of galleries have opened in the rebuild saifi village close to the city center , new cafes and jazz bars popped up in the gentrified areas of east beirut , where djs play the newest sound from europe and young musicians rap in the lebanese dialect .
at an abandoned train station , some musicians were recently organizing a techno party .
on this rave , ronja was handing out flyers inviting to a poetry slam at a private culture center .
" book fair in frankfurt ?
never heard of it , " she said .
she grew up in sweden and can ’ t read arabic well .
thus , she doesn ’ t follow the arab press .
rawan and sara go often to such events but haven ’ t heard about the book fair .
sara said those things don ’ t interest her .
" i work and work and hardly make $ 250 -lrb- € 200 -rrb- , " she said .
" i can ’ t go to europe , anyhow . "
no time for luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arabic rappers , from right to left , dj charley shaby , 25 , richy shaby , 20 , wassim akar , 22 , and mahmoud shalaby , 20 simon khuan was reading poems he has already published .
mamlaka as-sarasir -lrb- cachroche kingdom -rrb- came out three years ago .
the 31-year-old said he had heard about a large book fair taking place every year in frankfurt , but not about the arab world being the guest of honor .
" we are not in a luxury period here , " he says , " so people in general are not interested in culture . "
he hopes that such an event will not be turned into a political stage .
" it should just be for the intellectual aspect , " he said .
" we can ’ t solve our problems this way .
you can ’ t cover a hole in the table with a table cloth .
if the arab world wants to carry a message , i ask what message could that be ? "
but bashar haidar , a philosophy professor who was having a drink at a bistro with a colleague , said he had heard great things about the frankfurt book fair , but nothing about this year ’ s focus .
" that sounds fantastic , " he said .
" we should book tickets and go , " he told his colleague .
mixed feelings the lebanese authors who are invited to the fair were not quite as enthusiastic .
" since early 2004 , everything i read was criticism , " says emily nasrallah , who has had three novels and one children 's book translated into german .
" i haven ’ t read anything positive .
there was this delay , which also delayed the translation of books before the book fair .
but this is something for the governments to answer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut ´ s skyline , libanon she said she doesn ’ t expect anything , " but i hope they will succeed , because we have a lot to show . "
she said she hoped this could be a push for arab literature .
" i am also very happy that it is happening in germany , because from my experience i feel they respect us very much , " she said .
" but it ’ s not only germany .
it is also the frankfurt book fair .
when i am asked by journalists here , whether i don ’ t think that the book is dead , i always tell them to go to frankfurt and see for themselves . "
iman humaidan will have her second novel translated into german just in time for the book fair .
she said she is excited to go .
" i am looking forward to it , " she said .
" i hear everybody around me saying it ’ s going to be a scandal because we have nothing to present .
of course , we have !
the problem is we are not proud of what we have . "
lost images image is another problem .
" they were lost , because they lost their image , " humaidan said .
" the great ideologies have died .
what ’ s left is fundamentalism and the old regimes .
people like us are marginalized .
my first reaction was to ask : how can we access this space between those two sides ? "
she said she thinks the book fair should be different from those events " when the west thinks of dialogue with the arab world as a dialogue with fundamentalists .
i have the same problems with fundamentalists as you have . " hannah wettig , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.10.2004 poland to reduce force in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish soldiers will go home next year poland will significantly reduce its number of troops in iraq by the end of 2005 , the country 's defense minister said on monday .
the move could reflect some poles ' increasing dissatisfaction with american policies . in the run-up to the us-led invasion of iraq , poland was one of america 's staunchest supporters .
all of poland 's major political parties supported the war and 2,500 troops were sent to help with the war effort .
those soldiers now lead an 8,000 strong multinational force , which controls south-central iraq .
but poland 's defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski was quoted in monday 's issue of the polish daily gazeta wyborcza as saying that poland would significantly reduce its commitment to the region .
according to the report , poland will reduce its forces in iraq by 40 percent - from 2,500 to 1,500 - by the end of 2005 .
government under pressure the deadline to pull out troops will coincide with the expiration of the united nations security council resolution 1546 at the end of 2005 , which authorized the upcoming elections .
" that does not mean , however , that if a stabilization mission was continued , polish troops would be completely pulled out from iraq , " said szmajdzinkski .
" a group of officers at the headquarters , training centers , maybe a group of observers could still remain . "
the decision to reduce poland 's deployment in iraq came at the request of the current left-wing government 's junior coalition party , the labor union -lrb- up -rrb- .
polish prime minister marek belka 's government faces a parliamentary vote of confidence later this month , and general parliamentary elections are due to be held in mid-2005 .
both will take place amid a growing backdrop of disenchantment with american foreign policy .
america 's image tarnished poland has long been one of the united states ' staunchest supporters .
largely due to the legacy of communism , even the liberals among poland 's political elite shared us policy-makers ' view that tyranny should be met with force .
but as the situation in iraq degenerated over the past year , poles - both the media and the average citizen alike - have started to question the price poland pays for its unwavering support for its unwavering support of the united states .
indeed , 17 poles have died in iraq , but the political costs have also been high .
by allying itself with the us in the hopes of becoming a leader of so-called " new europe , " poland entered the eu on may 1st of this year at odds with germany and france .
and poles are questioning whether the current us administration truly intends to make good on its promise to deliver a credible democracy in iraq , the basis upon which they supported the invasion .
what 's more , the united states has not delivered many of the rewards promised to poland in exchange for its support , including lucrative reconstruction contracts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kwasniewski , pictured with us president bush , is getting tough with washington .
all of the above has led to a growing backlash .
earlier this month , even poland 's president aleksander kwasniewski offered his own voice to the growing chorus of dissent .
he told the new york times that the united states needed to become " more flexible , more gracious , " and that the bush administration should abandon its " neoconservative divide-and-rule policy . "
in june , spain withdrew its 1,300 troops after the socialists replaced the conservative government of jose maria aznar in national elections .
the new spanish prime minister , jose luis zapatero , has called the war iraq illegal under international law . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lech walesa : germany and france share blame for iraq war the former polish president and nobel peace prize winner says germany and france are partially to blame for the iraq war , because they failed to convince other eu members of their case against invasion .

the move could reflect some poles ' increasing dissatisfaction with american policies . in the run-up to the us-led invasion of iraq , poland was one of america 's staunchest supporters .
all of poland 's major political parties supported the war and 2,500 troops were sent to help with the war effort .
those soldiers now lead an 8,000 strong multinational force , which controls south-central iraq .
but poland 's defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski was quoted in monday 's issue of the polish daily gazeta wyborcza as saying that poland would significantly reduce its commitment to the region .
according to the report , poland will reduce its forces in iraq by 40 percent - from 2,500 to 1,500 - by the end of 2005 .
government under pressure the deadline to pull out troops will coincide with the expiration of the united nations security council resolution 1546 at the end of 2005 , which authorized the upcoming elections .
" that does not mean , however , that if a stabilization mission was continued , polish troops would be completely pulled out from iraq , " said szmajdzinkski .
" a group of officers at the headquarters , training centers , maybe a group of observers could still remain . "
the decision to reduce poland 's deployment in iraq came at the request of the current left-wing government 's junior coalition party , the labor union -lrb- up -rrb- .
polish prime minister marek belka 's government faces a parliamentary vote of confidence later this month , and general parliamentary elections are due to be held in mid-2005 .
both will take place amid a growing backdrop of disenchantment with american foreign policy .
america 's image tarnished poland has long been one of the united states ' staunchest supporters .
largely due to the legacy of communism , even the liberals among poland 's political elite shared us policy-makers ' view that tyranny should be met with force .
but as the situation in iraq degenerated over the past year , poles - both the media and the average citizen alike - have started to question the price poland pays for its unwavering support for its unwavering support of the united states .
indeed , 17 poles have died in iraq , but the political costs have also been high .
by allying itself with the us in the hopes of becoming a leader of so-called " new europe , " poland entered the eu on may 1st of this year at odds with germany and france .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the healing power of storytelling the new german translation of thousand and one nights -lrb- arabian nights -rrb- makes the oldest arabic version of this famed collection of oriental tales available for german readers for the first time . three hundred years ago , librarian antoine galland translated the story of " sindbad the sailor " for a noble woman .
he then heard of other stories , got his hands on a manuscript from syria and presented european readers with the first volume of " thousand and one nights " in 1704 .
the book 's popularity was like nothing ever seen before : overnight the stories took the west by storm , making hearts that shortly before had quaked in fear of the enemy from the east flutter in rapture for the enchanted orient .
literary triumph today the fabulous narratives even find favor with those more intellectual arabs who once dismissed the folktales as " pathetic prattle ; " only the eternally sanctimonious still take offence at the tales ' provocative sensuality .
galland had managed to uncover one of the world 's great literary treasures .
he translated the tales with a large measure of poetic freedom , in the style of his times , which probably only enhanced the work 's success .
there has since been no lack of alternative translations , including famous editions like that of enno littmann -lrb- 1921-1928 -rrb- .
but these have all been based on more recent manuscripts .
the original 15th-century fragment discovered by galland , which included 282 nights , is not only older , but also told in a particularly lively fashion , since , despite the authors ' efforts to stick to " correct " written arabic , colloquialisms keep breaking through – making for a different , more vernacular tone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of " thousand and one night " moves people from young to old in 1984 this original manuscript was published by muhsin mahdi .
and now , to mark the 300th anniversary of the first publication of the tales , arabic scholar claudia ott has produced a new translation - unlike galland keeping very close to the original text .
freed from the imposed patina of the european fairytale idiom , the " delectable " adventures of kings and beggars , slaves , demons and the " dead drunk " hunchback shine fresher than ever before .
ott effortlessly orchestrates the changes in register between the coarse tone of some of the spoken exchanges and the nicely turned phrases of the rhymed prose .
storytelling as last resort perhaps , more than the individual stories , it is the arrangement of the whole that is the stroke of genius , tying all the tales together : the fact that each story can act as a framework for further stories told within it , with the whole then subsumed under the wondrous tale of sheherazade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : never was the healing power of storytelling presented in a more beautiful way , like it is in the " arabian nights " the drama begins with the trauma of one man : sultan shahryar , a ruler in the island kingdom of india and china , discovers that his beloved wife is cheating on him every time he turns his back with a black slave .
when , on his flight from this horrendous scene , the wife and captive booty of a demon forces him to sleep with her in order to cuckold her hated demon husband , ifrit , he has had more than enough : shahryar decides from then on to kill each of his wives after their first night of lovemaking .
night after night .
in this brutal manner , the battle of the sexes culminates in a series of fatal one-night stands .
enter sheherazade , the daughter of the wazir .
this well-read and educated young woman has a plan : she will tell stories to save herself , the king , and the world .
she proceeds to tell tales just like every tv series does – so enthralling that , each night when the sun goes down , a cliffhanger will make the sultan desperate to hear what happens next -lrb- " and the jinni drew his sword to strike … " -rrb- , postponing her death until the beautiful storyteller is able to bear the sultan a child and thus change his mind about the wiles of womanhood . ludwig ammann , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de connecting the cultural dots dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing .

it was sweet revenge for bayern who surrendered their german title to bremen with a 3-1 loss at the olympic stadium last season .
bayern are starting to click into gear , building on their 4-0 champions league demolition of ajax in midweek , and leapfrogged bremen into third with the three points .
" we are up near the top of the table and back on the straight and narrow , " said bayern coach felix magath .
" we were fortunate to win but i think overall we deserved the three points . "
surprise package vfl wolfsburg still set the pace at the top following a 2-1 win over borussia monchengladbach .
vfb stuttgart are second one point behind wolfsburg after defeating arminia bielefeld 2-0 on sunday .
matthias sammer has yet to taste defeat in his ten games as stuttgart manager and his club are the only unbeaten team in the top-flight .
german international sebastian deisler was back in the bayern starting eleven after being ' rested ' for the past few matches and his corner was pivotal for the first goal .
in the 20th minute ballack rose highest to head home his fourth goal of the season from the corner kick .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sometimes makaay is so well marked it creates space for ballack , " explained magath .

during the cold war their tiny village bordered one of the soviet union 's largest foreign airbases .
then came cargolifter , a company hoping to build commercial heavy-lift zeppelins on the 500 hectare base after the russians left .
that project failed in 2002 , but it left behind a colossal 107-meter high airship hangar subsidized by taxpayers .
until recently , the most exciting thing to do in the area was to take a canoe ride and enjoy some of the spreewald 's popular cucumbers .
but colin au , a singapore-based malaysian multi-millionaire , is aiming to change all that .
this december , au and his partners at the malaysian conglomerate tanjong plc will open a € 70-million -lrb- $ 86.8-million -rrb- tropical rainforest theme park on the former cargolifter grounds .
" this concept could work anywhere it is cold , but germans really love the sun , " au told dw-world , as he pointed out where the hangar 's unfinished concrete floor will be transformed into white sandy beaches and heated lagoons .
thousands of plants when complete , the 360-meter long silver structure will be refashioned into a unique venue for thousands of tropical plants and cruise ship-like entertainment .
the park , known as tropical islands , will not only be home to orchids and palm trees ; it will also have several types of " villages " from tropical cultures , including borneo , congo and the amazon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer simulation of the tropical island beach .
in the depths of winter , the air temperature in the park will be a balmy 25 degrees celsius and the water in the pools an even warmer 30 degrees .
a special foil on the south side of the dome - the world 's largest freestanding construction of its kind - will let in almost 100 percent of the sun 's rays .
" if people do n't use sunscreen in the summer they 'll definitely get sunburn , " said tropical islands spokeswoman vivian kreft .
if successful , the resort in brand will become the flagship of a chain of similar parks around the world .
but none would be built on such a mammoth scale as the dome in germany .
au and tanjong were able to snap it up for a measly € 17.5 million - a fraction of what it cost cargolifter - during insolvency proceedings last year .
enough visitors ?
despite the proclivity of germans to flee their own inclement weather , it 's still uncertain if the park can really attract over two million visitors a year as planned .
only last week , the space center , a comic-themed amusement park in the northern city of bremen , closed its doors after opening earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first trees arrive .
but au dismissed worries that tropical islands could run into similar trouble .
" our concept is really much closer to a resort than an amusement park , " he said .
" it really should be attractive to a broad range of people . "
the project certainly was attractive to the government of the depressed eastern german state of brandenburg , which was relieved to find investors with a viable concept for the cargolifter hall .
with unemployment in brandenburg near 20 percent , the park will create 500 desperately needed new jobs for the region .
it 's the poor economy , though , that could present the biggest risk to the project , since down-on-their-luck germans have become notoriously stingy in recent years .
the amount of disposable income of many eastern germans will be further cut next year when unpopular reforms reduce the benefits of long-term unemployed to the level of welfare payments .
original concept is key harmut mertens , an economist at bankgesellschaft berlin , admitted the region is going through some tough times , but he remained optimistic tropical islands could be a success .
" they seem to have a pretty original concept there , " mertens told dw-world .
" the problem with the space center in bremen was that they put a lot of emphasis on shopping .

during the cold war their tiny village bordered one of the soviet union 's largest foreign airbases .
then came cargolifter , a company hoping to build commercial heavy-lift zeppelins on the 500 hectare base after the russians left .
that project failed in 2002 , but it left behind a colossal 107-meter high airship hangar subsidized by taxpayers .
until recently , the most exciting thing to do in the area was to take a canoe ride and enjoy some of the spreewald 's popular cucumbers .
but colin au , a singapore-based malaysian multi-millionaire , is aiming to change all that .
this december , au and his partners at the malaysian conglomerate tanjong plc will open a € 70-million -lrb- $ 86.8-million -rrb- tropical rainforest theme park on the former cargolifter grounds .
" this concept could work anywhere it is cold , but germans really love the sun , " au told dw-world , as he pointed out where the hangar 's unfinished concrete floor will be transformed into white sandy beaches and heated lagoons .
thousands of plants when complete , the 360-meter long silver structure will be refashioned into a unique venue for thousands of tropical plants and cruise ship-like entertainment .
the park , known as tropical islands , will not only be home to orchids and palm trees ; it will also have several types of " villages " from tropical cultures , including borneo , congo and the amazon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer simulation of the tropical island beach .
in the depths of winter , the air temperature in the park will be a balmy 25 degrees celsius and the water in the pools an even warmer 30 degrees .
a special foil on the south side of the dome - the world 's largest freestanding construction of its kind - will let in almost 100 percent of the sun 's rays .
" if people do n't use sunscreen in the summer they 'll definitely get sunburn , " said tropical islands spokeswoman vivian kreft .
if successful , the resort in brand will become the flagship of a chain of similar parks around the world .
but none would be built on such a mammoth scale as the dome in germany .
au and tanjong were able to snap it up for a measly € 17.5 million - a fraction of what it cost cargolifter - during insolvency proceedings last year .
enough visitors ?
despite the proclivity of germans to flee their own inclement weather , it 's still uncertain if the park can really attract over two million visitors a year as planned .
only last week , the space center , a comic-themed amusement park in the northern city of bremen , closed its doors after opening earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first trees arrive .
but au dismissed worries that tropical islands could run into similar trouble .
" our concept is really much closer to a resort than an amusement park , " he said .
" it really should be attractive to a broad range of people . "
the project certainly was attractive to the government of the depressed eastern german state of brandenburg , which was relieved to find investors with a viable concept for the cargolifter hall .
with unemployment in brandenburg near 20 percent , the park will create 500 desperately needed new jobs for the region .
it 's the poor economy , though , that could present the biggest risk to the project , since down-on-their-luck germans have become notoriously stingy in recent years .
the amount of disposable income of many eastern germans will be further cut next year when unpopular reforms reduce the benefits of long-term unemployed to the level of welfare payments .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the healing power of storytelling the new german translation of thousand and one nights -lrb- arabian nights -rrb- makes the oldest arabic version of this famed collection of oriental tales available for german readers for the first time . three hundred years ago , librarian antoine galland translated the story of " sindbad the sailor " for a noble woman .
he then heard of other stories , got his hands on a manuscript from syria and presented european readers with the first volume of " thousand and one nights " in 1704 .
the book 's popularity was like nothing ever seen before : overnight the stories took the west by storm , making hearts that shortly before had quaked in fear of the enemy from the east flutter in rapture for the enchanted orient .
literary triumph today the fabulous narratives even find favor with those more intellectual arabs who once dismissed the folktales as " pathetic prattle ; " only the eternally sanctimonious still take offence at the tales ' provocative sensuality .
galland had managed to uncover one of the world 's great literary treasures .
he translated the tales with a large measure of poetic freedom , in the style of his times , which probably only enhanced the work 's success .
there has since been no lack of alternative translations , including famous editions like that of enno littmann -lrb- 1921-1928 -rrb- .
but these have all been based on more recent manuscripts .
the original 15th-century fragment discovered by galland , which included 282 nights , is not only older , but also told in a particularly lively fashion , since , despite the authors ' efforts to stick to " correct " written arabic , colloquialisms keep breaking through – making for a different , more vernacular tone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of " thousand and one night " moves people from young to old in 1984 this original manuscript was published by muhsin mahdi .
and now , to mark the 300th anniversary of the first publication of the tales , arabic scholar claudia ott has produced a new translation - unlike galland keeping very close to the original text .
freed from the imposed patina of the european fairytale idiom , the " delectable " adventures of kings and beggars , slaves , demons and the " dead drunk " hunchback shine fresher than ever before .
ott effortlessly orchestrates the changes in register between the coarse tone of some of the spoken exchanges and the nicely turned phrases of the rhymed prose .
storytelling as last resort perhaps , more than the individual stories , it is the arrangement of the whole that is the stroke of genius , tying all the tales together : the fact that each story can act as a framework for further stories told within it , with the whole then subsumed under the wondrous tale of sheherazade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : never was the healing power of storytelling presented in a more beautiful way , like it is in the " arabian nights " the drama begins with the trauma of one man : sultan shahryar , a ruler in the island kingdom of india and china , discovers that his beloved wife is cheating on him every time he turns his back with a black slave .
when , on his flight from this horrendous scene , the wife and captive booty of a demon forces him to sleep with her in order to cuckold her hated demon husband , ifrit , he has had more than enough : shahryar decides from then on to kill each of his wives after their first night of lovemaking .
night after night .
in this brutal manner , the battle of the sexes culminates in a series of fatal one-night stands .

this well-read and educated young woman has a plan : she will tell stories to save herself , the king , and the world .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the healing power of storytelling the new german translation of thousand and one nights -lrb- arabian nights -rrb- makes the oldest arabic version of this famed collection of oriental tales available for german readers for the first time . three hundred years ago , librarian antoine galland translated the story of " sindbad the sailor " for a noble woman .
he then heard of other stories , got his hands on a manuscript from syria and presented european readers with the first volume of " thousand and one nights " in 1704 .
the book 's popularity was like nothing ever seen before : overnight the stories took the west by storm , making hearts that shortly before had quaked in fear of the enemy from the east flutter in rapture for the enchanted orient .
literary triumph today the fabulous narratives even find favor with those more intellectual arabs who once dismissed the folktales as " pathetic prattle ; " only the eternally sanctimonious still take offence at the tales ' provocative sensuality .
galland had managed to uncover one of the world 's great literary treasures .
he translated the tales with a large measure of poetic freedom , in the style of his times , which probably only enhanced the work 's success .
there has since been no lack of alternative translations , including famous editions like that of enno littmann -lrb- 1921-1928 -rrb- .
but these have all been based on more recent manuscripts .
the original 15th-century fragment discovered by galland , which included 282 nights , is not only older , but also told in a particularly lively fashion , since , despite the authors ' efforts to stick to " correct " written arabic , colloquialisms keep breaking through – making for a different , more vernacular tone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of " thousand and one night " moves people from young to old in 1984 this original manuscript was published by muhsin mahdi .
and now , to mark the 300th anniversary of the first publication of the tales , arabic scholar claudia ott has produced a new translation - unlike galland keeping very close to the original text .
freed from the imposed patina of the european fairytale idiom , the " delectable " adventures of kings and beggars , slaves , demons and the " dead drunk " hunchback shine fresher than ever before .
ott effortlessly orchestrates the changes in register between the coarse tone of some of the spoken exchanges and the nicely turned phrases of the rhymed prose .
storytelling as last resort perhaps , more than the individual stories , it is the arrangement of the whole that is the stroke of genius , tying all the tales together : the fact that each story can act as a framework for further stories told within it , with the whole then subsumed under the wondrous tale of sheherazade .

during the cold war their tiny village bordered one of the soviet union 's largest foreign airbases .
then came cargolifter , a company hoping to build commercial heavy-lift zeppelins on the 500 hectare base after the russians left .
that project failed in 2002 , but it left behind a colossal 107-meter high airship hangar subsidized by taxpayers .
until recently , the most exciting thing to do in the area was to take a canoe ride and enjoy some of the spreewald 's popular cucumbers .
but colin au , a singapore-based malaysian multi-millionaire , is aiming to change all that .
this december , au and his partners at the malaysian conglomerate tanjong plc will open a € 70-million -lrb- $ 86.8-million -rrb- tropical rainforest theme park on the former cargolifter grounds .
" this concept could work anywhere it is cold , but germans really love the sun , " au told dw-world , as he pointed out where the hangar 's unfinished concrete floor will be transformed into white sandy beaches and heated lagoons .
thousands of plants when complete , the 360-meter long silver structure will be refashioned into a unique venue for thousands of tropical plants and cruise ship-like entertainment .
the park , known as tropical islands , will not only be home to orchids and palm trees ; it will also have several types of " villages " from tropical cultures , including borneo , congo and the amazon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer simulation of the tropical island beach .
in the depths of winter , the air temperature in the park will be a balmy 25 degrees celsius and the water in the pools an even warmer 30 degrees .
a special foil on the south side of the dome - the world 's largest freestanding construction of its kind - will let in almost 100 percent of the sun 's rays .
" if people do n't use sunscreen in the summer they 'll definitely get sunburn , " said tropical islands spokeswoman vivian kreft .
if successful , the resort in brand will become the flagship of a chain of similar parks around the world .
but none would be built on such a mammoth scale as the dome in germany .
au and tanjong were able to snap it up for a measly € 17.5 million - a fraction of what it cost cargolifter - during insolvency proceedings last year .
enough visitors ?
despite the proclivity of germans to flee their own inclement weather , it 's still uncertain if the park can really attract over two million visitors a year as planned .
only last week , the space center , a comic-themed amusement park in the northern city of bremen , closed its doors after opening earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first trees arrive .
but au dismissed worries that tropical islands could run into similar trouble .
" our concept is really much closer to a resort than an amusement park , " he said .
" it really should be attractive to a broad range of people . "
the project certainly was attractive to the government of the depressed eastern german state of brandenburg , which was relieved to find investors with a viable concept for the cargolifter hall .
with unemployment in brandenburg near 20 percent , the park will create 500 desperately needed new jobs for the region .
it 's the poor economy , though , that could present the biggest risk to the project , since down-on-their-luck germans have become notoriously stingy in recent years .
the amount of disposable income of many eastern germans will be further cut next year when unpopular reforms reduce the benefits of long-term unemployed to the level of welfare payments .
original concept is key harmut mertens , an economist at bankgesellschaft berlin , admitted the region is going through some tough times , but he remained optimistic tropical islands could be a success .
" they seem to have a pretty original concept there , " mertens told dw-world .
" the problem with the space center in bremen was that they put a lot of emphasis on shopping .
that 's not the case with the tropics park . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cargolifter building the dome .
the locals from brand , however , are more cautious after seeing both the soviets and the zeppelin makers come and go .
" i 'm a little skeptical , " said carola seidenfeudel , who runs a snack shop not far from the dome .
she said her family sold drinks and food to cargolifter employees for years before the company went bankrupt .
only after construction started for tropical island this spring did they return to their familiar corner next to brand 's tiny railway station .

the attacks have mainly concerned journalists with the local press – and the number of cases has risen recently , something which the report calls an alarming tendency .
the debate over the freedom of the romanian press has been fuelled by recent alleged attempts to influence the work of journalists in a number of independent romanian newspapers .
two big newspapers , evenime ntul zilei and romania libera , protested at alleged undue interference by their western owners in their editorial content .
both the swiss group ringier and the german owner waz , owners of the two dailies , have denied influencing editorial policy .
the report is due to be published on wednesday and will be a key document on romania 's readiness to join the eu in 2007 .

but researchers at the renowned allensbach opinion research institute have published a study which reaches very different conclusions . to rita barwitzki , a 26-year-old from leipzig , the fall of the berlin wall almost 15 years ago could n't have come at a better time . " i had to shed part of my identity , " she explained , " but i could n't wait to discover new things . " " i did n't want to get stuck in the old ways - after all a new system had arrived that gave me more freedom and independence . " rita believes she benefited from having lived both behind the iron curtain and in reunited germany .
she has childhood memories of life under honecker , but it was the west that shaped her life as a teenager . her self-confidence is typical of the under-30s in eastern germany , who are more enterprising than the older generation , and many of their contemporaries in the west . empty prejudice when the ifd-allensbach questioned a sample of 2000 eastern germans , it was the young people who made the best impression . " we 'd always heard that the younger east germans felt they had no future , that they were lacking in motivation , " explained project manager thomas petersen .
" there were no opportunities , and the more capable ones left for the west - those are some of the clichés . " they proved to be empty prejudices .
" there 's a new generation emerging in our statistics that 's quite different , " observed petersen .
" they do n't just sit around feeling sorry for themselves , they take the initiative and they 're brimming with optimism . " shaping their own destiny 52 percent of young eastern germans say they are in control of their lives , while only a third of older eastern germans can match their self-belief .
in western germany , 45 percent believe that destiny is something you shape yourself , regardless of external circumstances . how do the researchers explain this ?
with the east german dictatorship an increasingly distant memory , a new generation has grown up that does not share the values of its parents .
a similar phenomenon was observed in post-war west germany and in the early 1990s in spain , 15 years after the death of franco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1973 , east berlin hosted the 10th world youth games .
" this younger generation hardly knew east germany , pointed out thomas petersen .
" they grew up in freedom and have been exposed to a world quite different to that in which their parents lived . " " there were differences in language , how one behaves in public and in private , what one can say , what one ca n't say , even how one keeps an eye on the neighbours .
these things were very different in a dictatorship . " the advantages of adversity thomas petersen also points out that eastern germans growing up in cities and towns with a 20 percent unemployment rate have experienced hardship from an early age . almost everybody in eastern germany knows someone who has lost their job and who 's suffering from financial or psychological problems . it 's a different story in western germany .

but researchers at the renowned allensbach opinion research institute have published a study which reaches very different conclusions . to rita barwitzki , a 26-year-old from leipzig , the fall of the berlin wall almost 15 years ago could n't have come at a better time . " i had to shed part of my identity , " she explained , " but i could n't wait to discover new things . " " i did n't want to get stuck in the old ways - after all a new system had arrived that gave me more freedom and independence . " rita believes she benefited from having lived both behind the iron curtain and in reunited germany .
she has childhood memories of life under honecker , but it was the west that shaped her life as a teenager . her self-confidence is typical of the under-30s in eastern germany , who are more enterprising than the older generation , and many of their contemporaries in the west . empty prejudice when the ifd-allensbach questioned a sample of 2000 eastern germans , it was the young people who made the best impression . " we 'd always heard that the younger east germans felt they had no future , that they were lacking in motivation , " explained project manager thomas petersen .
" there were no opportunities , and the more capable ones left for the west - those are some of the clichés . " they proved to be empty prejudices .

" shaping their own destiny 52 percent of young eastern germans say they are in control of their lives , while only a third of older eastern germans can match their self-belief .
in western germany , 45 percent believe that destiny is something you shape yourself , regardless of external circumstances . how do the researchers explain this ?
with the east german dictatorship an increasingly distant memory , a new generation has grown up that does not share the values of its parents .
a similar phenomenon was observed in post-war west germany and in the early 1990s in spain , 15 years after the death of franco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1973 , east berlin hosted the 10th world youth games .

these things were very different in a dictatorship . " the advantages of adversity thomas petersen also points out that eastern germans growing up in cities and towns with a 20 percent unemployment rate have experienced hardship from an early age . almost everybody in eastern germany knows someone who has lost their job and who 's suffering from financial or psychological problems . it 's a different story in western germany .

the report emphasizes that economic pressure has been put on the press as well as noting cases of physical attacks against journalists .
the attacks have mainly concerned journalists with the local press – and the number of cases has risen recently , something which the report calls an alarming tendency .
the debate over the freedom of the romanian press has been fuelled by recent alleged attempts to influence the work of journalists in a number of independent romanian newspapers .
two big newspapers , evenime ntul zilei and romania libera , protested at alleged undue interference by their western owners in their editorial content .
both the swiss group ringier and the german owner waz , owners of the two dailies , have denied influencing editorial policy .
the report is due to be published on wednesday and will be a key document on romania 's readiness to join the eu in 2007 .

lebanese authors are worried , but also get their hopes up . beirut ’ s young cultural scene is thriving : during the last year , tens of galleries have opened in the rebuild saifi village close to the city center , new cafes and jazz bars popped up in the gentrified areas of east beirut , where djs play the newest sound from europe and young musicians rap in the lebanese dialect .
at an abandoned train station , some musicians were recently organizing a techno party .
on this rave , ronja was handing out flyers inviting to a poetry slam at a private culture center .
" book fair in frankfurt ?
never heard of it , " she said .
she grew up in sweden and can ’ t read arabic well .
thus , she doesn ’ t follow the arab press .
rawan and sara go often to such events but haven ’ t heard about the book fair .
sara said those things don ’ t interest her .
" i work and work and hardly make $ 250 -lrb- € 200 -rrb- , " she said .
" i can ’ t go to europe , anyhow . "
no time for luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arabic rappers , from right to left , dj charley shaby , 25 , richy shaby , 20 , wassim akar , 22 , and mahmoud shalaby , 20 simon khuan was reading poems he has already published .
mamlaka as-sarasir -lrb- cachroche kingdom -rrb- came out three years ago .
the 31-year-old said he had heard about a large book fair taking place every year in frankfurt , but not about the arab world being the guest of honor .
" we are not in a luxury period here , " he says , " so people in general are not interested in culture . "
he hopes that such an event will not be turned into a political stage .
" it should just be for the intellectual aspect , " he said .
" we can ’ t solve our problems this way .
you can ’ t cover a hole in the table with a table cloth .
if the arab world wants to carry a message , i ask what message could that be ? "
but bashar haidar , a philosophy professor who was having a drink at a bistro with a colleague , said he had heard great things about the frankfurt book fair , but nothing about this year ’ s focus .
" that sounds fantastic , " he said .
" we should book tickets and go , " he told his colleague .
mixed feelings the lebanese authors who are invited to the fair were not quite as enthusiastic .
" since early 2004 , everything i read was criticism , " says emily nasrallah , who has had three novels and one children 's book translated into german .
" i haven ’ t read anything positive .
there was this delay , which also delayed the translation of books before the book fair .
but this is something for the governments to answer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut ´ s skyline , libanon she said she doesn ’ t expect anything , " but i hope they will succeed , because we have a lot to show . "
she said she hoped this could be a push for arab literature .
" i am also very happy that it is happening in germany , because from my experience i feel they respect us very much , " she said .
" but it ’ s not only germany .
it is also the frankfurt book fair .
when i am asked by journalists here , whether i don ’ t think that the book is dead , i always tell them to go to frankfurt and see for themselves . "
iman humaidan will have her second novel translated into german just in time for the book fair .
she said she is excited to go .
" i am looking forward to it , " she said .
" i hear everybody around me saying it ’ s going to be a scandal because we have nothing to present .
of course , we have !
the problem is we are not proud of what we have . "
lost images image is another problem .
" they were lost , because they lost their image , " humaidan said .
" the great ideologies have died .
what ’ s left is fundamentalism and the old regimes .
people like us are marginalized .
my first reaction was to ask : how can we access this space between those two sides ? "
she said she thinks the book fair should be different from those events " when the west thinks of dialogue with the arab world as a dialogue with fundamentalists .

lebanese authors are worried , but also get their hopes up . beirut ’ s young cultural scene is thriving : during the last year , tens of galleries have opened in the rebuild saifi village close to the city center , new cafes and jazz bars popped up in the gentrified areas of east beirut , where djs play the newest sound from europe and young musicians rap in the lebanese dialect .
at an abandoned train station , some musicians were recently organizing a techno party .
on this rave , ronja was handing out flyers inviting to a poetry slam at a private culture center .

it was sweet revenge for bayern who surrendered their german title to bremen with a 3-1 loss at the olympic stadium last season .
bayern are starting to click into gear , building on their 4-0 champions league demolition of ajax in midweek , and leapfrogged bremen into third with the three points .
" we are up near the top of the table and back on the straight and narrow , " said bayern coach felix magath .
" we were fortunate to win but i think overall we deserved the three points . "
surprise package vfl wolfsburg still set the pace at the top following a 2-1 win over borussia monchengladbach .
vfb stuttgart are second one point behind wolfsburg after defeating arminia bielefeld 2-0 on sunday .
matthias sammer has yet to taste defeat in his ten games as stuttgart manager and his club are the only unbeaten team in the top-flight .
german international sebastian deisler was back in the bayern starting eleven after being ' rested ' for the past few matches and his corner was pivotal for the first goal .
in the 20th minute ballack rose highest to head home his fourth goal of the season from the corner kick .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sometimes makaay is so well marked it creates space for ballack , " explained magath .
" it is good to have two people who are so clinical in front of goal . "
croatian international ivan klasnic should have equalised for bremen on the half hour mark but somehow headed wide with the goal at his mercy .
" in the first half we lacked the bite that we demonstrated against valencia , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we could not convert our chances either . "
greece 's euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas , who scored the winner against valencia in midweek , replaced klasnic at the interval as coach schaaf revamped his front line . hosts bremen asserted more pressure but it was in vain as substitute schweinsteiger staked a claim for a place in the first team curling home a 75th minute shot that caught goalkeeper andreas reinke off guard .
the second goal proved important as miroslav klose reduced the deficit with a header in the 81st minute , his fourth goal in his last two bundesliga outings , but bayern held on .
bremen 's miserable afternoon was capped off when it was confirmed that german international frank fahrenhorst had broken his nose after ballack 's stray elbow forced him to leave the field after seven minutes .
leverkusen ends drought bayer leverkusen ended a five match winless streak with a 3-0 triumph over sv hamburg at the bayarena .
bildunterschrift : " i am delighted with the three points , " said bayer manager klaus augenthaler .
" the win is more significant than the victory against bayern because the team were at a low ebb . "
augenthaler claimed polish international jacek krzynowek should have a licence for his left foot and it was clear what the coach meant .
in the 10th minute krzynowek unleashed a 25 yard shot from his cannon left foot and the ball crashed into the roof of the net .
brazilian international juan -lrb- 73 -rrb- and bulgarian international dimitar berbatov -lrb- 86 -rrb- struck late on for leverkusen spoiling the return of hamburg chief klaus toppmoller , who guided bayer to the champions league final in 2002 .
borussia dortmund fans still pine for their first home win in the bundesliga following a 2-2 draw with fc nuremberg .
nuremberg scored twice in the 23rd and 25th minute to shock the 75,000 fans , but czech international jan koller salvaged a point with a brace -lrb- 28 , 45 -rrb- in a busy first half at the westfalen stadium .
in a league encounter on sunday , manager ralf rangnick enjoyed his first bundesliga match in charge of schalke 04 with a 3-2 triumph over local rivals vfl bochum .
schalke climbed an incredible nine places with the victory and are now in seventh after being in the relegation zone before the match .
a first half goal blitz did the damage with german international gerald asamoah -lrb- 10 -rrb- , levan kobiaschvili -lrb- 13 -rrb- and brazilian lincoln -lrb- 44 -rrb- all on target .
bochum pulled two goals back in a see-saw second half but could not find an equaliser against ten-man schalke who had goalscorer lincoln dismissed in the 80th minute for wasting time . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern turns up heat with win in bremen it was n't pretty but bayern munich claimed a victory over arch rivals werder bremen on saturday , moving up to third in the league with a 2-1 win .

" your strategic decision you have to make - to change the situation in the whole region , including iraq , for the better .
and for the europeans it will be turkey , " fischer told guests at the american academy in berlin last week . berlin pledges to back ankara schröder 's government has moved beyond giving lip service to the notion of turkey 's eu candidacy , as was the case under the conservative government of helmut kohl , to making it one of the pillars of german foreign policy .
it threw its weight in earnest behind ankara 's bid at the eu 's summit in copenhagen in late 2002 , which was focused on enlargement . with france in tow , the government in berlin initiated the proposal that will in december see eu leaders decide on turkey 's future based on a european commission report this week about its progress toward democratic reforms . " if the european commission recommends opening accession talks , then germany will clearly support that , " schröder said sunday before presenting prime minister recep tayyip erdogan an award for his reform work so far . opposition calls for ' special relationship ' the german opposition has , meanwhile , raised the issue of human rights abuses and says turkey does not share the same " values " , ostensibly cultural and religious , as the union . " from a geographical point of view , i think that europe has to have borders so that its integrity is not endangered , " edmund stoiber , the former conservative candidate for chancellor , told afp last week . " this does n't rule out having ties through a partnership , " he added . economic opportunities for the german business community , turkey 's membership will bring economic opportunities to its biggest trading partner and , in the words of wholesale and foreign trade federation head anton boerner , a " growth and profit spiral " . about 30 percent of turkey 's trade with the eu is with germany .
however , for the conservatives , acutely aware of the massive cost of german reunification , the price is too high .
the brussels think-tank " friends of europe " has estimated that turkey 's integration will cost some 15 billion euros annually over three years .
germany would pay the most : 2.4 billion euros a year . " while integration would be good for turkey , it would be unmanageable for europe , in particular from a financial point of view because the costs of such an integration would be too high , " stoiber said . strengthening turkey 's ties to the west however heinz kramer , an expert on turkish affairs at the swp institute , told afp that a firm date for accession talks could be good all round . " a prospect of membership will help the turkish government consolidate its reform programme and will send a signal to the financial and economic markets that turkey is more strongly linked to the west , " he said . that aside , public opinion is not in ankara 's favour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 bringing the tropics to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the park will be housed in the world 's largest freestanding dome long famous for its tasty cucumbers , the spreewald region just south of berlin is about to become well-known for rather more exotic flora : asian investors are converting a zeppelin hangar into a tropical rainforest . the denizens of brand , a small community 60 kilometers outside of the german capital berlin , probably think they 've seen it all .
during the cold war their tiny village bordered one of the soviet union 's largest foreign airbases .
then came cargolifter , a company hoping to build commercial heavy-lift zeppelins on the 500 hectare base after the russians left .
that project failed in 2002 , but it left behind a colossal 107-meter high airship hangar subsidized by taxpayers .
until recently , the most exciting thing to do in the area was to take a canoe ride and enjoy some of the spreewald 's popular cucumbers .
but colin au , a singapore-based malaysian multi-millionaire , is aiming to change all that .
this december , au and his partners at the malaysian conglomerate tanjong plc will open a € 70-million -lrb- $ 86.8-million -rrb- tropical rainforest theme park on the former cargolifter grounds .
" this concept could work anywhere it is cold , but germans really love the sun , " au told dw-world , as he pointed out where the hangar 's unfinished concrete floor will be transformed into white sandy beaches and heated lagoons .
thousands of plants when complete , the 360-meter long silver structure will be refashioned into a unique venue for thousands of tropical plants and cruise ship-like entertainment .
the park , known as tropical islands , will not only be home to orchids and palm trees ; it will also have several types of " villages " from tropical cultures , including borneo , congo and the amazon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer simulation of the tropical island beach .
in the depths of winter , the air temperature in the park will be a balmy 25 degrees celsius and the water in the pools an even warmer 30 degrees .
a special foil on the south side of the dome - the world 's largest freestanding construction of its kind - will let in almost 100 percent of the sun 's rays .
" if people do n't use sunscreen in the summer they 'll definitely get sunburn , " said tropical islands spokeswoman vivian kreft .
if successful , the resort in brand will become the flagship of a chain of similar parks around the world .
but none would be built on such a mammoth scale as the dome in germany .
au and tanjong were able to snap it up for a measly € 17.5 million - a fraction of what it cost cargolifter - during insolvency proceedings last year .
enough visitors ?
despite the proclivity of germans to flee their own inclement weather , it 's still uncertain if the park can really attract over two million visitors a year as planned .
only last week , the space center , a comic-themed amusement park in the northern city of bremen , closed its doors after opening earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first trees arrive .
but au dismissed worries that tropical islands could run into similar trouble .
" our concept is really much closer to a resort than an amusement park , " he said .
" it really should be attractive to a broad range of people . "
the project certainly was attractive to the government of the depressed eastern german state of brandenburg , which was relieved to find investors with a viable concept for the cargolifter hall .
with unemployment in brandenburg near 20 percent , the park will create 500 desperately needed new jobs for the region .
it 's the poor economy , though , that could present the biggest risk to the project , since down-on-their-luck germans have become notoriously stingy in recent years .
the amount of disposable income of many eastern germans will be further cut next year when unpopular reforms reduce the benefits of long-term unemployed to the level of welfare payments .
original concept is key harmut mertens , an economist at bankgesellschaft berlin , admitted the region is going through some tough times , but he remained optimistic tropical islands could be a success .
" they seem to have a pretty original concept there , " mertens told dw-world .
" the problem with the space center in bremen was that they put a lot of emphasis on shopping .
that 's not the case with the tropics park . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cargolifter building the dome .
the locals from brand , however , are more cautious after seeing both the soviets and the zeppelin makers come and go .
" i 'm a little skeptical , " said carola seidenfeudel , who runs a snack shop not far from the dome .
she said her family sold drinks and food to cargolifter employees for years before the company went bankrupt .
only after construction started for tropical island this spring did they return to their familiar corner next to brand 's tiny railway station .
" it 'll be great if it works , but we 've been burned before , " she said . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cargolifter goes way of hindenburg once a boutique project of nascent eastern german entrepreneurialism , airship developer cargolifter declares insolvency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far bremen wins opener delayed by blackout leverkusen go top as champions slip up champions extend winning streak all change in bundesliga title race sports -pipe- 04.10.2004 bayern beats bremen , leverkusen ends winless streak großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanking the bayern gods bayern munich underlined their determination to wrestle the german crown back from werder bremen with a 2-1 victory over the champions at the weserstadion on saturday . bayern had not won in bremen since december 1999 but broke that hoodoo with german internationals michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger on target .
it was sweet revenge for bayern who surrendered their german title to bremen with a 3-1 loss at the olympic stadium last season .
bayern are starting to click into gear , building on their 4-0 champions league demolition of ajax in midweek , and leapfrogged bremen into third with the three points .
" we are up near the top of the table and back on the straight and narrow , " said bayern coach felix magath .
" we were fortunate to win but i think overall we deserved the three points . "
surprise package vfl wolfsburg still set the pace at the top following a 2-1 win over borussia monchengladbach .
vfb stuttgart are second one point behind wolfsburg after defeating arminia bielefeld 2-0 on sunday .
matthias sammer has yet to taste defeat in his ten games as stuttgart manager and his club are the only unbeaten team in the top-flight .
german international sebastian deisler was back in the bayern starting eleven after being ' rested ' for the past few matches and his corner was pivotal for the first goal .
in the 20th minute ballack rose highest to head home his fourth goal of the season from the corner kick .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sometimes makaay is so well marked it creates space for ballack , " explained magath .
" it is good to have two people who are so clinical in front of goal . "
croatian international ivan klasnic should have equalised for bremen on the half hour mark but somehow headed wide with the goal at his mercy .
" in the first half we lacked the bite that we demonstrated against valencia , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we could not convert our chances either . "
greece 's euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas , who scored the winner against valencia in midweek , replaced klasnic at the interval as coach schaaf revamped his front line . hosts bremen asserted more pressure but it was in vain as substitute schweinsteiger staked a claim for a place in the first team curling home a 75th minute shot that caught goalkeeper andreas reinke off guard .
the second goal proved important as miroslav klose reduced the deficit with a header in the 81st minute , his fourth goal in his last two bundesliga outings , but bayern held on .
bremen 's miserable afternoon was capped off when it was confirmed that german international frank fahrenhorst had broken his nose after ballack 's stray elbow forced him to leave the field after seven minutes .
leverkusen ends drought bayer leverkusen ended a five match winless streak with a 3-0 triumph over sv hamburg at the bayarena .
bildunterschrift : " i am delighted with the three points , " said bayer manager klaus augenthaler .
" the win is more significant than the victory against bayern because the team were at a low ebb . "
augenthaler claimed polish international jacek krzynowek should have a licence for his left foot and it was clear what the coach meant .
in the 10th minute krzynowek unleashed a 25 yard shot from his cannon left foot and the ball crashed into the roof of the net .
brazilian international juan -lrb- 73 -rrb- and bulgarian international dimitar berbatov -lrb- 86 -rrb- struck late on for leverkusen spoiling the return of hamburg chief klaus toppmoller , who guided bayer to the champions league final in 2002 .
borussia dortmund fans still pine for their first home win in the bundesliga following a 2-2 draw with fc nuremberg .
nuremberg scored twice in the 23rd and 25th minute to shock the 75,000 fans , but czech international jan koller salvaged a point with a brace -lrb- 28 , 45 -rrb- in a busy first half at the westfalen stadium .
in a league encounter on sunday , manager ralf rangnick enjoyed his first bundesliga match in charge of schalke 04 with a 3-2 triumph over local rivals vfl bochum .
schalke climbed an incredible nine places with the victory and are now in seventh after being in the relegation zone before the match .
a first half goal blitz did the damage with german international gerald asamoah -lrb- 10 -rrb- , levan kobiaschvili -lrb- 13 -rrb- and brazilian lincoln -lrb- 44 -rrb- all on target .
bochum pulled two goals back in a see-saw second half but could not find an equaliser against ten-man schalke who had goalscorer lincoln dismissed in the 80th minute for wasting time . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern turns up heat with win in bremen it was n't pretty but bayern munich claimed a victory over arch rivals werder bremen on saturday , moving up to third in the league with a 2-1 win .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the healing power of storytelling the new german translation of thousand and one nights -lrb- arabian nights -rrb- makes the oldest arabic version of this famed collection of oriental tales available for german readers for the first time . three hundred years ago , librarian antoine galland translated the story of " sindbad the sailor " for a noble woman .
he then heard of other stories , got his hands on a manuscript from syria and presented european readers with the first volume of " thousand and one nights " in 1704 .
the book 's popularity was like nothing ever seen before : overnight the stories took the west by storm , making hearts that shortly before had quaked in fear of the enemy from the east flutter in rapture for the enchanted orient .
literary triumph today the fabulous narratives even find favor with those more intellectual arabs who once dismissed the folktales as " pathetic prattle ; " only the eternally sanctimonious still take offence at the tales ' provocative sensuality .
galland had managed to uncover one of the world 's great literary treasures .
he translated the tales with a large measure of poetic freedom , in the style of his times , which probably only enhanced the work 's success .
there has since been no lack of alternative translations , including famous editions like that of enno littmann -lrb- 1921-1928 -rrb- .
but these have all been based on more recent manuscripts .
the original 15th-century fragment discovered by galland , which included 282 nights , is not only older , but also told in a particularly lively fashion , since , despite the authors ' efforts to stick to " correct " written arabic , colloquialisms keep breaking through – making for a different , more vernacular tone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of " thousand and one night " moves people from young to old in 1984 this original manuscript was published by muhsin mahdi .
and now , to mark the 300th anniversary of the first publication of the tales , arabic scholar claudia ott has produced a new translation - unlike galland keeping very close to the original text .
freed from the imposed patina of the european fairytale idiom , the " delectable " adventures of kings and beggars , slaves , demons and the " dead drunk " hunchback shine fresher than ever before .
ott effortlessly orchestrates the changes in register between the coarse tone of some of the spoken exchanges and the nicely turned phrases of the rhymed prose .
storytelling as last resort perhaps , more than the individual stories , it is the arrangement of the whole that is the stroke of genius , tying all the tales together : the fact that each story can act as a framework for further stories told within it , with the whole then subsumed under the wondrous tale of sheherazade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : never was the healing power of storytelling presented in a more beautiful way , like it is in the " arabian nights " the drama begins with the trauma of one man : sultan shahryar , a ruler in the island kingdom of india and china , discovers that his beloved wife is cheating on him every time he turns his back with a black slave .
when , on his flight from this horrendous scene , the wife and captive booty of a demon forces him to sleep with her in order to cuckold her hated demon husband , ifrit , he has had more than enough : shahryar decides from then on to kill each of his wives after their first night of lovemaking .
night after night .
in this brutal manner , the battle of the sexes culminates in a series of fatal one-night stands .

this well-read and educated young woman has a plan : she will tell stories to save herself , the king , and the world .
she proceeds to tell tales just like every tv series does – so enthralling that , each night when the sun goes down , a cliffhanger will make the sultan desperate to hear what happens next -lrb- " and the jinni drew his sword to strike … " -rrb- , postponing her death until the beautiful storyteller is able to bear the sultan a child and thus change his mind about the wiles of womanhood . ludwig ammann , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de connecting the cultural dots dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the healing power of storytelling the new german translation of thousand and one nights -lrb- arabian nights -rrb- makes the oldest arabic version of this famed collection of oriental tales available for german readers for the first time . three hundred years ago , librarian antoine galland translated the story of " sindbad the sailor " for a noble woman .
he then heard of other stories , got his hands on a manuscript from syria and presented european readers with the first volume of " thousand and one nights " in 1704 .
the book 's popularity was like nothing ever seen before : overnight the stories took the west by storm , making hearts that shortly before had quaked in fear of the enemy from the east flutter in rapture for the enchanted orient .
literary triumph today the fabulous narratives even find favor with those more intellectual arabs who once dismissed the folktales as " pathetic prattle ; " only the eternally sanctimonious still take offence at the tales ' provocative sensuality .
galland had managed to uncover one of the world 's great literary treasures .
he translated the tales with a large measure of poetic freedom , in the style of his times , which probably only enhanced the work 's success .
there has since been no lack of alternative translations , including famous editions like that of enno littmann -lrb- 1921-1928 -rrb- .
but these have all been based on more recent manuscripts .
the original 15th-century fragment discovered by galland , which included 282 nights , is not only older , but also told in a particularly lively fashion , since , despite the authors ' efforts to stick to " correct " written arabic , colloquialisms keep breaking through – making for a different , more vernacular tone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of " thousand and one night " moves people from young to old in 1984 this original manuscript was published by muhsin mahdi .
and now , to mark the 300th anniversary of the first publication of the tales , arabic scholar claudia ott has produced a new translation - unlike galland keeping very close to the original text .
freed from the imposed patina of the european fairytale idiom , the " delectable " adventures of kings and beggars , slaves , demons and the " dead drunk " hunchback shine fresher than ever before .
ott effortlessly orchestrates the changes in register between the coarse tone of some of the spoken exchanges and the nicely turned phrases of the rhymed prose .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.10.2004 poland to reduce force in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish soldiers will go home next year poland will significantly reduce its number of troops in iraq by the end of 2005 , the country 's defense minister said on monday .
the move could reflect some poles ' increasing dissatisfaction with american policies . in the run-up to the us-led invasion of iraq , poland was one of america 's staunchest supporters .
all of poland 's major political parties supported the war and 2,500 troops were sent to help with the war effort .
those soldiers now lead an 8,000 strong multinational force , which controls south-central iraq .
but poland 's defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski was quoted in monday 's issue of the polish daily gazeta wyborcza as saying that poland would significantly reduce its commitment to the region .
according to the report , poland will reduce its forces in iraq by 40 percent - from 2,500 to 1,500 - by the end of 2005 .
government under pressure the deadline to pull out troops will coincide with the expiration of the united nations security council resolution 1546 at the end of 2005 , which authorized the upcoming elections .
" that does not mean , however , that if a stabilization mission was continued , polish troops would be completely pulled out from iraq , " said szmajdzinkski .
" a group of officers at the headquarters , training centers , maybe a group of observers could still remain . "
the decision to reduce poland 's deployment in iraq came at the request of the current left-wing government 's junior coalition party , the labor union -lrb- up -rrb- .
polish prime minister marek belka 's government faces a parliamentary vote of confidence later this month , and general parliamentary elections are due to be held in mid-2005 .
both will take place amid a growing backdrop of disenchantment with american foreign policy .
america 's image tarnished poland has long been one of the united states ' staunchest supporters .
largely due to the legacy of communism , even the liberals among poland 's political elite shared us policy-makers ' view that tyranny should be met with force .
but as the situation in iraq degenerated over the past year , poles - both the media and the average citizen alike - have started to question the price poland pays for its unwavering support for its unwavering support of the united states .
indeed , 17 poles have died in iraq , but the political costs have also been high .
by allying itself with the us in the hopes of becoming a leader of so-called " new europe , " poland entered the eu on may 1st of this year at odds with germany and france .
and poles are questioning whether the current us administration truly intends to make good on its promise to deliver a credible democracy in iraq , the basis upon which they supported the invasion .
what 's more , the united states has not delivered many of the rewards promised to poland in exchange for its support , including lucrative reconstruction contracts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kwasniewski , pictured with us president bush , is getting tough with washington .
all of the above has led to a growing backlash .
earlier this month , even poland 's president aleksander kwasniewski offered his own voice to the growing chorus of dissent .
he told the new york times that the united states needed to become " more flexible , more gracious , " and that the bush administration should abandon its " neoconservative divide-and-rule policy . "
in june , spain withdrew its 1,300 troops after the socialists replaced the conservative government of jose maria aznar in national elections .
the new spanish prime minister , jose luis zapatero , has called the war iraq illegal under international law . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lech walesa : germany and france share blame for iraq war the former polish president and nobel peace prize winner says germany and france are partially to blame for the iraq war , because they failed to convince other eu members of their case against invasion .

the move could reflect some poles ' increasing dissatisfaction with american policies . in the run-up to the us-led invasion of iraq , poland was one of america 's staunchest supporters .
all of poland 's major political parties supported the war and 2,500 troops were sent to help with the war effort .
those soldiers now lead an 8,000 strong multinational force , which controls south-central iraq .
but poland 's defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski was quoted in monday 's issue of the polish daily gazeta wyborcza as saying that poland would significantly reduce its commitment to the region .
according to the report , poland will reduce its forces in iraq by 40 percent - from 2,500 to 1,500 - by the end of 2005 .
government under pressure the deadline to pull out troops will coincide with the expiration of the united nations security council resolution 1546 at the end of 2005 , which authorized the upcoming elections .
" that does not mean , however , that if a stabilization mission was continued , polish troops would be completely pulled out from iraq , " said szmajdzinkski .
" a group of officers at the headquarters , training centers , maybe a group of observers could still remain . "
the decision to reduce poland 's deployment in iraq came at the request of the current left-wing government 's junior coalition party , the labor union -lrb- up -rrb- .
polish prime minister marek belka 's government faces a parliamentary vote of confidence later this month , and general parliamentary elections are due to be held in mid-2005 .
both will take place amid a growing backdrop of disenchantment with american foreign policy .
america 's image tarnished poland has long been one of the united states ' staunchest supporters .
largely due to the legacy of communism , even the liberals among poland 's political elite shared us policy-makers ' view that tyranny should be met with force .
but as the situation in iraq degenerated over the past year , poles - both the media and the average citizen alike - have started to question the price poland pays for its unwavering support for its unwavering support of the united states .
indeed , 17 poles have died in iraq , but the political costs have also been high .
by allying itself with the us in the hopes of becoming a leader of so-called " new europe , " poland entered the eu on may 1st of this year at odds with germany and france .
and poles are questioning whether the current us administration truly intends to make good on its promise to deliver a credible democracy in iraq , the basis upon which they supported the invasion .
what 's more , the united states has not delivered many of the rewards promised to poland in exchange for its support , including lucrative reconstruction contracts .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the unknown guest of honor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2004 frankfurt book fair 2004 focuses on the arab world in beirut 's cultural scene nobody seems to know about the book fair in frankfurt .
lebanese authors are worried , but also get their hopes up . beirut ’ s young cultural scene is thriving : during the last year , tens of galleries have opened in the rebuild saifi village close to the city center , new cafes and jazz bars popped up in the gentrified areas of east beirut , where djs play the newest sound from europe and young musicians rap in the lebanese dialect .
at an abandoned train station , some musicians were recently organizing a techno party .
on this rave , ronja was handing out flyers inviting to a poetry slam at a private culture center .
" book fair in frankfurt ?
never heard of it , " she said .
she grew up in sweden and can ’ t read arabic well .
thus , she doesn ’ t follow the arab press .
rawan and sara go often to such events but haven ’ t heard about the book fair .
sara said those things don ’ t interest her .
" i work and work and hardly make $ 250 -lrb- € 200 -rrb- , " she said .
" i can ’ t go to europe , anyhow . "
no time for luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arabic rappers , from right to left , dj charley shaby , 25 , richy shaby , 20 , wassim akar , 22 , and mahmoud shalaby , 20 simon khuan was reading poems he has already published .
mamlaka as-sarasir -lrb- cachroche kingdom -rrb- came out three years ago .
the 31-year-old said he had heard about a large book fair taking place every year in frankfurt , but not about the arab world being the guest of honor .
" we are not in a luxury period here , " he says , " so people in general are not interested in culture . "
he hopes that such an event will not be turned into a political stage .
" it should just be for the intellectual aspect , " he said .
" we can ’ t solve our problems this way .
you can ’ t cover a hole in the table with a table cloth .
if the arab world wants to carry a message , i ask what message could that be ? "
but bashar haidar , a philosophy professor who was having a drink at a bistro with a colleague , said he had heard great things about the frankfurt book fair , but nothing about this year ’ s focus .
" that sounds fantastic , " he said .
" we should book tickets and go , " he told his colleague .
mixed feelings the lebanese authors who are invited to the fair were not quite as enthusiastic .
" since early 2004 , everything i read was criticism , " says emily nasrallah , who has had three novels and one children 's book translated into german .
" i haven ’ t read anything positive .
there was this delay , which also delayed the translation of books before the book fair .
but this is something for the governments to answer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut ´ s skyline , libanon she said she doesn ’ t expect anything , " but i hope they will succeed , because we have a lot to show . "
she said she hoped this could be a push for arab literature .
" i am also very happy that it is happening in germany , because from my experience i feel they respect us very much , " she said .
" but it ’ s not only germany .
it is also the frankfurt book fair .
when i am asked by journalists here , whether i don ’ t think that the book is dead , i always tell them to go to frankfurt and see for themselves . "
iman humaidan will have her second novel translated into german just in time for the book fair .
she said she is excited to go .
" i am looking forward to it , " she said .
" i hear everybody around me saying it ’ s going to be a scandal because we have nothing to present .
of course , we have !
the problem is we are not proud of what we have . "
lost images image is another problem .
" they were lost , because they lost their image , " humaidan said .
" the great ideologies have died .
what ’ s left is fundamentalism and the old regimes .
people like us are marginalized .
my first reaction was to ask : how can we access this space between those two sides ? "
she said she thinks the book fair should be different from those events " when the west thinks of dialogue with the arab world as a dialogue with fundamentalists .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the unknown guest of honor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2004 frankfurt book fair 2004 focuses on the arab world in beirut 's cultural scene nobody seems to know about the book fair in frankfurt .
lebanese authors are worried , but also get their hopes up . beirut ’ s young cultural scene is thriving : during the last year , tens of galleries have opened in the rebuild saifi village close to the city center , new cafes and jazz bars popped up in the gentrified areas of east beirut , where djs play the newest sound from europe and young musicians rap in the lebanese dialect .
at an abandoned train station , some musicians were recently organizing a techno party .
on this rave , ronja was handing out flyers inviting to a poetry slam at a private culture center .
" book fair in frankfurt ?
never heard of it , " she said .
she grew up in sweden and can ’ t read arabic well .
thus , she doesn ’ t follow the arab press .
rawan and sara go often to such events but haven ’ t heard about the book fair .
sara said those things don ’ t interest her .
" i work and work and hardly make $ 250 -lrb- € 200 -rrb- , " she said .
" i can ’ t go to europe , anyhow . "
no time for luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arabic rappers , from right to left , dj charley shaby , 25 , richy shaby , 20 , wassim akar , 22 , and mahmoud shalaby , 20 simon khuan was reading poems he has already published .
mamlaka as-sarasir -lrb- cachroche kingdom -rrb- came out three years ago .
the 31-year-old said he had heard about a large book fair taking place every year in frankfurt , but not about the arab world being the guest of honor .
" we are not in a luxury period here , " he says , " so people in general are not interested in culture . "
he hopes that such an event will not be turned into a political stage .
" it should just be for the intellectual aspect , " he said .
" we can ’ t solve our problems this way .
you can ’ t cover a hole in the table with a table cloth .
if the arab world wants to carry a message , i ask what message could that be ? "
but bashar haidar , a philosophy professor who was having a drink at a bistro with a colleague , said he had heard great things about the frankfurt book fair , but nothing about this year ’ s focus .
" that sounds fantastic , " he said .
" we should book tickets and go , " he told his colleague .
mixed feelings the lebanese authors who are invited to the fair were not quite as enthusiastic .
" since early 2004 , everything i read was criticism , " says emily nasrallah , who has had three novels and one children 's book translated into german .
" i haven ’ t read anything positive .
there was this delay , which also delayed the translation of books before the book fair .
but this is something for the governments to answer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut ´ s skyline , libanon she said she doesn ’ t expect anything , " but i hope they will succeed , because we have a lot to show . "
she said she hoped this could be a push for arab literature .
" i am also very happy that it is happening in germany , because from my experience i feel they respect us very much , " she said .
" but it ’ s not only germany .
it is also the frankfurt book fair .
when i am asked by journalists here , whether i don ’ t think that the book is dead , i always tell them to go to frankfurt and see for themselves . "
iman humaidan will have her second novel translated into german just in time for the book fair .
she said she is excited to go .
" i am looking forward to it , " she said .
" i hear everybody around me saying it ’ s going to be a scandal because we have nothing to present .
of course , we have !
the problem is we are not proud of what we have . "
lost images image is another problem .
" they were lost , because they lost their image , " humaidan said .
" the great ideologies have died .
what ’ s left is fundamentalism and the old regimes .
people like us are marginalized .
my first reaction was to ask : how can we access this space between those two sides ? "
she said she thinks the book fair should be different from those events " when the west thinks of dialogue with the arab world as a dialogue with fundamentalists .
i have the same problems with fundamentalists as you have . " hannah wettig , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all .

but researchers at the renowned allensbach opinion research institute have published a study which reaches very different conclusions . to rita barwitzki , a 26-year-old from leipzig , the fall of the berlin wall almost 15 years ago could n't have come at a better time . " i had to shed part of my identity , " she explained , " but i could n't wait to discover new things . " " i did n't want to get stuck in the old ways - after all a new system had arrived that gave me more freedom and independence . " rita believes she benefited from having lived both behind the iron curtain and in reunited germany .
she has childhood memories of life under honecker , but it was the west that shaped her life as a teenager . her self-confidence is typical of the under-30s in eastern germany , who are more enterprising than the older generation , and many of their contemporaries in the west . empty prejudice when the ifd-allensbach questioned a sample of 2000 eastern germans , it was the young people who made the best impression . " we 'd always heard that the younger east germans felt they had no future , that they were lacking in motivation , " explained project manager thomas petersen .
" there were no opportunities , and the more capable ones left for the west - those are some of the clichés . " they proved to be empty prejudices .
" there 's a new generation emerging in our statistics that 's quite different , " observed petersen .
" they do n't just sit around feeling sorry for themselves , they take the initiative and they 're brimming with optimism . " shaping their own destiny 52 percent of young eastern germans say they are in control of their lives , while only a third of older eastern germans can match their self-belief .
in western germany , 45 percent believe that destiny is something you shape yourself , regardless of external circumstances . how do the researchers explain this ?
with the east german dictatorship an increasingly distant memory , a new generation has grown up that does not share the values of its parents .
a similar phenomenon was observed in post-war west germany and in the early 1990s in spain , 15 years after the death of franco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1973 , east berlin hosted the 10th world youth games .
" this younger generation hardly knew east germany , pointed out thomas petersen .
" they grew up in freedom and have been exposed to a world quite different to that in which their parents lived . " " there were differences in language , how one behaves in public and in private , what one can say , what one ca n't say , even how one keeps an eye on the neighbours .
these things were very different in a dictatorship . " the advantages of adversity thomas petersen also points out that eastern germans growing up in cities and towns with a 20 percent unemployment rate have experienced hardship from an early age . almost everybody in eastern germany knows someone who has lost their job and who 's suffering from financial or psychological problems . it 's a different story in western germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 bringing the tropics to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the park will be housed in the world 's largest freestanding dome long famous for its tasty cucumbers , the spreewald region just south of berlin is about to become well-known for rather more exotic flora : asian investors are converting a zeppelin hangar into a tropical rainforest . the denizens of brand , a small community 60 kilometers outside of the german capital berlin , probably think they 've seen it all .
during the cold war their tiny village bordered one of the soviet union 's largest foreign airbases .
then came cargolifter , a company hoping to build commercial heavy-lift zeppelins on the 500 hectare base after the russians left .
that project failed in 2002 , but it left behind a colossal 107-meter high airship hangar subsidized by taxpayers .
until recently , the most exciting thing to do in the area was to take a canoe ride and enjoy some of the spreewald 's popular cucumbers .
but colin au , a singapore-based malaysian multi-millionaire , is aiming to change all that .
this december , au and his partners at the malaysian conglomerate tanjong plc will open a € 70-million -lrb- $ 86.8-million -rrb- tropical rainforest theme park on the former cargolifter grounds .
" this concept could work anywhere it is cold , but germans really love the sun , " au told dw-world , as he pointed out where the hangar 's unfinished concrete floor will be transformed into white sandy beaches and heated lagoons .
thousands of plants when complete , the 360-meter long silver structure will be refashioned into a unique venue for thousands of tropical plants and cruise ship-like entertainment .
the park , known as tropical islands , will not only be home to orchids and palm trees ; it will also have several types of " villages " from tropical cultures , including borneo , congo and the amazon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer simulation of the tropical island beach .
in the depths of winter , the air temperature in the park will be a balmy 25 degrees celsius and the water in the pools an even warmer 30 degrees .
a special foil on the south side of the dome - the world 's largest freestanding construction of its kind - will let in almost 100 percent of the sun 's rays .
" if people do n't use sunscreen in the summer they 'll definitely get sunburn , " said tropical islands spokeswoman vivian kreft .
if successful , the resort in brand will become the flagship of a chain of similar parks around the world .
but none would be built on such a mammoth scale as the dome in germany .
au and tanjong were able to snap it up for a measly € 17.5 million - a fraction of what it cost cargolifter - during insolvency proceedings last year .
enough visitors ?
despite the proclivity of germans to flee their own inclement weather , it 's still uncertain if the park can really attract over two million visitors a year as planned .
only last week , the space center , a comic-themed amusement park in the northern city of bremen , closed its doors after opening earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first trees arrive .
but au dismissed worries that tropical islands could run into similar trouble .
" our concept is really much closer to a resort than an amusement park , " he said .
" it really should be attractive to a broad range of people . "
the project certainly was attractive to the government of the depressed eastern german state of brandenburg , which was relieved to find investors with a viable concept for the cargolifter hall .
with unemployment in brandenburg near 20 percent , the park will create 500 desperately needed new jobs for the region .
it 's the poor economy , though , that could present the biggest risk to the project , since down-on-their-luck germans have become notoriously stingy in recent years .
the amount of disposable income of many eastern germans will be further cut next year when unpopular reforms reduce the benefits of long-term unemployed to the level of welfare payments .
original concept is key harmut mertens , an economist at bankgesellschaft berlin , admitted the region is going through some tough times , but he remained optimistic tropical islands could be a success .
" they seem to have a pretty original concept there , " mertens told dw-world .
" the problem with the space center in bremen was that they put a lot of emphasis on shopping .
that 's not the case with the tropics park . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cargolifter building the dome .
the locals from brand , however , are more cautious after seeing both the soviets and the zeppelin makers come and go .
" i 'm a little skeptical , " said carola seidenfeudel , who runs a snack shop not far from the dome .
she said her family sold drinks and food to cargolifter employees for years before the company went bankrupt .
only after construction started for tropical island this spring did they return to their familiar corner next to brand 's tiny railway station .
" it 'll be great if it works , but we 've been burned before , " she said . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cargolifter goes way of hindenburg once a boutique project of nascent eastern german entrepreneurialism , airship developer cargolifter declares insolvency .

then came cargolifter , a company hoping to build commercial heavy-lift zeppelins on the 500 hectare base after the russians left .
that project failed in 2002 , but it left behind a colossal 107-meter high airship hangar subsidized by taxpayers .
until recently , the most exciting thing to do in the area was to take a canoe ride and enjoy some of the spreewald 's popular cucumbers .
but colin au , a singapore-based malaysian multi-millionaire , is aiming to change all that .
this december , au and his partners at the malaysian conglomerate tanjong plc will open a € 70-million -lrb- $ 86.8-million -rrb- tropical rainforest theme park on the former cargolifter grounds .
" this concept could work anywhere it is cold , but germans really love the sun , " au told dw-world , as he pointed out where the hangar 's unfinished concrete floor will be transformed into white sandy beaches and heated lagoons .
thousands of plants when complete , the 360-meter long silver structure will be refashioned into a unique venue for thousands of tropical plants and cruise ship-like entertainment .
the park , known as tropical islands , will not only be home to orchids and palm trees ; it will also have several types of " villages " from tropical cultures , including borneo , congo and the amazon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer simulation of the tropical island beach .
in the depths of winter , the air temperature in the park will be a balmy 25 degrees celsius and the water in the pools an even warmer 30 degrees .
a special foil on the south side of the dome - the world 's largest freestanding construction of its kind - will let in almost 100 percent of the sun 's rays .
" if people do n't use sunscreen in the summer they 'll definitely get sunburn , " said tropical islands spokeswoman vivian kreft .
if successful , the resort in brand will become the flagship of a chain of similar parks around the world .
but none would be built on such a mammoth scale as the dome in germany .
au and tanjong were able to snap it up for a measly € 17.5 million - a fraction of what it cost cargolifter - during insolvency proceedings last year .
enough visitors ?
despite the proclivity of germans to flee their own inclement weather , it 's still uncertain if the park can really attract over two million visitors a year as planned .
only last week , the space center , a comic-themed amusement park in the northern city of bremen , closed its doors after opening earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first trees arrive .
but au dismissed worries that tropical islands could run into similar trouble .
" our concept is really much closer to a resort than an amusement park , " he said .
" it really should be attractive to a broad range of people . "
the project certainly was attractive to the government of the depressed eastern german state of brandenburg , which was relieved to find investors with a viable concept for the cargolifter hall .
with unemployment in brandenburg near 20 percent , the park will create 500 desperately needed new jobs for the region .
it 's the poor economy , though , that could present the biggest risk to the project , since down-on-their-luck germans have become notoriously stingy in recent years .
the amount of disposable income of many eastern germans will be further cut next year when unpopular reforms reduce the benefits of long-term unemployed to the level of welfare payments .
original concept is key harmut mertens , an economist at bankgesellschaft berlin , admitted the region is going through some tough times , but he remained optimistic tropical islands could be a success .
" they seem to have a pretty original concept there , " mertens told dw-world .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cargolifter building the dome .
the locals from brand , however , are more cautious after seeing both the soviets and the zeppelin makers come and go .
" i 'm a little skeptical , " said carola seidenfeudel , who runs a snack shop not far from the dome .
she said her family sold drinks and food to cargolifter employees for years before the company went bankrupt .

" your strategic decision you have to make - to change the situation in the whole region , including iraq , for the better .
and for the europeans it will be turkey , " fischer told guests at the american academy in berlin last week . berlin pledges to back ankara schröder 's government has moved beyond giving lip service to the notion of turkey 's eu candidacy , as was the case under the conservative government of helmut kohl , to making it one of the pillars of german foreign policy .
it threw its weight in earnest behind ankara 's bid at the eu 's summit in copenhagen in late 2002 , which was focused on enlargement . with france in tow , the government in berlin initiated the proposal that will in december see eu leaders decide on turkey 's future based on a european commission report this week about its progress toward democratic reforms . " if the european commission recommends opening accession talks , then germany will clearly support that , " schröder said sunday before presenting prime minister recep tayyip erdogan an award for his reform work so far . opposition calls for ' special relationship ' the german opposition has , meanwhile , raised the issue of human rights abuses and says turkey does not share the same " values " , ostensibly cultural and religious , as the union . " from a geographical point of view , i think that europe has to have borders so that its integrity is not endangered , " edmund stoiber , the former conservative candidate for chancellor , told afp last week . " this does n't rule out having ties through a partnership , " he added . economic opportunities for the german business community , turkey 's membership will bring economic opportunities to its biggest trading partner and , in the words of wholesale and foreign trade federation head anton boerner , a " growth and profit spiral " . about 30 percent of turkey 's trade with the eu is with germany .
however , for the conservatives , acutely aware of the massive cost of german reunification , the price is too high .
the brussels think-tank " friends of europe " has estimated that turkey 's integration will cost some 15 billion euros annually over three years .
germany would pay the most : 2.4 billion euros a year . " while integration would be good for turkey , it would be unmanageable for europe , in particular from a financial point of view because the costs of such an integration would be too high , " stoiber said . strengthening turkey 's ties to the west however heinz kramer , an expert on turkish affairs at the swp institute , told afp that a firm date for accession talks could be good all round . " a prospect of membership will help the turkish government consolidate its reform programme and will send a signal to the financial and economic markets that turkey is more strongly linked to the west , " he said . that aside , public opinion is not in ankara 's favour .
a recent survey found that 35 percent of people support turkey joining the bloc , while 57 are against . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish eu membership to cost up to € 28 billion per year reported on in several german newspapers , the study says that ankara 's joining the 25-nation union would be a " challenge with great opportunities for both sides . "

during the cold war their tiny village bordered one of the soviet union 's largest foreign airbases .
then came cargolifter , a company hoping to build commercial heavy-lift zeppelins on the 500 hectare base after the russians left .
that project failed in 2002 , but it left behind a colossal 107-meter high airship hangar subsidized by taxpayers .
until recently , the most exciting thing to do in the area was to take a canoe ride and enjoy some of the spreewald 's popular cucumbers .
but colin au , a singapore-based malaysian multi-millionaire , is aiming to change all that .
this december , au and his partners at the malaysian conglomerate tanjong plc will open a € 70-million -lrb- $ 86.8-million -rrb- tropical rainforest theme park on the former cargolifter grounds .
" this concept could work anywhere it is cold , but germans really love the sun , " au told dw-world , as he pointed out where the hangar 's unfinished concrete floor will be transformed into white sandy beaches and heated lagoons .
thousands of plants when complete , the 360-meter long silver structure will be refashioned into a unique venue for thousands of tropical plants and cruise ship-like entertainment .
the park , known as tropical islands , will not only be home to orchids and palm trees ; it will also have several types of " villages " from tropical cultures , including borneo , congo and the amazon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer simulation of the tropical island beach .

a special foil on the south side of the dome - the world 's largest freestanding construction of its kind - will let in almost 100 percent of the sun 's rays .
" if people do n't use sunscreen in the summer they 'll definitely get sunburn , " said tropical islands spokeswoman vivian kreft .
if successful , the resort in brand will become the flagship of a chain of similar parks around the world .

au and tanjong were able to snap it up for a measly € 17.5 million - a fraction of what it cost cargolifter - during insolvency proceedings last year .
enough visitors ?
despite the proclivity of germans to flee their own inclement weather , it 's still uncertain if the park can really attract over two million visitors a year as planned .
only last week , the space center , a comic-themed amusement park in the northern city of bremen , closed its doors after opening earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first trees arrive .
but au dismissed worries that tropical islands could run into similar trouble .
" our concept is really much closer to a resort than an amusement park , " he said .
" it really should be attractive to a broad range of people . "
the project certainly was attractive to the government of the depressed eastern german state of brandenburg , which was relieved to find investors with a viable concept for the cargolifter hall .
with unemployment in brandenburg near 20 percent , the park will create 500 desperately needed new jobs for the region .
it 's the poor economy , though , that could present the biggest risk to the project , since down-on-their-luck germans have become notoriously stingy in recent years .
the amount of disposable income of many eastern germans will be further cut next year when unpopular reforms reduce the benefits of long-term unemployed to the level of welfare payments .
original concept is key harmut mertens , an economist at bankgesellschaft berlin , admitted the region is going through some tough times , but he remained optimistic tropical islands could be a success .

the project certainly was attractive to the government of the depressed eastern german state of brandenburg , which was relieved to find investors with a viable concept for the cargolifter hall .
with unemployment in brandenburg near 20 percent , the park will create 500 desperately needed new jobs for the region .
it 's the poor economy , though , that could present the biggest risk to the project , since down-on-their-luck germans have become notoriously stingy in recent years .
the amount of disposable income of many eastern germans will be further cut next year when unpopular reforms reduce the benefits of long-term unemployed to the level of welfare payments .

during the cold war their tiny village bordered one of the soviet union 's largest foreign airbases .
then came cargolifter , a company hoping to build commercial heavy-lift zeppelins on the 500 hectare base after the russians left .
that project failed in 2002 , but it left behind a colossal 107-meter high airship hangar subsidized by taxpayers .
until recently , the most exciting thing to do in the area was to take a canoe ride and enjoy some of the spreewald 's popular cucumbers .
but colin au , a singapore-based malaysian multi-millionaire , is aiming to change all that .
this december , au and his partners at the malaysian conglomerate tanjong plc will open a € 70-million -lrb- $ 86.8-million -rrb- tropical rainforest theme park on the former cargolifter grounds .
" this concept could work anywhere it is cold , but germans really love the sun , " au told dw-world , as he pointed out where the hangar 's unfinished concrete floor will be transformed into white sandy beaches and heated lagoons .
thousands of plants when complete , the 360-meter long silver structure will be refashioned into a unique venue for thousands of tropical plants and cruise ship-like entertainment .
the park , known as tropical islands , will not only be home to orchids and palm trees ; it will also have several types of " villages " from tropical cultures , including borneo , congo and the amazon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer simulation of the tropical island beach .
in the depths of winter , the air temperature in the park will be a balmy 25 degrees celsius and the water in the pools an even warmer 30 degrees .
a special foil on the south side of the dome - the world 's largest freestanding construction of its kind - will let in almost 100 percent of the sun 's rays .
" if people do n't use sunscreen in the summer they 'll definitely get sunburn , " said tropical islands spokeswoman vivian kreft .
if successful , the resort in brand will become the flagship of a chain of similar parks around the world .
but none would be built on such a mammoth scale as the dome in germany .
au and tanjong were able to snap it up for a measly € 17.5 million - a fraction of what it cost cargolifter - during insolvency proceedings last year .
enough visitors ?
despite the proclivity of germans to flee their own inclement weather , it 's still uncertain if the park can really attract over two million visitors a year as planned .

but researchers at the renowned allensbach opinion research institute have published a study which reaches very different conclusions . to rita barwitzki , a 26-year-old from leipzig , the fall of the berlin wall almost 15 years ago could n't have come at a better time . " i had to shed part of my identity , " she explained , " but i could n't wait to discover new things . " " i did n't want to get stuck in the old ways - after all a new system had arrived that gave me more freedom and independence . " rita believes she benefited from having lived both behind the iron curtain and in reunited germany .
she has childhood memories of life under honecker , but it was the west that shaped her life as a teenager . her self-confidence is typical of the under-30s in eastern germany , who are more enterprising than the older generation , and many of their contemporaries in the west . empty prejudice when the ifd-allensbach questioned a sample of 2000 eastern germans , it was the young people who made the best impression . " we 'd always heard that the younger east germans felt they had no future , that they were lacking in motivation , " explained project manager thomas petersen .

in western germany , 45 percent believe that destiny is something you shape yourself , regardless of external circumstances . how do the researchers explain this ?
with the east german dictatorship an increasingly distant memory , a new generation has grown up that does not share the values of its parents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far bremen wins opener delayed by blackout leverkusen go top as champions slip up champions extend winning streak all change in bundesliga title race sports -pipe- 04.10.2004 bayern beats bremen , leverkusen ends winless streak großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanking the bayern gods bayern munich underlined their determination to wrestle the german crown back from werder bremen with a 2-1 victory over the champions at the weserstadion on saturday . bayern had not won in bremen since december 1999 but broke that hoodoo with german internationals michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger on target .
it was sweet revenge for bayern who surrendered their german title to bremen with a 3-1 loss at the olympic stadium last season .
bayern are starting to click into gear , building on their 4-0 champions league demolition of ajax in midweek , and leapfrogged bremen into third with the three points .
" we are up near the top of the table and back on the straight and narrow , " said bayern coach felix magath .
" we were fortunate to win but i think overall we deserved the three points . "
surprise package vfl wolfsburg still set the pace at the top following a 2-1 win over borussia monchengladbach .
vfb stuttgart are second one point behind wolfsburg after defeating arminia bielefeld 2-0 on sunday .
matthias sammer has yet to taste defeat in his ten games as stuttgart manager and his club are the only unbeaten team in the top-flight .
german international sebastian deisler was back in the bayern starting eleven after being ' rested ' for the past few matches and his corner was pivotal for the first goal .
in the 20th minute ballack rose highest to head home his fourth goal of the season from the corner kick .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sometimes makaay is so well marked it creates space for ballack , " explained magath .
" it is good to have two people who are so clinical in front of goal . "
croatian international ivan klasnic should have equalised for bremen on the half hour mark but somehow headed wide with the goal at his mercy .
" in the first half we lacked the bite that we demonstrated against valencia , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we could not convert our chances either . "
greece 's euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas , who scored the winner against valencia in midweek , replaced klasnic at the interval as coach schaaf revamped his front line . hosts bremen asserted more pressure but it was in vain as substitute schweinsteiger staked a claim for a place in the first team curling home a 75th minute shot that caught goalkeeper andreas reinke off guard .
the second goal proved important as miroslav klose reduced the deficit with a header in the 81st minute , his fourth goal in his last two bundesliga outings , but bayern held on .
bremen 's miserable afternoon was capped off when it was confirmed that german international frank fahrenhorst had broken his nose after ballack 's stray elbow forced him to leave the field after seven minutes .
leverkusen ends drought bayer leverkusen ended a five match winless streak with a 3-0 triumph over sv hamburg at the bayarena .
bildunterschrift : " i am delighted with the three points , " said bayer manager klaus augenthaler .
" the win is more significant than the victory against bayern because the team were at a low ebb . "
augenthaler claimed polish international jacek krzynowek should have a licence for his left foot and it was clear what the coach meant .
in the 10th minute krzynowek unleashed a 25 yard shot from his cannon left foot and the ball crashed into the roof of the net .
brazilian international juan -lrb- 73 -rrb- and bulgarian international dimitar berbatov -lrb- 86 -rrb- struck late on for leverkusen spoiling the return of hamburg chief klaus toppmoller , who guided bayer to the champions league final in 2002 .
borussia dortmund fans still pine for their first home win in the bundesliga following a 2-2 draw with fc nuremberg .
nuremberg scored twice in the 23rd and 25th minute to shock the 75,000 fans , but czech international jan koller salvaged a point with a brace -lrb- 28 , 45 -rrb- in a busy first half at the westfalen stadium .
in a league encounter on sunday , manager ralf rangnick enjoyed his first bundesliga match in charge of schalke 04 with a 3-2 triumph over local rivals vfl bochum .
schalke climbed an incredible nine places with the victory and are now in seventh after being in the relegation zone before the match .
a first half goal blitz did the damage with german international gerald asamoah -lrb- 10 -rrb- , levan kobiaschvili -lrb- 13 -rrb- and brazilian lincoln -lrb- 44 -rrb- all on target .
bochum pulled two goals back in a see-saw second half but could not find an equaliser against ten-man schalke who had goalscorer lincoln dismissed in the 80th minute for wasting time . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern turns up heat with win in bremen it was n't pretty but bayern munich claimed a victory over arch rivals werder bremen on saturday , moving up to third in the league with a 2-1 win .

it was sweet revenge for bayern who surrendered their german title to bremen with a 3-1 loss at the olympic stadium last season .
bayern are starting to click into gear , building on their 4-0 champions league demolition of ajax in midweek , and leapfrogged bremen into third with the three points .
" we are up near the top of the table and back on the straight and narrow , " said bayern coach felix magath .
" we were fortunate to win but i think overall we deserved the three points . "
surprise package vfl wolfsburg still set the pace at the top following a 2-1 win over borussia monchengladbach .
vfb stuttgart are second one point behind wolfsburg after defeating arminia bielefeld 2-0 on sunday .
matthias sammer has yet to taste defeat in his ten games as stuttgart manager and his club are the only unbeaten team in the top-flight .
german international sebastian deisler was back in the bayern starting eleven after being ' rested ' for the past few matches and his corner was pivotal for the first goal .
in the 20th minute ballack rose highest to head home his fourth goal of the season from the corner kick .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sometimes makaay is so well marked it creates space for ballack , " explained magath .
" it is good to have two people who are so clinical in front of goal . "
croatian international ivan klasnic should have equalised for bremen on the half hour mark but somehow headed wide with the goal at his mercy .
" in the first half we lacked the bite that we demonstrated against valencia , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we could not convert our chances either . "
greece 's euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas , who scored the winner against valencia in midweek , replaced klasnic at the interval as coach schaaf revamped his front line . hosts bremen asserted more pressure but it was in vain as substitute schweinsteiger staked a claim for a place in the first team curling home a 75th minute shot that caught goalkeeper andreas reinke off guard .
the second goal proved important as miroslav klose reduced the deficit with a header in the 81st minute , his fourth goal in his last two bundesliga outings , but bayern held on .
bremen 's miserable afternoon was capped off when it was confirmed that german international frank fahrenhorst had broken his nose after ballack 's stray elbow forced him to leave the field after seven minutes .
leverkusen ends drought bayer leverkusen ended a five match winless streak with a 3-0 triumph over sv hamburg at the bayarena .
bildunterschrift : " i am delighted with the three points , " said bayer manager klaus augenthaler .
" the win is more significant than the victory against bayern because the team were at a low ebb . "
augenthaler claimed polish international jacek krzynowek should have a licence for his left foot and it was clear what the coach meant .
in the 10th minute krzynowek unleashed a 25 yard shot from his cannon left foot and the ball crashed into the roof of the net .
brazilian international juan -lrb- 73 -rrb- and bulgarian international dimitar berbatov -lrb- 86 -rrb- struck late on for leverkusen spoiling the return of hamburg chief klaus toppmoller , who guided bayer to the champions league final in 2002 .
borussia dortmund fans still pine for their first home win in the bundesliga following a 2-2 draw with fc nuremberg .
nuremberg scored twice in the 23rd and 25th minute to shock the 75,000 fans , but czech international jan koller salvaged a point with a brace -lrb- 28 , 45 -rrb- in a busy first half at the westfalen stadium .
in a league encounter on sunday , manager ralf rangnick enjoyed his first bundesliga match in charge of schalke 04 with a 3-2 triumph over local rivals vfl bochum .
schalke climbed an incredible nine places with the victory and are now in seventh after being in the relegation zone before the match .
a first half goal blitz did the damage with german international gerald asamoah -lrb- 10 -rrb- , levan kobiaschvili -lrb- 13 -rrb- and brazilian lincoln -lrb- 44 -rrb- all on target .
bochum pulled two goals back in a see-saw second half but could not find an equaliser against ten-man schalke who had goalscorer lincoln dismissed in the 80th minute for wasting time . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern turns up heat with win in bremen it was n't pretty but bayern munich claimed a victory over arch rivals werder bremen on saturday , moving up to third in the league with a 2-1 win .

" we are up near the top of the table and back on the straight and narrow , " said bayern coach felix magath .
" we were fortunate to win but i think overall we deserved the three points . "
surprise package vfl wolfsburg still set the pace at the top following a 2-1 win over borussia monchengladbach .
vfb stuttgart are second one point behind wolfsburg after defeating arminia bielefeld 2-0 on sunday .
matthias sammer has yet to taste defeat in his ten games as stuttgart manager and his club are the only unbeaten team in the top-flight .
german international sebastian deisler was back in the bayern starting eleven after being ' rested ' for the past few matches and his corner was pivotal for the first goal .
in the 20th minute ballack rose highest to head home his fourth goal of the season from the corner kick .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sometimes makaay is so well marked it creates space for ballack , " explained magath .
" it is good to have two people who are so clinical in front of goal . "
croatian international ivan klasnic should have equalised for bremen on the half hour mark but somehow headed wide with the goal at his mercy .
" in the first half we lacked the bite that we demonstrated against valencia , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we could not convert our chances either . "
greece 's euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas , who scored the winner against valencia in midweek , replaced klasnic at the interval as coach schaaf revamped his front line . hosts bremen asserted more pressure but it was in vain as substitute schweinsteiger staked a claim for a place in the first team curling home a 75th minute shot that caught goalkeeper andreas reinke off guard .
the second goal proved important as miroslav klose reduced the deficit with a header in the 81st minute , his fourth goal in his last two bundesliga outings , but bayern held on .
bremen 's miserable afternoon was capped off when it was confirmed that german international frank fahrenhorst had broken his nose after ballack 's stray elbow forced him to leave the field after seven minutes .
leverkusen ends drought bayer leverkusen ended a five match winless streak with a 3-0 triumph over sv hamburg at the bayarena .
bildunterschrift : " i am delighted with the three points , " said bayer manager klaus augenthaler .
" the win is more significant than the victory against bayern because the team were at a low ebb . "
augenthaler claimed polish international jacek krzynowek should have a licence for his left foot and it was clear what the coach meant .
in the 10th minute krzynowek unleashed a 25 yard shot from his cannon left foot and the ball crashed into the roof of the net .
brazilian international juan -lrb- 73 -rrb- and bulgarian international dimitar berbatov -lrb- 86 -rrb- struck late on for leverkusen spoiling the return of hamburg chief klaus toppmoller , who guided bayer to the champions league final in 2002 .
borussia dortmund fans still pine for their first home win in the bundesliga following a 2-2 draw with fc nuremberg .
nuremberg scored twice in the 23rd and 25th minute to shock the 75,000 fans , but czech international jan koller salvaged a point with a brace -lrb- 28 , 45 -rrb- in a busy first half at the westfalen stadium .
in a league encounter on sunday , manager ralf rangnick enjoyed his first bundesliga match in charge of schalke 04 with a 3-2 triumph over local rivals vfl bochum .
schalke climbed an incredible nine places with the victory and are now in seventh after being in the relegation zone before the match .
a first half goal blitz did the damage with german international gerald asamoah -lrb- 10 -rrb- , levan kobiaschvili -lrb- 13 -rrb- and brazilian lincoln -lrb- 44 -rrb- all on target .
bochum pulled two goals back in a see-saw second half but could not find an equaliser against ten-man schalke who had goalscorer lincoln dismissed in the 80th minute for wasting time . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern turns up heat with win in bremen it was n't pretty but bayern munich claimed a victory over arch rivals werder bremen on saturday , moving up to third in the league with a 2-1 win .

" the -lrb- german -rrb- government will not support the individual demands for compensation in connection with the second world war in national or international courts , " schröder told the czech newspaper hospodarske noviny monday , referring to similar claims by germans who were expelled from poland after 1945 . " that naturally also applies to the czech republic , " schröder said in an interview . during his visit schröder also met with the czech republic 's new prime minister stanislav gross . dozens of sudeten germans are seeking to take their case for compensation to the european court of human rights in strasbourg . polish-german legal defense council their initiative mirrors the campaign to win damages being mounted by some germans expelled from territories in eastern germany that became polish after 1945 .

" we do not want to burden our relationship with political and legal questions dating from the past , we want to point them to the future . " schröder said the sudeten germans ' claims were " devoid of any legal basis . " in 1997 , after months of difficult negotiations , germany and the czech republic signed a joint declaration mutually recognizing past mistakes and undertaking to open a new chapter in their relationship . afp / dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-czech school aims to build bridges in 1998 , a secondary school near the czech-german border embarked on a project to educate german and czech students together in order to increase understanding between the countries .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the unknown guest of honor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2004 frankfurt book fair 2004 focuses on the arab world in beirut 's cultural scene nobody seems to know about the book fair in frankfurt .
lebanese authors are worried , but also get their hopes up . beirut ’ s young cultural scene is thriving : during the last year , tens of galleries have opened in the rebuild saifi village close to the city center , new cafes and jazz bars popped up in the gentrified areas of east beirut , where djs play the newest sound from europe and young musicians rap in the lebanese dialect .
at an abandoned train station , some musicians were recently organizing a techno party .
on this rave , ronja was handing out flyers inviting to a poetry slam at a private culture center .
" book fair in frankfurt ?
never heard of it , " she said .
she grew up in sweden and can ’ t read arabic well .
thus , she doesn ’ t follow the arab press .
rawan and sara go often to such events but haven ’ t heard about the book fair .
sara said those things don ’ t interest her .
" i work and work and hardly make $ 250 -lrb- € 200 -rrb- , " she said .

mamlaka as-sarasir -lrb- cachroche kingdom -rrb- came out three years ago .
the 31-year-old said he had heard about a large book fair taking place every year in frankfurt , but not about the arab world being the guest of honor .
" we are not in a luxury period here , " he says , " so people in general are not interested in culture . "
he hopes that such an event will not be turned into a political stage .
" it should just be for the intellectual aspect , " he said .
" we can ’ t solve our problems this way .
you can ’ t cover a hole in the table with a table cloth .
if the arab world wants to carry a message , i ask what message could that be ? "
but bashar haidar , a philosophy professor who was having a drink at a bistro with a colleague , said he had heard great things about the frankfurt book fair , but nothing about this year ’ s focus .
" that sounds fantastic , " he said .
" we should book tickets and go , " he told his colleague .
mixed feelings the lebanese authors who are invited to the fair were not quite as enthusiastic .
" since early 2004 , everything i read was criticism , " says emily nasrallah , who has had three novels and one children 's book translated into german .
" i haven ’ t read anything positive .
there was this delay , which also delayed the translation of books before the book fair .

she said she hoped this could be a push for arab literature .
" i am also very happy that it is happening in germany , because from my experience i feel they respect us very much , " she said .
" but it ’ s not only germany .
it is also the frankfurt book fair .
when i am asked by journalists here , whether i don ’ t think that the book is dead , i always tell them to go to frankfurt and see for themselves . "
iman humaidan will have her second novel translated into german just in time for the book fair .
she said she is excited to go .
" i am looking forward to it , " she said .
" i hear everybody around me saying it ’ s going to be a scandal because we have nothing to present .

" the great ideologies have died .
what ’ s left is fundamentalism and the old regimes .
people like us are marginalized .
my first reaction was to ask : how can we access this space between those two sides ? "

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the unknown guest of honor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2004 frankfurt book fair 2004 focuses on the arab world in beirut 's cultural scene nobody seems to know about the book fair in frankfurt .
lebanese authors are worried , but also get their hopes up . beirut ’ s young cultural scene is thriving : during the last year , tens of galleries have opened in the rebuild saifi village close to the city center , new cafes and jazz bars popped up in the gentrified areas of east beirut , where djs play the newest sound from europe and young musicians rap in the lebanese dialect .

the move could reflect some poles ' increasing dissatisfaction with american policies . in the run-up to the us-led invasion of iraq , poland was one of america 's staunchest supporters .
all of poland 's major political parties supported the war and 2,500 troops were sent to help with the war effort .
those soldiers now lead an 8,000 strong multinational force , which controls south-central iraq .
but poland 's defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski was quoted in monday 's issue of the polish daily gazeta wyborcza as saying that poland would significantly reduce its commitment to the region .
according to the report , poland will reduce its forces in iraq by 40 percent - from 2,500 to 1,500 - by the end of 2005 .
government under pressure the deadline to pull out troops will coincide with the expiration of the united nations security council resolution 1546 at the end of 2005 , which authorized the upcoming elections .
" that does not mean , however , that if a stabilization mission was continued , polish troops would be completely pulled out from iraq , " said szmajdzinkski .
" a group of officers at the headquarters , training centers , maybe a group of observers could still remain . "
the decision to reduce poland 's deployment in iraq came at the request of the current left-wing government 's junior coalition party , the labor union -lrb- up -rrb- .
polish prime minister marek belka 's government faces a parliamentary vote of confidence later this month , and general parliamentary elections are due to be held in mid-2005 .
both will take place amid a growing backdrop of disenchantment with american foreign policy .
america 's image tarnished poland has long been one of the united states ' staunchest supporters .
largely due to the legacy of communism , even the liberals among poland 's political elite shared us policy-makers ' view that tyranny should be met with force .
but as the situation in iraq degenerated over the past year , poles - both the media and the average citizen alike - have started to question the price poland pays for its unwavering support for its unwavering support of the united states .
indeed , 17 poles have died in iraq , but the political costs have also been high .
by allying itself with the us in the hopes of becoming a leader of so-called " new europe , " poland entered the eu on may 1st of this year at odds with germany and france .
and poles are questioning whether the current us administration truly intends to make good on its promise to deliver a credible democracy in iraq , the basis upon which they supported the invasion .
what 's more , the united states has not delivered many of the rewards promised to poland in exchange for its support , including lucrative reconstruction contracts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kwasniewski , pictured with us president bush , is getting tough with washington .
all of the above has led to a growing backlash .
earlier this month , even poland 's president aleksander kwasniewski offered his own voice to the growing chorus of dissent .
he told the new york times that the united states needed to become " more flexible , more gracious , " and that the bush administration should abandon its " neoconservative divide-and-rule policy . "
in june , spain withdrew its 1,300 troops after the socialists replaced the conservative government of jose maria aznar in national elections .

the move could reflect some poles ' increasing dissatisfaction with american policies . in the run-up to the us-led invasion of iraq , poland was one of america 's staunchest supporters .
all of poland 's major political parties supported the war and 2,500 troops were sent to help with the war effort .
those soldiers now lead an 8,000 strong multinational force , which controls south-central iraq .
but poland 's defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski was quoted in monday 's issue of the polish daily gazeta wyborcza as saying that poland would significantly reduce its commitment to the region .
according to the report , poland will reduce its forces in iraq by 40 percent - from 2,500 to 1,500 - by the end of 2005 .
government under pressure the deadline to pull out troops will coincide with the expiration of the united nations security council resolution 1546 at the end of 2005 , which authorized the upcoming elections .
" that does not mean , however , that if a stabilization mission was continued , polish troops would be completely pulled out from iraq , " said szmajdzinkski .
" a group of officers at the headquarters , training centers , maybe a group of observers could still remain . "
the decision to reduce poland 's deployment in iraq came at the request of the current left-wing government 's junior coalition party , the labor union -lrb- up -rrb- .
polish prime minister marek belka 's government faces a parliamentary vote of confidence later this month , and general parliamentary elections are due to be held in mid-2005 .
both will take place amid a growing backdrop of disenchantment with american foreign policy .
america 's image tarnished poland has long been one of the united states ' staunchest supporters .
largely due to the legacy of communism , even the liberals among poland 's political elite shared us policy-makers ' view that tyranny should be met with force .
but as the situation in iraq degenerated over the past year , poles - both the media and the average citizen alike - have started to question the price poland pays for its unwavering support for its unwavering support of the united states .
indeed , 17 poles have died in iraq , but the political costs have also been high .
by allying itself with the us in the hopes of becoming a leader of so-called " new europe , " poland entered the eu on may 1st of this year at odds with germany and france .
and poles are questioning whether the current us administration truly intends to make good on its promise to deliver a credible democracy in iraq , the basis upon which they supported the invasion .
what 's more , the united states has not delivered many of the rewards promised to poland in exchange for its support , including lucrative reconstruction contracts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kwasniewski , pictured with us president bush , is getting tough with washington .
all of the above has led to a growing backlash .

he told the new york times that the united states needed to become " more flexible , more gracious , " and that the bush administration should abandon its " neoconservative divide-and-rule policy . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 2004 frankfurt book fair book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent the unknown guest of honor opinion : open , sesame !
frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the healing power of storytelling the new german translation of thousand and one nights -lrb- arabian nights -rrb- makes the oldest arabic version of this famed collection of oriental tales available for german readers for the first time . three hundred years ago , librarian antoine galland translated the story of " sindbad the sailor " for a noble woman .
he then heard of other stories , got his hands on a manuscript from syria and presented european readers with the first volume of " thousand and one nights " in 1704 .
the book 's popularity was like nothing ever seen before : overnight the stories took the west by storm , making hearts that shortly before had quaked in fear of the enemy from the east flutter in rapture for the enchanted orient .
literary triumph today the fabulous narratives even find favor with those more intellectual arabs who once dismissed the folktales as " pathetic prattle ; " only the eternally sanctimonious still take offence at the tales ' provocative sensuality .
galland had managed to uncover one of the world 's great literary treasures .
he translated the tales with a large measure of poetic freedom , in the style of his times , which probably only enhanced the work 's success .
there has since been no lack of alternative translations , including famous editions like that of enno littmann -lrb- 1921-1928 -rrb- .
but these have all been based on more recent manuscripts .
the original 15th-century fragment discovered by galland , which included 282 nights , is not only older , but also told in a particularly lively fashion , since , despite the authors ' efforts to stick to " correct " written arabic , colloquialisms keep breaking through – making for a different , more vernacular tone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of " thousand and one night " moves people from young to old in 1984 this original manuscript was published by muhsin mahdi .
and now , to mark the 300th anniversary of the first publication of the tales , arabic scholar claudia ott has produced a new translation - unlike galland keeping very close to the original text .
freed from the imposed patina of the european fairytale idiom , the " delectable " adventures of kings and beggars , slaves , demons and the " dead drunk " hunchback shine fresher than ever before .
ott effortlessly orchestrates the changes in register between the coarse tone of some of the spoken exchanges and the nicely turned phrases of the rhymed prose .
storytelling as last resort perhaps , more than the individual stories , it is the arrangement of the whole that is the stroke of genius , tying all the tales together : the fact that each story can act as a framework for further stories told within it , with the whole then subsumed under the wondrous tale of sheherazade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : never was the healing power of storytelling presented in a more beautiful way , like it is in the " arabian nights " the drama begins with the trauma of one man : sultan shahryar , a ruler in the island kingdom of india and china , discovers that his beloved wife is cheating on him every time he turns his back with a black slave .
when , on his flight from this horrendous scene , the wife and captive booty of a demon forces him to sleep with her in order to cuckold her hated demon husband , ifrit , he has had more than enough : shahryar decides from then on to kill each of his wives after their first night of lovemaking .
night after night .
in this brutal manner , the battle of the sexes culminates in a series of fatal one-night stands .
enter sheherazade , the daughter of the wazir .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the healing power of storytelling the new german translation of thousand and one nights -lrb- arabian nights -rrb- makes the oldest arabic version of this famed collection of oriental tales available for german readers for the first time . three hundred years ago , librarian antoine galland translated the story of " sindbad the sailor " for a noble woman .
he then heard of other stories , got his hands on a manuscript from syria and presented european readers with the first volume of " thousand and one nights " in 1704 .
the book 's popularity was like nothing ever seen before : overnight the stories took the west by storm , making hearts that shortly before had quaked in fear of the enemy from the east flutter in rapture for the enchanted orient .
literary triumph today the fabulous narratives even find favor with those more intellectual arabs who once dismissed the folktales as " pathetic prattle ; " only the eternally sanctimonious still take offence at the tales ' provocative sensuality .
galland had managed to uncover one of the world 's great literary treasures .
he translated the tales with a large measure of poetic freedom , in the style of his times , which probably only enhanced the work 's success .
there has since been no lack of alternative translations , including famous editions like that of enno littmann -lrb- 1921-1928 -rrb- .
but these have all been based on more recent manuscripts .
the original 15th-century fragment discovered by galland , which included 282 nights , is not only older , but also told in a particularly lively fashion , since , despite the authors ' efforts to stick to " correct " written arabic , colloquialisms keep breaking through – making for a different , more vernacular tone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of " thousand and one night " moves people from young to old in 1984 this original manuscript was published by muhsin mahdi .
and now , to mark the 300th anniversary of the first publication of the tales , arabic scholar claudia ott has produced a new translation - unlike galland keeping very close to the original text .
freed from the imposed patina of the european fairytale idiom , the " delectable " adventures of kings and beggars , slaves , demons and the " dead drunk " hunchback shine fresher than ever before .
ott effortlessly orchestrates the changes in register between the coarse tone of some of the spoken exchanges and the nicely turned phrases of the rhymed prose .
storytelling as last resort perhaps , more than the individual stories , it is the arrangement of the whole that is the stroke of genius , tying all the tales together : the fact that each story can act as a framework for further stories told within it , with the whole then subsumed under the wondrous tale of sheherazade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : never was the healing power of storytelling presented in a more beautiful way , like it is in the " arabian nights " the drama begins with the trauma of one man : sultan shahryar , a ruler in the island kingdom of india and china , discovers that his beloved wife is cheating on him every time he turns his back with a black slave .
when , on his flight from this horrendous scene , the wife and captive booty of a demon forces him to sleep with her in order to cuckold her hated demon husband , ifrit , he has had more than enough : shahryar decides from then on to kill each of his wives after their first night of lovemaking .
night after night .
in this brutal manner , the battle of the sexes culminates in a series of fatal one-night stands .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the healing power of storytelling the new german translation of thousand and one nights -lrb- arabian nights -rrb- makes the oldest arabic version of this famed collection of oriental tales available for german readers for the first time . three hundred years ago , librarian antoine galland translated the story of " sindbad the sailor " for a noble woman .
he then heard of other stories , got his hands on a manuscript from syria and presented european readers with the first volume of " thousand and one nights " in 1704 .
the book 's popularity was like nothing ever seen before : overnight the stories took the west by storm , making hearts that shortly before had quaked in fear of the enemy from the east flutter in rapture for the enchanted orient .
literary triumph today the fabulous narratives even find favor with those more intellectual arabs who once dismissed the folktales as " pathetic prattle ; " only the eternally sanctimonious still take offence at the tales ' provocative sensuality .
galland had managed to uncover one of the world 's great literary treasures .
he translated the tales with a large measure of poetic freedom , in the style of his times , which probably only enhanced the work 's success .
there has since been no lack of alternative translations , including famous editions like that of enno littmann -lrb- 1921-1928 -rrb- .
but these have all been based on more recent manuscripts .
the original 15th-century fragment discovered by galland , which included 282 nights , is not only older , but also told in a particularly lively fashion , since , despite the authors ' efforts to stick to " correct " written arabic , colloquialisms keep breaking through – making for a different , more vernacular tone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of " thousand and one night " moves people from young to old in 1984 this original manuscript was published by muhsin mahdi .
and now , to mark the 300th anniversary of the first publication of the tales , arabic scholar claudia ott has produced a new translation - unlike galland keeping very close to the original text .
freed from the imposed patina of the european fairytale idiom , the " delectable " adventures of kings and beggars , slaves , demons and the " dead drunk " hunchback shine fresher than ever before .
ott effortlessly orchestrates the changes in register between the coarse tone of some of the spoken exchanges and the nicely turned phrases of the rhymed prose .
storytelling as last resort perhaps , more than the individual stories , it is the arrangement of the whole that is the stroke of genius , tying all the tales together : the fact that each story can act as a framework for further stories told within it , with the whole then subsumed under the wondrous tale of sheherazade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : never was the healing power of storytelling presented in a more beautiful way , like it is in the " arabian nights " the drama begins with the trauma of one man : sultan shahryar , a ruler in the island kingdom of india and china , discovers that his beloved wife is cheating on him every time he turns his back with a black slave .
when , on his flight from this horrendous scene , the wife and captive booty of a demon forces him to sleep with her in order to cuckold her hated demon husband , ifrit , he has had more than enough : shahryar decides from then on to kill each of his wives after their first night of lovemaking .
night after night .
in this brutal manner , the battle of the sexes culminates in a series of fatal one-night stands .
enter sheherazade , the daughter of the wazir .
this well-read and educated young woman has a plan : she will tell stories to save herself , the king , and the world .
she proceeds to tell tales just like every tv series does – so enthralling that , each night when the sun goes down , a cliffhanger will make the sultan desperate to hear what happens next -lrb- " and the jinni drew his sword to strike … " -rrb- , postponing her death until the beautiful storyteller is able to bear the sultan a child and thus change his mind about the wiles of womanhood . ludwig ammann , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de connecting the cultural dots dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing .

in berlin , the chancellor presented him with the german " quadriga bridges of respect " award given by the privately-funded werkstatt deutschland for outstanding contributions to european unity . hailing erdogan as " a great reformer , " schröder said the award was " a consequence of his political convictions and also of his painful personal experiences with repression and persecution " - a reference to the four months erdogan spent in jail for breaching turkey 's strict secular rules . accession talks imminent even more exciting for the turkish leader was the news that the eu commission would be recommending the start of accession negotiations with the muslim country .
the report is due to be officially published wednesday , but it has transpired that the commission believes the political criteria are fulfilled and recommends opening membership talks with turkey . however , any euphoria was tempered by eu enlargement commissioner günther verheugen who reiterated his belief that turkish membership was unlikely before 2015 at the earliest . news of the report coincided with political talks in berlin between gerhard schröder and the turkish prime minister .
although both leaders refused to comment on the report , gerhard schröder did n't leave any doubt about his vote at an eu summit in december . " if the criteria will have been met , " he said , " germany will vote in favor of accession talks with turkey at the summit in december .
but let me make sure once again that we are only talking about accession negotiations and nothing else . " " implementation is decisive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan said he hoped turkish membership in the eu would mean a reconciliation of civilizations .
he once again insisted that he would only go for full eu membership and not make do with the " special relationship " proposed recently by germany 's conservative opposition leader angela merkel . he also claimed that torture in his country was a thing of the past , while admitting that implementing the set of reforms adopted recently was indeed a challenging task . " changing laws doesn ’ t resolve any problem " he pointed out .
" implementation is the decisive part and also the most daunting because it means shifting mentalities .
but my government is determined and possesses the political will to carry through the implementation of the reforms to the end . " the erdogan government has passed sweeping reforms to meet eu membership conditions - among them the abolition of the death penalty and granting greater cultural rights to the kurdish minority .
but the regular eu commission report also alleges that torture still persists and civil liberties such as freedom of expression , of association and of the press continue to be denied . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany remains turkey 's ally in eu bid if turkey is finally given a date to begin european union membership talks , it will be thanks in part to germany ; its strongest ally inside the bloc in recent years .

in berlin , the chancellor presented him with the german " quadriga bridges of respect " award given by the privately-funded werkstatt deutschland for outstanding contributions to european unity . hailing erdogan as " a great reformer , " schröder said the award was " a consequence of his political convictions and also of his painful personal experiences with repression and persecution " - a reference to the four months erdogan spent in jail for breaching turkey 's strict secular rules . accession talks imminent even more exciting for the turkish leader was the news that the eu commission would be recommending the start of accession negotiations with the muslim country .
the report is due to be officially published wednesday , but it has transpired that the commission believes the political criteria are fulfilled and recommends opening membership talks with turkey . however , any euphoria was tempered by eu enlargement commissioner günther verheugen who reiterated his belief that turkish membership was unlikely before 2015 at the earliest . news of the report coincided with political talks in berlin between gerhard schröder and the turkish prime minister .
although both leaders refused to comment on the report , gerhard schröder did n't leave any doubt about his vote at an eu summit in december . " if the criteria will have been met , " he said , " germany will vote in favor of accession talks with turkey at the summit in december .
but let me make sure once again that we are only talking about accession negotiations and nothing else . " " implementation is decisive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan said he hoped turkish membership in the eu would mean a reconciliation of civilizations .
he once again insisted that he would only go for full eu membership and not make do with the " special relationship " proposed recently by germany 's conservative opposition leader angela merkel . he also claimed that torture in his country was a thing of the past , while admitting that implementing the set of reforms adopted recently was indeed a challenging task . " changing laws doesn ’ t resolve any problem " he pointed out .
" implementation is the decisive part and also the most daunting because it means shifting mentalities .
but my government is determined and possesses the political will to carry through the implementation of the reforms to the end . " the erdogan government has passed sweeping reforms to meet eu membership conditions - among them the abolition of the death penalty and granting greater cultural rights to the kurdish minority .
but the regular eu commission report also alleges that torture still persists and civil liberties such as freedom of expression , of association and of the press continue to be denied . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany remains turkey 's ally in eu bid if turkey is finally given a date to begin european union membership talks , it will be thanks in part to germany ; its strongest ally inside the bloc in recent years .

the report emphasizes that economic pressure has been put on the press as well as noting cases of physical attacks against journalists .
the attacks have mainly concerned journalists with the local press – and the number of cases has risen recently , something which the report calls an alarming tendency .
the debate over the freedom of the romanian press has been fuelled by recent alleged attempts to influence the work of journalists in a number of independent romanian newspapers .

the scare later turned out to be a false alarm .
the singapore airlines flight , en route from frankfurt to new york , had 312 passengers on board .
the german pilot was told there may be a bomb aboard the boeing 747-400 , which then made an unscheduled landing in manchester , england .
the passengers deplaned there .
" it looks very much like a false alarm , " a police spokeswoman said .
the authorities did n't say who had issued the bomb threat .
it is the fourth time in a week that an airplane was diverted due to a bomb threat .
last week a british airways flight going from berlin to london had to stop in amsterdam , and two olympic airlines planes en route from athens to new york were diverted to the uk. and ireland .
in none of the cases were explosives ever found . more briefs 03.10.2004 -pipe- afghan president visits berlin 02.10.2004 -pipe- german demo rallies against cutting jobless benefits 02.10.2004 -pipe- greens to name new leadership 01.10.2004 -pipe- spd up , cdu down in polls 01.10.2004 -pipe- schröder goes ahead with afghanistan visit 01.10.2004 -pipe- fewer germans moving from east to west 30.09.2004 -pipe- schröder mulls cancelling afghan trip 30.09.2004 -pipe- german diplomats charged over visa scam radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the unknown guest of honor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2004 frankfurt book fair 2004 focuses on the arab world in beirut 's cultural scene nobody seems to know about the book fair in frankfurt .
lebanese authors are worried , but also get their hopes up . beirut ’ s young cultural scene is thriving : during the last year , tens of galleries have opened in the rebuild saifi village close to the city center , new cafes and jazz bars popped up in the gentrified areas of east beirut , where djs play the newest sound from europe and young musicians rap in the lebanese dialect .
at an abandoned train station , some musicians were recently organizing a techno party .
on this rave , ronja was handing out flyers inviting to a poetry slam at a private culture center .
" book fair in frankfurt ?
never heard of it , " she said .
she grew up in sweden and can ’ t read arabic well .
thus , she doesn ’ t follow the arab press .
rawan and sara go often to such events but haven ’ t heard about the book fair .
sara said those things don ’ t interest her .
" i work and work and hardly make $ 250 -lrb- € 200 -rrb- , " she said .
" i can ’ t go to europe , anyhow . "

the 31-year-old said he had heard about a large book fair taking place every year in frankfurt , but not about the arab world being the guest of honor .
" we are not in a luxury period here , " he says , " so people in general are not interested in culture . "
he hopes that such an event will not be turned into a political stage .
" it should just be for the intellectual aspect , " he said .
" we can ’ t solve our problems this way .
you can ’ t cover a hole in the table with a table cloth .
if the arab world wants to carry a message , i ask what message could that be ? "
but bashar haidar , a philosophy professor who was having a drink at a bistro with a colleague , said he had heard great things about the frankfurt book fair , but nothing about this year ’ s focus .
" that sounds fantastic , " he said .
" we should book tickets and go , " he told his colleague .
mixed feelings the lebanese authors who are invited to the fair were not quite as enthusiastic .
" since early 2004 , everything i read was criticism , " says emily nasrallah , who has had three novels and one children 's book translated into german .
" i haven ’ t read anything positive .
there was this delay , which also delayed the translation of books before the book fair .

" but it ’ s not only germany .
it is also the frankfurt book fair .
when i am asked by journalists here , whether i don ’ t think that the book is dead , i always tell them to go to frankfurt and see for themselves . "

" i am looking forward to it , " she said .
" i hear everybody around me saying it ’ s going to be a scandal because we have nothing to present .
of course , we have !
the problem is we are not proud of what we have . "

" they were lost , because they lost their image , " humaidan said .
" the great ideologies have died .
what ’ s left is fundamentalism and the old regimes .
people like us are marginalized .
my first reaction was to ask : how can we access this space between those two sides ? "

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the unknown guest of honor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2004 frankfurt book fair 2004 focuses on the arab world in beirut 's cultural scene nobody seems to know about the book fair in frankfurt .
lebanese authors are worried , but also get their hopes up . beirut ’ s young cultural scene is thriving : during the last year , tens of galleries have opened in the rebuild saifi village close to the city center , new cafes and jazz bars popped up in the gentrified areas of east beirut , where djs play the newest sound from europe and young musicians rap in the lebanese dialect .
at an abandoned train station , some musicians were recently organizing a techno party .
on this rave , ronja was handing out flyers inviting to a poetry slam at a private culture center .
" book fair in frankfurt ?
never heard of it , " she said .
she grew up in sweden and can ’ t read arabic well .
thus , she doesn ’ t follow the arab press .
rawan and sara go often to such events but haven ’ t heard about the book fair .
sara said those things don ’ t interest her .
" i work and work and hardly make $ 250 -lrb- € 200 -rrb- , " she said .
" i can ’ t go to europe , anyhow . "

mamlaka as-sarasir -lrb- cachroche kingdom -rrb- came out three years ago .
the 31-year-old said he had heard about a large book fair taking place every year in frankfurt , but not about the arab world being the guest of honor .
" we are not in a luxury period here , " he says , " so people in general are not interested in culture . "
he hopes that such an event will not be turned into a political stage .
" it should just be for the intellectual aspect , " he said .
" we can ’ t solve our problems this way .
you can ’ t cover a hole in the table with a table cloth .
if the arab world wants to carry a message , i ask what message could that be ? "
but bashar haidar , a philosophy professor who was having a drink at a bistro with a colleague , said he had heard great things about the frankfurt book fair , but nothing about this year ’ s focus .
" that sounds fantastic , " he said .
" we should book tickets and go , " he told his colleague .
mixed feelings the lebanese authors who are invited to the fair were not quite as enthusiastic .
" since early 2004 , everything i read was criticism , " says emily nasrallah , who has had three novels and one children 's book translated into german .
" i haven ’ t read anything positive .
there was this delay , which also delayed the translation of books before the book fair .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the unknown guest of honor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2004 frankfurt book fair 2004 focuses on the arab world in beirut 's cultural scene nobody seems to know about the book fair in frankfurt .
lebanese authors are worried , but also get their hopes up . beirut ’ s young cultural scene is thriving : during the last year , tens of galleries have opened in the rebuild saifi village close to the city center , new cafes and jazz bars popped up in the gentrified areas of east beirut , where djs play the newest sound from europe and young musicians rap in the lebanese dialect .
at an abandoned train station , some musicians were recently organizing a techno party .
on this rave , ronja was handing out flyers inviting to a poetry slam at a private culture center .
" book fair in frankfurt ?
never heard of it , " she said .
she grew up in sweden and can ’ t read arabic well .
thus , she doesn ’ t follow the arab press .
rawan and sara go often to such events but haven ’ t heard about the book fair .
sara said those things don ’ t interest her .
" i work and work and hardly make $ 250 -lrb- € 200 -rrb- , " she said .
" i can ’ t go to europe , anyhow . "
no time for luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arabic rappers , from right to left , dj charley shaby , 25 , richy shaby , 20 , wassim akar , 22 , and mahmoud shalaby , 20 simon khuan was reading poems he has already published .
mamlaka as-sarasir -lrb- cachroche kingdom -rrb- came out three years ago .
the 31-year-old said he had heard about a large book fair taking place every year in frankfurt , but not about the arab world being the guest of honor .
" we are not in a luxury period here , " he says , " so people in general are not interested in culture . "
he hopes that such an event will not be turned into a political stage .
" it should just be for the intellectual aspect , " he said .
" we can ’ t solve our problems this way .
you can ’ t cover a hole in the table with a table cloth .
if the arab world wants to carry a message , i ask what message could that be ? "
but bashar haidar , a philosophy professor who was having a drink at a bistro with a colleague , said he had heard great things about the frankfurt book fair , but nothing about this year ’ s focus .
" that sounds fantastic , " he said .
" we should book tickets and go , " he told his colleague .
mixed feelings the lebanese authors who are invited to the fair were not quite as enthusiastic .
" since early 2004 , everything i read was criticism , " says emily nasrallah , who has had three novels and one children 's book translated into german .
" i haven ’ t read anything positive .
there was this delay , which also delayed the translation of books before the book fair .
but this is something for the governments to answer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut ´ s skyline , libanon she said she doesn ’ t expect anything , " but i hope they will succeed , because we have a lot to show . "
she said she hoped this could be a push for arab literature .
" i am also very happy that it is happening in germany , because from my experience i feel they respect us very much , " she said .
" but it ’ s not only germany .
it is also the frankfurt book fair .
when i am asked by journalists here , whether i don ’ t think that the book is dead , i always tell them to go to frankfurt and see for themselves . "
iman humaidan will have her second novel translated into german just in time for the book fair .
she said she is excited to go .
" i am looking forward to it , " she said .
" i hear everybody around me saying it ’ s going to be a scandal because we have nothing to present .
of course , we have !
the problem is we are not proud of what we have . "
lost images image is another problem .
" they were lost , because they lost their image , " humaidan said .
" the great ideologies have died .
what ’ s left is fundamentalism and the old regimes .
people like us are marginalized .
my first reaction was to ask : how can we access this space between those two sides ? "
she said she thinks the book fair should be different from those events " when the west thinks of dialogue with the arab world as a dialogue with fundamentalists .
i have the same problems with fundamentalists as you have . " hannah wettig , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all .

the move could reflect some poles ' increasing dissatisfaction with american policies . in the run-up to the us-led invasion of iraq , poland was one of america 's staunchest supporters .
all of poland 's major political parties supported the war and 2,500 troops were sent to help with the war effort .
those soldiers now lead an 8,000 strong multinational force , which controls south-central iraq .
but poland 's defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski was quoted in monday 's issue of the polish daily gazeta wyborcza as saying that poland would significantly reduce its commitment to the region .
according to the report , poland will reduce its forces in iraq by 40 percent - from 2,500 to 1,500 - by the end of 2005 .
government under pressure the deadline to pull out troops will coincide with the expiration of the united nations security council resolution 1546 at the end of 2005 , which authorized the upcoming elections .
" that does not mean , however , that if a stabilization mission was continued , polish troops would be completely pulled out from iraq , " said szmajdzinkski .
" a group of officers at the headquarters , training centers , maybe a group of observers could still remain . "
the decision to reduce poland 's deployment in iraq came at the request of the current left-wing government 's junior coalition party , the labor union -lrb- up -rrb- .
polish prime minister marek belka 's government faces a parliamentary vote of confidence later this month , and general parliamentary elections are due to be held in mid-2005 .
both will take place amid a growing backdrop of disenchantment with american foreign policy .
america 's image tarnished poland has long been one of the united states ' staunchest supporters .
largely due to the legacy of communism , even the liberals among poland 's political elite shared us policy-makers ' view that tyranny should be met with force .
but as the situation in iraq degenerated over the past year , poles - both the media and the average citizen alike - have started to question the price poland pays for its unwavering support for its unwavering support of the united states .
indeed , 17 poles have died in iraq , but the political costs have also been high .
by allying itself with the us in the hopes of becoming a leader of so-called " new europe , " poland entered the eu on may 1st of this year at odds with germany and france .
and poles are questioning whether the current us administration truly intends to make good on its promise to deliver a credible democracy in iraq , the basis upon which they supported the invasion .
what 's more , the united states has not delivered many of the rewards promised to poland in exchange for its support , including lucrative reconstruction contracts .

all of the above has led to a growing backlash .

he told the new york times that the united states needed to become " more flexible , more gracious , " and that the bush administration should abandon its " neoconservative divide-and-rule policy . "

the move could reflect some poles ' increasing dissatisfaction with american policies . in the run-up to the us-led invasion of iraq , poland was one of america 's staunchest supporters .
all of poland 's major political parties supported the war and 2,500 troops were sent to help with the war effort .
those soldiers now lead an 8,000 strong multinational force , which controls south-central iraq .
but poland 's defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski was quoted in monday 's issue of the polish daily gazeta wyborcza as saying that poland would significantly reduce its commitment to the region .
according to the report , poland will reduce its forces in iraq by 40 percent - from 2,500 to 1,500 - by the end of 2005 .
government under pressure the deadline to pull out troops will coincide with the expiration of the united nations security council resolution 1546 at the end of 2005 , which authorized the upcoming elections .
" that does not mean , however , that if a stabilization mission was continued , polish troops would be completely pulled out from iraq , " said szmajdzinkski .
" a group of officers at the headquarters , training centers , maybe a group of observers could still remain . "
the decision to reduce poland 's deployment in iraq came at the request of the current left-wing government 's junior coalition party , the labor union -lrb- up -rrb- .
polish prime minister marek belka 's government faces a parliamentary vote of confidence later this month , and general parliamentary elections are due to be held in mid-2005 .
both will take place amid a growing backdrop of disenchantment with american foreign policy .
america 's image tarnished poland has long been one of the united states ' staunchest supporters .
largely due to the legacy of communism , even the liberals among poland 's political elite shared us policy-makers ' view that tyranny should be met with force .
but as the situation in iraq degenerated over the past year , poles - both the media and the average citizen alike - have started to question the price poland pays for its unwavering support for its unwavering support of the united states .
indeed , 17 poles have died in iraq , but the political costs have also been high .
by allying itself with the us in the hopes of becoming a leader of so-called " new europe , " poland entered the eu on may 1st of this year at odds with germany and france .
and poles are questioning whether the current us administration truly intends to make good on its promise to deliver a credible democracy in iraq , the basis upon which they supported the invasion .
what 's more , the united states has not delivered many of the rewards promised to poland in exchange for its support , including lucrative reconstruction contracts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kwasniewski , pictured with us president bush , is getting tough with washington .
all of the above has led to a growing backlash .
earlier this month , even poland 's president aleksander kwasniewski offered his own voice to the growing chorus of dissent .
he told the new york times that the united states needed to become " more flexible , more gracious , " and that the bush administration should abandon its " neoconservative divide-and-rule policy . "
in june , spain withdrew its 1,300 troops after the socialists replaced the conservative government of jose maria aznar in national elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.10.2004 poland to reduce force in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish soldiers will go home next year poland will significantly reduce its number of troops in iraq by the end of 2005 , the country 's defense minister said on monday .
the move could reflect some poles ' increasing dissatisfaction with american policies . in the run-up to the us-led invasion of iraq , poland was one of america 's staunchest supporters .
all of poland 's major political parties supported the war and 2,500 troops were sent to help with the war effort .
those soldiers now lead an 8,000 strong multinational force , which controls south-central iraq .
but poland 's defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski was quoted in monday 's issue of the polish daily gazeta wyborcza as saying that poland would significantly reduce its commitment to the region .
according to the report , poland will reduce its forces in iraq by 40 percent - from 2,500 to 1,500 - by the end of 2005 .
government under pressure the deadline to pull out troops will coincide with the expiration of the united nations security council resolution 1546 at the end of 2005 , which authorized the upcoming elections .
" that does not mean , however , that if a stabilization mission was continued , polish troops would be completely pulled out from iraq , " said szmajdzinkski .
" a group of officers at the headquarters , training centers , maybe a group of observers could still remain . "
the decision to reduce poland 's deployment in iraq came at the request of the current left-wing government 's junior coalition party , the labor union -lrb- up -rrb- .
polish prime minister marek belka 's government faces a parliamentary vote of confidence later this month , and general parliamentary elections are due to be held in mid-2005 .
both will take place amid a growing backdrop of disenchantment with american foreign policy .
america 's image tarnished poland has long been one of the united states ' staunchest supporters .
largely due to the legacy of communism , even the liberals among poland 's political elite shared us policy-makers ' view that tyranny should be met with force .
but as the situation in iraq degenerated over the past year , poles - both the media and the average citizen alike - have started to question the price poland pays for its unwavering support for its unwavering support of the united states .
indeed , 17 poles have died in iraq , but the political costs have also been high .
by allying itself with the us in the hopes of becoming a leader of so-called " new europe , " poland entered the eu on may 1st of this year at odds with germany and france .
and poles are questioning whether the current us administration truly intends to make good on its promise to deliver a credible democracy in iraq , the basis upon which they supported the invasion .
what 's more , the united states has not delivered many of the rewards promised to poland in exchange for its support , including lucrative reconstruction contracts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kwasniewski , pictured with us president bush , is getting tough with washington .
all of the above has led to a growing backlash .
earlier this month , even poland 's president aleksander kwasniewski offered his own voice to the growing chorus of dissent .
he told the new york times that the united states needed to become " more flexible , more gracious , " and that the bush administration should abandon its " neoconservative divide-and-rule policy . "
in june , spain withdrew its 1,300 troops after the socialists replaced the conservative government of jose maria aznar in national elections .
the new spanish prime minister , jose luis zapatero , has called the war iraq illegal under international law . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lech walesa : germany and france share blame for iraq war the former polish president and nobel peace prize winner says germany and france are partially to blame for the iraq war , because they failed to convince other eu members of their case against invasion .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the healing power of storytelling the new german translation of thousand and one nights -lrb- arabian nights -rrb- makes the oldest arabic version of this famed collection of oriental tales available for german readers for the first time . three hundred years ago , librarian antoine galland translated the story of " sindbad the sailor " for a noble woman .
he then heard of other stories , got his hands on a manuscript from syria and presented european readers with the first volume of " thousand and one nights " in 1704 .
the book 's popularity was like nothing ever seen before : overnight the stories took the west by storm , making hearts that shortly before had quaked in fear of the enemy from the east flutter in rapture for the enchanted orient .
literary triumph today the fabulous narratives even find favor with those more intellectual arabs who once dismissed the folktales as " pathetic prattle ; " only the eternally sanctimonious still take offence at the tales ' provocative sensuality .
galland had managed to uncover one of the world 's great literary treasures .
he translated the tales with a large measure of poetic freedom , in the style of his times , which probably only enhanced the work 's success .
there has since been no lack of alternative translations , including famous editions like that of enno littmann -lrb- 1921-1928 -rrb- .
but these have all been based on more recent manuscripts .
the original 15th-century fragment discovered by galland , which included 282 nights , is not only older , but also told in a particularly lively fashion , since , despite the authors ' efforts to stick to " correct " written arabic , colloquialisms keep breaking through – making for a different , more vernacular tone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of " thousand and one night " moves people from young to old in 1984 this original manuscript was published by muhsin mahdi .
and now , to mark the 300th anniversary of the first publication of the tales , arabic scholar claudia ott has produced a new translation - unlike galland keeping very close to the original text .
freed from the imposed patina of the european fairytale idiom , the " delectable " adventures of kings and beggars , slaves , demons and the " dead drunk " hunchback shine fresher than ever before .
ott effortlessly orchestrates the changes in register between the coarse tone of some of the spoken exchanges and the nicely turned phrases of the rhymed prose .
storytelling as last resort perhaps , more than the individual stories , it is the arrangement of the whole that is the stroke of genius , tying all the tales together : the fact that each story can act as a framework for further stories told within it , with the whole then subsumed under the wondrous tale of sheherazade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : never was the healing power of storytelling presented in a more beautiful way , like it is in the " arabian nights " the drama begins with the trauma of one man : sultan shahryar , a ruler in the island kingdom of india and china , discovers that his beloved wife is cheating on him every time he turns his back with a black slave .
when , on his flight from this horrendous scene , the wife and captive booty of a demon forces him to sleep with her in order to cuckold her hated demon husband , ifrit , he has had more than enough : shahryar decides from then on to kill each of his wives after their first night of lovemaking .

this well-read and educated young woman has a plan : she will tell stories to save herself , the king , and the world .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the healing power of storytelling the new german translation of thousand and one nights -lrb- arabian nights -rrb- makes the oldest arabic version of this famed collection of oriental tales available for german readers for the first time . three hundred years ago , librarian antoine galland translated the story of " sindbad the sailor " for a noble woman .
he then heard of other stories , got his hands on a manuscript from syria and presented european readers with the first volume of " thousand and one nights " in 1704 .
the book 's popularity was like nothing ever seen before : overnight the stories took the west by storm , making hearts that shortly before had quaked in fear of the enemy from the east flutter in rapture for the enchanted orient .
literary triumph today the fabulous narratives even find favor with those more intellectual arabs who once dismissed the folktales as " pathetic prattle ; " only the eternally sanctimonious still take offence at the tales ' provocative sensuality .
galland had managed to uncover one of the world 's great literary treasures .
he translated the tales with a large measure of poetic freedom , in the style of his times , which probably only enhanced the work 's success .
there has since been no lack of alternative translations , including famous editions like that of enno littmann -lrb- 1921-1928 -rrb- .
but these have all been based on more recent manuscripts .
the original 15th-century fragment discovered by galland , which included 282 nights , is not only older , but also told in a particularly lively fashion , since , despite the authors ' efforts to stick to " correct " written arabic , colloquialisms keep breaking through – making for a different , more vernacular tone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of " thousand and one night " moves people from young to old in 1984 this original manuscript was published by muhsin mahdi .
and now , to mark the 300th anniversary of the first publication of the tales , arabic scholar claudia ott has produced a new translation - unlike galland keeping very close to the original text .
freed from the imposed patina of the european fairytale idiom , the " delectable " adventures of kings and beggars , slaves , demons and the " dead drunk " hunchback shine fresher than ever before .
ott effortlessly orchestrates the changes in register between the coarse tone of some of the spoken exchanges and the nicely turned phrases of the rhymed prose .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the healing power of storytelling the new german translation of thousand and one nights -lrb- arabian nights -rrb- makes the oldest arabic version of this famed collection of oriental tales available for german readers for the first time . three hundred years ago , librarian antoine galland translated the story of " sindbad the sailor " for a noble woman .
he then heard of other stories , got his hands on a manuscript from syria and presented european readers with the first volume of " thousand and one nights " in 1704 .
the book 's popularity was like nothing ever seen before : overnight the stories took the west by storm , making hearts that shortly before had quaked in fear of the enemy from the east flutter in rapture for the enchanted orient .
literary triumph today the fabulous narratives even find favor with those more intellectual arabs who once dismissed the folktales as " pathetic prattle ; " only the eternally sanctimonious still take offence at the tales ' provocative sensuality .
galland had managed to uncover one of the world 's great literary treasures .
he translated the tales with a large measure of poetic freedom , in the style of his times , which probably only enhanced the work 's success .
there has since been no lack of alternative translations , including famous editions like that of enno littmann -lrb- 1921-1928 -rrb- .
but these have all been based on more recent manuscripts .
the original 15th-century fragment discovered by galland , which included 282 nights , is not only older , but also told in a particularly lively fashion , since , despite the authors ' efforts to stick to " correct " written arabic , colloquialisms keep breaking through – making for a different , more vernacular tone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of " thousand and one night " moves people from young to old in 1984 this original manuscript was published by muhsin mahdi .
and now , to mark the 300th anniversary of the first publication of the tales , arabic scholar claudia ott has produced a new translation - unlike galland keeping very close to the original text .
freed from the imposed patina of the european fairytale idiom , the " delectable " adventures of kings and beggars , slaves , demons and the " dead drunk " hunchback shine fresher than ever before .
ott effortlessly orchestrates the changes in register between the coarse tone of some of the spoken exchanges and the nicely turned phrases of the rhymed prose .
storytelling as last resort perhaps , more than the individual stories , it is the arrangement of the whole that is the stroke of genius , tying all the tales together : the fact that each story can act as a framework for further stories told within it , with the whole then subsumed under the wondrous tale of sheherazade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : never was the healing power of storytelling presented in a more beautiful way , like it is in the " arabian nights " the drama begins with the trauma of one man : sultan shahryar , a ruler in the island kingdom of india and china , discovers that his beloved wife is cheating on him every time he turns his back with a black slave .
when , on his flight from this horrendous scene , the wife and captive booty of a demon forces him to sleep with her in order to cuckold her hated demon husband , ifrit , he has had more than enough : shahryar decides from then on to kill each of his wives after their first night of lovemaking .
night after night .
in this brutal manner , the battle of the sexes culminates in a series of fatal one-night stands .
enter sheherazade , the daughter of the wazir .
this well-read and educated young woman has a plan : she will tell stories to save herself , the king , and the world .
she proceeds to tell tales just like every tv series does – so enthralling that , each night when the sun goes down , a cliffhanger will make the sultan desperate to hear what happens next -lrb- " and the jinni drew his sword to strike … " -rrb- , postponing her death until the beautiful storyteller is able to bear the sultan a child and thus change his mind about the wiles of womanhood . ludwig ammann , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de connecting the cultural dots dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing .

" your strategic decision you have to make - to change the situation in the whole region , including iraq , for the better .
and for the europeans it will be turkey , " fischer told guests at the american academy in berlin last week . berlin pledges to back ankara schröder 's government has moved beyond giving lip service to the notion of turkey 's eu candidacy , as was the case under the conservative government of helmut kohl , to making it one of the pillars of german foreign policy .
it threw its weight in earnest behind ankara 's bid at the eu 's summit in copenhagen in late 2002 , which was focused on enlargement . with france in tow , the government in berlin initiated the proposal that will in december see eu leaders decide on turkey 's future based on a european commission report this week about its progress toward democratic reforms . " if the european commission recommends opening accession talks , then germany will clearly support that , " schröder said sunday before presenting prime minister recep tayyip erdogan an award for his reform work so far . opposition calls for ' special relationship ' the german opposition has , meanwhile , raised the issue of human rights abuses and says turkey does not share the same " values " , ostensibly cultural and religious , as the union . " from a geographical point of view , i think that europe has to have borders so that its integrity is not endangered , " edmund stoiber , the former conservative candidate for chancellor , told afp last week . " this does n't rule out having ties through a partnership , " he added . economic opportunities for the german business community , turkey 's membership will bring economic opportunities to its biggest trading partner and , in the words of wholesale and foreign trade federation head anton boerner , a " growth and profit spiral " . about 30 percent of turkey 's trade with the eu is with germany .
however , for the conservatives , acutely aware of the massive cost of german reunification , the price is too high .
the brussels think-tank " friends of europe " has estimated that turkey 's integration will cost some 15 billion euros annually over three years .
germany would pay the most : 2.4 billion euros a year . " while integration would be good for turkey , it would be unmanageable for europe , in particular from a financial point of view because the costs of such an integration would be too high , " stoiber said . strengthening turkey 's ties to the west however heinz kramer , an expert on turkish affairs at the swp institute , told afp that a firm date for accession talks could be good all round . " a prospect of membership will help the turkish government consolidate its reform programme and will send a signal to the financial and economic markets that turkey is more strongly linked to the west , " he said . that aside , public opinion is not in ankara 's favour .
a recent survey found that 35 percent of people support turkey joining the bloc , while 57 are against . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish eu membership to cost up to € 28 billion per year reported on in several german newspapers , the study says that ankara 's joining the 25-nation union would be a " challenge with great opportunities for both sides .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the kids are alright großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan kretzschmar and franziska van almsick are top eastern athletes a new study shows that young eastern germans are far more hard-working and independent-minded than their peers in the west . the recent rise in right-wing extremism in eastern germany is often blamed on its disillusioned younger generation .
but researchers at the renowned allensbach opinion research institute have published a study which reaches very different conclusions . to rita barwitzki , a 26-year-old from leipzig , the fall of the berlin wall almost 15 years ago could n't have come at a better time . " i had to shed part of my identity , " she explained , " but i could n't wait to discover new things . " " i did n't want to get stuck in the old ways - after all a new system had arrived that gave me more freedom and independence . " rita believes she benefited from having lived both behind the iron curtain and in reunited germany .
she has childhood memories of life under honecker , but it was the west that shaped her life as a teenager . her self-confidence is typical of the under-30s in eastern germany , who are more enterprising than the older generation , and many of their contemporaries in the west . empty prejudice when the ifd-allensbach questioned a sample of 2000 eastern germans , it was the young people who made the best impression . " we 'd always heard that the younger east germans felt they had no future , that they were lacking in motivation , " explained project manager thomas petersen .
" there were no opportunities , and the more capable ones left for the west - those are some of the clichés . " they proved to be empty prejudices .
" there 's a new generation emerging in our statistics that 's quite different , " observed petersen .
" they do n't just sit around feeling sorry for themselves , they take the initiative and they 're brimming with optimism . " shaping their own destiny 52 percent of young eastern germans say they are in control of their lives , while only a third of older eastern germans can match their self-belief .
in western germany , 45 percent believe that destiny is something you shape yourself , regardless of external circumstances . how do the researchers explain this ?
with the east german dictatorship an increasingly distant memory , a new generation has grown up that does not share the values of its parents .
a similar phenomenon was observed in post-war west germany and in the early 1990s in spain , 15 years after the death of franco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1973 , east berlin hosted the 10th world youth games .
" this younger generation hardly knew east germany , pointed out thomas petersen .
" they grew up in freedom and have been exposed to a world quite different to that in which their parents lived . " " there were differences in language , how one behaves in public and in private , what one can say , what one ca n't say , even how one keeps an eye on the neighbours .
these things were very different in a dictatorship . " the advantages of adversity thomas petersen also points out that eastern germans growing up in cities and towns with a 20 percent unemployment rate have experienced hardship from an early age . almost everybody in eastern germany knows someone who has lost their job and who 's suffering from financial or psychological problems . it 's a different story in western germany .
but in the long-term , petersen believes , the energy and optimism of young eastern germans could start to spill over into the west . christiane hoffman -lrb- dw staff -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fewer germans moving from east to west the wave of migration from eastern to western germany is starting to subside .

but researchers at the renowned allensbach opinion research institute have published a study which reaches very different conclusions . to rita barwitzki , a 26-year-old from leipzig , the fall of the berlin wall almost 15 years ago could n't have come at a better time . " i had to shed part of my identity , " she explained , " but i could n't wait to discover new things . " " i did n't want to get stuck in the old ways - after all a new system had arrived that gave me more freedom and independence . " rita believes she benefited from having lived both behind the iron curtain and in reunited germany .
she has childhood memories of life under honecker , but it was the west that shaped her life as a teenager . her self-confidence is typical of the under-30s in eastern germany , who are more enterprising than the older generation , and many of their contemporaries in the west . empty prejudice when the ifd-allensbach questioned a sample of 2000 eastern germans , it was the young people who made the best impression . " we 'd always heard that the younger east germans felt they had no future , that they were lacking in motivation , " explained project manager thomas petersen .
" there were no opportunities , and the more capable ones left for the west - those are some of the clichés . " they proved to be empty prejudices .
" there 's a new generation emerging in our statistics that 's quite different , " observed petersen .
" they do n't just sit around feeling sorry for themselves , they take the initiative and they 're brimming with optimism . " shaping their own destiny 52 percent of young eastern germans say they are in control of their lives , while only a third of older eastern germans can match their self-belief .
in western germany , 45 percent believe that destiny is something you shape yourself , regardless of external circumstances . how do the researchers explain this ?
with the east german dictatorship an increasingly distant memory , a new generation has grown up that does not share the values of its parents .
a similar phenomenon was observed in post-war west germany and in the early 1990s in spain , 15 years after the death of franco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1973 , east berlin hosted the 10th world youth games .
" this younger generation hardly knew east germany , pointed out thomas petersen .
" they grew up in freedom and have been exposed to a world quite different to that in which their parents lived . " " there were differences in language , how one behaves in public and in private , what one can say , what one ca n't say , even how one keeps an eye on the neighbours .
these things were very different in a dictatorship . " the advantages of adversity thomas petersen also points out that eastern germans growing up in cities and towns with a 20 percent unemployment rate have experienced hardship from an early age . almost everybody in eastern germany knows someone who has lost their job and who 's suffering from financial or psychological problems . it 's a different story in western germany .
but in the long-term , petersen believes , the energy and optimism of young eastern germans could start to spill over into the west . christiane hoffman -lrb- dw staff -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fewer germans moving from east to west the wave of migration from eastern to western germany is starting to subside .

during the cold war their tiny village bordered one of the soviet union 's largest foreign airbases .
then came cargolifter , a company hoping to build commercial heavy-lift zeppelins on the 500 hectare base after the russians left .
that project failed in 2002 , but it left behind a colossal 107-meter high airship hangar subsidized by taxpayers .
until recently , the most exciting thing to do in the area was to take a canoe ride and enjoy some of the spreewald 's popular cucumbers .
but colin au , a singapore-based malaysian multi-millionaire , is aiming to change all that .
this december , au and his partners at the malaysian conglomerate tanjong plc will open a € 70-million -lrb- $ 86.8-million -rrb- tropical rainforest theme park on the former cargolifter grounds .
" this concept could work anywhere it is cold , but germans really love the sun , " au told dw-world , as he pointed out where the hangar 's unfinished concrete floor will be transformed into white sandy beaches and heated lagoons .
thousands of plants when complete , the 360-meter long silver structure will be refashioned into a unique venue for thousands of tropical plants and cruise ship-like entertainment .
the park , known as tropical islands , will not only be home to orchids and palm trees ; it will also have several types of " villages " from tropical cultures , including borneo , congo and the amazon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer simulation of the tropical island beach .
in the depths of winter , the air temperature in the park will be a balmy 25 degrees celsius and the water in the pools an even warmer 30 degrees .
a special foil on the south side of the dome - the world 's largest freestanding construction of its kind - will let in almost 100 percent of the sun 's rays .
" if people do n't use sunscreen in the summer they 'll definitely get sunburn , " said tropical islands spokeswoman vivian kreft .
if successful , the resort in brand will become the flagship of a chain of similar parks around the world .
but none would be built on such a mammoth scale as the dome in germany .
au and tanjong were able to snap it up for a measly € 17.5 million - a fraction of what it cost cargolifter - during insolvency proceedings last year .
enough visitors ?
despite the proclivity of germans to flee their own inclement weather , it 's still uncertain if the park can really attract over two million visitors a year as planned .
only last week , the space center , a comic-themed amusement park in the northern city of bremen , closed its doors after opening earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first trees arrive .
but au dismissed worries that tropical islands could run into similar trouble .
" our concept is really much closer to a resort than an amusement park , " he said .
" it really should be attractive to a broad range of people . "
the project certainly was attractive to the government of the depressed eastern german state of brandenburg , which was relieved to find investors with a viable concept for the cargolifter hall .
with unemployment in brandenburg near 20 percent , the park will create 500 desperately needed new jobs for the region .
it 's the poor economy , though , that could present the biggest risk to the project , since down-on-their-luck germans have become notoriously stingy in recent years .
the amount of disposable income of many eastern germans will be further cut next year when unpopular reforms reduce the benefits of long-term unemployed to the level of welfare payments .
original concept is key harmut mertens , an economist at bankgesellschaft berlin , admitted the region is going through some tough times , but he remained optimistic tropical islands could be a success .
" they seem to have a pretty original concept there , " mertens told dw-world .
" the problem with the space center in bremen was that they put a lot of emphasis on shopping .
that 's not the case with the tropics park . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cargolifter building the dome .
the locals from brand , however , are more cautious after seeing both the soviets and the zeppelin makers come and go .
" i 'm a little skeptical , " said carola seidenfeudel , who runs a snack shop not far from the dome .
she said her family sold drinks and food to cargolifter employees for years before the company went bankrupt .
only after construction started for tropical island this spring did they return to their familiar corner next to brand 's tiny railway station .

this december , au and his partners at the malaysian conglomerate tanjong plc will open a € 70-million -lrb- $ 86.8-million -rrb- tropical rainforest theme park on the former cargolifter grounds .
" this concept could work anywhere it is cold , but germans really love the sun , " au told dw-world , as he pointed out where the hangar 's unfinished concrete floor will be transformed into white sandy beaches and heated lagoons .
thousands of plants when complete , the 360-meter long silver structure will be refashioned into a unique venue for thousands of tropical plants and cruise ship-like entertainment .
the park , known as tropical islands , will not only be home to orchids and palm trees ; it will also have several types of " villages " from tropical cultures , including borneo , congo and the amazon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer simulation of the tropical island beach .
in the depths of winter , the air temperature in the park will be a balmy 25 degrees celsius and the water in the pools an even warmer 30 degrees .
a special foil on the south side of the dome - the world 's largest freestanding construction of its kind - will let in almost 100 percent of the sun 's rays .
" if people do n't use sunscreen in the summer they 'll definitely get sunburn , " said tropical islands spokeswoman vivian kreft .
if successful , the resort in brand will become the flagship of a chain of similar parks around the world .
but none would be built on such a mammoth scale as the dome in germany .
au and tanjong were able to snap it up for a measly € 17.5 million - a fraction of what it cost cargolifter - during insolvency proceedings last year .
enough visitors ?
despite the proclivity of germans to flee their own inclement weather , it 's still uncertain if the park can really attract over two million visitors a year as planned .
only last week , the space center , a comic-themed amusement park in the northern city of bremen , closed its doors after opening earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first trees arrive .
but au dismissed worries that tropical islands could run into similar trouble .
" our concept is really much closer to a resort than an amusement park , " he said .
" it really should be attractive to a broad range of people . "
the project certainly was attractive to the government of the depressed eastern german state of brandenburg , which was relieved to find investors with a viable concept for the cargolifter hall .
with unemployment in brandenburg near 20 percent , the park will create 500 desperately needed new jobs for the region .
it 's the poor economy , though , that could present the biggest risk to the project , since down-on-their-luck germans have become notoriously stingy in recent years .
the amount of disposable income of many eastern germans will be further cut next year when unpopular reforms reduce the benefits of long-term unemployed to the level of welfare payments .
original concept is key harmut mertens , an economist at bankgesellschaft berlin , admitted the region is going through some tough times , but he remained optimistic tropical islands could be a success .
" they seem to have a pretty original concept there , " mertens told dw-world .
" the problem with the space center in bremen was that they put a lot of emphasis on shopping .
that 's not the case with the tropics park . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cargolifter building the dome .
the locals from brand , however , are more cautious after seeing both the soviets and the zeppelin makers come and go .
" i 'm a little skeptical , " said carola seidenfeudel , who runs a snack shop not far from the dome .
she said her family sold drinks and food to cargolifter employees for years before the company went bankrupt .

a special foil on the south side of the dome - the world 's largest freestanding construction of its kind - will let in almost 100 percent of the sun 's rays .

au and tanjong were able to snap it up for a measly € 17.5 million - a fraction of what it cost cargolifter - during insolvency proceedings last year .
enough visitors ?
despite the proclivity of germans to flee their own inclement weather , it 's still uncertain if the park can really attract over two million visitors a year as planned .
only last week , the space center , a comic-themed amusement park in the northern city of bremen , closed its doors after opening earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first trees arrive .
but au dismissed worries that tropical islands could run into similar trouble .
" our concept is really much closer to a resort than an amusement park , " he said .
" it really should be attractive to a broad range of people . "
the project certainly was attractive to the government of the depressed eastern german state of brandenburg , which was relieved to find investors with a viable concept for the cargolifter hall .
with unemployment in brandenburg near 20 percent , the park will create 500 desperately needed new jobs for the region .
it 's the poor economy , though , that could present the biggest risk to the project , since down-on-their-luck germans have become notoriously stingy in recent years .
the amount of disposable income of many eastern germans will be further cut next year when unpopular reforms reduce the benefits of long-term unemployed to the level of welfare payments .
original concept is key harmut mertens , an economist at bankgesellschaft berlin , admitted the region is going through some tough times , but he remained optimistic tropical islands could be a success .
" they seem to have a pretty original concept there , " mertens told dw-world .

during the cold war their tiny village bordered one of the soviet union 's largest foreign airbases .
then came cargolifter , a company hoping to build commercial heavy-lift zeppelins on the 500 hectare base after the russians left .
that project failed in 2002 , but it left behind a colossal 107-meter high airship hangar subsidized by taxpayers .
until recently , the most exciting thing to do in the area was to take a canoe ride and enjoy some of the spreewald 's popular cucumbers .
but colin au , a singapore-based malaysian multi-millionaire , is aiming to change all that .
this december , au and his partners at the malaysian conglomerate tanjong plc will open a € 70-million -lrb- $ 86.8-million -rrb- tropical rainforest theme park on the former cargolifter grounds .
" this concept could work anywhere it is cold , but germans really love the sun , " au told dw-world , as he pointed out where the hangar 's unfinished concrete floor will be transformed into white sandy beaches and heated lagoons .
thousands of plants when complete , the 360-meter long silver structure will be refashioned into a unique venue for thousands of tropical plants and cruise ship-like entertainment .
the park , known as tropical islands , will not only be home to orchids and palm trees ; it will also have several types of " villages " from tropical cultures , including borneo , congo and the amazon .

it was sweet revenge for bayern who surrendered their german title to bremen with a 3-1 loss at the olympic stadium last season .
bayern are starting to click into gear , building on their 4-0 champions league demolition of ajax in midweek , and leapfrogged bremen into third with the three points .
" we are up near the top of the table and back on the straight and narrow , " said bayern coach felix magath .
" we were fortunate to win but i think overall we deserved the three points . "
surprise package vfl wolfsburg still set the pace at the top following a 2-1 win over borussia monchengladbach .
vfb stuttgart are second one point behind wolfsburg after defeating arminia bielefeld 2-0 on sunday .
matthias sammer has yet to taste defeat in his ten games as stuttgart manager and his club are the only unbeaten team in the top-flight .
german international sebastian deisler was back in the bayern starting eleven after being ' rested ' for the past few matches and his corner was pivotal for the first goal .
in the 20th minute ballack rose highest to head home his fourth goal of the season from the corner kick .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sometimes makaay is so well marked it creates space for ballack , " explained magath .
" it is good to have two people who are so clinical in front of goal . "
croatian international ivan klasnic should have equalised for bremen on the half hour mark but somehow headed wide with the goal at his mercy .
" in the first half we lacked the bite that we demonstrated against valencia , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we could not convert our chances either . "
greece 's euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas , who scored the winner against valencia in midweek , replaced klasnic at the interval as coach schaaf revamped his front line . hosts bremen asserted more pressure but it was in vain as substitute schweinsteiger staked a claim for a place in the first team curling home a 75th minute shot that caught goalkeeper andreas reinke off guard .
the second goal proved important as miroslav klose reduced the deficit with a header in the 81st minute , his fourth goal in his last two bundesliga outings , but bayern held on .
bremen 's miserable afternoon was capped off when it was confirmed that german international frank fahrenhorst had broken his nose after ballack 's stray elbow forced him to leave the field after seven minutes .
leverkusen ends drought bayer leverkusen ended a five match winless streak with a 3-0 triumph over sv hamburg at the bayarena .
bildunterschrift : " i am delighted with the three points , " said bayer manager klaus augenthaler .
" the win is more significant than the victory against bayern because the team were at a low ebb . "
augenthaler claimed polish international jacek krzynowek should have a licence for his left foot and it was clear what the coach meant .
in the 10th minute krzynowek unleashed a 25 yard shot from his cannon left foot and the ball crashed into the roof of the net .
brazilian international juan -lrb- 73 -rrb- and bulgarian international dimitar berbatov -lrb- 86 -rrb- struck late on for leverkusen spoiling the return of hamburg chief klaus toppmoller , who guided bayer to the champions league final in 2002 .
borussia dortmund fans still pine for their first home win in the bundesliga following a 2-2 draw with fc nuremberg .
nuremberg scored twice in the 23rd and 25th minute to shock the 75,000 fans , but czech international jan koller salvaged a point with a brace -lrb- 28 , 45 -rrb- in a busy first half at the westfalen stadium .
in a league encounter on sunday , manager ralf rangnick enjoyed his first bundesliga match in charge of schalke 04 with a 3-2 triumph over local rivals vfl bochum .
schalke climbed an incredible nine places with the victory and are now in seventh after being in the relegation zone before the match .
a first half goal blitz did the damage with german international gerald asamoah -lrb- 10 -rrb- , levan kobiaschvili -lrb- 13 -rrb- and brazilian lincoln -lrb- 44 -rrb- all on target .
bochum pulled two goals back in a see-saw second half but could not find an equaliser against ten-man schalke who had goalscorer lincoln dismissed in the 80th minute for wasting time . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern turns up heat with win in bremen it was n't pretty but bayern munich claimed a victory over arch rivals werder bremen on saturday , moving up to third in the league with a 2-1 win .

" your strategic decision you have to make - to change the situation in the whole region , including iraq , for the better .
and for the europeans it will be turkey , " fischer told guests at the american academy in berlin last week . berlin pledges to back ankara schröder 's government has moved beyond giving lip service to the notion of turkey 's eu candidacy , as was the case under the conservative government of helmut kohl , to making it one of the pillars of german foreign policy .
it threw its weight in earnest behind ankara 's bid at the eu 's summit in copenhagen in late 2002 , which was focused on enlargement . with france in tow , the government in berlin initiated the proposal that will in december see eu leaders decide on turkey 's future based on a european commission report this week about its progress toward democratic reforms . " if the european commission recommends opening accession talks , then germany will clearly support that , " schröder said sunday before presenting prime minister recep tayyip erdogan an award for his reform work so far . opposition calls for ' special relationship ' the german opposition has , meanwhile , raised the issue of human rights abuses and says turkey does not share the same " values " , ostensibly cultural and religious , as the union . " from a geographical point of view , i think that europe has to have borders so that its integrity is not endangered , " edmund stoiber , the former conservative candidate for chancellor , told afp last week . " this does n't rule out having ties through a partnership , " he added . economic opportunities for the german business community , turkey 's membership will bring economic opportunities to its biggest trading partner and , in the words of wholesale and foreign trade federation head anton boerner , a " growth and profit spiral " . about 30 percent of turkey 's trade with the eu is with germany .
however , for the conservatives , acutely aware of the massive cost of german reunification , the price is too high .
the brussels think-tank " friends of europe " has estimated that turkey 's integration will cost some 15 billion euros annually over three years .
germany would pay the most : 2.4 billion euros a year . " while integration would be good for turkey , it would be unmanageable for europe , in particular from a financial point of view because the costs of such an integration would be too high , " stoiber said . strengthening turkey 's ties to the west however heinz kramer , an expert on turkish affairs at the swp institute , told afp that a firm date for accession talks could be good all round . " a prospect of membership will help the turkish government consolidate its reform programme and will send a signal to the financial and economic markets that turkey is more strongly linked to the west , " he said . that aside , public opinion is not in ankara 's favour .
a recent survey found that 35 percent of people support turkey joining the bloc , while 57 are against . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish eu membership to cost up to € 28 billion per year reported on in several german newspapers , the study says that ankara 's joining the 25-nation union would be a " challenge with great opportunities for both sides .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.10.2004 poland to reduce force in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish soldiers will go home next year poland will significantly reduce its number of troops in iraq by the end of 2005 , the country 's defense minister said on monday .
the move could reflect some poles ' increasing dissatisfaction with american policies . in the run-up to the us-led invasion of iraq , poland was one of america 's staunchest supporters .
all of poland 's major political parties supported the war and 2,500 troops were sent to help with the war effort .
those soldiers now lead an 8,000 strong multinational force , which controls south-central iraq .
but poland 's defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski was quoted in monday 's issue of the polish daily gazeta wyborcza as saying that poland would significantly reduce its commitment to the region .
according to the report , poland will reduce its forces in iraq by 40 percent - from 2,500 to 1,500 - by the end of 2005 .
government under pressure the deadline to pull out troops will coincide with the expiration of the united nations security council resolution 1546 at the end of 2005 , which authorized the upcoming elections .
" that does not mean , however , that if a stabilization mission was continued , polish troops would be completely pulled out from iraq , " said szmajdzinkski .
" a group of officers at the headquarters , training centers , maybe a group of observers could still remain . "
the decision to reduce poland 's deployment in iraq came at the request of the current left-wing government 's junior coalition party , the labor union -lrb- up -rrb- .
polish prime minister marek belka 's government faces a parliamentary vote of confidence later this month , and general parliamentary elections are due to be held in mid-2005 .
both will take place amid a growing backdrop of disenchantment with american foreign policy .
america 's image tarnished poland has long been one of the united states ' staunchest supporters .
largely due to the legacy of communism , even the liberals among poland 's political elite shared us policy-makers ' view that tyranny should be met with force .
but as the situation in iraq degenerated over the past year , poles - both the media and the average citizen alike - have started to question the price poland pays for its unwavering support for its unwavering support of the united states .
indeed , 17 poles have died in iraq , but the political costs have also been high .
by allying itself with the us in the hopes of becoming a leader of so-called " new europe , " poland entered the eu on may 1st of this year at odds with germany and france .
and poles are questioning whether the current us administration truly intends to make good on its promise to deliver a credible democracy in iraq , the basis upon which they supported the invasion .
what 's more , the united states has not delivered many of the rewards promised to poland in exchange for its support , including lucrative reconstruction contracts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kwasniewski , pictured with us president bush , is getting tough with washington .
all of the above has led to a growing backlash .
earlier this month , even poland 's president aleksander kwasniewski offered his own voice to the growing chorus of dissent .
he told the new york times that the united states needed to become " more flexible , more gracious , " and that the bush administration should abandon its " neoconservative divide-and-rule policy . "
in june , spain withdrew its 1,300 troops after the socialists replaced the conservative government of jose maria aznar in national elections .
the new spanish prime minister , jose luis zapatero , has called the war iraq illegal under international law . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lech walesa : germany and france share blame for iraq war the former polish president and nobel peace prize winner says germany and france are partially to blame for the iraq war , because they failed to convince other eu members of their case against invasion .

the report emphasizes that economic pressure has been put on the press as well as noting cases of physical attacks against journalists .
the attacks have mainly concerned journalists with the local press – and the number of cases has risen recently , something which the report calls an alarming tendency .
the debate over the freedom of the romanian press has been fuelled by recent alleged attempts to influence the work of journalists in a number of independent romanian newspapers .
two big newspapers , evenime ntul zilei and romania libera , protested at alleged undue interference by their western owners in their editorial content .
both the swiss group ringier and the german owner waz , owners of the two dailies , have denied influencing editorial policy .
the report is due to be published on wednesday and will be a key document on romania 's readiness to join the eu in 2007 .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the healing power of storytelling the new german translation of thousand and one nights -lrb- arabian nights -rrb- makes the oldest arabic version of this famed collection of oriental tales available for german readers for the first time . three hundred years ago , librarian antoine galland translated the story of " sindbad the sailor " for a noble woman .
he then heard of other stories , got his hands on a manuscript from syria and presented european readers with the first volume of " thousand and one nights " in 1704 .
the book 's popularity was like nothing ever seen before : overnight the stories took the west by storm , making hearts that shortly before had quaked in fear of the enemy from the east flutter in rapture for the enchanted orient .
literary triumph today the fabulous narratives even find favor with those more intellectual arabs who once dismissed the folktales as " pathetic prattle ; " only the eternally sanctimonious still take offence at the tales ' provocative sensuality .
galland had managed to uncover one of the world 's great literary treasures .
he translated the tales with a large measure of poetic freedom , in the style of his times , which probably only enhanced the work 's success .
there has since been no lack of alternative translations , including famous editions like that of enno littmann -lrb- 1921-1928 -rrb- .
but these have all been based on more recent manuscripts .
the original 15th-century fragment discovered by galland , which included 282 nights , is not only older , but also told in a particularly lively fashion , since , despite the authors ' efforts to stick to " correct " written arabic , colloquialisms keep breaking through – making for a different , more vernacular tone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of " thousand and one night " moves people from young to old in 1984 this original manuscript was published by muhsin mahdi .
and now , to mark the 300th anniversary of the first publication of the tales , arabic scholar claudia ott has produced a new translation - unlike galland keeping very close to the original text .
freed from the imposed patina of the european fairytale idiom , the " delectable " adventures of kings and beggars , slaves , demons and the " dead drunk " hunchback shine fresher than ever before .
ott effortlessly orchestrates the changes in register between the coarse tone of some of the spoken exchanges and the nicely turned phrases of the rhymed prose .
storytelling as last resort perhaps , more than the individual stories , it is the arrangement of the whole that is the stroke of genius , tying all the tales together : the fact that each story can act as a framework for further stories told within it , with the whole then subsumed under the wondrous tale of sheherazade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : never was the healing power of storytelling presented in a more beautiful way , like it is in the " arabian nights " the drama begins with the trauma of one man : sultan shahryar , a ruler in the island kingdom of india and china , discovers that his beloved wife is cheating on him every time he turns his back with a black slave .
when , on his flight from this horrendous scene , the wife and captive booty of a demon forces him to sleep with her in order to cuckold her hated demon husband , ifrit , he has had more than enough : shahryar decides from then on to kill each of his wives after their first night of lovemaking .
night after night .
in this brutal manner , the battle of the sexes culminates in a series of fatal one-night stands .

this well-read and educated young woman has a plan : she will tell stories to save herself , the king , and the world .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the healing power of storytelling the new german translation of thousand and one nights -lrb- arabian nights -rrb- makes the oldest arabic version of this famed collection of oriental tales available for german readers for the first time . three hundred years ago , librarian antoine galland translated the story of " sindbad the sailor " for a noble woman .
he then heard of other stories , got his hands on a manuscript from syria and presented european readers with the first volume of " thousand and one nights " in 1704 .
the book 's popularity was like nothing ever seen before : overnight the stories took the west by storm , making hearts that shortly before had quaked in fear of the enemy from the east flutter in rapture for the enchanted orient .
literary triumph today the fabulous narratives even find favor with those more intellectual arabs who once dismissed the folktales as " pathetic prattle ; " only the eternally sanctimonious still take offence at the tales ' provocative sensuality .
galland had managed to uncover one of the world 's great literary treasures .
he translated the tales with a large measure of poetic freedom , in the style of his times , which probably only enhanced the work 's success .
there has since been no lack of alternative translations , including famous editions like that of enno littmann -lrb- 1921-1928 -rrb- .
but these have all been based on more recent manuscripts .
the original 15th-century fragment discovered by galland , which included 282 nights , is not only older , but also told in a particularly lively fashion , since , despite the authors ' efforts to stick to " correct " written arabic , colloquialisms keep breaking through – making for a different , more vernacular tone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of " thousand and one night " moves people from young to old in 1984 this original manuscript was published by muhsin mahdi .
and now , to mark the 300th anniversary of the first publication of the tales , arabic scholar claudia ott has produced a new translation - unlike galland keeping very close to the original text .
freed from the imposed patina of the european fairytale idiom , the " delectable " adventures of kings and beggars , slaves , demons and the " dead drunk " hunchback shine fresher than ever before .
ott effortlessly orchestrates the changes in register between the coarse tone of some of the spoken exchanges and the nicely turned phrases of the rhymed prose .
storytelling as last resort perhaps , more than the individual stories , it is the arrangement of the whole that is the stroke of genius , tying all the tales together : the fact that each story can act as a framework for further stories told within it , with the whole then subsumed under the wondrous tale of sheherazade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : never was the healing power of storytelling presented in a more beautiful way , like it is in the " arabian nights " the drama begins with the trauma of one man : sultan shahryar , a ruler in the island kingdom of india and china , discovers that his beloved wife is cheating on him every time he turns his back with a black slave .
when , on his flight from this horrendous scene , the wife and captive booty of a demon forces him to sleep with her in order to cuckold her hated demon husband , ifrit , he has had more than enough : shahryar decides from then on to kill each of his wives after their first night of lovemaking .
night after night .
in this brutal manner , the battle of the sexes culminates in a series of fatal one-night stands .
enter sheherazade , the daughter of the wazir .
this well-read and educated young woman has a plan : she will tell stories to save herself , the king , and the world .
she proceeds to tell tales just like every tv series does – so enthralling that , each night when the sun goes down , a cliffhanger will make the sultan desperate to hear what happens next -lrb- " and the jinni drew his sword to strike … " -rrb- , postponing her death until the beautiful storyteller is able to bear the sultan a child and thus change his mind about the wiles of womanhood . ludwig ammann , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de connecting the cultural dots dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the unknown guest of honor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2004 frankfurt book fair 2004 focuses on the arab world in beirut 's cultural scene nobody seems to know about the book fair in frankfurt .
lebanese authors are worried , but also get their hopes up . beirut ’ s young cultural scene is thriving : during the last year , tens of galleries have opened in the rebuild saifi village close to the city center , new cafes and jazz bars popped up in the gentrified areas of east beirut , where djs play the newest sound from europe and young musicians rap in the lebanese dialect .
at an abandoned train station , some musicians were recently organizing a techno party .
on this rave , ronja was handing out flyers inviting to a poetry slam at a private culture center .
" book fair in frankfurt ?
never heard of it , " she said .
she grew up in sweden and can ’ t read arabic well .
thus , she doesn ’ t follow the arab press .
rawan and sara go often to such events but haven ’ t heard about the book fair .
sara said those things don ’ t interest her .
" i work and work and hardly make $ 250 -lrb- € 200 -rrb- , " she said .
" i can ’ t go to europe , anyhow . "
no time for luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arabic rappers , from right to left , dj charley shaby , 25 , richy shaby , 20 , wassim akar , 22 , and mahmoud shalaby , 20 simon khuan was reading poems he has already published .
mamlaka as-sarasir -lrb- cachroche kingdom -rrb- came out three years ago .
the 31-year-old said he had heard about a large book fair taking place every year in frankfurt , but not about the arab world being the guest of honor .
" we are not in a luxury period here , " he says , " so people in general are not interested in culture . "
he hopes that such an event will not be turned into a political stage .
" it should just be for the intellectual aspect , " he said .
" we can ’ t solve our problems this way .
you can ’ t cover a hole in the table with a table cloth .
if the arab world wants to carry a message , i ask what message could that be ? "
but bashar haidar , a philosophy professor who was having a drink at a bistro with a colleague , said he had heard great things about the frankfurt book fair , but nothing about this year ’ s focus .
" that sounds fantastic , " he said .
" we should book tickets and go , " he told his colleague .
mixed feelings the lebanese authors who are invited to the fair were not quite as enthusiastic .
" since early 2004 , everything i read was criticism , " says emily nasrallah , who has had three novels and one children 's book translated into german .
" i haven ’ t read anything positive .
there was this delay , which also delayed the translation of books before the book fair .
but this is something for the governments to answer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut ´ s skyline , libanon she said she doesn ’ t expect anything , " but i hope they will succeed , because we have a lot to show . "
she said she hoped this could be a push for arab literature .
" i am also very happy that it is happening in germany , because from my experience i feel they respect us very much , " she said .
" but it ’ s not only germany .
it is also the frankfurt book fair .
when i am asked by journalists here , whether i don ’ t think that the book is dead , i always tell them to go to frankfurt and see for themselves . "
iman humaidan will have her second novel translated into german just in time for the book fair .
she said she is excited to go .
" i am looking forward to it , " she said .
" i hear everybody around me saying it ’ s going to be a scandal because we have nothing to present .
of course , we have !
the problem is we are not proud of what we have . "
lost images image is another problem .
" they were lost , because they lost their image , " humaidan said .
" the great ideologies have died .
what ’ s left is fundamentalism and the old regimes .
people like us are marginalized .
my first reaction was to ask : how can we access this space between those two sides ? "
she said she thinks the book fair should be different from those events " when the west thinks of dialogue with the arab world as a dialogue with fundamentalists .

during the cold war their tiny village bordered one of the soviet union 's largest foreign airbases .
then came cargolifter , a company hoping to build commercial heavy-lift zeppelins on the 500 hectare base after the russians left .
that project failed in 2002 , but it left behind a colossal 107-meter high airship hangar subsidized by taxpayers .
until recently , the most exciting thing to do in the area was to take a canoe ride and enjoy some of the spreewald 's popular cucumbers .
but colin au , a singapore-based malaysian multi-millionaire , is aiming to change all that .
this december , au and his partners at the malaysian conglomerate tanjong plc will open a € 70-million -lrb- $ 86.8-million -rrb- tropical rainforest theme park on the former cargolifter grounds .
" this concept could work anywhere it is cold , but germans really love the sun , " au told dw-world , as he pointed out where the hangar 's unfinished concrete floor will be transformed into white sandy beaches and heated lagoons .
thousands of plants when complete , the 360-meter long silver structure will be refashioned into a unique venue for thousands of tropical plants and cruise ship-like entertainment .
the park , known as tropical islands , will not only be home to orchids and palm trees ; it will also have several types of " villages " from tropical cultures , including borneo , congo and the amazon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer simulation of the tropical island beach .
in the depths of winter , the air temperature in the park will be a balmy 25 degrees celsius and the water in the pools an even warmer 30 degrees .
a special foil on the south side of the dome - the world 's largest freestanding construction of its kind - will let in almost 100 percent of the sun 's rays .
" if people do n't use sunscreen in the summer they 'll definitely get sunburn , " said tropical islands spokeswoman vivian kreft .
if successful , the resort in brand will become the flagship of a chain of similar parks around the world .
but none would be built on such a mammoth scale as the dome in germany .
au and tanjong were able to snap it up for a measly € 17.5 million - a fraction of what it cost cargolifter - during insolvency proceedings last year .
enough visitors ?
despite the proclivity of germans to flee their own inclement weather , it 's still uncertain if the park can really attract over two million visitors a year as planned .
only last week , the space center , a comic-themed amusement park in the northern city of bremen , closed its doors after opening earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first trees arrive .
but au dismissed worries that tropical islands could run into similar trouble .
" our concept is really much closer to a resort than an amusement park , " he said .
" it really should be attractive to a broad range of people . "
the project certainly was attractive to the government of the depressed eastern german state of brandenburg , which was relieved to find investors with a viable concept for the cargolifter hall .
with unemployment in brandenburg near 20 percent , the park will create 500 desperately needed new jobs for the region .
it 's the poor economy , though , that could present the biggest risk to the project , since down-on-their-luck germans have become notoriously stingy in recent years .
the amount of disposable income of many eastern germans will be further cut next year when unpopular reforms reduce the benefits of long-term unemployed to the level of welfare payments .
original concept is key harmut mertens , an economist at bankgesellschaft berlin , admitted the region is going through some tough times , but he remained optimistic tropical islands could be a success .
" they seem to have a pretty original concept there , " mertens told dw-world .
" the problem with the space center in bremen was that they put a lot of emphasis on shopping .
that 's not the case with the tropics park . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cargolifter building the dome .
the locals from brand , however , are more cautious after seeing both the soviets and the zeppelin makers come and go .
" i 'm a little skeptical , " said carola seidenfeudel , who runs a snack shop not far from the dome .
she said her family sold drinks and food to cargolifter employees for years before the company went bankrupt .
only after construction started for tropical island this spring did they return to their familiar corner next to brand 's tiny railway station .

" your strategic decision you have to make - to change the situation in the whole region , including iraq , for the better .
and for the europeans it will be turkey , " fischer told guests at the american academy in berlin last week . berlin pledges to back ankara schröder 's government has moved beyond giving lip service to the notion of turkey 's eu candidacy , as was the case under the conservative government of helmut kohl , to making it one of the pillars of german foreign policy .
it threw its weight in earnest behind ankara 's bid at the eu 's summit in copenhagen in late 2002 , which was focused on enlargement . with france in tow , the government in berlin initiated the proposal that will in december see eu leaders decide on turkey 's future based on a european commission report this week about its progress toward democratic reforms . " if the european commission recommends opening accession talks , then germany will clearly support that , " schröder said sunday before presenting prime minister recep tayyip erdogan an award for his reform work so far . opposition calls for ' special relationship ' the german opposition has , meanwhile , raised the issue of human rights abuses and says turkey does not share the same " values " , ostensibly cultural and religious , as the union . " from a geographical point of view , i think that europe has to have borders so that its integrity is not endangered , " edmund stoiber , the former conservative candidate for chancellor , told afp last week . " this does n't rule out having ties through a partnership , " he added . economic opportunities for the german business community , turkey 's membership will bring economic opportunities to its biggest trading partner and , in the words of wholesale and foreign trade federation head anton boerner , a " growth and profit spiral " . about 30 percent of turkey 's trade with the eu is with germany .
however , for the conservatives , acutely aware of the massive cost of german reunification , the price is too high .
the brussels think-tank " friends of europe " has estimated that turkey 's integration will cost some 15 billion euros annually over three years .
germany would pay the most : 2.4 billion euros a year . " while integration would be good for turkey , it would be unmanageable for europe , in particular from a financial point of view because the costs of such an integration would be too high , " stoiber said . strengthening turkey 's ties to the west however heinz kramer , an expert on turkish affairs at the swp institute , told afp that a firm date for accession talks could be good all round . " a prospect of membership will help the turkish government consolidate its reform programme and will send a signal to the financial and economic markets that turkey is more strongly linked to the west , " he said . that aside , public opinion is not in ankara 's favour .
a recent survey found that 35 percent of people support turkey joining the bloc , while 57 are against . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish eu membership to cost up to € 28 billion per year reported on in several german newspapers , the study says that ankara 's joining the 25-nation union would be a " challenge with great opportunities for both sides . "
-lrb- october 1 , 2004 -rrb- waiting for eu many members of the turkish-german community are n't exactly sure what turkey 's membership in the eu would mean for them personally .

the park , known as tropical islands , will not only be home to orchids and palm trees ; it will also have several types of " villages " from tropical cultures , including borneo , congo and the amazon .

in the depths of winter , the air temperature in the park will be a balmy 25 degrees celsius and the water in the pools an even warmer 30 degrees .
a special foil on the south side of the dome - the world 's largest freestanding construction of its kind - will let in almost 100 percent of the sun 's rays .
" if people do n't use sunscreen in the summer they 'll definitely get sunburn , " said tropical islands spokeswoman vivian kreft .
if successful , the resort in brand will become the flagship of a chain of similar parks around the world .
but none would be built on such a mammoth scale as the dome in germany .
au and tanjong were able to snap it up for a measly € 17.5 million - a fraction of what it cost cargolifter - during insolvency proceedings last year .
enough visitors ?
despite the proclivity of germans to flee their own inclement weather , it 's still uncertain if the park can really attract over two million visitors a year as planned .
only last week , the space center , a comic-themed amusement park in the northern city of bremen , closed its doors after opening earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first trees arrive .
but au dismissed worries that tropical islands could run into similar trouble .
" our concept is really much closer to a resort than an amusement park , " he said .
" it really should be attractive to a broad range of people . "
the project certainly was attractive to the government of the depressed eastern german state of brandenburg , which was relieved to find investors with a viable concept for the cargolifter hall .
with unemployment in brandenburg near 20 percent , the park will create 500 desperately needed new jobs for the region .
it 's the poor economy , though , that could present the biggest risk to the project , since down-on-their-luck germans have become notoriously stingy in recent years .
the amount of disposable income of many eastern germans will be further cut next year when unpopular reforms reduce the benefits of long-term unemployed to the level of welfare payments .
original concept is key harmut mertens , an economist at bankgesellschaft berlin , admitted the region is going through some tough times , but he remained optimistic tropical islands could be a success .

during the cold war their tiny village bordered one of the soviet union 's largest foreign airbases .
then came cargolifter , a company hoping to build commercial heavy-lift zeppelins on the 500 hectare base after the russians left .
that project failed in 2002 , but it left behind a colossal 107-meter high airship hangar subsidized by taxpayers .
until recently , the most exciting thing to do in the area was to take a canoe ride and enjoy some of the spreewald 's popular cucumbers .
but colin au , a singapore-based malaysian multi-millionaire , is aiming to change all that .
this december , au and his partners at the malaysian conglomerate tanjong plc will open a € 70-million -lrb- $ 86.8-million -rrb- tropical rainforest theme park on the former cargolifter grounds .
" this concept could work anywhere it is cold , but germans really love the sun , " au told dw-world , as he pointed out where the hangar 's unfinished concrete floor will be transformed into white sandy beaches and heated lagoons .
thousands of plants when complete , the 360-meter long silver structure will be refashioned into a unique venue for thousands of tropical plants and cruise ship-like entertainment .

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the healing power of storytelling the new german translation of thousand and one nights -lrb- arabian nights -rrb- makes the oldest arabic version of this famed collection of oriental tales available for german readers for the first time . three hundred years ago , librarian antoine galland translated the story of " sindbad the sailor " for a noble woman .
he then heard of other stories , got his hands on a manuscript from syria and presented european readers with the first volume of " thousand and one nights " in 1704 .
the book 's popularity was like nothing ever seen before : overnight the stories took the west by storm , making hearts that shortly before had quaked in fear of the enemy from the east flutter in rapture for the enchanted orient .
literary triumph today the fabulous narratives even find favor with those more intellectual arabs who once dismissed the folktales as " pathetic prattle ; " only the eternally sanctimonious still take offence at the tales ' provocative sensuality .
galland had managed to uncover one of the world 's great literary treasures .
he translated the tales with a large measure of poetic freedom , in the style of his times , which probably only enhanced the work 's success .
there has since been no lack of alternative translations , including famous editions like that of enno littmann -lrb- 1921-1928 -rrb- .
but these have all been based on more recent manuscripts .
the original 15th-century fragment discovered by galland , which included 282 nights , is not only older , but also told in a particularly lively fashion , since , despite the authors ' efforts to stick to " correct " written arabic , colloquialisms keep breaking through – making for a different , more vernacular tone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stories of " thousand and one night " moves people from young to old in 1984 this original manuscript was published by muhsin mahdi .
and now , to mark the 300th anniversary of the first publication of the tales , arabic scholar claudia ott has produced a new translation - unlike galland keeping very close to the original text .
freed from the imposed patina of the european fairytale idiom , the " delectable " adventures of kings and beggars , slaves , demons and the " dead drunk " hunchback shine fresher than ever before .
ott effortlessly orchestrates the changes in register between the coarse tone of some of the spoken exchanges and the nicely turned phrases of the rhymed prose .
storytelling as last resort perhaps , more than the individual stories , it is the arrangement of the whole that is the stroke of genius , tying all the tales together : the fact that each story can act as a framework for further stories told within it , with the whole then subsumed under the wondrous tale of sheherazade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : never was the healing power of storytelling presented in a more beautiful way , like it is in the " arabian nights " the drama begins with the trauma of one man : sultan shahryar , a ruler in the island kingdom of india and china , discovers that his beloved wife is cheating on him every time he turns his back with a black slave .
when , on his flight from this horrendous scene , the wife and captive booty of a demon forces him to sleep with her in order to cuckold her hated demon husband , ifrit , he has had more than enough : shahryar decides from then on to kill each of his wives after their first night of lovemaking .
night after night .
in this brutal manner , the battle of the sexes culminates in a series of fatal one-night stands .
enter sheherazade , the daughter of the wazir .
this well-read and educated young woman has a plan : she will tell stories to save herself , the king , and the world .
she proceeds to tell tales just like every tv series does – so enthralling that , each night when the sun goes down , a cliffhanger will make the sultan desperate to hear what happens next -lrb- " and the jinni drew his sword to strike … " -rrb- , postponing her death until the beautiful storyteller is able to bear the sultan a child and thus change his mind about the wiles of womanhood . ludwig ammann , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de connecting the cultural dots dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.10.2004 -pipe- 11:00 utc eu report : press freedom problems in romania according to the bbc , the draft report on romania criticizes attempts to curb media freedom , as well as looking at the widespread corruption in the country .
the report emphasizes that economic pressure has been put on the press as well as noting cases of physical attacks against journalists .
the attacks have mainly concerned journalists with the local press – and the number of cases has risen recently , something which the report calls an alarming tendency .
the debate over the freedom of the romanian press has been fuelled by recent alleged attempts to influence the work of journalists in a number of independent romanian newspapers .
two big newspapers , evenime ntul zilei and romania libera , protested at alleged undue interference by their western owners in their editorial content .
both the swiss group ringier and the german owner waz , owners of the two dailies , have denied influencing editorial policy .
the report is due to be published on wednesday and will be a key document on romania 's readiness to join the eu in 2007 .

it was sweet revenge for bayern who surrendered their german title to bremen with a 3-1 loss at the olympic stadium last season .
bayern are starting to click into gear , building on their 4-0 champions league demolition of ajax in midweek , and leapfrogged bremen into third with the three points .
" we are up near the top of the table and back on the straight and narrow , " said bayern coach felix magath .
" we were fortunate to win but i think overall we deserved the three points . "
surprise package vfl wolfsburg still set the pace at the top following a 2-1 win over borussia monchengladbach .
vfb stuttgart are second one point behind wolfsburg after defeating arminia bielefeld 2-0 on sunday .
matthias sammer has yet to taste defeat in his ten games as stuttgart manager and his club are the only unbeaten team in the top-flight .
german international sebastian deisler was back in the bayern starting eleven after being ' rested ' for the past few matches and his corner was pivotal for the first goal .
in the 20th minute ballack rose highest to head home his fourth goal of the season from the corner kick .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sometimes makaay is so well marked it creates space for ballack , " explained magath .
" it is good to have two people who are so clinical in front of goal . "
croatian international ivan klasnic should have equalised for bremen on the half hour mark but somehow headed wide with the goal at his mercy .
" in the first half we lacked the bite that we demonstrated against valencia , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we could not convert our chances either . "
greece 's euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas , who scored the winner against valencia in midweek , replaced klasnic at the interval as coach schaaf revamped his front line . hosts bremen asserted more pressure but it was in vain as substitute schweinsteiger staked a claim for a place in the first team curling home a 75th minute shot that caught goalkeeper andreas reinke off guard .
the second goal proved important as miroslav klose reduced the deficit with a header in the 81st minute , his fourth goal in his last two bundesliga outings , but bayern held on .
bremen 's miserable afternoon was capped off when it was confirmed that german international frank fahrenhorst had broken his nose after ballack 's stray elbow forced him to leave the field after seven minutes .
leverkusen ends drought bayer leverkusen ended a five match winless streak with a 3-0 triumph over sv hamburg at the bayarena .
bildunterschrift : " i am delighted with the three points , " said bayer manager klaus augenthaler .
" the win is more significant than the victory against bayern because the team were at a low ebb . "
augenthaler claimed polish international jacek krzynowek should have a licence for his left foot and it was clear what the coach meant .
in the 10th minute krzynowek unleashed a 25 yard shot from his cannon left foot and the ball crashed into the roof of the net .
brazilian international juan -lrb- 73 -rrb- and bulgarian international dimitar berbatov -lrb- 86 -rrb- struck late on for leverkusen spoiling the return of hamburg chief klaus toppmoller , who guided bayer to the champions league final in 2002 .
borussia dortmund fans still pine for their first home win in the bundesliga following a 2-2 draw with fc nuremberg .
nuremberg scored twice in the 23rd and 25th minute to shock the 75,000 fans , but czech international jan koller salvaged a point with a brace -lrb- 28 , 45 -rrb- in a busy first half at the westfalen stadium .
in a league encounter on sunday , manager ralf rangnick enjoyed his first bundesliga match in charge of schalke 04 with a 3-2 triumph over local rivals vfl bochum .
schalke climbed an incredible nine places with the victory and are now in seventh after being in the relegation zone before the match .
a first half goal blitz did the damage with german international gerald asamoah -lrb- 10 -rrb- , levan kobiaschvili -lrb- 13 -rrb- and brazilian lincoln -lrb- 44 -rrb- all on target .
bochum pulled two goals back in a see-saw second half but could not find an equaliser against ten-man schalke who had goalscorer lincoln dismissed in the 80th minute for wasting time . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern turns up heat with win in bremen it was n't pretty but bayern munich claimed a victory over arch rivals werder bremen on saturday , moving up to third in the league with a 2-1 win .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 bringing the tropics to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the park will be housed in the world 's largest freestanding dome long famous for its tasty cucumbers , the spreewald region just south of berlin is about to become well-known for rather more exotic flora : asian investors are converting a zeppelin hangar into a tropical rainforest . the denizens of brand , a small community 60 kilometers outside of the german capital berlin , probably think they 've seen it all .
during the cold war their tiny village bordered one of the soviet union 's largest foreign airbases .
then came cargolifter , a company hoping to build commercial heavy-lift zeppelins on the 500 hectare base after the russians left .
that project failed in 2002 , but it left behind a colossal 107-meter high airship hangar subsidized by taxpayers .
until recently , the most exciting thing to do in the area was to take a canoe ride and enjoy some of the spreewald 's popular cucumbers .
but colin au , a singapore-based malaysian multi-millionaire , is aiming to change all that .
this december , au and his partners at the malaysian conglomerate tanjong plc will open a € 70-million -lrb- $ 86.8-million -rrb- tropical rainforest theme park on the former cargolifter grounds .
" this concept could work anywhere it is cold , but germans really love the sun , " au told dw-world , as he pointed out where the hangar 's unfinished concrete floor will be transformed into white sandy beaches and heated lagoons .
thousands of plants when complete , the 360-meter long silver structure will be refashioned into a unique venue for thousands of tropical plants and cruise ship-like entertainment .
the park , known as tropical islands , will not only be home to orchids and palm trees ; it will also have several types of " villages " from tropical cultures , including borneo , congo and the amazon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer simulation of the tropical island beach .
in the depths of winter , the air temperature in the park will be a balmy 25 degrees celsius and the water in the pools an even warmer 30 degrees .
a special foil on the south side of the dome - the world 's largest freestanding construction of its kind - will let in almost 100 percent of the sun 's rays .
" if people do n't use sunscreen in the summer they 'll definitely get sunburn , " said tropical islands spokeswoman vivian kreft .
if successful , the resort in brand will become the flagship of a chain of similar parks around the world .
but none would be built on such a mammoth scale as the dome in germany .
au and tanjong were able to snap it up for a measly € 17.5 million - a fraction of what it cost cargolifter - during insolvency proceedings last year .
enough visitors ?
despite the proclivity of germans to flee their own inclement weather , it 's still uncertain if the park can really attract over two million visitors a year as planned .
only last week , the space center , a comic-themed amusement park in the northern city of bremen , closed its doors after opening earlier this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first trees arrive .
but au dismissed worries that tropical islands could run into similar trouble .
" our concept is really much closer to a resort than an amusement park , " he said .
" it really should be attractive to a broad range of people . "
the project certainly was attractive to the government of the depressed eastern german state of brandenburg , which was relieved to find investors with a viable concept for the cargolifter hall .
with unemployment in brandenburg near 20 percent , the park will create 500 desperately needed new jobs for the region .
it 's the poor economy , though , that could present the biggest risk to the project , since down-on-their-luck germans have become notoriously stingy in recent years .
the amount of disposable income of many eastern germans will be further cut next year when unpopular reforms reduce the benefits of long-term unemployed to the level of welfare payments .
original concept is key harmut mertens , an economist at bankgesellschaft berlin , admitted the region is going through some tough times , but he remained optimistic tropical islands could be a success .
" they seem to have a pretty original concept there , " mertens told dw-world .
" the problem with the space center in bremen was that they put a lot of emphasis on shopping .
that 's not the case with the tropics park . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cargolifter building the dome .
the locals from brand , however , are more cautious after seeing both the soviets and the zeppelin makers come and go .
" i 'm a little skeptical , " said carola seidenfeudel , who runs a snack shop not far from the dome .
she said her family sold drinks and food to cargolifter employees for years before the company went bankrupt .
only after construction started for tropical island this spring did they return to their familiar corner next to brand 's tiny railway station .
" it 'll be great if it works , but we 've been burned before , " she said . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cargolifter goes way of hindenburg once a boutique project of nascent eastern german entrepreneurialism , airship developer cargolifter declares insolvency .

lebanese authors are worried , but also get their hopes up . beirut ’ s young cultural scene is thriving : during the last year , tens of galleries have opened in the rebuild saifi village close to the city center , new cafes and jazz bars popped up in the gentrified areas of east beirut , where djs play the newest sound from europe and young musicians rap in the lebanese dialect .
at an abandoned train station , some musicians were recently organizing a techno party .
on this rave , ronja was handing out flyers inviting to a poetry slam at a private culture center .
" book fair in frankfurt ?
never heard of it , " she said .
she grew up in sweden and can ’ t read arabic well .
thus , she doesn ’ t follow the arab press .
rawan and sara go often to such events but haven ’ t heard about the book fair .
sara said those things don ’ t interest her .

the 31-year-old said he had heard about a large book fair taking place every year in frankfurt , but not about the arab world being the guest of honor .
" we are not in a luxury period here , " he says , " so people in general are not interested in culture . "
he hopes that such an event will not be turned into a political stage .
" it should just be for the intellectual aspect , " he said .
" we can ’ t solve our problems this way .

all of poland 's major political parties supported the war and 2,500 troops were sent to help with the war effort .
those soldiers now lead an 8,000 strong multinational force , which controls south-central iraq .
but poland 's defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski was quoted in monday 's issue of the polish daily gazeta wyborcza as saying that poland would significantly reduce its commitment to the region .
according to the report , poland will reduce its forces in iraq by 40 percent - from 2,500 to 1,500 - by the end of 2005 .
government under pressure the deadline to pull out troops will coincide with the expiration of the united nations security council resolution 1546 at the end of 2005 , which authorized the upcoming elections .
" that does not mean , however , that if a stabilization mission was continued , polish troops would be completely pulled out from iraq , " said szmajdzinkski .
" a group of officers at the headquarters , training centers , maybe a group of observers could still remain . "
the decision to reduce poland 's deployment in iraq came at the request of the current left-wing government 's junior coalition party , the labor union -lrb- up -rrb- .
polish prime minister marek belka 's government faces a parliamentary vote of confidence later this month , and general parliamentary elections are due to be held in mid-2005 .
both will take place amid a growing backdrop of disenchantment with american foreign policy .
america 's image tarnished poland has long been one of the united states ' staunchest supporters .
largely due to the legacy of communism , even the liberals among poland 's political elite shared us policy-makers ' view that tyranny should be met with force .
but as the situation in iraq degenerated over the past year , poles - both the media and the average citizen alike - have started to question the price poland pays for its unwavering support for its unwavering support of the united states .
indeed , 17 poles have died in iraq , but the political costs have also been high .
by allying itself with the us in the hopes of becoming a leader of so-called " new europe , " poland entered the eu on may 1st of this year at odds with germany and france .
and poles are questioning whether the current us administration truly intends to make good on its promise to deliver a credible democracy in iraq , the basis upon which they supported the invasion .
what 's more , the united states has not delivered many of the rewards promised to poland in exchange for its support , including lucrative reconstruction contracts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kwasniewski , pictured with us president bush , is getting tough with washington .
all of the above has led to a growing backlash .
earlier this month , even poland 's president aleksander kwasniewski offered his own voice to the growing chorus of dissent .
he told the new york times that the united states needed to become " more flexible , more gracious , " and that the bush administration should abandon its " neoconservative divide-and-rule policy . "
in june , spain withdrew its 1,300 troops after the socialists replaced the conservative government of jose maria aznar in national elections .
the new spanish prime minister , jose luis zapatero , has called the war iraq illegal under international law . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lech walesa : germany and france share blame for iraq war the former polish president and nobel peace prize winner says germany and france are partially to blame for the iraq war , because they failed to convince other eu members of their case against invasion .

but researchers at the renowned allensbach opinion research institute have published a study which reaches very different conclusions . to rita barwitzki , a 26-year-old from leipzig , the fall of the berlin wall almost 15 years ago could n't have come at a better time . " i had to shed part of my identity , " she explained , " but i could n't wait to discover new things . " " i did n't want to get stuck in the old ways - after all a new system had arrived that gave me more freedom and independence . " rita believes she benefited from having lived both behind the iron curtain and in reunited germany .
she has childhood memories of life under honecker , but it was the west that shaped her life as a teenager . her self-confidence is typical of the under-30s in eastern germany , who are more enterprising than the older generation , and many of their contemporaries in the west . empty prejudice when the ifd-allensbach questioned a sample of 2000 eastern germans , it was the young people who made the best impression . " we 'd always heard that the younger east germans felt they had no future , that they were lacking in motivation , " explained project manager thomas petersen .
" there were no opportunities , and the more capable ones left for the west - those are some of the clichés . " they proved to be empty prejudices .
" there 's a new generation emerging in our statistics that 's quite different , " observed petersen .
" they do n't just sit around feeling sorry for themselves , they take the initiative and they 're brimming with optimism . " shaping their own destiny 52 percent of young eastern germans say they are in control of their lives , while only a third of older eastern germans can match their self-belief .
in western germany , 45 percent believe that destiny is something you shape yourself , regardless of external circumstances . how do the researchers explain this ?
with the east german dictatorship an increasingly distant memory , a new generation has grown up that does not share the values of its parents .
a similar phenomenon was observed in post-war west germany and in the early 1990s in spain , 15 years after the death of franco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1973 , east berlin hosted the 10th world youth games .
" this younger generation hardly knew east germany , pointed out thomas petersen .
" they grew up in freedom and have been exposed to a world quite different to that in which their parents lived . " " there were differences in language , how one behaves in public and in private , what one can say , what one ca n't say , even how one keeps an eye on the neighbours .
these things were very different in a dictatorship . " the advantages of adversity thomas petersen also points out that eastern germans growing up in cities and towns with a 20 percent unemployment rate have experienced hardship from an early age . almost everybody in eastern germany knows someone who has lost their job and who 's suffering from financial or psychological problems . it 's a different story in western germany .

but researchers at the renowned allensbach opinion research institute have published a study which reaches very different conclusions . to rita barwitzki , a 26-year-old from leipzig , the fall of the berlin wall almost 15 years ago could n't have come at a better time . " i had to shed part of my identity , " she explained , " but i could n't wait to discover new things . " " i did n't want to get stuck in the old ways - after all a new system had arrived that gave me more freedom and independence . " rita believes she benefited from having lived both behind the iron curtain and in reunited germany .
she has childhood memories of life under honecker , but it was the west that shaped her life as a teenager . her self-confidence is typical of the under-30s in eastern germany , who are more enterprising than the older generation , and many of their contemporaries in the west . empty prejudice when the ifd-allensbach questioned a sample of 2000 eastern germans , it was the young people who made the best impression . " we 'd always heard that the younger east germans felt they had no future , that they were lacking in motivation , " explained project manager thomas petersen .
" there were no opportunities , and the more capable ones left for the west - those are some of the clichés . " they proved to be empty prejudices .
" there 's a new generation emerging in our statistics that 's quite different , " observed petersen .
" they do n't just sit around feeling sorry for themselves , they take the initiative and they 're brimming with optimism . " shaping their own destiny 52 percent of young eastern germans say they are in control of their lives , while only a third of older eastern germans can match their self-belief .
in western germany , 45 percent believe that destiny is something you shape yourself , regardless of external circumstances . how do the researchers explain this ?
with the east german dictatorship an increasingly distant memory , a new generation has grown up that does not share the values of its parents .
a similar phenomenon was observed in post-war west germany and in the early 1990s in spain , 15 years after the death of franco . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1973 , east berlin hosted the 10th world youth games .
" this younger generation hardly knew east germany , pointed out thomas petersen .
" they grew up in freedom and have been exposed to a world quite different to that in which their parents lived . " " there were differences in language , how one behaves in public and in private , what one can say , what one ca n't say , even how one keeps an eye on the neighbours .
these things were very different in a dictatorship . " the advantages of adversity thomas petersen also points out that eastern germans growing up in cities and towns with a 20 percent unemployment rate have experienced hardship from an early age . almost everybody in eastern germany knows someone who has lost their job and who 's suffering from financial or psychological problems . it 's a different story in western germany .
but in the long-term , petersen believes , the energy and optimism of young eastern germans could start to spill over into the west . christiane hoffman -lrb- dw staff -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fewer germans moving from east to west the wave of migration from eastern to western germany is starting to subside .

the move could reflect some poles ' increasing dissatisfaction with american policies . in the run-up to the us-led invasion of iraq , poland was one of america 's staunchest supporters .
all of poland 's major political parties supported the war and 2,500 troops were sent to help with the war effort .
those soldiers now lead an 8,000 strong multinational force , which controls south-central iraq .
but poland 's defense minister jerzy szmajdzinski was quoted in monday 's issue of the polish daily gazeta wyborcza as saying that poland would significantly reduce its commitment to the region .
according to the report , poland will reduce its forces in iraq by 40 percent - from 2,500 to 1,500 - by the end of 2005 .
government under pressure the deadline to pull out troops will coincide with the expiration of the united nations security council resolution 1546 at the end of 2005 , which authorized the upcoming elections .
" that does not mean , however , that if a stabilization mission was continued , polish troops would be completely pulled out from iraq , " said szmajdzinkski .
" a group of officers at the headquarters , training centers , maybe a group of observers could still remain . "
the decision to reduce poland 's deployment in iraq came at the request of the current left-wing government 's junior coalition party , the labor union -lrb- up -rrb- .
polish prime minister marek belka 's government faces a parliamentary vote of confidence later this month , and general parliamentary elections are due to be held in mid-2005 .
both will take place amid a growing backdrop of disenchantment with american foreign policy .
america 's image tarnished poland has long been one of the united states ' staunchest supporters .
largely due to the legacy of communism , even the liberals among poland 's political elite shared us policy-makers ' view that tyranny should be met with force .
but as the situation in iraq degenerated over the past year , poles - both the media and the average citizen alike - have started to question the price poland pays for its unwavering support for its unwavering support of the united states .
indeed , 17 poles have died in iraq , but the political costs have also been high .
by allying itself with the us in the hopes of becoming a leader of so-called " new europe , " poland entered the eu on may 1st of this year at odds with germany and france .
and poles are questioning whether the current us administration truly intends to make good on its promise to deliver a credible democracy in iraq , the basis upon which they supported the invasion .
what 's more , the united states has not delivered many of the rewards promised to poland in exchange for its support , including lucrative reconstruction contracts .

he told the new york times that the united states needed to become " more flexible , more gracious , " and that the bush administration should abandon its " neoconservative divide-and-rule policy . "

frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.10.2004 the unknown guest of honor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2004 frankfurt book fair 2004 focuses on the arab world in beirut 's cultural scene nobody seems to know about the book fair in frankfurt .
lebanese authors are worried , but also get their hopes up . beirut ’ s young cultural scene is thriving : during the last year , tens of galleries have opened in the rebuild saifi village close to the city center , new cafes and jazz bars popped up in the gentrified areas of east beirut , where djs play the newest sound from europe and young musicians rap in the lebanese dialect .
at an abandoned train station , some musicians were recently organizing a techno party .
on this rave , ronja was handing out flyers inviting to a poetry slam at a private culture center .
" book fair in frankfurt ?
never heard of it , " she said .
she grew up in sweden and can ’ t read arabic well .
thus , she doesn ’ t follow the arab press .
rawan and sara go often to such events but haven ’ t heard about the book fair .
sara said those things don ’ t interest her .
" i work and work and hardly make $ 250 -lrb- € 200 -rrb- , " she said .
" i can ’ t go to europe , anyhow . "
no time for luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arabic rappers , from right to left , dj charley shaby , 25 , richy shaby , 20 , wassim akar , 22 , and mahmoud shalaby , 20 simon khuan was reading poems he has already published .
mamlaka as-sarasir -lrb- cachroche kingdom -rrb- came out three years ago .
the 31-year-old said he had heard about a large book fair taking place every year in frankfurt , but not about the arab world being the guest of honor .
" we are not in a luxury period here , " he says , " so people in general are not interested in culture . "
he hopes that such an event will not be turned into a political stage .
" it should just be for the intellectual aspect , " he said .
" we can ’ t solve our problems this way .
you can ’ t cover a hole in the table with a table cloth .
if the arab world wants to carry a message , i ask what message could that be ? "
but bashar haidar , a philosophy professor who was having a drink at a bistro with a colleague , said he had heard great things about the frankfurt book fair , but nothing about this year ’ s focus .
" that sounds fantastic , " he said .
" we should book tickets and go , " he told his colleague .
mixed feelings the lebanese authors who are invited to the fair were not quite as enthusiastic .
" since early 2004 , everything i read was criticism , " says emily nasrallah , who has had three novels and one children 's book translated into german .
" i haven ’ t read anything positive .
there was this delay , which also delayed the translation of books before the book fair .
but this is something for the governments to answer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut ´ s skyline , libanon she said she doesn ’ t expect anything , " but i hope they will succeed , because we have a lot to show . "
she said she hoped this could be a push for arab literature .
" i am also very happy that it is happening in germany , because from my experience i feel they respect us very much , " she said .
" but it ’ s not only germany .
it is also the frankfurt book fair .
when i am asked by journalists here , whether i don ’ t think that the book is dead , i always tell them to go to frankfurt and see for themselves . "
iman humaidan will have her second novel translated into german just in time for the book fair .
she said she is excited to go .
" i am looking forward to it , " she said .
" i hear everybody around me saying it ’ s going to be a scandal because we have nothing to present .
of course , we have !
the problem is we are not proud of what we have . "
lost images image is another problem .
" they were lost , because they lost their image , " humaidan said .
" the great ideologies have died .
what ’ s left is fundamentalism and the old regimes .
people like us are marginalized .
my first reaction was to ask : how can we access this space between those two sides ? "
she said she thinks the book fair should be different from those events " when the west thinks of dialogue with the arab world as a dialogue with fundamentalists .
i have the same problems with fundamentalists as you have . " hannah wettig , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.10.2004 -pipe- 11:00 utc eu report : press freedom problems in romania according to the bbc , the draft report on romania criticizes attempts to curb media freedom , as well as looking at the widespread corruption in the country .
the report emphasizes that economic pressure has been put on the press as well as noting cases of physical attacks against journalists .
the attacks have mainly concerned journalists with the local press – and the number of cases has risen recently , something which the report calls an alarming tendency .
the debate over the freedom of the romanian press has been fuelled by recent alleged attempts to influence the work of journalists in a number of independent romanian newspapers .
two big newspapers , evenime ntul zilei and romania libera , protested at alleged undue interference by their western owners in their editorial content .
both the swiss group ringier and the german owner waz , owners of the two dailies , have denied influencing editorial policy .
the report is due to be published on wednesday and will be a key document on romania 's readiness to join the eu in 2007 .

polish prime minister marek belka 's government faces a parliamentary vote of confidence later this month , and general parliamentary elections are due to be held in mid-2005 .
both will take place amid a growing backdrop of disenchantment with american foreign policy .
america 's image tarnished poland has long been one of the united states ' staunchest supporters .
largely due to the legacy of communism , even the liberals among poland 's political elite shared us policy-makers ' view that tyranny should be met with force .
but as the situation in iraq degenerated over the past year , poles - both the media and the average citizen alike - have started to question the price poland pays for its unwavering support for its unwavering support of the united states .
indeed , 17 poles have died in iraq , but the political costs have also been high .
by allying itself with the us in the hopes of becoming a leader of so-called " new europe , " poland entered the eu on may 1st of this year at odds with germany and france .
and poles are questioning whether the current us administration truly intends to make good on its promise to deliver a credible democracy in iraq , the basis upon which they supported the invasion .
what 's more , the united states has not delivered many of the rewards promised to poland in exchange for its support , including lucrative reconstruction contracts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kwasniewski , pictured with us president bush , is getting tough with washington .
all of the above has led to a growing backlash .
earlier this month , even poland 's president aleksander kwasniewski offered his own voice to the growing chorus of dissent .
he told the new york times that the united states needed to become " more flexible , more gracious , " and that the bush administration should abandon its " neoconservative divide-and-rule policy . "
in june , spain withdrew its 1,300 troops after the socialists replaced the conservative government of jose maria aznar in national elections .
the new spanish prime minister , jose luis zapatero , has called the war iraq illegal under international law . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lech walesa : germany and france share blame for iraq war the former polish president and nobel peace prize winner says germany and france are partially to blame for the iraq war , because they failed to convince other eu members of their case against invasion .

built between the mid-fifties and the 1990s , many of them are coming to the end of their natural life .
by the year 2030 all but one of them will be de-commissioned .
but , it looks as though we may need them after all , as our own stocks of north sea oil and gas run out .
this morning , breakfast asks whether britain is about to go nuclear again .
mike sergeant reported from sizewell , where there are two nuclear power plans .
what you told breakfast " it would take about 7,500 wind turbines to generate as much electricity as sizewell b ..
the only answer to carbon-free generation is nuclear . "
bruce gawler we 'll debate the issues with former labour cabinet minister brian wilson - and stephen tindale from greenpeace .
we also want to hear what you think : natural resources the need to find an alternative to nuclear power grows year by year as natural resources - gas , oil , and the tiny proportion of coal that is still used as an energy source in the uk - continue to be used .
developments in nuclear power started in the mid 1950s and its use to create electricity grew until at its height , about a quarter of the uk 's power was nuclear generated .
by 2023 , this will be cut to only 4 % as more power stations come to the end of their working life and start to pose a serious risk to safety .
although the nuclear power stations are generally cleaner than coal fired stations , the process of mining the uranium needed for the nuclear process is n't .
some countries - notably finland have built a new nuclear plant to help reduce its greenhouse gas emissions .
kyoto in 1997 , britain signed up to the kyoto agreement in japan which in theory legally binds industrialised countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions .
the agreement descended in farce when the united states pulled out ; president george w bush said he would never sign it .
you can read more about kyoto from the link at the right of this page .
solution ?
environmental campaigners argue that nuclear power could be replaced by renewable sources - wind , water and solar power which wo n't run out .
the problem with wind and water powered turbines is that they hundreds of them are needed to generate a comparable amount of electricity from a nuclear source .
in the meantime , the argument will rage on about whether nuclear facilities are the way forward and whether their building programme should be re-started .
campaigners against this say in the 21st century , there is another serious risk to nuclear power , and that is from terrorism .
the need to find a solution to the uk 's power needs grows by the year , and each year will see the need become more pressing .
should britain build more nuclear power stations ?
if not , how would you keep the nation 's power supplies running ?

a conference in edinburgh on monday will hear that inmates who keep up family ties are up to six times less likely to reoffend .
scotland 's prisons now run a range of programmes to help those behind bars keep contact with their families .
but delegates at the conference , organised by families outside , will be told that the support is too patchy .
the gathering , which will attract experts from throughout the uk , will hear from the family members of prisoners .
they are expected to say that the experience of having a loved one locked up is like being in a " prison with no bars " . "

" the benefits of family life are widely accepted - this is no less true for prisoners than for anyone else . "
the conference will be addressed by a range of speakers describing projects and approaches which can provide families with the support , information and involvement they need to play a part in their relatives ' rehabilitation .
paying the cost there will also be a keynote speech from justice minister cathy jamieson .
the chief inspector of prisons , dr andrew mclellan , will chair the conference at the roxburgh hotel in the capital .
he said : " the room for visits is such an important room in a prison - most prisoners would say the most important room .
" good family relationships will keep prisoners out of trouble in the future - the cost of breakdown in family relationships will be paid for years to come . "
scotland continues to have a big problem with reoffending .
the latest statistics showed that two thirds of people being sentenced have a previous conviction .

the freedom of information -lrb- scotland -rrb- act -lrb- foi -rrb- will allow the public to see a range of facts held by bodies such as councils , the police and health boards .
the poll of 1,009 people - ordered by scotland 's information chief - found only 32 % knew what the act was for .
two thirds did not know it referred to general data and not personal facts .
the right to see information which is held on an individual is already enshrined in the data protection act .
poll findings 30 % had heard of the act 14 % thought they had heard of it 32 % said it referred to general information 12 % said they were very or quite likely to use it 79 % said bodies would be more open 57 % said there would be greater confidence in decisions of bodies 70 % were concerned that bodies could get around the law the foi scotland act comes into effect next january .
it will allow the public to see policy papers , statistics and financial information belonging to organisations such as scottish water , the scottish executive , the scottish parliament and education institutions .
public bodies will be allowed to charge up to 10 % of retrieval costs between £ 100 and £ 600 .
if the cost is likely to be above this upper limit , the authority is not obliged to provide the information .
information can also be withheld in other circumstances , for example , due to national security or defence requirements , criminal investigations or where the release is outlawed by other legislation .
refusals of information can ultimately be appealed to the scottish information commissioner , kevin dunion , who is responsible for promoting and enforcing the new rights and can force release of documents .
kevin dunion is scotland 's information commissioner he said : " our research shows that most people see freedom of information as being useful to them and good for society , but they are confused about what they can expect from the new legislation .
" people will only feel confident about requiring authorities to release information which should be public knowledge if they are sure about their new rights .
" my job is as much about promoting the new freedom of information act as enforcing it , and i will be launching a major promotional campaign in january 2005 to ensure that public awareness improves . "
a spokesman for the scottish executive said : " the foi act is an executive initiative aimed at making public bodies more open and accountable .

at present , the government in beijing fixes the yuan against the us dollar .
the us , among other states , says the rate at which it is fixed is too low , giving chinese companies unfair trading advantages .
but in washington , chinese officials rebuffed suggestions of an early shift to letting the financial markets set the rate .
" we have already said time and again we are moving toward a more market-based , supply-and-demand based , flexible exchange rate , " the chinese central bank 's deputy governor , li ruogu , said .
" how long it takes , i do n't know , " he told a group of global bankers gathered for the annual meetings of the international monetary fund and world bank .
" because china has an 8,000 year history , a decade is truly a short period , " he joked .
" i 've been asked numerous times , ' what is the time frame ? ' - i tell them , ' no time frame ' . "
the yuan is currently set at 8.28 to the dollar .
banking reforms the g7 group of nations has also been calling on china to adopt a more flexible currency system .
however , during their first ever get-together with g7 nations in washington over the weekend , chinese officials said they would not rush currency reforms .
in the past , the chinese said changes will be difficult until the country puts in place a number of reforms to its banking system .

by stephen robb bbc news online while millions of britons are using the internet to research their ancestors , bbc news online asks whether the tradition of simply passing stories down from generation to generation is dying out .
are families no longer talking ?
interest in family history is booming , according to mark pearsall , family history specialist at the national archives .
" it 's growing all the time , mainly down to the fact that it 's so much easier now to undertake research , " he said .
" there are more and more resources becoming available online .
in the old days , you would have had to go into a record office and spend hours ploughing through old records or microfilms of them .
" now you can actually start at home sitting at your computer . "
online records census records , births , deaths , marriages , military service records and wills can all be researched online .
it is estimated that more than four million britons investigate their family history every year .
in 2002 when the national archives , then the public record office , published the 1901 census online , the website was unable to cope with 30 million hits a day and had to be shut down for seven months .
family tales which used to be passed down through the generations are being lost vanessa green founder , family tales ' bringing the past to life ' but a survey by family tales , a company producing personalised family history books , found that almost eight out of 10 people wished that when grandparents and great-grandparents had been alive they had asked them more about their family history .
almost two-thirds , of 610 people polled by family tales , did not know the names of their great-grandparents or what they had done for a living .
family tales founder vanessa green said : " the combination of people choosing to start families later on in life , and the fact that more and more people with children are living in different parts of the country to their immediate family , means that family tales which used to be passed down through the generations are being lost . "
communication problem maggie loughran , of the federation of family history societies , believes families nowadays spend little time " sitting around and talking , which is when the family stories tend to come out " .
dr patricia spungen , founder of parenting website raising kids , supports this view of 21st century family life .
the stories and the lives that people are engaging with are albert square and coronation street dr patricia spungen founder , raising kids " these days both parents and children have increasing demands on their time , " she said .
" at home , children spend more time alone , with their own tvs , computers and music systems .
" eating together is often the only opportunity for the family to talk , share experiences , laugh and have ' family time ' . "
but a raising kids study published last month found that one in five families eats together less than once a week , with 75 % of families watching television while dining .
" the stories and the lives that people are engaging with are albert square and coronation street , " dr spungen said .
life stories paradoxically , as british families ' interest in hearing about their own past has apparently diminished , the recording of ordinary people 's stories as historical evidence has gained popularity .
it is someone 's life story in their own words , so it is something that is kind of raw and is n't very often seen in historical source material bre stitt national life story collection in 1987 , the national life story collection -lrb- nlsc -rrb- was established to support the oral history section of the british library and take recordings from a cross-section of british people .
to mark the millennium , the british library and bbc collected around 6,000 interviews in the largest-ever oral history project .
" maybe five years ago , a lot of people did n't know what oral history was , " said the nlsc 's bre stitt .
" it now seems to be a really vibrant area - there are lots of local groups around the country .
i think it is more highly regarded now than it perhaps was five years ago .
" we get a lot of people using it as primary source material .
it is someone 's life story in their own words , so it is something that is kind of raw and is n't very often seen in historical source material . "
needing verification ms loughran maintains that personal stories are the ideal starting point for researching family history .
she said : " i try to encourage children to actually sit down with the oldies in the family and get them to write down everything they remember .

by stephen robb bbc news online while millions of britons are using the internet to research their ancestors , bbc news online asks whether the tradition of simply passing stories down from generation to generation is dying out .
are families no longer talking ?
interest in family history is booming , according to mark pearsall , family history specialist at the national archives .
" it 's growing all the time , mainly down to the fact that it 's so much easier now to undertake research , " he said .
" there are more and more resources becoming available online .
in the old days , you would have had to go into a record office and spend hours ploughing through old records or microfilms of them .
" now you can actually start at home sitting at your computer . "
online records census records , births , deaths , marriages , military service records and wills can all be researched online .
it is estimated that more than four million britons investigate their family history every year .
in 2002 when the national archives , then the public record office , published the 1901 census online , the website was unable to cope with 30 million hits a day and had to be shut down for seven months .
family tales which used to be passed down through the generations are being lost vanessa green founder , family tales ' bringing the past to life ' but a survey by family tales , a company producing personalised family history books , found that almost eight out of 10 people wished that when grandparents and great-grandparents had been alive they had asked them more about their family history .
almost two-thirds , of 610 people polled by family tales , did not know the names of their great-grandparents or what they had done for a living .
family tales founder vanessa green said : " the combination of people choosing to start families later on in life , and the fact that more and more people with children are living in different parts of the country to their immediate family , means that family tales which used to be passed down through the generations are being lost . "
communication problem maggie loughran , of the federation of family history societies , believes families nowadays spend little time " sitting around and talking , which is when the family stories tend to come out " .
dr patricia spungen , founder of parenting website raising kids , supports this view of 21st century family life .
the stories and the lives that people are engaging with are albert square and coronation street dr patricia spungen founder , raising kids " these days both parents and children have increasing demands on their time , " she said .
" at home , children spend more time alone , with their own tvs , computers and music systems .
" eating together is often the only opportunity for the family to talk , share experiences , laugh and have ' family time ' . "
but a raising kids study published last month found that one in five families eats together less than once a week , with 75 % of families watching television while dining .
" the stories and the lives that people are engaging with are albert square and coronation street , " dr spungen said .
life stories paradoxically , as british families ' interest in hearing about their own past has apparently diminished , the recording of ordinary people 's stories as historical evidence has gained popularity .
it is someone 's life story in their own words , so it is something that is kind of raw and is n't very often seen in historical source material bre stitt national life story collection in 1987 , the national life story collection -lrb- nlsc -rrb- was established to support the oral history section of the british library and take recordings from a cross-section of british people .
to mark the millennium , the british library and bbc collected around 6,000 interviews in the largest-ever oral history project .
" maybe five years ago , a lot of people did n't know what oral history was , " said the nlsc 's bre stitt .
" it now seems to be a really vibrant area - there are lots of local groups around the country .
i think it is more highly regarded now than it perhaps was five years ago .
" we get a lot of people using it as primary source material .
it is someone 's life story in their own words , so it is something that is kind of raw and is n't very often seen in historical source material . "
needing verification ms loughran maintains that personal stories are the ideal starting point for researching family history .
she said : " i try to encourage children to actually sit down with the oldies in the family and get them to write down everything they remember .
people have said that things family members told them turned out to be wrong , and were ' red herrings ' that hindered their research mark pearsall family history specialist , national archives " even if nobody does anything with it for 20 or 30 years , it does n't matter - you can go back to it and you have got your basic facts .

by stephen robb bbc news online while millions of britons are using the internet to research their ancestors , bbc news online asks whether the tradition of simply passing stories down from generation to generation is dying out .
are families no longer talking ?
interest in family history is booming , according to mark pearsall , family history specialist at the national archives .
" it 's growing all the time , mainly down to the fact that it 's so much easier now to undertake research , " he said .
" there are more and more resources becoming available online .
in the old days , you would have had to go into a record office and spend hours ploughing through old records or microfilms of them .
" now you can actually start at home sitting at your computer . "
online records census records , births , deaths , marriages , military service records and wills can all be researched online .
it is estimated that more than four million britons investigate their family history every year .
in 2002 when the national archives , then the public record office , published the 1901 census online , the website was unable to cope with 30 million hits a day and had to be shut down for seven months .
family tales which used to be passed down through the generations are being lost vanessa green founder , family tales ' bringing the past to life ' but a survey by family tales , a company producing personalised family history books , found that almost eight out of 10 people wished that when grandparents and great-grandparents had been alive they had asked them more about their family history .
almost two-thirds , of 610 people polled by family tales , did not know the names of their great-grandparents or what they had done for a living .
family tales founder vanessa green said : " the combination of people choosing to start families later on in life , and the fact that more and more people with children are living in different parts of the country to their immediate family , means that family tales which used to be passed down through the generations are being lost . "
communication problem maggie loughran , of the federation of family history societies , believes families nowadays spend little time " sitting around and talking , which is when the family stories tend to come out " .
dr patricia spungen , founder of parenting website raising kids , supports this view of 21st century family life .
the stories and the lives that people are engaging with are albert square and coronation street dr patricia spungen founder , raising kids " these days both parents and children have increasing demands on their time , " she said .
" at home , children spend more time alone , with their own tvs , computers and music systems .
" eating together is often the only opportunity for the family to talk , share experiences , laugh and have ' family time ' . "
but a raising kids study published last month found that one in five families eats together less than once a week , with 75 % of families watching television while dining .
" the stories and the lives that people are engaging with are albert square and coronation street , " dr spungen said .
life stories paradoxically , as british families ' interest in hearing about their own past has apparently diminished , the recording of ordinary people 's stories as historical evidence has gained popularity .
it is someone 's life story in their own words , so it is something that is kind of raw and is n't very often seen in historical source material bre stitt national life story collection in 1987 , the national life story collection -lrb- nlsc -rrb- was established to support the oral history section of the british library and take recordings from a cross-section of british people .
to mark the millennium , the british library and bbc collected around 6,000 interviews in the largest-ever oral history project .
" maybe five years ago , a lot of people did n't know what oral history was , " said the nlsc 's bre stitt .
" it now seems to be a really vibrant area - there are lots of local groups around the country .
i think it is more highly regarded now than it perhaps was five years ago .
" we get a lot of people using it as primary source material .
it is someone 's life story in their own words , so it is something that is kind of raw and is n't very often seen in historical source material . "

the tribunal , which has been delayed by political infighting within cambodia , will be the first chance for the regime 's leaders to face justice .
it will include cambodians and foreigners , but still needs funding .
more than 1m cambodians died from starvation , disease or execution under the khmer rouge 's 1975-79 rule .
cambodia 's national assembly voted by 107-0 to ratify the tribunal , which has been under discussion for more than five years .
" what we have been waiting for so long has happened today , " prime minister hun sen said after the vote .
khmer rouge tribunal will try cases of genocide and crimes against humanity five judges -lrb- three cambodian -rrb- sit in trial court cases decided by majority maximum penalty is life imprisonment key figures facing trial the delays , and a 11-month political stalemate in cambodia , had raised fears that none of the khmer rouge 's ageing leaders would face justice .
its main architect , pol pot , died in 1998 .
former army chief , ta mok , and chief interrogator kaing khek iev , are the only two senior figures currently in detention awaiting trial .
other leaders , including head of state khieu samphan , foreign minister iang sary , and nuon chea , known as " brother number two " , are still free .
the un-backed tribunal will be made up of cambodian and foreign legal experts , with cambodians in the majority .
cambodian and foreign analysts have welcomed the tribunal 's establishment .
but there are worries that it will not be free of interference from the cambodian government , some of whose members fought for the khmer rouge .
there has also been criticism that , by focussing on a few high-profile leaders , the tribunal , will allow lower-ranking khmer rouge leaders who were also involved in serious crimes to escape justice .
funding for the tribunal has yet to be agreed .
cambodia 's foreign minister , hor namhong , last week urged the un to help find funds for half of the $ 50m tribunal .
so far , only australia has pledged to donate more than $ 2m .
it was not clear how quickly the tribunal would be able to begin work .
it still needs to be approved by the senate and king norodom sihanouk , although these are expected to be formalities .

it is part of the welsh assembly government 's keep well this winter campaign .
mr morgan , who turned 65 last week , had his injection at his local gp surgery in dinas powys in the vale of glamorgan .
' preventable ' " flu vaccination is an important safeguard against this dangerous disease , which can result in a person being admitted to hospital or even dying in the most severe cases among vulnerable people , " he said .

dr richard roberts , a consultant in communicable disease control in the national public health service said the uptake for the jab had been increasing .
" it 's getting better year by year , we had over 60 % last year of the over-65s and we 're hoping for more this year . "
dr roberts could not pinpoint the cost for the vaccine but said : " it is not a very expensive vaccine and it 's been around for years . "
he said patients could get information from leaflets placed in gps ' surgeries and said : " doctors also approach their elderly patients and those in the younger age groups who are at risk . "
dr ruth hall , chief medical officer for wales , said : " flu can make you very poorly indeed and lead to serious complications , such as bronchitis and pneumonia , which may be fatal .
" fortunately , flu is largely preventable through routine vaccination .
all those who are eligible should book in for their flu jab before the winter gets underway . "

chronicles focuses on the years when dylan emerged as a young protest singer and went on to become the icon of the peace-and-love generation .
it also covers the turning point when , at the height of his worldwide acclaim , he was hurt in a motorcycle accident and then shunned the limelight to start a family in rural seclusion .
the book is keenly anticipated by fans because it marks the ageing dylan 's first detailed written assessment of his own mythical life and career .
one of rock 's most reticent figures , he has been the subject of many biographies and academic studies but has until now declined to give his own account of his rise from midwest obscurity to global superstardom .
like a rolling stone born robert allen zimmerman on 24 may 1941 in duluth , minnesota became the toast of new york 's early 1960s folk-protest movement returned from family seclusion with a string of critically-acclaimed albums in the mid-1970s it is hoped dylan 's writings will shed an authoritative new light on legendary episodes such as the 1965 newport folk festival at which he was roundly jeered for playing an electric rock set .
it will be interesting to see whether he will comment on the reputation he gained at the start of his career for fabricating details of his early years .
arriving in new york in 1961 , the middle-class jewish store owner 's son from duluth , minnesota , told his new associates stories that he had grown up with the circus , or been orphaned .
now aged 63 , his memoirs have been long awaited so-called dylanologists remain sceptical about whether the complete truth will finally emerge in chronicles , which is being published in three volumes .
derek barker , editor of the dylan fan magazine isis , said : " there are no gems that make me think he 's going to tell us something new .
" we would like to hear the full story from the man 's lips -lrb- but -rrb- he 's going to tell us what he wants to tell us . "
dylan 's later life after a patchy spell throughout the 1980s and 90s , he has emerged triumphant with some of his most well-received work aged 63 , he has recorded more than 40 albums and is still involved in his " never ending tour " mr barker said : " i think he 's doing it for his own benefit .
he 's trying to debunk the myth that 's built up around bob dylan over the years , although i do n't think he will .
" it 's a very unusual project for him to do .
he 's an extremely secretive person .
those who know bob dylan will be a little bit suspicious .
i do n't think it 's going to be a completely heartfelt " tell-all " autobiography .
" he has bent the truth right back from the beginning , and what is truth and what is myth has been blurred - even in his own mind - with the passing of time . "
in a rare interview to promote the book , dylan told the sunday telegraph he had never wanted to be spokesman for a generation .
fans are hoping dylan will reveal undocumented details about his past " not only did i not want it , but i did n't need it , " he told the paper .
" i could n't understand it either .
" none of us like to be defined by what other people think of us .
i was n't the toastmaster of any generation and that notion had to be pulled up by the roots . "
he also told how his live act in the 1980s had deteriorated to the point where " in reality i was just above a club act ... the whisky had gone out of the bottle " .
giles elliott , chart manager at the bookseller trade magazine , said the dylan book was expected to easily breach the 3,000 sales barrier - qualifying it as a success in hardback terms .
last year 's biggest music seller , the eminem anthology whatever you say i am , sold nearly 67,000 .
duncan thomson , books editor at amazon.co.uk , said there was significant interest in dylan 's recollections , and the book was high in its pre-orders chart .
the singer is one of rock music 's most private individuals " bob dylan has been notoriously shy over the years about giving interviews and revealing too much of himself and his life to the public .
" his fans are queuing up to hear what the great man has to say about his life , his career and the inspiration for his songs . "
sean penn is narrating an audio book version , while a separate book containing dylan lyrics from 1961 to 2001 is also due out on tuesday .
in may next year the bbc will air an arena documentary in which the singer talks to movie director martin scorsese in his first filmed interview for nearly 20 years .

arriving in new york in 1961 , the middle-class jewish store owner 's son from duluth , minnesota , told his new associates stories that he had grown up with the circus , or been orphaned .
so-called dylanologists remain sceptical about whether the complete truth will finally emerge in chronicles , which is being published in three volumes .
derek barker , editor of the dylan fan magazine isis , said : " there are no gems that make me think he 's going to tell us something new .
" we would like to hear the full story from the man 's lips -lrb- but -rrb- he 's going to tell us what he wants to tell us . "
dylan 's later life after a patchy spell throughout the 1980s and 90s , he has emerged triumphant with some of his most well-received work aged 63 , he has recorded more than 40 albums and is still involved in his " never ending tour " mr barker said : " i think he 's doing it for his own benefit .
he 's trying to debunk the myth that 's built up around bob dylan over the years , although i do n't think he will .
" it 's a very unusual project for him to do .
he 's an extremely secretive person .
those who know bob dylan will be a little bit suspicious .
i do n't think it 's going to be a completely heartfelt " tell-all " autobiography .
" he has bent the truth right back from the beginning , and what is truth and what is myth has been blurred - even in his own mind - with the passing of time . "
in a rare interview to promote the book , dylan told the sunday telegraph he had never wanted to be spokesman for a generation .
" not only did i not want it , but i did n't need it , " he told the paper .
" i could n't understand it either .
" none of us like to be defined by what other people think of us .
i was n't the toastmaster of any generation and that notion had to be pulled up by the roots . "
he also told how his live act in the 1980s had deteriorated to the point where " in reality i was just above a club act ... the whisky had gone out of the bottle " .
giles elliott , chart manager at the bookseller trade magazine , said the dylan book was expected to easily breach the 3,000 sales barrier - qualifying it as a success in hardback terms .
last year 's biggest music seller , the eminem anthology whatever you say i am , sold nearly 67,000 .
duncan thomson , books editor at amazon.co.uk , said there was significant interest in dylan 's recollections , and the book was high in its pre-orders chart .
" bob dylan has been notoriously shy over the years about giving interviews and revealing too much of himself and his life to the public .
" his fans are queuing up to hear what the great man has to say about his life , his career and the inspiration for his songs . "
sean penn is narrating an audio book version , while a separate book containing dylan lyrics from 1961 to 2001 is also due out on tuesday .
in may next year the bbc will air an arena documentary in which the singer talks to movie director martin scorsese in his first filmed interview for nearly 20 years .

the cds allow users to copy their music once for free onto a personal computer , but use the internet to charge a fee for subsequent copies of the same disc .
sony music entertainment said it would stop producing the cds because its message against illegal duplication has widely sunk in .
a spokesperson said only a small part of the population illegally copy cds .
restricted playback the copy protection technology was introduced two years ago by record companies who faced a sales slump and wanted to stop pirated cds reaching the black market .
it usually works by placing a layer of data on a cd that enables playback only on a home stereo or portable hi-fi device .
however , in january belgium-based consumer group test-achats said the technology also stopped fans playing the cds on some devices and making legitimate back-up copies .
the group called for emi , universal , sony and bmg to stop releasing copy-protected cds and to reimburse fans .
big-selling releases including shakira 's laundry service and radiohead 's hail to the thief were affected , test-achats said .
piracy slowdown in july the international federation of phonographic industries -lrb- ifpi -rrb- estimated that 35 % of all cds sold in the world were pirate copies .
the ratio of illegal to legal sales had increased from one in five in 2000 to one in three in 2003 .
the growth of pirate cds has slowed , however .
the number of pirate cds rose 4 % in 2003 , compared with a 14 % rise in the previous year .
sony recently started adapting its copy protection strategy due to the proliferation of mp3 computer files , used to store music in portable audio players such as apple 's ipod .
last month sony announced that its own portable audio players , which will soon go on sale in europe , will be able to use any mp3 files .
previously , sony 's players only handled mp3 files that were converted into the company 's own format .

it usually works by placing a layer of data on a cd that enables playback only on a home stereo or portable hi-fi device .

antur dwyryd llŷn failed to pay the wages of 68 employees last week and in may 40 were sacked because it had lost a number of contracts .
the agency was set up in 1988 to help establish and support local companies in an economically deprived region .
it is now believed to have substantial debts .
the agency , based in penrhyndeudraeth near porthmadog , receives most of its income from government sources and quangos .
it has been central to hundreds of small businesses in the area , giving money to 154 local companies in the financial year ending in april , and organising training .
but the agency has now left many people - its own staff among them - owed money .
one local company , carmel school of motoring outside caernarfon is owed nearly £ 4,000 for hgv tuition given to antur clients .
the debt is nearly 12 months old and the owner , steven flynn , has placed the matter in the hands of the county court .
" they have disappointed me because they are a public company , " said mr flynn .
" i have a small business .
losing £ 4,000 is a big blow . "
mr flynn says he is considering sending in bailiffs in an attempt to recover the debt .
he claims he signed a contract in may which meant he would receive money each month .
" but i 've only had one payment .
" you hear adverts on the radio on how to start you 're own business - but this is enough to break anybody 's heart , " he added .
nerys fullerlove a business lecturer at the university college of wales , aberystwyth was surprised to hear the agency was in financial trouble .
" antur dwyryd is like many other institutions - it offers advice and training to small businesses in wales and it 's under contract to the government usually .
" it can also apply for grants from europe and other places .
" it 's a shock because it 's in the public sector but it has to compete for contracts and if they lose a contract they can get into financial trouble . "
dafydd wyn jones , chief executive of antur dwyryd llŷn , declined to comment on sunday night but said a statement would be made on monday .
