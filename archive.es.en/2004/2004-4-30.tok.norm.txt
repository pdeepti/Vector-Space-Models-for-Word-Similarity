eu enlargement will bring about many changes .
for bargain hunters fond of cruising duty-free zones along the polish border , it will mean the end of an era .
tour operators reliant on the trade are bracing for the blow . duty-free zones offering liquor , cigarettes and luxury items tax-free sprang up in germany in the mid-1950s - mostly in airports , but also on ships travelling in international waters .
one such zone is on the oder river that separates germany and poland .
since 1998 , a small section of the water on the polish side has been duty-free , and a lucrative business has built up on-board ships travelling in the area .
such an excursion has become known as a " butterfahrt " - literally “ butter trips ” - because they started out as a way for people to get cheap butter .
last year over one million germans travelled to these tax-free waters .
but with poland 's entry into the european union on may 1 , the duty-free law will no longer be valid : germany 's " butterfahrt " industry seems doomed to melt away , leaving a puddle of unemployment , deserted ships and empty buses in its wake . free lunch and big savings on a chilly april morning in berlin , double-decker buses lined one of the main boulevards as far as the eye can see .
the passengers on the buses were destined for a " butterfahrt " on the oder .
currently a " butterfahrt " costs just a few euros , with the shipping companies paying subsidies of up to 50 percent to the bus companies that cart people their way .
" the ' butterfahrt ' is an excursion package of bus and ship travel , " anna wiese , marketing director for berlin-based holiday travels agency , told deutsche welle .
" our buses pick up guests in berlin and bring them to various ports on the oder , where they board the duty-free ships .
one tour also supplies lunch and a surprise gift to each guest . " in the buses , bargain hunters study the flyers announcing the latest sales awaiting them on-board the floating supermarkets .
brand-name liquor and cigarettes can be bought for a fraction of the price paid in german shops .
for example , a carton of philip morris cigarettes costs just € 8.50 -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- .
in germany , the same carton fetches up to € 36 . a culture of savings the incredible bargains make the " butterfahrt " irresistible , bus driver dieter draht said .
" some guests take the trip every day , just to buy duty-free cigarettes , whisky , and who knows what else , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on a recent " butter trip " boat on the oder river .
the " butterfahrt " has developed into nothing less than a tradition among berlin ’ s urban poor .
its popularity reflects the state of germany ’ s economy .
it has also become something of a social occasion , part of the rage for discount shopping that permeates germany . " good quality and cheap , " said one customer when asked why he had come along on the trip .
" all of us here are modest earners and people dependent on social welfare and unemployment money or retired . " get it while the goings good but starting in may , there will be no more subsidies for the bus companies or free lunches for the travelers .
the price of the trip will double and all goods bought on board will be taxed .
so in the final weeks of duty-free shopping , " butterfahrt " business has been booming . holiday travel said they were sending out twice as many buses a day , with customers cramming in as many cheap shopping trips as they could before the good times were over .
" last week we went three times , and this week we are going twice , " said one customer .
" we ’ ve got to take advantage of these last weeks as much as we can . " end of an era one of the regular guests was indignant about no longer being able to get around germany ’ s high tobacco tax .
" smokers are supporting the nation , " he said . the shipping industry is just as unhappy about the situation : hundreds of jobs will be lost after may 1 .
still , some hope to keep the " butterfahrt " alive by attracting a new clientele - one just as interested in the scenic bus and boat ride as in cheap booze and cigarettes . anna wiese from holiday travels pointed out that only time will tell .
" we will see a large chunk of our business fall away , but we will still continue to offer the ' butterfahrt ' excursions - but at a higher price , " she said .
" we must see what our guests are prepared to pay . "
goods on-board the ships will become more expensive , but they will still be cheaper than in germany , wiese added . leah mcdonnell -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe read dw-world 's eu expansion dossier .

as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers . it 's the time of the year when all hell breaks loose in berlin and neighborhoods like turkish-dominated kreuzberg become urban battle grounds , complete with burning cars , smashed shop windows and violent clashes between police and rampaging teenagers . may day rioting has become a tradition in berlin , harking back to may 1 , 1987 , when left-wing demonstrators first took to the streets to protest against what they called a " bourgeois " celebration of the 750th anniversary of the founding of berlin . since then , the rioting has returned to berlin with unfailing regularity each year , first in west berlin and then following german reunification in 1990 , in both halves of the united city . tougher , quicker action this year however , city authorities and police are clear they plan to put an end to the violence that mars the largely peaceful may day demonstrations and festive atmosphere of the street fairs and parties that dot berlin 's historic center near the brandenburg gate , the hip eastern neighborhood of prenzlauer berg as well as its western neighbor , the kreuzberg district . berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , whose administration has used a " soft glove " approach in the past , has said that the police will crack down on rioters this year . berlin 's interior minister erhart körting has announced that the police on saturday will take swifter and tougher action against vandals and rioters than last year and also keep a watch on small groups of rowdy teenagers in kreuzberg on may day eve to preempt any rioting . a strenuous week for the police may day will mark the culmination of a difficult week for berlin 's police , who have had to provide security for a series of high-profile events , starting with the two-day osce anti-semitism conference on april 28 and 29 .
the conference welcomed , among other dignitaries , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and israeli president moshe katsav .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police in berlin police reinforcements were called in from other german states to assist local police , taking the total count of police officers to around 15,000 this past week , turning downtown berlin into a virtual fortress . on friday night before may day , police will be kept busy as several hundred high-ranking officials from all across europe converge on berlin 's central gendarmen markt square to take part in ceremonies marking the expansion of the european union by ten new members . the night before may day is also celebrated in germany as walpurgisnacht , a pagan ritual to usher in the spring , but which is also used as an occasion by leftist young people in berlin to go on a violent , often drunken rampages in the prenzlauer berg district .
police cars usually begin parking outside the park by early evening . angry protests set to heighten demonstrations despite the heightened security measures and the heightened police presence - some 8,000 will be on the streets - officials admit that this year 's demonstrations are likely to take on an even angrier tone than usual . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 200,000 trade unionists plan to take part in traditional may day parades through the heart of the city to protest the federal government 's cuts in health care , social services and retirement pensions . " this will contribute to a greater emotional and political edge to the demonstrations , " interior minister körting told the daily berliner zeitung .
" it would be naïve to believe that these days will pass peacefully . " in addition , some 2,500 neo-nazis plan to hold a rally in eastern berlin , with leftist counter-demonstrators vowing to stop them , setting the scene for possible clashes . berlin police president dieter glietsch has confirmed that the police will be more visible on may day this year and will clamp down on rioters . " we 've had enough " though the prospect of violence looms large on saturday , organizers of the various street festivals and parades remain undeterred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burnt-out cars in kreuzberg silke fischer , organizer of the famous " myfest " food and music festival around the oranien street in kreuzberg told the berliner zeitung that residents had had enough of " their cars being set ablaze and it being called a revolution . " she added : " for years we 've been watching teenagers reduce an entire district to ashes .

as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers . it 's the time of the year when all hell breaks loose in berlin and neighborhoods like turkish-dominated kreuzberg become urban battle grounds , complete with burning cars , smashed shop windows and violent clashes between police and rampaging teenagers . may day rioting has become a tradition in berlin , harking back to may 1 , 1987 , when left-wing demonstrators first took to the streets to protest against what they called a " bourgeois " celebration of the 750th anniversary of the founding of berlin . since then , the rioting has returned to berlin with unfailing regularity each year , first in west berlin and then following german reunification in 1990 , in both halves of the united city . tougher , quicker action this year however , city authorities and police are clear they plan to put an end to the violence that mars the largely peaceful may day demonstrations and festive atmosphere of the street fairs and parties that dot berlin 's historic center near the brandenburg gate , the hip eastern neighborhood of prenzlauer berg as well as its western neighbor , the kreuzberg district . berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , whose administration has used a " soft glove " approach in the past , has said that the police will crack down on rioters this year . berlin 's interior minister erhart körting has announced that the police on saturday will take swifter and tougher action against vandals and rioters than last year and also keep a watch on small groups of rowdy teenagers in kreuzberg on may day eve to preempt any rioting . a strenuous week for the police may day will mark the culmination of a difficult week for berlin 's police , who have had to provide security for a series of high-profile events , starting with the two-day osce anti-semitism conference on april 28 and 29 .
the conference welcomed , among other dignitaries , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and israeli president moshe katsav .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police in berlin police reinforcements were called in from other german states to assist local police , taking the total count of police officers to around 15,000 this past week , turning downtown berlin into a virtual fortress . on friday night before may day , police will be kept busy as several hundred high-ranking officials from all across europe converge on berlin 's central gendarmen markt square to take part in ceremonies marking the expansion of the european union by ten new members . the night before may day is also celebrated in germany as walpurgisnacht , a pagan ritual to usher in the spring , but which is also used as an occasion by leftist young people in berlin to go on a violent , often drunken rampages in the prenzlauer berg district .
police cars usually begin parking outside the park by early evening . angry protests set to heighten demonstrations despite the heightened security measures and the heightened police presence - some 8,000 will be on the streets - officials admit that this year 's demonstrations are likely to take on an even angrier tone than usual . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 200,000 trade unionists plan to take part in traditional may day parades through the heart of the city to protest the federal government 's cuts in health care , social services and retirement pensions . " this will contribute to a greater emotional and political edge to the demonstrations , " interior minister körting told the daily berliner zeitung .
" it would be naïve to believe that these days will pass peacefully . " in addition , some 2,500 neo-nazis plan to hold a rally in eastern berlin , with leftist counter-demonstrators vowing to stop them , setting the scene for possible clashes . berlin police president dieter glietsch has confirmed that the police will be more visible on may day this year and will clamp down on rioters .

the historic enlargement of the bloc is being hailed as a chance to spread political stability and economic prosperity , but it will also bring a host of challenges . several years in the making , the expansion of the european union next month will mark the beginning of a new era for a continent long separated by conflict and ideology .
with the cold war now consigned to memory , a large swathe of formerly communist eastern europe - as well as the mediterranean islands of malta and cyprus - will join the prosperous west . poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia , estonia , latvia and lithuania have all waited 15 years after emerging from the shadow of the soviet union to finally be part of europe 's most exclusive club .
that means for the first time in modern history , more than 450 million europeans will be united in a single political entity stretching from the atlantic ocean to the baltic states ' eastern border with russia . " first and foremost this is a peace project , " günter verheugen , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , told german public broadcaster ard last week .
" it creates peace , stability and security in the european region . " many eu citizens - both old and new - likely share those noble sentiments .
but unfortunately for public officials in brussels and national capitals across the continent , as may 1 approaches , ever more europeans are also beginning to question what other effects eastward expansion of the bloc will have . large and unmanageable ? some are worried a union of 25 will become unwieldy , unmanageable and less transparent than it is now .
others , especially in countries bordering the new member states like germany and austria , fear they will lose their jobs as businesses move east in search of cheap labor and poorer easterners come west looking work .
though many concerns may be overblown , experts do agree that there are a number of daunting challenges awaiting the enlarged eu . " it 's certainly going to exacerbate how the eu tries to manage things , " heather grabbe , the deputy director at the centre for european reform in london , told dw-world .
having followed eu expansion for the better part of a decade , grabbe believes adding members to the table at brussels will force members to push for further reform of eu decision-making .
" there wo n't be institutional gridlock - in the end it will muddle through . " she said she expected a number of issues to arise after the new members had settled in , which could then be tackled by the eu .
" hopefully any shortcomings should provoke more reform , " grabbe said . integration delayed economically , the 10 new members have been integrating with western europe for over a decade . but some aspects of integration will be delayed - because countries on both sides of the former east-west divide want it that way .
most glaring will be the lack of new eu citizens ' ability to work legally in the old eu countries .
all of the western nations , with the exception of britain and ireland , will impose some sort of restrictions on their labor markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fearing germany will be overrun by unemployed poles , the government in berlin is likely to refuse them working privileges for a full seven years as allowed by eu treaties .
this has naturally incensed poland , which calls german concerns irrational . " there is no reason to expect there will be a mass inflow of poles to the german labor market .
but the german domestic situation does not facilitate a rational approach to this issue , " outgoing polish prime minister leszek miller said last month . poland , however , has its own reservations .
despite desperately needing foreign investment from western eu countries , warsaw has negotiated a 12-year ban on foreigners buying agricultural land .
poland fought hard for the restrictions because many poles are worried germans may be inclined to try and buy back land and real estate that they or their families once owned prior to be expelled from areas belonging to germany before world war ii . poland also showed that the new members wo n't shy away from blocking eu decision-making if it is in their interest when it last year led the campaign against the draft constitution for the bloc due to a dispute over voting rights .
warsaw has since dropped its hardliner stance on the matter , but only because its main ally , the conservative-led government of spain , was voted out of office in march . row over budget issues the constitution , along with the future funding of the eu , will be two of the top issues in brussels immediately following the accession of the 10 new countries .
fearing the poor east could increase the demand for aid in coming years , net contributor nations have already been arguing for months that the eu budget should be capped at one percent of each country 's gross national product . the european commission has dismissed such calls , arguing brussels would be expected to achieve more with less .
and those countries that have been the biggest beneficiaries of eu structural funds in past , in particular spain , greece and portugal , are unhappy aid will be diverted to the less fortunate new member states .
but some experts counter the eu does n't need more money , brussels just needs change its spending habits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas mauer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin singled out the often criticized the eu 's common agricultural policy , which subsidizes europe 's farmers with nearly half of the bloc 's total € 100-billion budget . " we have to ask ourselves what do we want to pay for ?
that agriculture takes up so much is longer responsible .
those funds could be put into research and development or other investments that could help all of europe , " mauer told dw-world . such disputes over money may resolve themselves if expansion brings real economic benefits to members both old and new as is expected .
according to some estimates , the new members ' gross domestic product could increase by 1.5 percent and some 300,000 new jobs will be created in the old countries . and as may 1 approaches , quibbling over the budget and other typical eu quarrels are sure to fade into the background as the leaders of the expanded union bask in the glow of the historic moment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.04.2004 what will change with eu expansion ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border controls will remain in eastern europe - at least for now .
though the 10 new eu states will become full members of the bloc and fully adopt community law , some exceptions will be applied - at least for interim periods .
here 's a list of the most important changes . border controls eu citizens will be able to move freely throughout the union .
they will , however , need a valid personal identity card or passport to cross into the new member states because they are not yet members of the schengen agreement , which eliminates border checks in many western european countries .
border controls will continue between western and eastern european countries .
the eu will determine at a later date when the border checks with the new member states should be lifted .
much of it will depend on the ability of the new member states to secure the eu 's exterior borders .
only after eu conditions in this area are met can the new member states be brought into the schengen agreement and border controls be suspended .
customs following eu expansion , the new member states will be integrated into the eu 's internal market .
controls and tariffs on all goods will be eliminated .
however , certain goods will still be banned from germany and other western european countries , including guns and narcotics .
transport of tobacco will also be limited , with mobile groups being set up to help stop the smuggling business .
controls will also be carried out for illegal goods at western european borders .
in the german states of saxony and thuringia alone , 404 officials have been assigned patrolling duties and will be working closely with the federal border guard .
labor market in principle , eu citizens in europe have the freedom to choose where they want to work .
however , with the exception of ireland and britain , most of the existing eu member states are taking advantage of an optional provision negotiated in the accession agreement that permits countries to require work permits for members of the new eu states during the first two years after enlargement .
-lrb- citizens of malta and cyprus , however , will have full work rights from may 1 . -rrb-
the work permit provision can be extended for up to seven years .
germany has said it intends to do , but a valid case for extending the opt-out clause must be presented to the european commission every two years .
currency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- in frankfurt the euro will not be extended to the new eu members immediately after accession , and all national currencies will be kept in place .
before they can join the euro , member states must fulfill the so-called maastricht criteria and successfully piggyback their currency to the euro for at least two years with a consistent exchange rate .
purchasing property the new eu member states will also be required to allow the free movement of capital after joining the eu .
but limitations have been placed on agricultural and forest lands .
in these areas , the new member states have been given an opt-out provision that lasts for up to seven years -lrb- for poland the length has been extended to 12 years -rrb- .
however , there are special rules that will allow farmers to lease land in the new member states .
purchase of homes and apartments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eastern european " plattenbau " apartment building .
following eu accession , eu citizens will be able to buy homes in all of the new eu countries - including single family homes and apartments .
however , they may not purchases the buildings exclusively as vacation homes .
the main exception here is slovenia , which has been granted the right to restrict the purchase of real estate for up to seven years after it joins the eu .
during a transition period of five years , poland , hungary , the czech republic and cyprus will maintain rules limiting the purchase of second apartments by citizens from other eu countries .
due to its extreme demographic and geographical situation , malta will also permanently restrict the purchase of second apartments in the price range up to € 70,000 -lrb- $ 83,500 -rrb- .
for other types of real estate , the limit will be € 1.2 million .
vacation apartments have also been classified as second apartments .
subsidiary rights self-employed eu citizens and firms have already had the right to establish subsidiary businesses in the eu candidate countries for some time now .
entrepreneurs in the new eu member states also have the right to establish businesses in western europe .
studying abroad the special eu academic program for the candidate states , the " east partnership " will remain in place .
but citizens of the new states will also now be able to participate in the eu 's socrates , leonardo da vinci and youth in europe programs .
healthcare on june 1 , the eu will introduce a european health insurance card .
at first it will be valid only in 12 eu countries - belgium , france , luxembourg , spain , germany , greece , ireland , sweden , denmark , finland , estonia , slovenia and norway .
but by the end of 2005 they will also be good in all eu countries .
the new cards replace the e111 forms currently used by europeans for healthcare reimbursement when visiting other european countries .
additionally , coverage will be extended from the current definition of procedures that are " essential without delay " to just " essential services , " meaning a lot more treatment options will be covered .
but until the cards are introduced , those covered by health care service in europe must first get approval from their homeland insurer before seeking services in another eu country .
pensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden girls with their entry into the european union , the so-called community law will now apply in the new eu member states .
that means that when a person applies for their pension , regardless of where they are living in the eu , all the contributions they have made in countries throughout the eu will be calculated in determining the sum they are to receive .
but the conditions for receiving a pension - age limits , minimum number of years that have been paid into the system or disability - will still be determined at the national level .
there is currently no centralized eu pensions system .
in all cases , a worker must pay into the pension system of the country where he or she is employed .
car rentals the legality of existing restrictions in western europe that permit car rental agencies to ban the rental of certain car makes for travel into eastern europe will still apply . from dw-world content partner mdr.de -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe a final report card for new eu members where is europe headed ? verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit getting the green light europe -pipe- 30.04.2004 the eve of enlargement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe : the world 's biggest building site on may 1 , the eu will accept 10 new members .
the historic enlargement of the bloc is being hailed as a chance to spread political stability and economic prosperity , but it will also bring a host of challenges . several years in the making , the expansion of the european union next month will mark the beginning of a new era for a continent long separated by conflict and ideology .
with the cold war now consigned to memory , a large swathe of formerly communist eastern europe - as well as the mediterranean islands of malta and cyprus - will join the prosperous west . poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia , estonia , latvia and lithuania have all waited 15 years after emerging from the shadow of the soviet union to finally be part of europe 's most exclusive club .
that means for the first time in modern history , more than 450 million europeans will be united in a single political entity stretching from the atlantic ocean to the baltic states ' eastern border with russia . " first and foremost this is a peace project , " günter verheugen , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , told german public broadcaster ard last week .
" it creates peace , stability and security in the european region . " many eu citizens - both old and new - likely share those noble sentiments .
but unfortunately for public officials in brussels and national capitals across the continent , as may 1 approaches , ever more europeans are also beginning to question what other effects eastward expansion of the bloc will have . large and unmanageable ? some are worried a union of 25 will become unwieldy , unmanageable and less transparent than it is now .
others , especially in countries bordering the new member states like germany and austria , fear they will lose their jobs as businesses move east in search of cheap labor and poorer easterners come west looking work .
though many concerns may be overblown , experts do agree that there are a number of daunting challenges awaiting the enlarged eu . " it 's certainly going to exacerbate how the eu tries to manage things , " heather grabbe , the deputy director at the centre for european reform in london , told dw-world .
having followed eu expansion for the better part of a decade , grabbe believes adding members to the table at brussels will force members to push for further reform of eu decision-making .
" there wo n't be institutional gridlock - in the end it will muddle through . " she said she expected a number of issues to arise after the new members had settled in , which could then be tackled by the eu .
" hopefully any shortcomings should provoke more reform , " grabbe said . integration delayed economically , the 10 new members have been integrating with western europe for over a decade . but some aspects of integration will be delayed - because countries on both sides of the former east-west divide want it that way .
most glaring will be the lack of new eu citizens ' ability to work legally in the old eu countries .
all of the western nations , with the exception of britain and ireland , will impose some sort of restrictions on their labor markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fearing germany will be overrun by unemployed poles , the government in berlin is likely to refuse them working privileges for a full seven years as allowed by eu treaties .
this has naturally incensed poland , which calls german concerns irrational . " there is no reason to expect there will be a mass inflow of poles to the german labor market .
but the german domestic situation does not facilitate a rational approach to this issue , " outgoing polish prime minister leszek miller said last month . poland , however , has its own reservations .
despite desperately needing foreign investment from western eu countries , warsaw has negotiated a 12-year ban on foreigners buying agricultural land .
poland fought hard for the restrictions because many poles are worried germans may be inclined to try and buy back land and real estate that they or their families once owned prior to be expelled from areas belonging to germany before world war ii . poland also showed that the new members wo n't shy away from blocking eu decision-making if it is in their interest when it last year led the campaign against the draft constitution for the bloc due to a dispute over voting rights .
warsaw has since dropped its hardliner stance on the matter , but only because its main ally , the conservative-led government of spain , was voted out of office in march . row over budget issues the constitution , along with the future funding of the eu , will be two of the top issues in brussels immediately following the accession of the 10 new countries .
fearing the poor east could increase the demand for aid in coming years , net contributor nations have already been arguing for months that the eu budget should be capped at one percent of each country 's gross national product . the european commission has dismissed such calls , arguing brussels would be expected to achieve more with less .
and those countries that have been the biggest beneficiaries of eu structural funds in past , in particular spain , greece and portugal , are unhappy aid will be diverted to the less fortunate new member states .
but some experts counter the eu does n't need more money , brussels just needs change its spending habits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas mauer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin singled out the often criticized the eu 's common agricultural policy , which subsidizes europe 's farmers with nearly half of the bloc 's total € 100-billion budget . " we have to ask ourselves what do we want to pay for ?
that agriculture takes up so much is longer responsible .
those funds could be put into research and development or other investments that could help all of europe , " mauer told dw-world . such disputes over money may resolve themselves if expansion brings real economic benefits to members both old and new as is expected .
according to some estimates , the new members ' gross domestic product could increase by 1.5 percent and some 300,000 new jobs will be created in the old countries . and as may 1 approaches , quibbling over the budget and other typical eu quarrels are sure to fade into the background as the leaders of the expanded union bask in the glow of the historic moment .
but it 's only after the official festivities are over and the politicians have left the stage that the european union 's 75 million new citizens will begin to make their presence truly felt . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

though the 10 new eu states will become full members of the bloc and fully adopt community law , some exceptions will be applied - at least for interim periods .
here 's a list of the most important changes . border controls eu citizens will be able to move freely throughout the union .
they will , however , need a valid personal identity card or passport to cross into the new member states because they are not yet members of the schengen agreement , which eliminates border checks in many western european countries .
border controls will continue between western and eastern european countries .
the eu will determine at a later date when the border checks with the new member states should be lifted .
much of it will depend on the ability of the new member states to secure the eu 's exterior borders .
only after eu conditions in this area are met can the new member states be brought into the schengen agreement and border controls be suspended .
customs following eu expansion , the new member states will be integrated into the eu 's internal market .
controls and tariffs on all goods will be eliminated .
however , certain goods will still be banned from germany and other western european countries , including guns and narcotics .
transport of tobacco will also be limited , with mobile groups being set up to help stop the smuggling business .
controls will also be carried out for illegal goods at western european borders .
in the german states of saxony and thuringia alone , 404 officials have been assigned patrolling duties and will be working closely with the federal border guard .
labor market in principle , eu citizens in europe have the freedom to choose where they want to work .
however , with the exception of ireland and britain , most of the existing eu member states are taking advantage of an optional provision negotiated in the accession agreement that permits countries to require work permits for members of the new eu states during the first two years after enlargement .
-lrb- citizens of malta and cyprus , however , will have full work rights from may 1 . -rrb-
the work permit provision can be extended for up to seven years .
germany has said it intends to do , but a valid case for extending the opt-out clause must be presented to the european commission every two years .
currency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- in frankfurt the euro will not be extended to the new eu members immediately after accession , and all national currencies will be kept in place .
before they can join the euro , member states must fulfill the so-called maastricht criteria and successfully piggyback their currency to the euro for at least two years with a consistent exchange rate .
purchasing property the new eu member states will also be required to allow the free movement of capital after joining the eu .
but limitations have been placed on agricultural and forest lands .
in these areas , the new member states have been given an opt-out provision that lasts for up to seven years -lrb- for poland the length has been extended to 12 years -rrb- .
however , there are special rules that will allow farmers to lease land in the new member states .
purchase of homes and apartments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eastern european " plattenbau " apartment building .
following eu accession , eu citizens will be able to buy homes in all of the new eu countries - including single family homes and apartments .
however , they may not purchases the buildings exclusively as vacation homes .
the main exception here is slovenia , which has been granted the right to restrict the purchase of real estate for up to seven years after it joins the eu .
during a transition period of five years , poland , hungary , the czech republic and cyprus will maintain rules limiting the purchase of second apartments by citizens from other eu countries .
due to its extreme demographic and geographical situation , malta will also permanently restrict the purchase of second apartments in the price range up to € 70,000 -lrb- $ 83,500 -rrb- .
for other types of real estate , the limit will be € 1.2 million .
vacation apartments have also been classified as second apartments .
subsidiary rights self-employed eu citizens and firms have already had the right to establish subsidiary businesses in the eu candidate countries for some time now .
entrepreneurs in the new eu member states also have the right to establish businesses in western europe .
studying abroad the special eu academic program for the candidate states , the " east partnership " will remain in place .
but citizens of the new states will also now be able to participate in the eu 's socrates , leonardo da vinci and youth in europe programs .
healthcare on june 1 , the eu will introduce a european health insurance card .
at first it will be valid only in 12 eu countries - belgium , france , luxembourg , spain , germany , greece , ireland , sweden , denmark , finland , estonia , slovenia and norway .
but by the end of 2005 they will also be good in all eu countries .
the new cards replace the e111 forms currently used by europeans for healthcare reimbursement when visiting other european countries .
additionally , coverage will be extended from the current definition of procedures that are " essential without delay " to just " essential services , " meaning a lot more treatment options will be covered .
but until the cards are introduced , those covered by health care service in europe must first get approval from their homeland insurer before seeking services in another eu country .
pensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden girls with their entry into the european union , the so-called community law will now apply in the new eu member states .
that means that when a person applies for their pension , regardless of where they are living in the eu , all the contributions they have made in countries throughout the eu will be calculated in determining the sum they are to receive .
but the conditions for receiving a pension - age limits , minimum number of years that have been paid into the system or disability - will still be determined at the national level .
there is currently no centralized eu pensions system .
in all cases , a worker must pay into the pension system of the country where he or she is employed .
car rentals the legality of existing restrictions in western europe that permit car rental agencies to ban the rental of certain car makes for travel into eastern europe will still apply . from dw-world content partner mdr.de -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

it hopes that membership will strengthen already close economic ties to europe .
one of the most important contacts for foreign businesses is siim raie , 26 . siim raie is young , but he is already at the top .
at 26 , he is the general director of the estonian chamber of commerce in tallinn .
that he has managed to climb so high at such a tender age surprises him least of all .
he is no rarity in estonia .
wherever you look , young people occupy key positions .
raie says , " this is the transition process that we are going through .
it is just that in newly independent estonia so many new positions were created , so many new organisations were created that new leaders were needed .
so we didn ’ t have the whole big generation of leaders back then needed for the market economy – young people did have a real good chance to become executives . "
portraits of raie ’ s predecessors look down from the walls of the gallery at the chamber of commerce .
there are only two .
one led the organisation from 1925 to 1940 .
the next came only in 1989 , shortly before estonia gained independence and began to develop a market economy .
the chamber of commerce was re-established at that time .
the organisation is located right in the centre of tallinn , close to the seat of government and the ministries .
the site has made it easier to make many informal contacts , over lunch for example .
after all , siim raie is also the most important lobbyist in the estonian economy .
the country has developed rapidly in the past decade .
growth rates of between six and seven percent annually make it an interesting place for foreign investors to put their money .
delegations from industries and chamber of commerce representatives from other eu countries arrive regularly .
siim raie is their first contact .
he sends them on to possible partners in estonia .
three-quarters of all of the goods produced in estonia are already being exported to the eu .
raie believes membership will strengthen economic ties even further .
part of the credit for the economic upswing can go to the young leadership elite that took part in the transition to democracy and a market economy .
raie describes his work , " oh , it is exciting .
it is not only me , but the whole generation of young executives in the country .
we do have a unique experience , which people of our age in the other european countries probably don ’ t have .
we have been in the process of changes , we are the ones making the changes and it is exciting .
and it makes you feel like the sky is the limit .
and i guess that is what we bring along to the european union as well : a generation of young executives who know how to make changes , how to make things happen . "
siim raie was thirteen when estonia gained independence from the soviet union .
at the time , his country began to orient itself towards europe , politically , economically and culturally .
today , siim raie has no questions about his identity as a european .
he says , " when i was in the united states people asked me ‘ where are you from ? ’
i tried to explain to them ‘ estonia , close to finland , next to the baltic sea ... ’ and nobody really understood .
but when you said that you are from europe , everybody knew it .

it hopes that membership will strengthen already close economic ties to europe .
one of the most important contacts for foreign businesses is siim raie , 26 . siim raie is young , but he is already at the top .
at 26 , he is the general director of the estonian chamber of commerce in tallinn .
that he has managed to climb so high at such a tender age surprises him least of all .
he is no rarity in estonia .
wherever you look , young people occupy key positions .
raie says , " this is the transition process that we are going through .
it is just that in newly independent estonia so many new positions were created , so many new organisations were created that new leaders were needed .
so we didn ’ t have the whole big generation of leaders back then needed for the market economy – young people did have a real good chance to become executives . "
portraits of raie ’ s predecessors look down from the walls of the gallery at the chamber of commerce .
there are only two .
one led the organisation from 1925 to 1940 .
the next came only in 1989 , shortly before estonia gained independence and began to develop a market economy .
the chamber of commerce was re-established at that time .
the organisation is located right in the centre of tallinn , close to the seat of government and the ministries .
the site has made it easier to make many informal contacts , over lunch for example .
after all , siim raie is also the most important lobbyist in the estonian economy .
the country has developed rapidly in the past decade .
growth rates of between six and seven percent annually make it an interesting place for foreign investors to put their money .
delegations from industries and chamber of commerce representatives from other eu countries arrive regularly .
siim raie is their first contact .
he sends them on to possible partners in estonia .
three-quarters of all of the goods produced in estonia are already being exported to the eu .
raie believes membership will strengthen economic ties even further .
part of the credit for the economic upswing can go to the young leadership elite that took part in the transition to democracy and a market economy .
raie describes his work , " oh , it is exciting .
it is not only me , but the whole generation of young executives in the country .
we do have a unique experience , which people of our age in the other european countries probably don ’ t have .
we have been in the process of changes , we are the ones making the changes and it is exciting .
and it makes you feel like the sky is the limit .
and i guess that is what we bring along to the european union as well : a generation of young executives who know how to make changes , how to make things happen . "
siim raie was thirteen when estonia gained independence from the soviet union .
at the time , his country began to orient itself towards europe , politically , economically and culturally .
today , siim raie has no questions about his identity as a european .
he says , " when i was in the united states people asked me ‘ where are you from ? ’
i tried to explain to them ‘ estonia , close to finland , next to the baltic sea ... ’ and nobody really understood .
but when you said that you are from europe , everybody knew it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe a final report card for new eu members where is europe headed ? verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit getting the green light europe -pipe- 30.04.2004 the eve of enlargement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe : the world 's biggest building site on may 1 , the eu will accept 10 new members .
the historic enlargement of the bloc is being hailed as a chance to spread political stability and economic prosperity , but it will also bring a host of challenges . several years in the making , the expansion of the european union next month will mark the beginning of a new era for a continent long separated by conflict and ideology .
with the cold war now consigned to memory , a large swathe of formerly communist eastern europe - as well as the mediterranean islands of malta and cyprus - will join the prosperous west . poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia , estonia , latvia and lithuania have all waited 15 years after emerging from the shadow of the soviet union to finally be part of europe 's most exclusive club .
that means for the first time in modern history , more than 450 million europeans will be united in a single political entity stretching from the atlantic ocean to the baltic states ' eastern border with russia . " first and foremost this is a peace project , " günter verheugen , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , told german public broadcaster ard last week .
" it creates peace , stability and security in the european region . " many eu citizens - both old and new - likely share those noble sentiments .
but unfortunately for public officials in brussels and national capitals across the continent , as may 1 approaches , ever more europeans are also beginning to question what other effects eastward expansion of the bloc will have . large and unmanageable ? some are worried a union of 25 will become unwieldy , unmanageable and less transparent than it is now .
others , especially in countries bordering the new member states like germany and austria , fear they will lose their jobs as businesses move east in search of cheap labor and poorer easterners come west looking work .
though many concerns may be overblown , experts do agree that there are a number of daunting challenges awaiting the enlarged eu . " it 's certainly going to exacerbate how the eu tries to manage things , " heather grabbe , the deputy director at the centre for european reform in london , told dw-world .
having followed eu expansion for the better part of a decade , grabbe believes adding members to the table at brussels will force members to push for further reform of eu decision-making .
" there wo n't be institutional gridlock - in the end it will muddle through . " she said she expected a number of issues to arise after the new members had settled in , which could then be tackled by the eu .
" hopefully any shortcomings should provoke more reform , " grabbe said . integration delayed economically , the 10 new members have been integrating with western europe for over a decade . but some aspects of integration will be delayed - because countries on both sides of the former east-west divide want it that way .
most glaring will be the lack of new eu citizens ' ability to work legally in the old eu countries .
all of the western nations , with the exception of britain and ireland , will impose some sort of restrictions on their labor markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fearing germany will be overrun by unemployed poles , the government in berlin is likely to refuse them working privileges for a full seven years as allowed by eu treaties .
this has naturally incensed poland , which calls german concerns irrational . " there is no reason to expect there will be a mass inflow of poles to the german labor market .
but the german domestic situation does not facilitate a rational approach to this issue , " outgoing polish prime minister leszek miller said last month . poland , however , has its own reservations .
despite desperately needing foreign investment from western eu countries , warsaw has negotiated a 12-year ban on foreigners buying agricultural land .
poland fought hard for the restrictions because many poles are worried germans may be inclined to try and buy back land and real estate that they or their families once owned prior to be expelled from areas belonging to germany before world war ii . poland also showed that the new members wo n't shy away from blocking eu decision-making if it is in their interest when it last year led the campaign against the draft constitution for the bloc due to a dispute over voting rights .
warsaw has since dropped its hardliner stance on the matter , but only because its main ally , the conservative-led government of spain , was voted out of office in march . row over budget issues the constitution , along with the future funding of the eu , will be two of the top issues in brussels immediately following the accession of the 10 new countries .
fearing the poor east could increase the demand for aid in coming years , net contributor nations have already been arguing for months that the eu budget should be capped at one percent of each country 's gross national product . the european commission has dismissed such calls , arguing brussels would be expected to achieve more with less .
and those countries that have been the biggest beneficiaries of eu structural funds in past , in particular spain , greece and portugal , are unhappy aid will be diverted to the less fortunate new member states .
but some experts counter the eu does n't need more money , brussels just needs change its spending habits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas mauer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin singled out the often criticized the eu 's common agricultural policy , which subsidizes europe 's farmers with nearly half of the bloc 's total € 100-billion budget . " we have to ask ourselves what do we want to pay for ?
that agriculture takes up so much is longer responsible .
those funds could be put into research and development or other investments that could help all of europe , " mauer told dw-world . such disputes over money may resolve themselves if expansion brings real economic benefits to members both old and new as is expected .
according to some estimates , the new members ' gross domestic product could increase by 1.5 percent and some 300,000 new jobs will be created in the old countries . and as may 1 approaches , quibbling over the budget and other typical eu quarrels are sure to fade into the background as the leaders of the expanded union bask in the glow of the historic moment .
but it 's only after the official festivities are over and the politicians have left the stage that the european union 's 75 million new citizens will begin to make their presence truly felt . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers . it 's the time of the year when all hell breaks loose in berlin and neighborhoods like turkish-dominated kreuzberg become urban battle grounds , complete with burning cars , smashed shop windows and violent clashes between police and rampaging teenagers . may day rioting has become a tradition in berlin , harking back to may 1 , 1987 , when left-wing demonstrators first took to the streets to protest against what they called a " bourgeois " celebration of the 750th anniversary of the founding of berlin . since then , the rioting has returned to berlin with unfailing regularity each year , first in west berlin and then following german reunification in 1990 , in both halves of the united city . tougher , quicker action this year however , city authorities and police are clear they plan to put an end to the violence that mars the largely peaceful may day demonstrations and festive atmosphere of the street fairs and parties that dot berlin 's historic center near the brandenburg gate , the hip eastern neighborhood of prenzlauer berg as well as its western neighbor , the kreuzberg district . berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , whose administration has used a " soft glove " approach in the past , has said that the police will crack down on rioters this year . berlin 's interior minister erhart körting has announced that the police on saturday will take swifter and tougher action against vandals and rioters than last year and also keep a watch on small groups of rowdy teenagers in kreuzberg on may day eve to preempt any rioting . a strenuous week for the police may day will mark the culmination of a difficult week for berlin 's police , who have had to provide security for a series of high-profile events , starting with the two-day osce anti-semitism conference on april 28 and 29 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.04.2004 what will change with eu expansion ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border controls will remain in eastern europe - at least for now .
though the 10 new eu states will become full members of the bloc and fully adopt community law , some exceptions will be applied - at least for interim periods .
here 's a list of the most important changes . border controls eu citizens will be able to move freely throughout the union .
they will , however , need a valid personal identity card or passport to cross into the new member states because they are not yet members of the schengen agreement , which eliminates border checks in many western european countries .
border controls will continue between western and eastern european countries .
the eu will determine at a later date when the border checks with the new member states should be lifted .
much of it will depend on the ability of the new member states to secure the eu 's exterior borders .
only after eu conditions in this area are met can the new member states be brought into the schengen agreement and border controls be suspended .
customs following eu expansion , the new member states will be integrated into the eu 's internal market .
controls and tariffs on all goods will be eliminated .
however , certain goods will still be banned from germany and other western european countries , including guns and narcotics .
transport of tobacco will also be limited , with mobile groups being set up to help stop the smuggling business .
controls will also be carried out for illegal goods at western european borders .
in the german states of saxony and thuringia alone , 404 officials have been assigned patrolling duties and will be working closely with the federal border guard .
labor market in principle , eu citizens in europe have the freedom to choose where they want to work .
however , with the exception of ireland and britain , most of the existing eu member states are taking advantage of an optional provision negotiated in the accession agreement that permits countries to require work permits for members of the new eu states during the first two years after enlargement .
-lrb- citizens of malta and cyprus , however , will have full work rights from may 1 . -rrb-
the work permit provision can be extended for up to seven years .
germany has said it intends to do , but a valid case for extending the opt-out clause must be presented to the european commission every two years .
currency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- in frankfurt the euro will not be extended to the new eu members immediately after accession , and all national currencies will be kept in place .
before they can join the euro , member states must fulfill the so-called maastricht criteria and successfully piggyback their currency to the euro for at least two years with a consistent exchange rate .
purchasing property the new eu member states will also be required to allow the free movement of capital after joining the eu .
but limitations have been placed on agricultural and forest lands .
in these areas , the new member states have been given an opt-out provision that lasts for up to seven years -lrb- for poland the length has been extended to 12 years -rrb- .
however , there are special rules that will allow farmers to lease land in the new member states .
purchase of homes and apartments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eastern european " plattenbau " apartment building .
following eu accession , eu citizens will be able to buy homes in all of the new eu countries - including single family homes and apartments .
however , they may not purchases the buildings exclusively as vacation homes .
the main exception here is slovenia , which has been granted the right to restrict the purchase of real estate for up to seven years after it joins the eu .
during a transition period of five years , poland , hungary , the czech republic and cyprus will maintain rules limiting the purchase of second apartments by citizens from other eu countries .
due to its extreme demographic and geographical situation , malta will also permanently restrict the purchase of second apartments in the price range up to € 70,000 -lrb- $ 83,500 -rrb- .
for other types of real estate , the limit will be € 1.2 million .
vacation apartments have also been classified as second apartments .
subsidiary rights self-employed eu citizens and firms have already had the right to establish subsidiary businesses in the eu candidate countries for some time now .
entrepreneurs in the new eu member states also have the right to establish businesses in western europe .
studying abroad the special eu academic program for the candidate states , the " east partnership " will remain in place .
but citizens of the new states will also now be able to participate in the eu 's socrates , leonardo da vinci and youth in europe programs .
healthcare on june 1 , the eu will introduce a european health insurance card .
at first it will be valid only in 12 eu countries - belgium , france , luxembourg , spain , germany , greece , ireland , sweden , denmark , finland , estonia , slovenia and norway .
but by the end of 2005 they will also be good in all eu countries .
the new cards replace the e111 forms currently used by europeans for healthcare reimbursement when visiting other european countries .
additionally , coverage will be extended from the current definition of procedures that are " essential without delay " to just " essential services , " meaning a lot more treatment options will be covered .
but until the cards are introduced , those covered by health care service in europe must first get approval from their homeland insurer before seeking services in another eu country .
pensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden girls with their entry into the european union , the so-called community law will now apply in the new eu member states .
that means that when a person applies for their pension , regardless of where they are living in the eu , all the contributions they have made in countries throughout the eu will be calculated in determining the sum they are to receive .
but the conditions for receiving a pension - age limits , minimum number of years that have been paid into the system or disability - will still be determined at the national level .
there is currently no centralized eu pensions system .
in all cases , a worker must pay into the pension system of the country where he or she is employed .
car rentals the legality of existing restrictions in western europe that permit car rental agencies to ban the rental of certain car makes for travel into eastern europe will still apply . from dw-world content partner mdr.de -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

eu enlargement will bring about many changes .
for bargain hunters fond of cruising duty-free zones along the polish border , it will mean the end of an era .
tour operators reliant on the trade are bracing for the blow . duty-free zones offering liquor , cigarettes and luxury items tax-free sprang up in germany in the mid-1950s - mostly in airports , but also on ships travelling in international waters .
one such zone is on the oder river that separates germany and poland .
since 1998 , a small section of the water on the polish side has been duty-free , and a lucrative business has built up on-board ships travelling in the area .
such an excursion has become known as a " butterfahrt " - literally “ butter trips ” - because they started out as a way for people to get cheap butter .
last year over one million germans travelled to these tax-free waters .
but with poland 's entry into the european union on may 1 , the duty-free law will no longer be valid : germany 's " butterfahrt " industry seems doomed to melt away , leaving a puddle of unemployment , deserted ships and empty buses in its wake . free lunch and big savings on a chilly april morning in berlin , double-decker buses lined one of the main boulevards as far as the eye can see .
the passengers on the buses were destined for a " butterfahrt " on the oder .
currently a " butterfahrt " costs just a few euros , with the shipping companies paying subsidies of up to 50 percent to the bus companies that cart people their way .
" the ' butterfahrt ' is an excursion package of bus and ship travel , " anna wiese , marketing director for berlin-based holiday travels agency , told deutsche welle .
" our buses pick up guests in berlin and bring them to various ports on the oder , where they board the duty-free ships .
one tour also supplies lunch and a surprise gift to each guest . " in the buses , bargain hunters study the flyers announcing the latest sales awaiting them on-board the floating supermarkets .
brand-name liquor and cigarettes can be bought for a fraction of the price paid in german shops .
for example , a carton of philip morris cigarettes costs just € 8.50 -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- .
in germany , the same carton fetches up to € 36 . a culture of savings the incredible bargains make the " butterfahrt " irresistible , bus driver dieter draht said .
" some guests take the trip every day , just to buy duty-free cigarettes , whisky , and who knows what else , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on a recent " butter trip " boat on the oder river .
the " butterfahrt " has developed into nothing less than a tradition among berlin ’ s urban poor .
its popularity reflects the state of germany ’ s economy .
it has also become something of a social occasion , part of the rage for discount shopping that permeates germany . " good quality and cheap , " said one customer when asked why he had come along on the trip .
" all of us here are modest earners and people dependent on social welfare and unemployment money or retired . " get it while the goings good but starting in may , there will be no more subsidies for the bus companies or free lunches for the travelers .
the price of the trip will double and all goods bought on board will be taxed .
so in the final weeks of duty-free shopping , " butterfahrt " business has been booming . holiday travel said they were sending out twice as many buses a day , with customers cramming in as many cheap shopping trips as they could before the good times were over .
" last week we went three times , and this week we are going twice , " said one customer .
" we ’ ve got to take advantage of these last weeks as much as we can . " end of an era one of the regular guests was indignant about no longer being able to get around germany ’ s high tobacco tax .
" smokers are supporting the nation , " he said . the shipping industry is just as unhappy about the situation : hundreds of jobs will be lost after may 1 .
still , some hope to keep the " butterfahrt " alive by attracting a new clientele - one just as interested in the scenic bus and boat ride as in cheap booze and cigarettes . anna wiese from holiday travels pointed out that only time will tell .
" we will see a large chunk of our business fall away , but we will still continue to offer the ' butterfahrt ' excursions - but at a higher price , " she said .
" we must see what our guests are prepared to pay . "
goods on-board the ships will become more expensive , but they will still be cheaper than in germany , wiese added . leah mcdonnell -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe read dw-world 's eu expansion dossier .

last year over one million germans travelled to these tax-free waters .
but with poland 's entry into the european union on may 1 , the duty-free law will no longer be valid : germany 's " butterfahrt " industry seems doomed to melt away , leaving a puddle of unemployment , deserted ships and empty buses in its wake . free lunch and big savings on a chilly april morning in berlin , double-decker buses lined one of the main boulevards as far as the eye can see .
the passengers on the buses were destined for a " butterfahrt " on the oder .
currently a " butterfahrt " costs just a few euros , with the shipping companies paying subsidies of up to 50 percent to the bus companies that cart people their way .
" the ' butterfahrt ' is an excursion package of bus and ship travel , " anna wiese , marketing director for berlin-based holiday travels agency , told deutsche welle .
" our buses pick up guests in berlin and bring them to various ports on the oder , where they board the duty-free ships .
one tour also supplies lunch and a surprise gift to each guest . " in the buses , bargain hunters study the flyers announcing the latest sales awaiting them on-board the floating supermarkets .
brand-name liquor and cigarettes can be bought for a fraction of the price paid in german shops .
for example , a carton of philip morris cigarettes costs just € 8.50 -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- .
in germany , the same carton fetches up to € 36 . a culture of savings the incredible bargains make the " butterfahrt " irresistible , bus driver dieter draht said .
" some guests take the trip every day , just to buy duty-free cigarettes , whisky , and who knows what else , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on a recent " butter trip " boat on the oder river .
the " butterfahrt " has developed into nothing less than a tradition among berlin ’ s urban poor .
its popularity reflects the state of germany ’ s economy .
it has also become something of a social occasion , part of the rage for discount shopping that permeates germany . " good quality and cheap , " said one customer when asked why he had come along on the trip .
" all of us here are modest earners and people dependent on social welfare and unemployment money or retired . " get it while the goings good but starting in may , there will be no more subsidies for the bus companies or free lunches for the travelers .
the price of the trip will double and all goods bought on board will be taxed .
so in the final weeks of duty-free shopping , " butterfahrt " business has been booming . holiday travel said they were sending out twice as many buses a day , with customers cramming in as many cheap shopping trips as they could before the good times were over .
" last week we went three times , and this week we are going twice , " said one customer .
" we ’ ve got to take advantage of these last weeks as much as we can . " end of an era one of the regular guests was indignant about no longer being able to get around germany ’ s high tobacco tax .
" smokers are supporting the nation , " he said . the shipping industry is just as unhappy about the situation : hundreds of jobs will be lost after may 1 .
still , some hope to keep the " butterfahrt " alive by attracting a new clientele - one just as interested in the scenic bus and boat ride as in cheap booze and cigarettes . anna wiese from holiday travels pointed out that only time will tell .
" we will see a large chunk of our business fall away , but we will still continue to offer the ' butterfahrt ' excursions - but at a higher price , " she said .
" we must see what our guests are prepared to pay . "
goods on-board the ships will become more expensive , but they will still be cheaper than in germany , wiese added . leah mcdonnell -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe read dw-world 's eu expansion dossier .

eu enlargement will bring about many changes .
for bargain hunters fond of cruising duty-free zones along the polish border , it will mean the end of an era .
tour operators reliant on the trade are bracing for the blow . duty-free zones offering liquor , cigarettes and luxury items tax-free sprang up in germany in the mid-1950s - mostly in airports , but also on ships travelling in international waters .
one such zone is on the oder river that separates germany and poland .
since 1998 , a small section of the water on the polish side has been duty-free , and a lucrative business has built up on-board ships travelling in the area .

at 26 , he is the general director of the estonian chamber of commerce in tallinn .
that he has managed to climb so high at such a tender age surprises him least of all .
he is no rarity in estonia .
wherever you look , young people occupy key positions .
raie says , " this is the transition process that we are going through .
it is just that in newly independent estonia so many new positions were created , so many new organisations were created that new leaders were needed .
so we didn ’ t have the whole big generation of leaders back then needed for the market economy – young people did have a real good chance to become executives . "
portraits of raie ’ s predecessors look down from the walls of the gallery at the chamber of commerce .
there are only two .
one led the organisation from 1925 to 1940 .
the next came only in 1989 , shortly before estonia gained independence and began to develop a market economy .
the chamber of commerce was re-established at that time .
the organisation is located right in the centre of tallinn , close to the seat of government and the ministries .
the site has made it easier to make many informal contacts , over lunch for example .
after all , siim raie is also the most important lobbyist in the estonian economy .
the country has developed rapidly in the past decade .
growth rates of between six and seven percent annually make it an interesting place for foreign investors to put their money .
delegations from industries and chamber of commerce representatives from other eu countries arrive regularly .
siim raie is their first contact .
he sends them on to possible partners in estonia .
three-quarters of all of the goods produced in estonia are already being exported to the eu .
raie believes membership will strengthen economic ties even further .
part of the credit for the economic upswing can go to the young leadership elite that took part in the transition to democracy and a market economy .
raie describes his work , " oh , it is exciting .
it is not only me , but the whole generation of young executives in the country .
we do have a unique experience , which people of our age in the other european countries probably don ’ t have .
we have been in the process of changes , we are the ones making the changes and it is exciting .
and it makes you feel like the sky is the limit .
and i guess that is what we bring along to the european union as well : a generation of young executives who know how to make changes , how to make things happen . "
siim raie was thirteen when estonia gained independence from the soviet union .
at the time , his country began to orient itself towards europe , politically , economically and culturally .
today , siim raie has no questions about his identity as a european .
he says , " when i was in the united states people asked me ‘ where are you from ? ’

as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers . it 's the time of the year when all hell breaks loose in berlin and neighborhoods like turkish-dominated kreuzberg become urban battle grounds , complete with burning cars , smashed shop windows and violent clashes between police and rampaging teenagers . may day rioting has become a tradition in berlin , harking back to may 1 , 1987 , when left-wing demonstrators first took to the streets to protest against what they called a " bourgeois " celebration of the 750th anniversary of the founding of berlin . since then , the rioting has returned to berlin with unfailing regularity each year , first in west berlin and then following german reunification in 1990 , in both halves of the united city . tougher , quicker action this year however , city authorities and police are clear they plan to put an end to the violence that mars the largely peaceful may day demonstrations and festive atmosphere of the street fairs and parties that dot berlin 's historic center near the brandenburg gate , the hip eastern neighborhood of prenzlauer berg as well as its western neighbor , the kreuzberg district . berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , whose administration has used a " soft glove " approach in the past , has said that the police will crack down on rioters this year . berlin 's interior minister erhart körting has announced that the police on saturday will take swifter and tougher action against vandals and rioters than last year and also keep a watch on small groups of rowdy teenagers in kreuzberg on may day eve to preempt any rioting . a strenuous week for the police may day will mark the culmination of a difficult week for berlin 's police , who have had to provide security for a series of high-profile events , starting with the two-day osce anti-semitism conference on april 28 and 29 .
the conference welcomed , among other dignitaries , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and israeli president moshe katsav .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police in berlin police reinforcements were called in from other german states to assist local police , taking the total count of police officers to around 15,000 this past week , turning downtown berlin into a virtual fortress . on friday night before may day , police will be kept busy as several hundred high-ranking officials from all across europe converge on berlin 's central gendarmen markt square to take part in ceremonies marking the expansion of the european union by ten new members . the night before may day is also celebrated in germany as walpurgisnacht , a pagan ritual to usher in the spring , but which is also used as an occasion by leftist young people in berlin to go on a violent , often drunken rampages in the prenzlauer berg district .
police cars usually begin parking outside the park by early evening . angry protests set to heighten demonstrations despite the heightened security measures and the heightened police presence - some 8,000 will be on the streets - officials admit that this year 's demonstrations are likely to take on an even angrier tone than usual . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 200,000 trade unionists plan to take part in traditional may day parades through the heart of the city to protest the federal government 's cuts in health care , social services and retirement pensions . " this will contribute to a greater emotional and political edge to the demonstrations , " interior minister körting told the daily berliner zeitung .
" it would be naïve to believe that these days will pass peacefully . " in addition , some 2,500 neo-nazis plan to hold a rally in eastern berlin , with leftist counter-demonstrators vowing to stop them , setting the scene for possible clashes . berlin police president dieter glietsch has confirmed that the police will be more visible on may day this year and will clamp down on rioters . " we 've had enough " though the prospect of violence looms large on saturday , organizers of the various street festivals and parades remain undeterred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burnt-out cars in kreuzberg silke fischer , organizer of the famous " myfest " food and music festival around the oranien street in kreuzberg told the berliner zeitung that residents had had enough of " their cars being set ablaze and it being called a revolution .

raie believes membership will strengthen economic ties even further .
part of the credit for the economic upswing can go to the young leadership elite that took part in the transition to democracy and a market economy .
raie describes his work , " oh , it is exciting .
it is not only me , but the whole generation of young executives in the country .
we do have a unique experience , which people of our age in the other european countries probably don ’ t have .
we have been in the process of changes , we are the ones making the changes and it is exciting .
and it makes you feel like the sky is the limit .
and i guess that is what we bring along to the european union as well : a generation of young executives who know how to make changes , how to make things happen . "
siim raie was thirteen when estonia gained independence from the soviet union .
at the time , his country began to orient itself towards europe , politically , economically and culturally .
today , siim raie has no questions about his identity as a european .
he says , " when i was in the united states people asked me ‘ where are you from ? ’
i tried to explain to them ‘ estonia , close to finland , next to the baltic sea ... ’ and nobody really understood .
but when you said that you are from europe , everybody knew it .
and that ’ s the truth .
i am a european , certainly . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

eu enlargement will bring about many changes .
for bargain hunters fond of cruising duty-free zones along the polish border , it will mean the end of an era .
tour operators reliant on the trade are bracing for the blow . duty-free zones offering liquor , cigarettes and luxury items tax-free sprang up in germany in the mid-1950s - mostly in airports , but also on ships travelling in international waters .
one such zone is on the oder river that separates germany and poland .
since 1998 , a small section of the water on the polish side has been duty-free , and a lucrative business has built up on-board ships travelling in the area .
such an excursion has become known as a " butterfahrt " - literally “ butter trips ” - because they started out as a way for people to get cheap butter .
last year over one million germans travelled to these tax-free waters .
but with poland 's entry into the european union on may 1 , the duty-free law will no longer be valid : germany 's " butterfahrt " industry seems doomed to melt away , leaving a puddle of unemployment , deserted ships and empty buses in its wake . free lunch and big savings on a chilly april morning in berlin , double-decker buses lined one of the main boulevards as far as the eye can see .
the passengers on the buses were destined for a " butterfahrt " on the oder .
currently a " butterfahrt " costs just a few euros , with the shipping companies paying subsidies of up to 50 percent to the bus companies that cart people their way .
" the ' butterfahrt ' is an excursion package of bus and ship travel , " anna wiese , marketing director for berlin-based holiday travels agency , told deutsche welle .
" our buses pick up guests in berlin and bring them to various ports on the oder , where they board the duty-free ships .
one tour also supplies lunch and a surprise gift to each guest . " in the buses , bargain hunters study the flyers announcing the latest sales awaiting them on-board the floating supermarkets .
brand-name liquor and cigarettes can be bought for a fraction of the price paid in german shops .
for example , a carton of philip morris cigarettes costs just € 8.50 -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- .
in germany , the same carton fetches up to € 36 . a culture of savings the incredible bargains make the " butterfahrt " irresistible , bus driver dieter draht said .
" some guests take the trip every day , just to buy duty-free cigarettes , whisky , and who knows what else , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on a recent " butter trip " boat on the oder river .
the " butterfahrt " has developed into nothing less than a tradition among berlin ’ s urban poor .
its popularity reflects the state of germany ’ s economy .
it has also become something of a social occasion , part of the rage for discount shopping that permeates germany . " good quality and cheap , " said one customer when asked why he had come along on the trip .
" all of us here are modest earners and people dependent on social welfare and unemployment money or retired . " get it while the goings good but starting in may , there will be no more subsidies for the bus companies or free lunches for the travelers .
the price of the trip will double and all goods bought on board will be taxed .
so in the final weeks of duty-free shopping , " butterfahrt " business has been booming . holiday travel said they were sending out twice as many buses a day , with customers cramming in as many cheap shopping trips as they could before the good times were over .
" last week we went three times , and this week we are going twice , " said one customer .
" we ’ ve got to take advantage of these last weeks as much as we can . " end of an era one of the regular guests was indignant about no longer being able to get around germany ’ s high tobacco tax .
" smokers are supporting the nation , " he said . the shipping industry is just as unhappy about the situation : hundreds of jobs will be lost after may 1 .
still , some hope to keep the " butterfahrt " alive by attracting a new clientele - one just as interested in the scenic bus and boat ride as in cheap booze and cigarettes . anna wiese from holiday travels pointed out that only time will tell .
" we will see a large chunk of our business fall away , but we will still continue to offer the ' butterfahrt ' excursions - but at a higher price , " she said .
" we must see what our guests are prepared to pay . "
goods on-board the ships will become more expensive , but they will still be cheaper than in germany , wiese added . leah mcdonnell -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe read dw-world 's eu expansion dossier .

as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers . it 's the time of the year when all hell breaks loose in berlin and neighborhoods like turkish-dominated kreuzberg become urban battle grounds , complete with burning cars , smashed shop windows and violent clashes between police and rampaging teenagers . may day rioting has become a tradition in berlin , harking back to may 1 , 1987 , when left-wing demonstrators first took to the streets to protest against what they called a " bourgeois " celebration of the 750th anniversary of the founding of berlin . since then , the rioting has returned to berlin with unfailing regularity each year , first in west berlin and then following german reunification in 1990 , in both halves of the united city . tougher , quicker action this year however , city authorities and police are clear they plan to put an end to the violence that mars the largely peaceful may day demonstrations and festive atmosphere of the street fairs and parties that dot berlin 's historic center near the brandenburg gate , the hip eastern neighborhood of prenzlauer berg as well as its western neighbor , the kreuzberg district . berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , whose administration has used a " soft glove " approach in the past , has said that the police will crack down on rioters this year . berlin 's interior minister erhart körting has announced that the police on saturday will take swifter and tougher action against vandals and rioters than last year and also keep a watch on small groups of rowdy teenagers in kreuzberg on may day eve to preempt any rioting . a strenuous week for the police may day will mark the culmination of a difficult week for berlin 's police , who have had to provide security for a series of high-profile events , starting with the two-day osce anti-semitism conference on april 28 and 29 .
the conference welcomed , among other dignitaries , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and israeli president moshe katsav .

the historic enlargement of the bloc is being hailed as a chance to spread political stability and economic prosperity , but it will also bring a host of challenges . several years in the making , the expansion of the european union next month will mark the beginning of a new era for a continent long separated by conflict and ideology .
with the cold war now consigned to memory , a large swathe of formerly communist eastern europe - as well as the mediterranean islands of malta and cyprus - will join the prosperous west . poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia , estonia , latvia and lithuania have all waited 15 years after emerging from the shadow of the soviet union to finally be part of europe 's most exclusive club .
that means for the first time in modern history , more than 450 million europeans will be united in a single political entity stretching from the atlantic ocean to the baltic states ' eastern border with russia . " first and foremost this is a peace project , " günter verheugen , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , told german public broadcaster ard last week .
" it creates peace , stability and security in the european region . " many eu citizens - both old and new - likely share those noble sentiments .
but unfortunately for public officials in brussels and national capitals across the continent , as may 1 approaches , ever more europeans are also beginning to question what other effects eastward expansion of the bloc will have . large and unmanageable ? some are worried a union of 25 will become unwieldy , unmanageable and less transparent than it is now .
others , especially in countries bordering the new member states like germany and austria , fear they will lose their jobs as businesses move east in search of cheap labor and poorer easterners come west looking work .
though many concerns may be overblown , experts do agree that there are a number of daunting challenges awaiting the enlarged eu . " it 's certainly going to exacerbate how the eu tries to manage things , " heather grabbe , the deputy director at the centre for european reform in london , told dw-world .
having followed eu expansion for the better part of a decade , grabbe believes adding members to the table at brussels will force members to push for further reform of eu decision-making .
" there wo n't be institutional gridlock - in the end it will muddle through . " she said she expected a number of issues to arise after the new members had settled in , which could then be tackled by the eu .
" hopefully any shortcomings should provoke more reform , " grabbe said . integration delayed economically , the 10 new members have been integrating with western europe for over a decade . but some aspects of integration will be delayed - because countries on both sides of the former east-west divide want it that way .
most glaring will be the lack of new eu citizens ' ability to work legally in the old eu countries .
all of the western nations , with the exception of britain and ireland , will impose some sort of restrictions on their labor markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fearing germany will be overrun by unemployed poles , the government in berlin is likely to refuse them working privileges for a full seven years as allowed by eu treaties .
this has naturally incensed poland , which calls german concerns irrational . " there is no reason to expect there will be a mass inflow of poles to the german labor market .
but the german domestic situation does not facilitate a rational approach to this issue , " outgoing polish prime minister leszek miller said last month . poland , however , has its own reservations .
despite desperately needing foreign investment from western eu countries , warsaw has negotiated a 12-year ban on foreigners buying agricultural land .
poland fought hard for the restrictions because many poles are worried germans may be inclined to try and buy back land and real estate that they or their families once owned prior to be expelled from areas belonging to germany before world war ii . poland also showed that the new members wo n't shy away from blocking eu decision-making if it is in their interest when it last year led the campaign against the draft constitution for the bloc due to a dispute over voting rights .
warsaw has since dropped its hardliner stance on the matter , but only because its main ally , the conservative-led government of spain , was voted out of office in march . row over budget issues the constitution , along with the future funding of the eu , will be two of the top issues in brussels immediately following the accession of the 10 new countries .
fearing the poor east could increase the demand for aid in coming years , net contributor nations have already been arguing for months that the eu budget should be capped at one percent of each country 's gross national product . the european commission has dismissed such calls , arguing brussels would be expected to achieve more with less .
and those countries that have been the biggest beneficiaries of eu structural funds in past , in particular spain , greece and portugal , are unhappy aid will be diverted to the less fortunate new member states .
but some experts counter the eu does n't need more money , brussels just needs change its spending habits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas mauer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin singled out the often criticized the eu 's common agricultural policy , which subsidizes europe 's farmers with nearly half of the bloc 's total € 100-billion budget . " we have to ask ourselves what do we want to pay for ?
that agriculture takes up so much is longer responsible .
those funds could be put into research and development or other investments that could help all of europe , " mauer told dw-world . such disputes over money may resolve themselves if expansion brings real economic benefits to members both old and new as is expected .
according to some estimates , the new members ' gross domestic product could increase by 1.5 percent and some 300,000 new jobs will be created in the old countries . and as may 1 approaches , quibbling over the budget and other typical eu quarrels are sure to fade into the background as the leaders of the expanded union bask in the glow of the historic moment .
but it 's only after the official festivities are over and the politicians have left the stage that the european union 's 75 million new citizens will begin to make their presence truly felt . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

with the cold war now consigned to memory , a large swathe of formerly communist eastern europe - as well as the mediterranean islands of malta and cyprus - will join the prosperous west . poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia , estonia , latvia and lithuania have all waited 15 years after emerging from the shadow of the soviet union to finally be part of europe 's most exclusive club .
that means for the first time in modern history , more than 450 million europeans will be united in a single political entity stretching from the atlantic ocean to the baltic states ' eastern border with russia . " first and foremost this is a peace project , " günter verheugen , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , told german public broadcaster ard last week .
" it creates peace , stability and security in the european region . " many eu citizens - both old and new - likely share those noble sentiments .
but unfortunately for public officials in brussels and national capitals across the continent , as may 1 approaches , ever more europeans are also beginning to question what other effects eastward expansion of the bloc will have . large and unmanageable ? some are worried a union of 25 will become unwieldy , unmanageable and less transparent than it is now .
others , especially in countries bordering the new member states like germany and austria , fear they will lose their jobs as businesses move east in search of cheap labor and poorer easterners come west looking work .
though many concerns may be overblown , experts do agree that there are a number of daunting challenges awaiting the enlarged eu . " it 's certainly going to exacerbate how the eu tries to manage things , " heather grabbe , the deputy director at the centre for european reform in london , told dw-world .
having followed eu expansion for the better part of a decade , grabbe believes adding members to the table at brussels will force members to push for further reform of eu decision-making .
" there wo n't be institutional gridlock - in the end it will muddle through . " she said she expected a number of issues to arise after the new members had settled in , which could then be tackled by the eu .
" hopefully any shortcomings should provoke more reform , " grabbe said . integration delayed economically , the 10 new members have been integrating with western europe for over a decade . but some aspects of integration will be delayed - because countries on both sides of the former east-west divide want it that way .
most glaring will be the lack of new eu citizens ' ability to work legally in the old eu countries .
all of the western nations , with the exception of britain and ireland , will impose some sort of restrictions on their labor markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fearing germany will be overrun by unemployed poles , the government in berlin is likely to refuse them working privileges for a full seven years as allowed by eu treaties .
this has naturally incensed poland , which calls german concerns irrational . " there is no reason to expect there will be a mass inflow of poles to the german labor market .
but the german domestic situation does not facilitate a rational approach to this issue , " outgoing polish prime minister leszek miller said last month . poland , however , has its own reservations .
despite desperately needing foreign investment from western eu countries , warsaw has negotiated a 12-year ban on foreigners buying agricultural land .
poland fought hard for the restrictions because many poles are worried germans may be inclined to try and buy back land and real estate that they or their families once owned prior to be expelled from areas belonging to germany before world war ii . poland also showed that the new members wo n't shy away from blocking eu decision-making if it is in their interest when it last year led the campaign against the draft constitution for the bloc due to a dispute over voting rights .
warsaw has since dropped its hardliner stance on the matter , but only because its main ally , the conservative-led government of spain , was voted out of office in march . row over budget issues the constitution , along with the future funding of the eu , will be two of the top issues in brussels immediately following the accession of the 10 new countries .
fearing the poor east could increase the demand for aid in coming years , net contributor nations have already been arguing for months that the eu budget should be capped at one percent of each country 's gross national product . the european commission has dismissed such calls , arguing brussels would be expected to achieve more with less .
and those countries that have been the biggest beneficiaries of eu structural funds in past , in particular spain , greece and portugal , are unhappy aid will be diverted to the less fortunate new member states .
but some experts counter the eu does n't need more money , brussels just needs change its spending habits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas mauer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin singled out the often criticized the eu 's common agricultural policy , which subsidizes europe 's farmers with nearly half of the bloc 's total € 100-billion budget . " we have to ask ourselves what do we want to pay for ?
that agriculture takes up so much is longer responsible .
those funds could be put into research and development or other investments that could help all of europe , " mauer told dw-world . such disputes over money may resolve themselves if expansion brings real economic benefits to members both old and new as is expected .
according to some estimates , the new members ' gross domestic product could increase by 1.5 percent and some 300,000 new jobs will be created in the old countries . and as may 1 approaches , quibbling over the budget and other typical eu quarrels are sure to fade into the background as the leaders of the expanded union bask in the glow of the historic moment .

here 's a list of the most important changes . border controls eu citizens will be able to move freely throughout the union .
they will , however , need a valid personal identity card or passport to cross into the new member states because they are not yet members of the schengen agreement , which eliminates border checks in many western european countries .
border controls will continue between western and eastern european countries .
the eu will determine at a later date when the border checks with the new member states should be lifted .
much of it will depend on the ability of the new member states to secure the eu 's exterior borders .
only after eu conditions in this area are met can the new member states be brought into the schengen agreement and border controls be suspended .
customs following eu expansion , the new member states will be integrated into the eu 's internal market .
controls and tariffs on all goods will be eliminated .
however , certain goods will still be banned from germany and other western european countries , including guns and narcotics .
transport of tobacco will also be limited , with mobile groups being set up to help stop the smuggling business .
controls will also be carried out for illegal goods at western european borders .
in the german states of saxony and thuringia alone , 404 officials have been assigned patrolling duties and will be working closely with the federal border guard .
labor market in principle , eu citizens in europe have the freedom to choose where they want to work .
however , with the exception of ireland and britain , most of the existing eu member states are taking advantage of an optional provision negotiated in the accession agreement that permits countries to require work permits for members of the new eu states during the first two years after enlargement .
-lrb- citizens of malta and cyprus , however , will have full work rights from may 1 . -rrb-

purchasing property the new eu member states will also be required to allow the free movement of capital after joining the eu .
but limitations have been placed on agricultural and forest lands .
in these areas , the new member states have been given an opt-out provision that lasts for up to seven years -lrb- for poland the length has been extended to 12 years -rrb- .

the historic enlargement of the bloc is being hailed as a chance to spread political stability and economic prosperity , but it will also bring a host of challenges . several years in the making , the expansion of the european union next month will mark the beginning of a new era for a continent long separated by conflict and ideology .
with the cold war now consigned to memory , a large swathe of formerly communist eastern europe - as well as the mediterranean islands of malta and cyprus - will join the prosperous west . poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia , estonia , latvia and lithuania have all waited 15 years after emerging from the shadow of the soviet union to finally be part of europe 's most exclusive club .
that means for the first time in modern history , more than 450 million europeans will be united in a single political entity stretching from the atlantic ocean to the baltic states ' eastern border with russia . " first and foremost this is a peace project , " günter verheugen , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , told german public broadcaster ard last week .
" it creates peace , stability and security in the european region . " many eu citizens - both old and new - likely share those noble sentiments .
but unfortunately for public officials in brussels and national capitals across the continent , as may 1 approaches , ever more europeans are also beginning to question what other effects eastward expansion of the bloc will have . large and unmanageable ? some are worried a union of 25 will become unwieldy , unmanageable and less transparent than it is now .
others , especially in countries bordering the new member states like germany and austria , fear they will lose their jobs as businesses move east in search of cheap labor and poorer easterners come west looking work .
though many concerns may be overblown , experts do agree that there are a number of daunting challenges awaiting the enlarged eu . " it 's certainly going to exacerbate how the eu tries to manage things , " heather grabbe , the deputy director at the centre for european reform in london , told dw-world .
having followed eu expansion for the better part of a decade , grabbe believes adding members to the table at brussels will force members to push for further reform of eu decision-making .
" there wo n't be institutional gridlock - in the end it will muddle through . " she said she expected a number of issues to arise after the new members had settled in , which could then be tackled by the eu .
" hopefully any shortcomings should provoke more reform , " grabbe said . integration delayed economically , the 10 new members have been integrating with western europe for over a decade . but some aspects of integration will be delayed - because countries on both sides of the former east-west divide want it that way .

despite desperately needing foreign investment from western eu countries , warsaw has negotiated a 12-year ban on foreigners buying agricultural land .
poland fought hard for the restrictions because many poles are worried germans may be inclined to try and buy back land and real estate that they or their families once owned prior to be expelled from areas belonging to germany before world war ii . poland also showed that the new members wo n't shy away from blocking eu decision-making if it is in their interest when it last year led the campaign against the draft constitution for the bloc due to a dispute over voting rights .

as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers . it 's the time of the year when all hell breaks loose in berlin and neighborhoods like turkish-dominated kreuzberg become urban battle grounds , complete with burning cars , smashed shop windows and violent clashes between police and rampaging teenagers . may day rioting has become a tradition in berlin , harking back to may 1 , 1987 , when left-wing demonstrators first took to the streets to protest against what they called a " bourgeois " celebration of the 750th anniversary of the founding of berlin . since then , the rioting has returned to berlin with unfailing regularity each year , first in west berlin and then following german reunification in 1990 , in both halves of the united city . tougher , quicker action this year however , city authorities and police are clear they plan to put an end to the violence that mars the largely peaceful may day demonstrations and festive atmosphere of the street fairs and parties that dot berlin 's historic center near the brandenburg gate , the hip eastern neighborhood of prenzlauer berg as well as its western neighbor , the kreuzberg district . berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , whose administration has used a " soft glove " approach in the past , has said that the police will crack down on rioters this year . berlin 's interior minister erhart körting has announced that the police on saturday will take swifter and tougher action against vandals and rioters than last year and also keep a watch on small groups of rowdy teenagers in kreuzberg on may day eve to preempt any rioting . a strenuous week for the police may day will mark the culmination of a difficult week for berlin 's police , who have had to provide security for a series of high-profile events , starting with the two-day osce anti-semitism conference on april 28 and 29 .
the conference welcomed , among other dignitaries , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and israeli president moshe katsav .

police cars usually begin parking outside the park by early evening . angry protests set to heighten demonstrations despite the heightened security measures and the heightened police presence - some 8,000 will be on the streets - officials admit that this year 's demonstrations are likely to take on an even angrier tone than usual . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 200,000 trade unionists plan to take part in traditional may day parades through the heart of the city to protest the federal government 's cuts in health care , social services and retirement pensions . " this will contribute to a greater emotional and political edge to the demonstrations , " interior minister körting told the daily berliner zeitung .
" it would be naïve to believe that these days will pass peacefully . " in addition , some 2,500 neo-nazis plan to hold a rally in eastern berlin , with leftist counter-demonstrators vowing to stop them , setting the scene for possible clashes . berlin police president dieter glietsch has confirmed that the police will be more visible on may day this year and will clamp down on rioters . " we 've had enough " though the prospect of violence looms large on saturday , organizers of the various street festivals and parades remain undeterred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burnt-out cars in kreuzberg silke fischer , organizer of the famous " myfest " food and music festival around the oranien street in kreuzberg told the berliner zeitung that residents had had enough of " their cars being set ablaze and it being called a revolution .

though the 10 new eu states will become full members of the bloc and fully adopt community law , some exceptions will be applied - at least for interim periods .
here 's a list of the most important changes . border controls eu citizens will be able to move freely throughout the union .
they will , however , need a valid personal identity card or passport to cross into the new member states because they are not yet members of the schengen agreement , which eliminates border checks in many western european countries .
border controls will continue between western and eastern european countries .
the eu will determine at a later date when the border checks with the new member states should be lifted .
much of it will depend on the ability of the new member states to secure the eu 's exterior borders .
only after eu conditions in this area are met can the new member states be brought into the schengen agreement and border controls be suspended .
customs following eu expansion , the new member states will be integrated into the eu 's internal market .
controls and tariffs on all goods will be eliminated .
however , certain goods will still be banned from germany and other western european countries , including guns and narcotics .
transport of tobacco will also be limited , with mobile groups being set up to help stop the smuggling business .
controls will also be carried out for illegal goods at western european borders .
in the german states of saxony and thuringia alone , 404 officials have been assigned patrolling duties and will be working closely with the federal border guard .
labor market in principle , eu citizens in europe have the freedom to choose where they want to work .
however , with the exception of ireland and britain , most of the existing eu member states are taking advantage of an optional provision negotiated in the accession agreement that permits countries to require work permits for members of the new eu states during the first two years after enlargement .
-lrb- citizens of malta and cyprus , however , will have full work rights from may 1 . -rrb-
the work permit provision can be extended for up to seven years .
germany has said it intends to do , but a valid case for extending the opt-out clause must be presented to the european commission every two years .
currency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- in frankfurt the euro will not be extended to the new eu members immediately after accession , and all national currencies will be kept in place .
before they can join the euro , member states must fulfill the so-called maastricht criteria and successfully piggyback their currency to the euro for at least two years with a consistent exchange rate .
purchasing property the new eu member states will also be required to allow the free movement of capital after joining the eu .
but limitations have been placed on agricultural and forest lands .
in these areas , the new member states have been given an opt-out provision that lasts for up to seven years -lrb- for poland the length has been extended to 12 years -rrb- .
however , there are special rules that will allow farmers to lease land in the new member states .
purchase of homes and apartments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eastern european " plattenbau " apartment building .
following eu accession , eu citizens will be able to buy homes in all of the new eu countries - including single family homes and apartments .
however , they may not purchases the buildings exclusively as vacation homes .
the main exception here is slovenia , which has been granted the right to restrict the purchase of real estate for up to seven years after it joins the eu .
during a transition period of five years , poland , hungary , the czech republic and cyprus will maintain rules limiting the purchase of second apartments by citizens from other eu countries .
due to its extreme demographic and geographical situation , malta will also permanently restrict the purchase of second apartments in the price range up to € 70,000 -lrb- $ 83,500 -rrb- .
for other types of real estate , the limit will be € 1.2 million .
vacation apartments have also been classified as second apartments .
subsidiary rights self-employed eu citizens and firms have already had the right to establish subsidiary businesses in the eu candidate countries for some time now .
entrepreneurs in the new eu member states also have the right to establish businesses in western europe .
studying abroad the special eu academic program for the candidate states , the " east partnership " will remain in place .
but citizens of the new states will also now be able to participate in the eu 's socrates , leonardo da vinci and youth in europe programs .
healthcare on june 1 , the eu will introduce a european health insurance card .
at first it will be valid only in 12 eu countries - belgium , france , luxembourg , spain , germany , greece , ireland , sweden , denmark , finland , estonia , slovenia and norway .
but by the end of 2005 they will also be good in all eu countries .
the new cards replace the e111 forms currently used by europeans for healthcare reimbursement when visiting other european countries .
additionally , coverage will be extended from the current definition of procedures that are " essential without delay " to just " essential services , " meaning a lot more treatment options will be covered .
but until the cards are introduced , those covered by health care service in europe must first get approval from their homeland insurer before seeking services in another eu country .
pensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden girls with their entry into the european union , the so-called community law will now apply in the new eu member states .
that means that when a person applies for their pension , regardless of where they are living in the eu , all the contributions they have made in countries throughout the eu will be calculated in determining the sum they are to receive .
but the conditions for receiving a pension - age limits , minimum number of years that have been paid into the system or disability - will still be determined at the national level .
there is currently no centralized eu pensions system .
in all cases , a worker must pay into the pension system of the country where he or she is employed .
car rentals the legality of existing restrictions in western europe that permit car rental agencies to ban the rental of certain car makes for travel into eastern europe will still apply . from dw-world content partner mdr.de -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

eu enlargement will bring about many changes .
for bargain hunters fond of cruising duty-free zones along the polish border , it will mean the end of an era .
tour operators reliant on the trade are bracing for the blow . duty-free zones offering liquor , cigarettes and luxury items tax-free sprang up in germany in the mid-1950s - mostly in airports , but also on ships travelling in international waters .
one such zone is on the oder river that separates germany and poland .
since 1998 , a small section of the water on the polish side has been duty-free , and a lucrative business has built up on-board ships travelling in the area .
such an excursion has become known as a " butterfahrt " - literally “ butter trips ” - because they started out as a way for people to get cheap butter .
last year over one million germans travelled to these tax-free waters .
but with poland 's entry into the european union on may 1 , the duty-free law will no longer be valid : germany 's " butterfahrt " industry seems doomed to melt away , leaving a puddle of unemployment , deserted ships and empty buses in its wake . free lunch and big savings on a chilly april morning in berlin , double-decker buses lined one of the main boulevards as far as the eye can see .
the passengers on the buses were destined for a " butterfahrt " on the oder .
currently a " butterfahrt " costs just a few euros , with the shipping companies paying subsidies of up to 50 percent to the bus companies that cart people their way .
" the ' butterfahrt ' is an excursion package of bus and ship travel , " anna wiese , marketing director for berlin-based holiday travels agency , told deutsche welle .
" our buses pick up guests in berlin and bring them to various ports on the oder , where they board the duty-free ships .
one tour also supplies lunch and a surprise gift to each guest . " in the buses , bargain hunters study the flyers announcing the latest sales awaiting them on-board the floating supermarkets .
brand-name liquor and cigarettes can be bought for a fraction of the price paid in german shops .
for example , a carton of philip morris cigarettes costs just € 8.50 -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- .
in germany , the same carton fetches up to € 36 . a culture of savings the incredible bargains make the " butterfahrt " irresistible , bus driver dieter draht said .
" some guests take the trip every day , just to buy duty-free cigarettes , whisky , and who knows what else , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on a recent " butter trip " boat on the oder river .
the " butterfahrt " has developed into nothing less than a tradition among berlin ’ s urban poor .
its popularity reflects the state of germany ’ s economy .
it has also become something of a social occasion , part of the rage for discount shopping that permeates germany . " good quality and cheap , " said one customer when asked why he had come along on the trip .
" all of us here are modest earners and people dependent on social welfare and unemployment money or retired . " get it while the goings good but starting in may , there will be no more subsidies for the bus companies or free lunches for the travelers .
the price of the trip will double and all goods bought on board will be taxed .
so in the final weeks of duty-free shopping , " butterfahrt " business has been booming . holiday travel said they were sending out twice as many buses a day , with customers cramming in as many cheap shopping trips as they could before the good times were over .
" last week we went three times , and this week we are going twice , " said one customer .
" we ’ ve got to take advantage of these last weeks as much as we can . " end of an era one of the regular guests was indignant about no longer being able to get around germany ’ s high tobacco tax .
" smokers are supporting the nation , " he said . the shipping industry is just as unhappy about the situation : hundreds of jobs will be lost after may 1 .
still , some hope to keep the " butterfahrt " alive by attracting a new clientele - one just as interested in the scenic bus and boat ride as in cheap booze and cigarettes . anna wiese from holiday travels pointed out that only time will tell .
" we will see a large chunk of our business fall away , but we will still continue to offer the ' butterfahrt ' excursions - but at a higher price , " she said .
" we must see what our guests are prepared to pay . "
goods on-board the ships will become more expensive , but they will still be cheaper than in germany , wiese added . leah mcdonnell -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe read dw-world 's eu expansion dossier .

for example , a carton of philip morris cigarettes costs just € 8.50 -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- .
in germany , the same carton fetches up to € 36 . a culture of savings the incredible bargains make the " butterfahrt " irresistible , bus driver dieter draht said .
" some guests take the trip every day , just to buy duty-free cigarettes , whisky , and who knows what else , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on a recent " butter trip " boat on the oder river .
the " butterfahrt " has developed into nothing less than a tradition among berlin ’ s urban poor .
its popularity reflects the state of germany ’ s economy .
it has also become something of a social occasion , part of the rage for discount shopping that permeates germany . " good quality and cheap , " said one customer when asked why he had come along on the trip .
" all of us here are modest earners and people dependent on social welfare and unemployment money or retired . " get it while the goings good but starting in may , there will be no more subsidies for the bus companies or free lunches for the travelers .
the price of the trip will double and all goods bought on board will be taxed .
so in the final weeks of duty-free shopping , " butterfahrt " business has been booming . holiday travel said they were sending out twice as many buses a day , with customers cramming in as many cheap shopping trips as they could before the good times were over .
" last week we went three times , and this week we are going twice , " said one customer .
" we ’ ve got to take advantage of these last weeks as much as we can . " end of an era one of the regular guests was indignant about no longer being able to get around germany ’ s high tobacco tax .
" smokers are supporting the nation , " he said . the shipping industry is just as unhappy about the situation : hundreds of jobs will be lost after may 1 .
still , some hope to keep the " butterfahrt " alive by attracting a new clientele - one just as interested in the scenic bus and boat ride as in cheap booze and cigarettes . anna wiese from holiday travels pointed out that only time will tell .
" we will see a large chunk of our business fall away , but we will still continue to offer the ' butterfahrt ' excursions - but at a higher price , " she said .
" we must see what our guests are prepared to pay . "
goods on-board the ships will become more expensive , but they will still be cheaper than in germany , wiese added . leah mcdonnell -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe read dw-world 's eu expansion dossier .

it hopes that membership will strengthen already close economic ties to europe .
one of the most important contacts for foreign businesses is siim raie , 26 . siim raie is young , but he is already at the top .
at 26 , he is the general director of the estonian chamber of commerce in tallinn .
that he has managed to climb so high at such a tender age surprises him least of all .
he is no rarity in estonia .
wherever you look , young people occupy key positions .
raie says , " this is the transition process that we are going through .
it is just that in newly independent estonia so many new positions were created , so many new organisations were created that new leaders were needed .
so we didn ’ t have the whole big generation of leaders back then needed for the market economy – young people did have a real good chance to become executives . "
portraits of raie ’ s predecessors look down from the walls of the gallery at the chamber of commerce .
there are only two .
one led the organisation from 1925 to 1940 .
the next came only in 1989 , shortly before estonia gained independence and began to develop a market economy .
the chamber of commerce was re-established at that time .
the organisation is located right in the centre of tallinn , close to the seat of government and the ministries .
the site has made it easier to make many informal contacts , over lunch for example .
after all , siim raie is also the most important lobbyist in the estonian economy .
the country has developed rapidly in the past decade .
growth rates of between six and seven percent annually make it an interesting place for foreign investors to put their money .
delegations from industries and chamber of commerce representatives from other eu countries arrive regularly .
siim raie is their first contact .
he sends them on to possible partners in estonia .
three-quarters of all of the goods produced in estonia are already being exported to the eu .
raie believes membership will strengthen economic ties even further .
part of the credit for the economic upswing can go to the young leadership elite that took part in the transition to democracy and a market economy .
raie describes his work , " oh , it is exciting .
it is not only me , but the whole generation of young executives in the country .
we do have a unique experience , which people of our age in the other european countries probably don ’ t have .
we have been in the process of changes , we are the ones making the changes and it is exciting .
and it makes you feel like the sky is the limit .
and i guess that is what we bring along to the european union as well : a generation of young executives who know how to make changes , how to make things happen . "
siim raie was thirteen when estonia gained independence from the soviet union .
at the time , his country began to orient itself towards europe , politically , economically and culturally .
today , siim raie has no questions about his identity as a european .
he says , " when i was in the united states people asked me ‘ where are you from ? ’
i tried to explain to them ‘ estonia , close to finland , next to the baltic sea ... ’ and nobody really understood .
but when you said that you are from europe , everybody knew it .

the historic enlargement of the bloc is being hailed as a chance to spread political stability and economic prosperity , but it will also bring a host of challenges . several years in the making , the expansion of the european union next month will mark the beginning of a new era for a continent long separated by conflict and ideology .
with the cold war now consigned to memory , a large swathe of formerly communist eastern europe - as well as the mediterranean islands of malta and cyprus - will join the prosperous west . poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia , estonia , latvia and lithuania have all waited 15 years after emerging from the shadow of the soviet union to finally be part of europe 's most exclusive club .
that means for the first time in modern history , more than 450 million europeans will be united in a single political entity stretching from the atlantic ocean to the baltic states ' eastern border with russia . " first and foremost this is a peace project , " günter verheugen , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , told german public broadcaster ard last week .
" it creates peace , stability and security in the european region . " many eu citizens - both old and new - likely share those noble sentiments .
but unfortunately for public officials in brussels and national capitals across the continent , as may 1 approaches , ever more europeans are also beginning to question what other effects eastward expansion of the bloc will have . large and unmanageable ? some are worried a union of 25 will become unwieldy , unmanageable and less transparent than it is now .
others , especially in countries bordering the new member states like germany and austria , fear they will lose their jobs as businesses move east in search of cheap labor and poorer easterners come west looking work .
though many concerns may be overblown , experts do agree that there are a number of daunting challenges awaiting the enlarged eu . " it 's certainly going to exacerbate how the eu tries to manage things , " heather grabbe , the deputy director at the centre for european reform in london , told dw-world .
having followed eu expansion for the better part of a decade , grabbe believes adding members to the table at brussels will force members to push for further reform of eu decision-making .
" there wo n't be institutional gridlock - in the end it will muddle through . " she said she expected a number of issues to arise after the new members had settled in , which could then be tackled by the eu .
" hopefully any shortcomings should provoke more reform , " grabbe said . integration delayed economically , the 10 new members have been integrating with western europe for over a decade . but some aspects of integration will be delayed - because countries on both sides of the former east-west divide want it that way .
most glaring will be the lack of new eu citizens ' ability to work legally in the old eu countries .
all of the western nations , with the exception of britain and ireland , will impose some sort of restrictions on their labor markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fearing germany will be overrun by unemployed poles , the government in berlin is likely to refuse them working privileges for a full seven years as allowed by eu treaties .
this has naturally incensed poland , which calls german concerns irrational . " there is no reason to expect there will be a mass inflow of poles to the german labor market .
but the german domestic situation does not facilitate a rational approach to this issue , " outgoing polish prime minister leszek miller said last month . poland , however , has its own reservations .
despite desperately needing foreign investment from western eu countries , warsaw has negotiated a 12-year ban on foreigners buying agricultural land .
poland fought hard for the restrictions because many poles are worried germans may be inclined to try and buy back land and real estate that they or their families once owned prior to be expelled from areas belonging to germany before world war ii . poland also showed that the new members wo n't shy away from blocking eu decision-making if it is in their interest when it last year led the campaign against the draft constitution for the bloc due to a dispute over voting rights .
warsaw has since dropped its hardliner stance on the matter , but only because its main ally , the conservative-led government of spain , was voted out of office in march . row over budget issues the constitution , along with the future funding of the eu , will be two of the top issues in brussels immediately following the accession of the 10 new countries .
fearing the poor east could increase the demand for aid in coming years , net contributor nations have already been arguing for months that the eu budget should be capped at one percent of each country 's gross national product . the european commission has dismissed such calls , arguing brussels would be expected to achieve more with less .
and those countries that have been the biggest beneficiaries of eu structural funds in past , in particular spain , greece and portugal , are unhappy aid will be diverted to the less fortunate new member states .
but some experts counter the eu does n't need more money , brussels just needs change its spending habits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas mauer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin singled out the often criticized the eu 's common agricultural policy , which subsidizes europe 's farmers with nearly half of the bloc 's total € 100-billion budget . " we have to ask ourselves what do we want to pay for ?
that agriculture takes up so much is longer responsible .
those funds could be put into research and development or other investments that could help all of europe , " mauer told dw-world . such disputes over money may resolve themselves if expansion brings real economic benefits to members both old and new as is expected .
according to some estimates , the new members ' gross domestic product could increase by 1.5 percent and some 300,000 new jobs will be created in the old countries . and as may 1 approaches , quibbling over the budget and other typical eu quarrels are sure to fade into the background as the leaders of the expanded union bask in the glow of the historic moment .

the historic enlargement of the bloc is being hailed as a chance to spread political stability and economic prosperity , but it will also bring a host of challenges . several years in the making , the expansion of the european union next month will mark the beginning of a new era for a continent long separated by conflict and ideology .
with the cold war now consigned to memory , a large swathe of formerly communist eastern europe - as well as the mediterranean islands of malta and cyprus - will join the prosperous west . poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia , estonia , latvia and lithuania have all waited 15 years after emerging from the shadow of the soviet union to finally be part of europe 's most exclusive club .
that means for the first time in modern history , more than 450 million europeans will be united in a single political entity stretching from the atlantic ocean to the baltic states ' eastern border with russia . " first and foremost this is a peace project , " günter verheugen , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , told german public broadcaster ard last week .
" it creates peace , stability and security in the european region . " many eu citizens - both old and new - likely share those noble sentiments .
but unfortunately for public officials in brussels and national capitals across the continent , as may 1 approaches , ever more europeans are also beginning to question what other effects eastward expansion of the bloc will have . large and unmanageable ? some are worried a union of 25 will become unwieldy , unmanageable and less transparent than it is now .
others , especially in countries bordering the new member states like germany and austria , fear they will lose their jobs as businesses move east in search of cheap labor and poorer easterners come west looking work .
though many concerns may be overblown , experts do agree that there are a number of daunting challenges awaiting the enlarged eu . " it 's certainly going to exacerbate how the eu tries to manage things , " heather grabbe , the deputy director at the centre for european reform in london , told dw-world .
having followed eu expansion for the better part of a decade , grabbe believes adding members to the table at brussels will force members to push for further reform of eu decision-making .
" there wo n't be institutional gridlock - in the end it will muddle through . " she said she expected a number of issues to arise after the new members had settled in , which could then be tackled by the eu .
" hopefully any shortcomings should provoke more reform , " grabbe said . integration delayed economically , the 10 new members have been integrating with western europe for over a decade . but some aspects of integration will be delayed - because countries on both sides of the former east-west divide want it that way .
most glaring will be the lack of new eu citizens ' ability to work legally in the old eu countries .
all of the western nations , with the exception of britain and ireland , will impose some sort of restrictions on their labor markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fearing germany will be overrun by unemployed poles , the government in berlin is likely to refuse them working privileges for a full seven years as allowed by eu treaties .
this has naturally incensed poland , which calls german concerns irrational . " there is no reason to expect there will be a mass inflow of poles to the german labor market .
but the german domestic situation does not facilitate a rational approach to this issue , " outgoing polish prime minister leszek miller said last month . poland , however , has its own reservations .
despite desperately needing foreign investment from western eu countries , warsaw has negotiated a 12-year ban on foreigners buying agricultural land .
poland fought hard for the restrictions because many poles are worried germans may be inclined to try and buy back land and real estate that they or their families once owned prior to be expelled from areas belonging to germany before world war ii . poland also showed that the new members wo n't shy away from blocking eu decision-making if it is in their interest when it last year led the campaign against the draft constitution for the bloc due to a dispute over voting rights .
warsaw has since dropped its hardliner stance on the matter , but only because its main ally , the conservative-led government of spain , was voted out of office in march . row over budget issues the constitution , along with the future funding of the eu , will be two of the top issues in brussels immediately following the accession of the 10 new countries .
fearing the poor east could increase the demand for aid in coming years , net contributor nations have already been arguing for months that the eu budget should be capped at one percent of each country 's gross national product . the european commission has dismissed such calls , arguing brussels would be expected to achieve more with less .
and those countries that have been the biggest beneficiaries of eu structural funds in past , in particular spain , greece and portugal , are unhappy aid will be diverted to the less fortunate new member states .
but some experts counter the eu does n't need more money , brussels just needs change its spending habits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas mauer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin singled out the often criticized the eu 's common agricultural policy , which subsidizes europe 's farmers with nearly half of the bloc 's total € 100-billion budget . " we have to ask ourselves what do we want to pay for ?
that agriculture takes up so much is longer responsible .
those funds could be put into research and development or other investments that could help all of europe , " mauer told dw-world . such disputes over money may resolve themselves if expansion brings real economic benefits to members both old and new as is expected .
according to some estimates , the new members ' gross domestic product could increase by 1.5 percent and some 300,000 new jobs will be created in the old countries . and as may 1 approaches , quibbling over the budget and other typical eu quarrels are sure to fade into the background as the leaders of the expanded union bask in the glow of the historic moment .

as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers . it 's the time of the year when all hell breaks loose in berlin and neighborhoods like turkish-dominated kreuzberg become urban battle grounds , complete with burning cars , smashed shop windows and violent clashes between police and rampaging teenagers . may day rioting has become a tradition in berlin , harking back to may 1 , 1987 , when left-wing demonstrators first took to the streets to protest against what they called a " bourgeois " celebration of the 750th anniversary of the founding of berlin . since then , the rioting has returned to berlin with unfailing regularity each year , first in west berlin and then following german reunification in 1990 , in both halves of the united city . tougher , quicker action this year however , city authorities and police are clear they plan to put an end to the violence that mars the largely peaceful may day demonstrations and festive atmosphere of the street fairs and parties that dot berlin 's historic center near the brandenburg gate , the hip eastern neighborhood of prenzlauer berg as well as its western neighbor , the kreuzberg district . berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , whose administration has used a " soft glove " approach in the past , has said that the police will crack down on rioters this year . berlin 's interior minister erhart körting has announced that the police on saturday will take swifter and tougher action against vandals and rioters than last year and also keep a watch on small groups of rowdy teenagers in kreuzberg on may day eve to preempt any rioting . a strenuous week for the police may day will mark the culmination of a difficult week for berlin 's police , who have had to provide security for a series of high-profile events , starting with the two-day osce anti-semitism conference on april 28 and 29 .
the conference welcomed , among other dignitaries , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and israeli president moshe katsav .

" it would be naïve to believe that these days will pass peacefully . " in addition , some 2,500 neo-nazis plan to hold a rally in eastern berlin , with leftist counter-demonstrators vowing to stop them , setting the scene for possible clashes . berlin police president dieter glietsch has confirmed that the police will be more visible on may day this year and will clamp down on rioters .

eu enlargement will bring about many changes .
for bargain hunters fond of cruising duty-free zones along the polish border , it will mean the end of an era .
tour operators reliant on the trade are bracing for the blow . duty-free zones offering liquor , cigarettes and luxury items tax-free sprang up in germany in the mid-1950s - mostly in airports , but also on ships travelling in international waters .
one such zone is on the oder river that separates germany and poland .
since 1998 , a small section of the water on the polish side has been duty-free , and a lucrative business has built up on-board ships travelling in the area .
such an excursion has become known as a " butterfahrt " - literally “ butter trips ” - because they started out as a way for people to get cheap butter .
last year over one million germans travelled to these tax-free waters .
but with poland 's entry into the european union on may 1 , the duty-free law will no longer be valid : germany 's " butterfahrt " industry seems doomed to melt away , leaving a puddle of unemployment , deserted ships and empty buses in its wake . free lunch and big savings on a chilly april morning in berlin , double-decker buses lined one of the main boulevards as far as the eye can see .
the passengers on the buses were destined for a " butterfahrt " on the oder .
currently a " butterfahrt " costs just a few euros , with the shipping companies paying subsidies of up to 50 percent to the bus companies that cart people their way .
" the ' butterfahrt ' is an excursion package of bus and ship travel , " anna wiese , marketing director for berlin-based holiday travels agency , told deutsche welle .
" our buses pick up guests in berlin and bring them to various ports on the oder , where they board the duty-free ships .
one tour also supplies lunch and a surprise gift to each guest . " in the buses , bargain hunters study the flyers announcing the latest sales awaiting them on-board the floating supermarkets .
brand-name liquor and cigarettes can be bought for a fraction of the price paid in german shops .
for example , a carton of philip morris cigarettes costs just € 8.50 -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- .
in germany , the same carton fetches up to € 36 . a culture of savings the incredible bargains make the " butterfahrt " irresistible , bus driver dieter draht said .
" some guests take the trip every day , just to buy duty-free cigarettes , whisky , and who knows what else , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on a recent " butter trip " boat on the oder river .
the " butterfahrt " has developed into nothing less than a tradition among berlin ’ s urban poor .
its popularity reflects the state of germany ’ s economy .
it has also become something of a social occasion , part of the rage for discount shopping that permeates germany . " good quality and cheap , " said one customer when asked why he had come along on the trip .
" all of us here are modest earners and people dependent on social welfare and unemployment money or retired . " get it while the goings good but starting in may , there will be no more subsidies for the bus companies or free lunches for the travelers .
the price of the trip will double and all goods bought on board will be taxed .
so in the final weeks of duty-free shopping , " butterfahrt " business has been booming . holiday travel said they were sending out twice as many buses a day , with customers cramming in as many cheap shopping trips as they could before the good times were over .
" last week we went three times , and this week we are going twice , " said one customer .
" we ’ ve got to take advantage of these last weeks as much as we can . " end of an era one of the regular guests was indignant about no longer being able to get around germany ’ s high tobacco tax .
" smokers are supporting the nation , " he said . the shipping industry is just as unhappy about the situation : hundreds of jobs will be lost after may 1 .
still , some hope to keep the " butterfahrt " alive by attracting a new clientele - one just as interested in the scenic bus and boat ride as in cheap booze and cigarettes . anna wiese from holiday travels pointed out that only time will tell .
" we will see a large chunk of our business fall away , but we will still continue to offer the ' butterfahrt ' excursions - but at a higher price , " she said .
" we must see what our guests are prepared to pay . "
goods on-board the ships will become more expensive , but they will still be cheaper than in germany , wiese added . leah mcdonnell -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe read dw-world 's eu expansion dossier .

the passengers on the buses were destined for a " butterfahrt " on the oder .
currently a " butterfahrt " costs just a few euros , with the shipping companies paying subsidies of up to 50 percent to the bus companies that cart people their way .
" the ' butterfahrt ' is an excursion package of bus and ship travel , " anna wiese , marketing director for berlin-based holiday travels agency , told deutsche welle .
" our buses pick up guests in berlin and bring them to various ports on the oder , where they board the duty-free ships .

brand-name liquor and cigarettes can be bought for a fraction of the price paid in german shops .
for example , a carton of philip morris cigarettes costs just € 8.50 -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- .
in germany , the same carton fetches up to € 36 . a culture of savings the incredible bargains make the " butterfahrt " irresistible , bus driver dieter draht said .
" some guests take the trip every day , just to buy duty-free cigarettes , whisky , and who knows what else , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on a recent " butter trip " boat on the oder river .
the " butterfahrt " has developed into nothing less than a tradition among berlin ’ s urban poor .

it has also become something of a social occasion , part of the rage for discount shopping that permeates germany . " good quality and cheap , " said one customer when asked why he had come along on the trip .
" all of us here are modest earners and people dependent on social welfare and unemployment money or retired . " get it while the goings good but starting in may , there will be no more subsidies for the bus companies or free lunches for the travelers .
the price of the trip will double and all goods bought on board will be taxed .
so in the final weeks of duty-free shopping , " butterfahrt " business has been booming . holiday travel said they were sending out twice as many buses a day , with customers cramming in as many cheap shopping trips as they could before the good times were over .
" last week we went three times , and this week we are going twice , " said one customer .
" we ’ ve got to take advantage of these last weeks as much as we can . " end of an era one of the regular guests was indignant about no longer being able to get around germany ’ s high tobacco tax .
" smokers are supporting the nation , " he said . the shipping industry is just as unhappy about the situation : hundreds of jobs will be lost after may 1 .
still , some hope to keep the " butterfahrt " alive by attracting a new clientele - one just as interested in the scenic bus and boat ride as in cheap booze and cigarettes . anna wiese from holiday travels pointed out that only time will tell .
" we will see a large chunk of our business fall away , but we will still continue to offer the ' butterfahrt ' excursions - but at a higher price , " she said .

as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers . it 's the time of the year when all hell breaks loose in berlin and neighborhoods like turkish-dominated kreuzberg become urban battle grounds , complete with burning cars , smashed shop windows and violent clashes between police and rampaging teenagers . may day rioting has become a tradition in berlin , harking back to may 1 , 1987 , when left-wing demonstrators first took to the streets to protest against what they called a " bourgeois " celebration of the 750th anniversary of the founding of berlin . since then , the rioting has returned to berlin with unfailing regularity each year , first in west berlin and then following german reunification in 1990 , in both halves of the united city . tougher , quicker action this year however , city authorities and police are clear they plan to put an end to the violence that mars the largely peaceful may day demonstrations and festive atmosphere of the street fairs and parties that dot berlin 's historic center near the brandenburg gate , the hip eastern neighborhood of prenzlauer berg as well as its western neighbor , the kreuzberg district . berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , whose administration has used a " soft glove " approach in the past , has said that the police will crack down on rioters this year . berlin 's interior minister erhart körting has announced that the police on saturday will take swifter and tougher action against vandals and rioters than last year and also keep a watch on small groups of rowdy teenagers in kreuzberg on may day eve to preempt any rioting . a strenuous week for the police may day will mark the culmination of a difficult week for berlin 's police , who have had to provide security for a series of high-profile events , starting with the two-day osce anti-semitism conference on april 28 and 29 .
the conference welcomed , among other dignitaries , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and israeli president moshe katsav .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police in berlin police reinforcements were called in from other german states to assist local police , taking the total count of police officers to around 15,000 this past week , turning downtown berlin into a virtual fortress . on friday night before may day , police will be kept busy as several hundred high-ranking officials from all across europe converge on berlin 's central gendarmen markt square to take part in ceremonies marking the expansion of the european union by ten new members . the night before may day is also celebrated in germany as walpurgisnacht , a pagan ritual to usher in the spring , but which is also used as an occasion by leftist young people in berlin to go on a violent , often drunken rampages in the prenzlauer berg district .
police cars usually begin parking outside the park by early evening . angry protests set to heighten demonstrations despite the heightened security measures and the heightened police presence - some 8,000 will be on the streets - officials admit that this year 's demonstrations are likely to take on an even angrier tone than usual . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 200,000 trade unionists plan to take part in traditional may day parades through the heart of the city to protest the federal government 's cuts in health care , social services and retirement pensions . " this will contribute to a greater emotional and political edge to the demonstrations , " interior minister körting told the daily berliner zeitung .
" it would be naïve to believe that these days will pass peacefully . " in addition , some 2,500 neo-nazis plan to hold a rally in eastern berlin , with leftist counter-demonstrators vowing to stop them , setting the scene for possible clashes . berlin police president dieter glietsch has confirmed that the police will be more visible on may day this year and will clamp down on rioters . " we 've had enough " though the prospect of violence looms large on saturday , organizers of the various street festivals and parades remain undeterred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burnt-out cars in kreuzberg silke fischer , organizer of the famous " myfest " food and music festival around the oranien street in kreuzberg told the berliner zeitung that residents had had enough of " their cars being set ablaze and it being called a revolution .

as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers . it 's the time of the year when all hell breaks loose in berlin and neighborhoods like turkish-dominated kreuzberg become urban battle grounds , complete with burning cars , smashed shop windows and violent clashes between police and rampaging teenagers . may day rioting has become a tradition in berlin , harking back to may 1 , 1987 , when left-wing demonstrators first took to the streets to protest against what they called a " bourgeois " celebration of the 750th anniversary of the founding of berlin . since then , the rioting has returned to berlin with unfailing regularity each year , first in west berlin and then following german reunification in 1990 , in both halves of the united city . tougher , quicker action this year however , city authorities and police are clear they plan to put an end to the violence that mars the largely peaceful may day demonstrations and festive atmosphere of the street fairs and parties that dot berlin 's historic center near the brandenburg gate , the hip eastern neighborhood of prenzlauer berg as well as its western neighbor , the kreuzberg district . berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , whose administration has used a " soft glove " approach in the past , has said that the police will crack down on rioters this year . berlin 's interior minister erhart körting has announced that the police on saturday will take swifter and tougher action against vandals and rioters than last year and also keep a watch on small groups of rowdy teenagers in kreuzberg on may day eve to preempt any rioting . a strenuous week for the police may day will mark the culmination of a difficult week for berlin 's police , who have had to provide security for a series of high-profile events , starting with the two-day osce anti-semitism conference on april 28 and 29 .

police cars usually begin parking outside the park by early evening . angry protests set to heighten demonstrations despite the heightened security measures and the heightened police presence - some 8,000 will be on the streets - officials admit that this year 's demonstrations are likely to take on an even angrier tone than usual . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 200,000 trade unionists plan to take part in traditional may day parades through the heart of the city to protest the federal government 's cuts in health care , social services and retirement pensions .

" it would be naïve to believe that these days will pass peacefully . " in addition , some 2,500 neo-nazis plan to hold a rally in eastern berlin , with leftist counter-demonstrators vowing to stop them , setting the scene for possible clashes . berlin police president dieter glietsch has confirmed that the police will be more visible on may day this year and will clamp down on rioters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.04.2004 what will change with eu expansion ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border controls will remain in eastern europe - at least for now .
though the 10 new eu states will become full members of the bloc and fully adopt community law , some exceptions will be applied - at least for interim periods .
here 's a list of the most important changes . border controls eu citizens will be able to move freely throughout the union .
they will , however , need a valid personal identity card or passport to cross into the new member states because they are not yet members of the schengen agreement , which eliminates border checks in many western european countries .
border controls will continue between western and eastern european countries .
the eu will determine at a later date when the border checks with the new member states should be lifted .
much of it will depend on the ability of the new member states to secure the eu 's exterior borders .
only after eu conditions in this area are met can the new member states be brought into the schengen agreement and border controls be suspended .
customs following eu expansion , the new member states will be integrated into the eu 's internal market .
controls and tariffs on all goods will be eliminated .
however , certain goods will still be banned from germany and other western european countries , including guns and narcotics .
transport of tobacco will also be limited , with mobile groups being set up to help stop the smuggling business .
controls will also be carried out for illegal goods at western european borders .
in the german states of saxony and thuringia alone , 404 officials have been assigned patrolling duties and will be working closely with the federal border guard .
labor market in principle , eu citizens in europe have the freedom to choose where they want to work .
however , with the exception of ireland and britain , most of the existing eu member states are taking advantage of an optional provision negotiated in the accession agreement that permits countries to require work permits for members of the new eu states during the first two years after enlargement .
-lrb- citizens of malta and cyprus , however , will have full work rights from may 1 . -rrb-
the work permit provision can be extended for up to seven years .
germany has said it intends to do , but a valid case for extending the opt-out clause must be presented to the european commission every two years .
currency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- in frankfurt the euro will not be extended to the new eu members immediately after accession , and all national currencies will be kept in place .
before they can join the euro , member states must fulfill the so-called maastricht criteria and successfully piggyback their currency to the euro for at least two years with a consistent exchange rate .
purchasing property the new eu member states will also be required to allow the free movement of capital after joining the eu .
but limitations have been placed on agricultural and forest lands .
in these areas , the new member states have been given an opt-out provision that lasts for up to seven years -lrb- for poland the length has been extended to 12 years -rrb- .
however , there are special rules that will allow farmers to lease land in the new member states .
purchase of homes and apartments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eastern european " plattenbau " apartment building .
following eu accession , eu citizens will be able to buy homes in all of the new eu countries - including single family homes and apartments .
however , they may not purchases the buildings exclusively as vacation homes .
the main exception here is slovenia , which has been granted the right to restrict the purchase of real estate for up to seven years after it joins the eu .
during a transition period of five years , poland , hungary , the czech republic and cyprus will maintain rules limiting the purchase of second apartments by citizens from other eu countries .
due to its extreme demographic and geographical situation , malta will also permanently restrict the purchase of second apartments in the price range up to € 70,000 -lrb- $ 83,500 -rrb- .
for other types of real estate , the limit will be € 1.2 million .
vacation apartments have also been classified as second apartments .
subsidiary rights self-employed eu citizens and firms have already had the right to establish subsidiary businesses in the eu candidate countries for some time now .
entrepreneurs in the new eu member states also have the right to establish businesses in western europe .
studying abroad the special eu academic program for the candidate states , the " east partnership " will remain in place .
but citizens of the new states will also now be able to participate in the eu 's socrates , leonardo da vinci and youth in europe programs .
healthcare on june 1 , the eu will introduce a european health insurance card .
at first it will be valid only in 12 eu countries - belgium , france , luxembourg , spain , germany , greece , ireland , sweden , denmark , finland , estonia , slovenia and norway .
but by the end of 2005 they will also be good in all eu countries .
the new cards replace the e111 forms currently used by europeans for healthcare reimbursement when visiting other european countries .
additionally , coverage will be extended from the current definition of procedures that are " essential without delay " to just " essential services , " meaning a lot more treatment options will be covered .
but until the cards are introduced , those covered by health care service in europe must first get approval from their homeland insurer before seeking services in another eu country .
pensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden girls with their entry into the european union , the so-called community law will now apply in the new eu member states .
that means that when a person applies for their pension , regardless of where they are living in the eu , all the contributions they have made in countries throughout the eu will be calculated in determining the sum they are to receive .
but the conditions for receiving a pension - age limits , minimum number of years that have been paid into the system or disability - will still be determined at the national level .
there is currently no centralized eu pensions system .
in all cases , a worker must pay into the pension system of the country where he or she is employed .
car rentals the legality of existing restrictions in western europe that permit car rental agencies to ban the rental of certain car makes for travel into eastern europe will still apply . from dw-world content partner mdr.de -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

police cars usually begin parking outside the park by early evening . angry protests set to heighten demonstrations despite the heightened security measures and the heightened police presence - some 8,000 will be on the streets - officials admit that this year 's demonstrations are likely to take on an even angrier tone than usual . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 200,000 trade unionists plan to take part in traditional may day parades through the heart of the city to protest the federal government 's cuts in health care , social services and retirement pensions .

" it would be naïve to believe that these days will pass peacefully . " in addition , some 2,500 neo-nazis plan to hold a rally in eastern berlin , with leftist counter-demonstrators vowing to stop them , setting the scene for possible clashes . berlin police president dieter glietsch has confirmed that the police will be more visible on may day this year and will clamp down on rioters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.04.2004 what will change with eu expansion ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : border controls will remain in eastern europe - at least for now .
though the 10 new eu states will become full members of the bloc and fully adopt community law , some exceptions will be applied - at least for interim periods .
here 's a list of the most important changes . border controls eu citizens will be able to move freely throughout the union .
they will , however , need a valid personal identity card or passport to cross into the new member states because they are not yet members of the schengen agreement , which eliminates border checks in many western european countries .
border controls will continue between western and eastern european countries .
the eu will determine at a later date when the border checks with the new member states should be lifted .
much of it will depend on the ability of the new member states to secure the eu 's exterior borders .
only after eu conditions in this area are met can the new member states be brought into the schengen agreement and border controls be suspended .
customs following eu expansion , the new member states will be integrated into the eu 's internal market .
controls and tariffs on all goods will be eliminated .
however , certain goods will still be banned from germany and other western european countries , including guns and narcotics .
transport of tobacco will also be limited , with mobile groups being set up to help stop the smuggling business .
controls will also be carried out for illegal goods at western european borders .
in the german states of saxony and thuringia alone , 404 officials have been assigned patrolling duties and will be working closely with the federal border guard .
labor market in principle , eu citizens in europe have the freedom to choose where they want to work .
however , with the exception of ireland and britain , most of the existing eu member states are taking advantage of an optional provision negotiated in the accession agreement that permits countries to require work permits for members of the new eu states during the first two years after enlargement .
-lrb- citizens of malta and cyprus , however , will have full work rights from may 1 . -rrb-
the work permit provision can be extended for up to seven years .
germany has said it intends to do , but a valid case for extending the opt-out clause must be presented to the european commission every two years .
currency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- in frankfurt the euro will not be extended to the new eu members immediately after accession , and all national currencies will be kept in place .
before they can join the euro , member states must fulfill the so-called maastricht criteria and successfully piggyback their currency to the euro for at least two years with a consistent exchange rate .
purchasing property the new eu member states will also be required to allow the free movement of capital after joining the eu .
but limitations have been placed on agricultural and forest lands .
in these areas , the new member states have been given an opt-out provision that lasts for up to seven years -lrb- for poland the length has been extended to 12 years -rrb- .
however , there are special rules that will allow farmers to lease land in the new member states .
purchase of homes and apartments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eastern european " plattenbau " apartment building .
following eu accession , eu citizens will be able to buy homes in all of the new eu countries - including single family homes and apartments .
however , they may not purchases the buildings exclusively as vacation homes .
the main exception here is slovenia , which has been granted the right to restrict the purchase of real estate for up to seven years after it joins the eu .
during a transition period of five years , poland , hungary , the czech republic and cyprus will maintain rules limiting the purchase of second apartments by citizens from other eu countries .
due to its extreme demographic and geographical situation , malta will also permanently restrict the purchase of second apartments in the price range up to € 70,000 -lrb- $ 83,500 -rrb- .
for other types of real estate , the limit will be € 1.2 million .
vacation apartments have also been classified as second apartments .
subsidiary rights self-employed eu citizens and firms have already had the right to establish subsidiary businesses in the eu candidate countries for some time now .
entrepreneurs in the new eu member states also have the right to establish businesses in western europe .
studying abroad the special eu academic program for the candidate states , the " east partnership " will remain in place .
but citizens of the new states will also now be able to participate in the eu 's socrates , leonardo da vinci and youth in europe programs .
healthcare on june 1 , the eu will introduce a european health insurance card .
at first it will be valid only in 12 eu countries - belgium , france , luxembourg , spain , germany , greece , ireland , sweden , denmark , finland , estonia , slovenia and norway .
but by the end of 2005 they will also be good in all eu countries .
the new cards replace the e111 forms currently used by europeans for healthcare reimbursement when visiting other european countries .
additionally , coverage will be extended from the current definition of procedures that are " essential without delay " to just " essential services , " meaning a lot more treatment options will be covered .
but until the cards are introduced , those covered by health care service in europe must first get approval from their homeland insurer before seeking services in another eu country .
pensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden girls with their entry into the european union , the so-called community law will now apply in the new eu member states .
that means that when a person applies for their pension , regardless of where they are living in the eu , all the contributions they have made in countries throughout the eu will be calculated in determining the sum they are to receive .
but the conditions for receiving a pension - age limits , minimum number of years that have been paid into the system or disability - will still be determined at the national level .
there is currently no centralized eu pensions system .
in all cases , a worker must pay into the pension system of the country where he or she is employed .
car rentals the legality of existing restrictions in western europe that permit car rental agencies to ban the rental of certain car makes for travel into eastern europe will still apply . from dw-world content partner mdr.de -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

it hopes that membership will strengthen already close economic ties to europe .
one of the most important contacts for foreign businesses is siim raie , 26 . siim raie is young , but he is already at the top .
at 26 , he is the general director of the estonian chamber of commerce in tallinn .
that he has managed to climb so high at such a tender age surprises him least of all .
he is no rarity in estonia .
wherever you look , young people occupy key positions .
raie says , " this is the transition process that we are going through .
it is just that in newly independent estonia so many new positions were created , so many new organisations were created that new leaders were needed .
so we didn ’ t have the whole big generation of leaders back then needed for the market economy – young people did have a real good chance to become executives . "
portraits of raie ’ s predecessors look down from the walls of the gallery at the chamber of commerce .
there are only two .
one led the organisation from 1925 to 1940 .
the next came only in 1989 , shortly before estonia gained independence and began to develop a market economy .
the chamber of commerce was re-established at that time .
the organisation is located right in the centre of tallinn , close to the seat of government and the ministries .
the site has made it easier to make many informal contacts , over lunch for example .
after all , siim raie is also the most important lobbyist in the estonian economy .
the country has developed rapidly in the past decade .
growth rates of between six and seven percent annually make it an interesting place for foreign investors to put their money .
delegations from industries and chamber of commerce representatives from other eu countries arrive regularly .
siim raie is their first contact .
he sends them on to possible partners in estonia .
three-quarters of all of the goods produced in estonia are already being exported to the eu .
raie believes membership will strengthen economic ties even further .
part of the credit for the economic upswing can go to the young leadership elite that took part in the transition to democracy and a market economy .
raie describes his work , " oh , it is exciting .
it is not only me , but the whole generation of young executives in the country .
we do have a unique experience , which people of our age in the other european countries probably don ’ t have .
we have been in the process of changes , we are the ones making the changes and it is exciting .
and it makes you feel like the sky is the limit .
and i guess that is what we bring along to the european union as well : a generation of young executives who know how to make changes , how to make things happen . "
siim raie was thirteen when estonia gained independence from the soviet union .
at the time , his country began to orient itself towards europe , politically , economically and culturally .
today , siim raie has no questions about his identity as a european .
he says , " when i was in the united states people asked me ‘ where are you from ? ’

eu enlargement will bring about many changes .
for bargain hunters fond of cruising duty-free zones along the polish border , it will mean the end of an era .
tour operators reliant on the trade are bracing for the blow . duty-free zones offering liquor , cigarettes and luxury items tax-free sprang up in germany in the mid-1950s - mostly in airports , but also on ships travelling in international waters .
one such zone is on the oder river that separates germany and poland .
since 1998 , a small section of the water on the polish side has been duty-free , and a lucrative business has built up on-board ships travelling in the area .
such an excursion has become known as a " butterfahrt " - literally “ butter trips ” - because they started out as a way for people to get cheap butter .
last year over one million germans travelled to these tax-free waters .
but with poland 's entry into the european union on may 1 , the duty-free law will no longer be valid : germany 's " butterfahrt " industry seems doomed to melt away , leaving a puddle of unemployment , deserted ships and empty buses in its wake . free lunch and big savings on a chilly april morning in berlin , double-decker buses lined one of the main boulevards as far as the eye can see .
the passengers on the buses were destined for a " butterfahrt " on the oder .
currently a " butterfahrt " costs just a few euros , with the shipping companies paying subsidies of up to 50 percent to the bus companies that cart people their way .
" the ' butterfahrt ' is an excursion package of bus and ship travel , " anna wiese , marketing director for berlin-based holiday travels agency , told deutsche welle .
" our buses pick up guests in berlin and bring them to various ports on the oder , where they board the duty-free ships .

though the 10 new eu states will become full members of the bloc and fully adopt community law , some exceptions will be applied - at least for interim periods .
here 's a list of the most important changes . border controls eu citizens will be able to move freely throughout the union .
they will , however , need a valid personal identity card or passport to cross into the new member states because they are not yet members of the schengen agreement , which eliminates border checks in many western european countries .
border controls will continue between western and eastern european countries .
the eu will determine at a later date when the border checks with the new member states should be lifted .
much of it will depend on the ability of the new member states to secure the eu 's exterior borders .
only after eu conditions in this area are met can the new member states be brought into the schengen agreement and border controls be suspended .
customs following eu expansion , the new member states will be integrated into the eu 's internal market .
controls and tariffs on all goods will be eliminated .
however , certain goods will still be banned from germany and other western european countries , including guns and narcotics .
transport of tobacco will also be limited , with mobile groups being set up to help stop the smuggling business .
controls will also be carried out for illegal goods at western european borders .
in the german states of saxony and thuringia alone , 404 officials have been assigned patrolling duties and will be working closely with the federal border guard .
labor market in principle , eu citizens in europe have the freedom to choose where they want to work .
however , with the exception of ireland and britain , most of the existing eu member states are taking advantage of an optional provision negotiated in the accession agreement that permits countries to require work permits for members of the new eu states during the first two years after enlargement .
-lrb- citizens of malta and cyprus , however , will have full work rights from may 1 . -rrb-
the work permit provision can be extended for up to seven years .
germany has said it intends to do , but a valid case for extending the opt-out clause must be presented to the european commission every two years .
currency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- in frankfurt the euro will not be extended to the new eu members immediately after accession , and all national currencies will be kept in place .
before they can join the euro , member states must fulfill the so-called maastricht criteria and successfully piggyback their currency to the euro for at least two years with a consistent exchange rate .
purchasing property the new eu member states will also be required to allow the free movement of capital after joining the eu .
but limitations have been placed on agricultural and forest lands .
in these areas , the new member states have been given an opt-out provision that lasts for up to seven years -lrb- for poland the length has been extended to 12 years -rrb- .
however , there are special rules that will allow farmers to lease land in the new member states .
purchase of homes and apartments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eastern european " plattenbau " apartment building .
following eu accession , eu citizens will be able to buy homes in all of the new eu countries - including single family homes and apartments .
however , they may not purchases the buildings exclusively as vacation homes .
the main exception here is slovenia , which has been granted the right to restrict the purchase of real estate for up to seven years after it joins the eu .
during a transition period of five years , poland , hungary , the czech republic and cyprus will maintain rules limiting the purchase of second apartments by citizens from other eu countries .
due to its extreme demographic and geographical situation , malta will also permanently restrict the purchase of second apartments in the price range up to € 70,000 -lrb- $ 83,500 -rrb- .
for other types of real estate , the limit will be € 1.2 million .
vacation apartments have also been classified as second apartments .
subsidiary rights self-employed eu citizens and firms have already had the right to establish subsidiary businesses in the eu candidate countries for some time now .
entrepreneurs in the new eu member states also have the right to establish businesses in western europe .
studying abroad the special eu academic program for the candidate states , the " east partnership " will remain in place .
but citizens of the new states will also now be able to participate in the eu 's socrates , leonardo da vinci and youth in europe programs .
healthcare on june 1 , the eu will introduce a european health insurance card .
at first it will be valid only in 12 eu countries - belgium , france , luxembourg , spain , germany , greece , ireland , sweden , denmark , finland , estonia , slovenia and norway .
but by the end of 2005 they will also be good in all eu countries .
the new cards replace the e111 forms currently used by europeans for healthcare reimbursement when visiting other european countries .
additionally , coverage will be extended from the current definition of procedures that are " essential without delay " to just " essential services , " meaning a lot more treatment options will be covered .
but until the cards are introduced , those covered by health care service in europe must first get approval from their homeland insurer before seeking services in another eu country .
pensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden girls with their entry into the european union , the so-called community law will now apply in the new eu member states .
that means that when a person applies for their pension , regardless of where they are living in the eu , all the contributions they have made in countries throughout the eu will be calculated in determining the sum they are to receive .
but the conditions for receiving a pension - age limits , minimum number of years that have been paid into the system or disability - will still be determined at the national level .
there is currently no centralized eu pensions system .
in all cases , a worker must pay into the pension system of the country where he or she is employed .
car rentals the legality of existing restrictions in western europe that permit car rental agencies to ban the rental of certain car makes for travel into eastern europe will still apply . from dw-world content partner mdr.de -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

the historic enlargement of the bloc is being hailed as a chance to spread political stability and economic prosperity , but it will also bring a host of challenges . several years in the making , the expansion of the european union next month will mark the beginning of a new era for a continent long separated by conflict and ideology .
with the cold war now consigned to memory , a large swathe of formerly communist eastern europe - as well as the mediterranean islands of malta and cyprus - will join the prosperous west . poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia , estonia , latvia and lithuania have all waited 15 years after emerging from the shadow of the soviet union to finally be part of europe 's most exclusive club .
that means for the first time in modern history , more than 450 million europeans will be united in a single political entity stretching from the atlantic ocean to the baltic states ' eastern border with russia . " first and foremost this is a peace project , " günter verheugen , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , told german public broadcaster ard last week .
" it creates peace , stability and security in the european region . " many eu citizens - both old and new - likely share those noble sentiments .
but unfortunately for public officials in brussels and national capitals across the continent , as may 1 approaches , ever more europeans are also beginning to question what other effects eastward expansion of the bloc will have . large and unmanageable ? some are worried a union of 25 will become unwieldy , unmanageable and less transparent than it is now .
others , especially in countries bordering the new member states like germany and austria , fear they will lose their jobs as businesses move east in search of cheap labor and poorer easterners come west looking work .
though many concerns may be overblown , experts do agree that there are a number of daunting challenges awaiting the enlarged eu . " it 's certainly going to exacerbate how the eu tries to manage things , " heather grabbe , the deputy director at the centre for european reform in london , told dw-world .
having followed eu expansion for the better part of a decade , grabbe believes adding members to the table at brussels will force members to push for further reform of eu decision-making .
" there wo n't be institutional gridlock - in the end it will muddle through . " she said she expected a number of issues to arise after the new members had settled in , which could then be tackled by the eu .
" hopefully any shortcomings should provoke more reform , " grabbe said . integration delayed economically , the 10 new members have been integrating with western europe for over a decade . but some aspects of integration will be delayed - because countries on both sides of the former east-west divide want it that way .
most glaring will be the lack of new eu citizens ' ability to work legally in the old eu countries .
all of the western nations , with the exception of britain and ireland , will impose some sort of restrictions on their labor markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fearing germany will be overrun by unemployed poles , the government in berlin is likely to refuse them working privileges for a full seven years as allowed by eu treaties .
this has naturally incensed poland , which calls german concerns irrational . " there is no reason to expect there will be a mass inflow of poles to the german labor market .
but the german domestic situation does not facilitate a rational approach to this issue , " outgoing polish prime minister leszek miller said last month . poland , however , has its own reservations .
despite desperately needing foreign investment from western eu countries , warsaw has negotiated a 12-year ban on foreigners buying agricultural land .
poland fought hard for the restrictions because many poles are worried germans may be inclined to try and buy back land and real estate that they or their families once owned prior to be expelled from areas belonging to germany before world war ii . poland also showed that the new members wo n't shy away from blocking eu decision-making if it is in their interest when it last year led the campaign against the draft constitution for the bloc due to a dispute over voting rights .
warsaw has since dropped its hardliner stance on the matter , but only because its main ally , the conservative-led government of spain , was voted out of office in march . row over budget issues the constitution , along with the future funding of the eu , will be two of the top issues in brussels immediately following the accession of the 10 new countries .
fearing the poor east could increase the demand for aid in coming years , net contributor nations have already been arguing for months that the eu budget should be capped at one percent of each country 's gross national product . the european commission has dismissed such calls , arguing brussels would be expected to achieve more with less .
and those countries that have been the biggest beneficiaries of eu structural funds in past , in particular spain , greece and portugal , are unhappy aid will be diverted to the less fortunate new member states .
but some experts counter the eu does n't need more money , brussels just needs change its spending habits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas mauer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin singled out the often criticized the eu 's common agricultural policy , which subsidizes europe 's farmers with nearly half of the bloc 's total € 100-billion budget . " we have to ask ourselves what do we want to pay for ?
that agriculture takes up so much is longer responsible .
those funds could be put into research and development or other investments that could help all of europe , " mauer told dw-world . such disputes over money may resolve themselves if expansion brings real economic benefits to members both old and new as is expected .
according to some estimates , the new members ' gross domestic product could increase by 1.5 percent and some 300,000 new jobs will be created in the old countries . and as may 1 approaches , quibbling over the budget and other typical eu quarrels are sure to fade into the background as the leaders of the expanded union bask in the glow of the historic moment .
but it 's only after the official festivities are over and the politicians have left the stage that the european union 's 75 million new citizens will begin to make their presence truly felt . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

eu enlargement will bring about many changes .
for bargain hunters fond of cruising duty-free zones along the polish border , it will mean the end of an era .
tour operators reliant on the trade are bracing for the blow . duty-free zones offering liquor , cigarettes and luxury items tax-free sprang up in germany in the mid-1950s - mostly in airports , but also on ships travelling in international waters .
one such zone is on the oder river that separates germany and poland .
since 1998 , a small section of the water on the polish side has been duty-free , and a lucrative business has built up on-board ships travelling in the area .
such an excursion has become known as a " butterfahrt " - literally “ butter trips ” - because they started out as a way for people to get cheap butter .
last year over one million germans travelled to these tax-free waters .
but with poland 's entry into the european union on may 1 , the duty-free law will no longer be valid : germany 's " butterfahrt " industry seems doomed to melt away , leaving a puddle of unemployment , deserted ships and empty buses in its wake . free lunch and big savings on a chilly april morning in berlin , double-decker buses lined one of the main boulevards as far as the eye can see .
the passengers on the buses were destined for a " butterfahrt " on the oder .
currently a " butterfahrt " costs just a few euros , with the shipping companies paying subsidies of up to 50 percent to the bus companies that cart people their way .
" the ' butterfahrt ' is an excursion package of bus and ship travel , " anna wiese , marketing director for berlin-based holiday travels agency , told deutsche welle .

the historic enlargement of the bloc is being hailed as a chance to spread political stability and economic prosperity , but it will also bring a host of challenges . several years in the making , the expansion of the european union next month will mark the beginning of a new era for a continent long separated by conflict and ideology .

" it creates peace , stability and security in the european region . " many eu citizens - both old and new - likely share those noble sentiments .

" it 's certainly going to exacerbate how the eu tries to manage things , " heather grabbe , the deputy director at the centre for european reform in london , told dw-world .
having followed eu expansion for the better part of a decade , grabbe believes adding members to the table at brussels will force members to push for further reform of eu decision-making .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.04.2004 " butter trips " on the way out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruising the aisles of savings will soon come to an end .
eu enlargement will bring about many changes .
for bargain hunters fond of cruising duty-free zones along the polish border , it will mean the end of an era .
tour operators reliant on the trade are bracing for the blow . duty-free zones offering liquor , cigarettes and luxury items tax-free sprang up in germany in the mid-1950s - mostly in airports , but also on ships travelling in international waters .
one such zone is on the oder river that separates germany and poland .
since 1998 , a small section of the water on the polish side has been duty-free , and a lucrative business has built up on-board ships travelling in the area .
such an excursion has become known as a " butterfahrt " - literally “ butter trips ” - because they started out as a way for people to get cheap butter .
last year over one million germans travelled to these tax-free waters .
but with poland 's entry into the european union on may 1 , the duty-free law will no longer be valid : germany 's " butterfahrt " industry seems doomed to melt away , leaving a puddle of unemployment , deserted ships and empty buses in its wake . free lunch and big savings on a chilly april morning in berlin , double-decker buses lined one of the main boulevards as far as the eye can see .
the passengers on the buses were destined for a " butterfahrt " on the oder .
currently a " butterfahrt " costs just a few euros , with the shipping companies paying subsidies of up to 50 percent to the bus companies that cart people their way .
" the ' butterfahrt ' is an excursion package of bus and ship travel , " anna wiese , marketing director for berlin-based holiday travels agency , told deutsche welle .
" our buses pick up guests in berlin and bring them to various ports on the oder , where they board the duty-free ships .
one tour also supplies lunch and a surprise gift to each guest . " in the buses , bargain hunters study the flyers announcing the latest sales awaiting them on-board the floating supermarkets .
brand-name liquor and cigarettes can be bought for a fraction of the price paid in german shops .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe a final report card for new eu members where is europe headed ? verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit getting the green light europe -pipe- 30.04.2004 the eve of enlargement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe : the world 's biggest building site on may 1 , the eu will accept 10 new members .
the historic enlargement of the bloc is being hailed as a chance to spread political stability and economic prosperity , but it will also bring a host of challenges . several years in the making , the expansion of the european union next month will mark the beginning of a new era for a continent long separated by conflict and ideology .
with the cold war now consigned to memory , a large swathe of formerly communist eastern europe - as well as the mediterranean islands of malta and cyprus - will join the prosperous west . poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia , estonia , latvia and lithuania have all waited 15 years after emerging from the shadow of the soviet union to finally be part of europe 's most exclusive club .
that means for the first time in modern history , more than 450 million europeans will be united in a single political entity stretching from the atlantic ocean to the baltic states ' eastern border with russia . " first and foremost this is a peace project , " günter verheugen , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , told german public broadcaster ard last week .
" it creates peace , stability and security in the european region . " many eu citizens - both old and new - likely share those noble sentiments .
but unfortunately for public officials in brussels and national capitals across the continent , as may 1 approaches , ever more europeans are also beginning to question what other effects eastward expansion of the bloc will have . large and unmanageable ? some are worried a union of 25 will become unwieldy , unmanageable and less transparent than it is now .
others , especially in countries bordering the new member states like germany and austria , fear they will lose their jobs as businesses move east in search of cheap labor and poorer easterners come west looking work .
though many concerns may be overblown , experts do agree that there are a number of daunting challenges awaiting the enlarged eu . " it 's certainly going to exacerbate how the eu tries to manage things , " heather grabbe , the deputy director at the centre for european reform in london , told dw-world .
having followed eu expansion for the better part of a decade , grabbe believes adding members to the table at brussels will force members to push for further reform of eu decision-making .
" there wo n't be institutional gridlock - in the end it will muddle through . " she said she expected a number of issues to arise after the new members had settled in , which could then be tackled by the eu .
" hopefully any shortcomings should provoke more reform , " grabbe said . integration delayed economically , the 10 new members have been integrating with western europe for over a decade . but some aspects of integration will be delayed - because countries on both sides of the former east-west divide want it that way .
most glaring will be the lack of new eu citizens ' ability to work legally in the old eu countries .
all of the western nations , with the exception of britain and ireland , will impose some sort of restrictions on their labor markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fearing germany will be overrun by unemployed poles , the government in berlin is likely to refuse them working privileges for a full seven years as allowed by eu treaties .
this has naturally incensed poland , which calls german concerns irrational . " there is no reason to expect there will be a mass inflow of poles to the german labor market .
but the german domestic situation does not facilitate a rational approach to this issue , " outgoing polish prime minister leszek miller said last month . poland , however , has its own reservations .
despite desperately needing foreign investment from western eu countries , warsaw has negotiated a 12-year ban on foreigners buying agricultural land .
poland fought hard for the restrictions because many poles are worried germans may be inclined to try and buy back land and real estate that they or their families once owned prior to be expelled from areas belonging to germany before world war ii . poland also showed that the new members wo n't shy away from blocking eu decision-making if it is in their interest when it last year led the campaign against the draft constitution for the bloc due to a dispute over voting rights .
warsaw has since dropped its hardliner stance on the matter , but only because its main ally , the conservative-led government of spain , was voted out of office in march . row over budget issues the constitution , along with the future funding of the eu , will be two of the top issues in brussels immediately following the accession of the 10 new countries .
fearing the poor east could increase the demand for aid in coming years , net contributor nations have already been arguing for months that the eu budget should be capped at one percent of each country 's gross national product . the european commission has dismissed such calls , arguing brussels would be expected to achieve more with less .
and those countries that have been the biggest beneficiaries of eu structural funds in past , in particular spain , greece and portugal , are unhappy aid will be diverted to the less fortunate new member states .
but some experts counter the eu does n't need more money , brussels just needs change its spending habits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas mauer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin singled out the often criticized the eu 's common agricultural policy , which subsidizes europe 's farmers with nearly half of the bloc 's total € 100-billion budget . " we have to ask ourselves what do we want to pay for ?
that agriculture takes up so much is longer responsible .
those funds could be put into research and development or other investments that could help all of europe , " mauer told dw-world . such disputes over money may resolve themselves if expansion brings real economic benefits to members both old and new as is expected .
according to some estimates , the new members ' gross domestic product could increase by 1.5 percent and some 300,000 new jobs will be created in the old countries . and as may 1 approaches , quibbling over the budget and other typical eu quarrels are sure to fade into the background as the leaders of the expanded union bask in the glow of the historic moment .
but it 's only after the official festivities are over and the politicians have left the stage that the european union 's 75 million new citizens will begin to make their presence truly felt . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

eu enlargement will bring about many changes .
for bargain hunters fond of cruising duty-free zones along the polish border , it will mean the end of an era .
tour operators reliant on the trade are bracing for the blow . duty-free zones offering liquor , cigarettes and luxury items tax-free sprang up in germany in the mid-1950s - mostly in airports , but also on ships travelling in international waters .
one such zone is on the oder river that separates germany and poland .
since 1998 , a small section of the water on the polish side has been duty-free , and a lucrative business has built up on-board ships travelling in the area .
such an excursion has become known as a " butterfahrt " - literally “ butter trips ” - because they started out as a way for people to get cheap butter .
last year over one million germans travelled to these tax-free waters .
but with poland 's entry into the european union on may 1 , the duty-free law will no longer be valid : germany 's " butterfahrt " industry seems doomed to melt away , leaving a puddle of unemployment , deserted ships and empty buses in its wake . free lunch and big savings on a chilly april morning in berlin , double-decker buses lined one of the main boulevards as far as the eye can see .
the passengers on the buses were destined for a " butterfahrt " on the oder .
currently a " butterfahrt " costs just a few euros , with the shipping companies paying subsidies of up to 50 percent to the bus companies that cart people their way .
" the ' butterfahrt ' is an excursion package of bus and ship travel , " anna wiese , marketing director for berlin-based holiday travels agency , told deutsche welle .
" our buses pick up guests in berlin and bring them to various ports on the oder , where they board the duty-free ships .
one tour also supplies lunch and a surprise gift to each guest . " in the buses , bargain hunters study the flyers announcing the latest sales awaiting them on-board the floating supermarkets .
brand-name liquor and cigarettes can be bought for a fraction of the price paid in german shops .
for example , a carton of philip morris cigarettes costs just € 8.50 -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- .
in germany , the same carton fetches up to € 36 . a culture of savings the incredible bargains make the " butterfahrt " irresistible , bus driver dieter draht said .
" some guests take the trip every day , just to buy duty-free cigarettes , whisky , and who knows what else , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on a recent " butter trip " boat on the oder river .

at first it will be valid only in 12 eu countries - belgium , france , luxembourg , spain , germany , greece , ireland , sweden , denmark , finland , estonia , slovenia and norway .
but by the end of 2005 they will also be good in all eu countries .
the new cards replace the e111 forms currently used by europeans for healthcare reimbursement when visiting other european countries .
additionally , coverage will be extended from the current definition of procedures that are " essential without delay " to just " essential services , " meaning a lot more treatment options will be covered .
but until the cards are introduced , those covered by health care service in europe must first get approval from their homeland insurer before seeking services in another eu country .
pensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden girls with their entry into the european union , the so-called community law will now apply in the new eu member states .
that means that when a person applies for their pension , regardless of where they are living in the eu , all the contributions they have made in countries throughout the eu will be calculated in determining the sum they are to receive .
but the conditions for receiving a pension - age limits , minimum number of years that have been paid into the system or disability - will still be determined at the national level .
there is currently no centralized eu pensions system .
in all cases , a worker must pay into the pension system of the country where he or she is employed .

eu enlargement will bring about many changes .
for bargain hunters fond of cruising duty-free zones along the polish border , it will mean the end of an era .
tour operators reliant on the trade are bracing for the blow . duty-free zones offering liquor , cigarettes and luxury items tax-free sprang up in germany in the mid-1950s - mostly in airports , but also on ships travelling in international waters .
one such zone is on the oder river that separates germany and poland .
since 1998 , a small section of the water on the polish side has been duty-free , and a lucrative business has built up on-board ships travelling in the area .
such an excursion has become known as a " butterfahrt " - literally “ butter trips ” - because they started out as a way for people to get cheap butter .
last year over one million germans travelled to these tax-free waters .
but with poland 's entry into the european union on may 1 , the duty-free law will no longer be valid : germany 's " butterfahrt " industry seems doomed to melt away , leaving a puddle of unemployment , deserted ships and empty buses in its wake . free lunch and big savings on a chilly april morning in berlin , double-decker buses lined one of the main boulevards as far as the eye can see .
the passengers on the buses were destined for a " butterfahrt " on the oder .
currently a " butterfahrt " costs just a few euros , with the shipping companies paying subsidies of up to 50 percent to the bus companies that cart people their way .
" the ' butterfahrt ' is an excursion package of bus and ship travel , " anna wiese , marketing director for berlin-based holiday travels agency , told deutsche welle .
" our buses pick up guests in berlin and bring them to various ports on the oder , where they board the duty-free ships .
one tour also supplies lunch and a surprise gift to each guest . " in the buses , bargain hunters study the flyers announcing the latest sales awaiting them on-board the floating supermarkets .
brand-name liquor and cigarettes can be bought for a fraction of the price paid in german shops .
for example , a carton of philip morris cigarettes costs just € 8.50 -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- .
in germany , the same carton fetches up to € 36 . a culture of savings the incredible bargains make the " butterfahrt " irresistible , bus driver dieter draht said .
" some guests take the trip every day , just to buy duty-free cigarettes , whisky , and who knows what else , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on a recent " butter trip " boat on the oder river .
the " butterfahrt " has developed into nothing less than a tradition among berlin ’ s urban poor .
its popularity reflects the state of germany ’ s economy .
it has also become something of a social occasion , part of the rage for discount shopping that permeates germany . " good quality and cheap , " said one customer when asked why he had come along on the trip .
" all of us here are modest earners and people dependent on social welfare and unemployment money or retired . " get it while the goings good but starting in may , there will be no more subsidies for the bus companies or free lunches for the travelers .
the price of the trip will double and all goods bought on board will be taxed .
so in the final weeks of duty-free shopping , " butterfahrt " business has been booming . holiday travel said they were sending out twice as many buses a day , with customers cramming in as many cheap shopping trips as they could before the good times were over .
" last week we went three times , and this week we are going twice , " said one customer .
" we ’ ve got to take advantage of these last weeks as much as we can . " end of an era one of the regular guests was indignant about no longer being able to get around germany ’ s high tobacco tax .
" smokers are supporting the nation , " he said . the shipping industry is just as unhappy about the situation : hundreds of jobs will be lost after may 1 .
still , some hope to keep the " butterfahrt " alive by attracting a new clientele - one just as interested in the scenic bus and boat ride as in cheap booze and cigarettes . anna wiese from holiday travels pointed out that only time will tell .
" we will see a large chunk of our business fall away , but we will still continue to offer the ' butterfahrt ' excursions - but at a higher price , " she said .
" we must see what our guests are prepared to pay . "
goods on-board the ships will become more expensive , but they will still be cheaper than in germany , wiese added . leah mcdonnell -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe read dw-world 's eu expansion dossier .

it hopes that membership will strengthen already close economic ties to europe .
one of the most important contacts for foreign businesses is siim raie , 26 . siim raie is young , but he is already at the top .
at 26 , he is the general director of the estonian chamber of commerce in tallinn .
that he has managed to climb so high at such a tender age surprises him least of all .
he is no rarity in estonia .
wherever you look , young people occupy key positions .
raie says , " this is the transition process that we are going through .
it is just that in newly independent estonia so many new positions were created , so many new organisations were created that new leaders were needed .
so we didn ’ t have the whole big generation of leaders back then needed for the market economy – young people did have a real good chance to become executives . "
portraits of raie ’ s predecessors look down from the walls of the gallery at the chamber of commerce .
there are only two .
one led the organisation from 1925 to 1940 .
the next came only in 1989 , shortly before estonia gained independence and began to develop a market economy .
the chamber of commerce was re-established at that time .
the organisation is located right in the centre of tallinn , close to the seat of government and the ministries .
the site has made it easier to make many informal contacts , over lunch for example .
after all , siim raie is also the most important lobbyist in the estonian economy .
the country has developed rapidly in the past decade .
growth rates of between six and seven percent annually make it an interesting place for foreign investors to put their money .
delegations from industries and chamber of commerce representatives from other eu countries arrive regularly .
siim raie is their first contact .
he sends them on to possible partners in estonia .
three-quarters of all of the goods produced in estonia are already being exported to the eu .
raie believes membership will strengthen economic ties even further .
part of the credit for the economic upswing can go to the young leadership elite that took part in the transition to democracy and a market economy .
raie describes his work , " oh , it is exciting .
it is not only me , but the whole generation of young executives in the country .
we do have a unique experience , which people of our age in the other european countries probably don ’ t have .
we have been in the process of changes , we are the ones making the changes and it is exciting .
and it makes you feel like the sky is the limit .
and i guess that is what we bring along to the european union as well : a generation of young executives who know how to make changes , how to make things happen . "
siim raie was thirteen when estonia gained independence from the soviet union .
at the time , his country began to orient itself towards europe , politically , economically and culturally .
today , siim raie has no questions about his identity as a european .
he says , " when i was in the united states people asked me ‘ where are you from ? ’
i tried to explain to them ‘ estonia , close to finland , next to the baltic sea ... ’ and nobody really understood .
but when you said that you are from europe , everybody knew it .
and that ’ s the truth .
i am a european , certainly . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

though the 10 new eu states will become full members of the bloc and fully adopt community law , some exceptions will be applied - at least for interim periods .
here 's a list of the most important changes . border controls eu citizens will be able to move freely throughout the union .
they will , however , need a valid personal identity card or passport to cross into the new member states because they are not yet members of the schengen agreement , which eliminates border checks in many western european countries .
border controls will continue between western and eastern european countries .
the eu will determine at a later date when the border checks with the new member states should be lifted .
much of it will depend on the ability of the new member states to secure the eu 's exterior borders .
only after eu conditions in this area are met can the new member states be brought into the schengen agreement and border controls be suspended .
customs following eu expansion , the new member states will be integrated into the eu 's internal market .
controls and tariffs on all goods will be eliminated .
however , certain goods will still be banned from germany and other western european countries , including guns and narcotics .
transport of tobacco will also be limited , with mobile groups being set up to help stop the smuggling business .
controls will also be carried out for illegal goods at western european borders .
in the german states of saxony and thuringia alone , 404 officials have been assigned patrolling duties and will be working closely with the federal border guard .
labor market in principle , eu citizens in europe have the freedom to choose where they want to work .
however , with the exception of ireland and britain , most of the existing eu member states are taking advantage of an optional provision negotiated in the accession agreement that permits countries to require work permits for members of the new eu states during the first two years after enlargement .
-lrb- citizens of malta and cyprus , however , will have full work rights from may 1 . -rrb-
the work permit provision can be extended for up to seven years .
germany has said it intends to do , but a valid case for extending the opt-out clause must be presented to the european commission every two years .
currency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- in frankfurt the euro will not be extended to the new eu members immediately after accession , and all national currencies will be kept in place .

eu enlargement will bring about many changes .
for bargain hunters fond of cruising duty-free zones along the polish border , it will mean the end of an era .
tour operators reliant on the trade are bracing for the blow . duty-free zones offering liquor , cigarettes and luxury items tax-free sprang up in germany in the mid-1950s - mostly in airports , but also on ships travelling in international waters .
one such zone is on the oder river that separates germany and poland .
since 1998 , a small section of the water on the polish side has been duty-free , and a lucrative business has built up on-board ships travelling in the area .
such an excursion has become known as a " butterfahrt " - literally “ butter trips ” - because they started out as a way for people to get cheap butter .
last year over one million germans travelled to these tax-free waters .
but with poland 's entry into the european union on may 1 , the duty-free law will no longer be valid : germany 's " butterfahrt " industry seems doomed to melt away , leaving a puddle of unemployment , deserted ships and empty buses in its wake . free lunch and big savings on a chilly april morning in berlin , double-decker buses lined one of the main boulevards as far as the eye can see .
the passengers on the buses were destined for a " butterfahrt " on the oder .
currently a " butterfahrt " costs just a few euros , with the shipping companies paying subsidies of up to 50 percent to the bus companies that cart people their way .
" the ' butterfahrt ' is an excursion package of bus and ship travel , " anna wiese , marketing director for berlin-based holiday travels agency , told deutsche welle .
" our buses pick up guests in berlin and bring them to various ports on the oder , where they board the duty-free ships .
one tour also supplies lunch and a surprise gift to each guest . " in the buses , bargain hunters study the flyers announcing the latest sales awaiting them on-board the floating supermarkets .
brand-name liquor and cigarettes can be bought for a fraction of the price paid in german shops .
for example , a carton of philip morris cigarettes costs just € 8.50 -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- .
in germany , the same carton fetches up to € 36 . a culture of savings the incredible bargains make the " butterfahrt " irresistible , bus driver dieter draht said .
" some guests take the trip every day , just to buy duty-free cigarettes , whisky , and who knows what else , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on a recent " butter trip " boat on the oder river .
the " butterfahrt " has developed into nothing less than a tradition among berlin ’ s urban poor .
its popularity reflects the state of germany ’ s economy .
it has also become something of a social occasion , part of the rage for discount shopping that permeates germany . " good quality and cheap , " said one customer when asked why he had come along on the trip .
" all of us here are modest earners and people dependent on social welfare and unemployment money or retired . " get it while the goings good but starting in may , there will be no more subsidies for the bus companies or free lunches for the travelers .
the price of the trip will double and all goods bought on board will be taxed .
so in the final weeks of duty-free shopping , " butterfahrt " business has been booming . holiday travel said they were sending out twice as many buses a day , with customers cramming in as many cheap shopping trips as they could before the good times were over .
" last week we went three times , and this week we are going twice , " said one customer .
" we ’ ve got to take advantage of these last weeks as much as we can . " end of an era one of the regular guests was indignant about no longer being able to get around germany ’ s high tobacco tax .
" smokers are supporting the nation , " he said . the shipping industry is just as unhappy about the situation : hundreds of jobs will be lost after may 1 .
still , some hope to keep the " butterfahrt " alive by attracting a new clientele - one just as interested in the scenic bus and boat ride as in cheap booze and cigarettes . anna wiese from holiday travels pointed out that only time will tell .
" we will see a large chunk of our business fall away , but we will still continue to offer the ' butterfahrt ' excursions - but at a higher price , " she said .
" we must see what our guests are prepared to pay . "
goods on-board the ships will become more expensive , but they will still be cheaper than in germany , wiese added . leah mcdonnell -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe read dw-world 's eu expansion dossier .

eu enlargement will bring about many changes .
for bargain hunters fond of cruising duty-free zones along the polish border , it will mean the end of an era .
tour operators reliant on the trade are bracing for the blow . duty-free zones offering liquor , cigarettes and luxury items tax-free sprang up in germany in the mid-1950s - mostly in airports , but also on ships travelling in international waters .
one such zone is on the oder river that separates germany and poland .
since 1998 , a small section of the water on the polish side has been duty-free , and a lucrative business has built up on-board ships travelling in the area .
such an excursion has become known as a " butterfahrt " - literally “ butter trips ” - because they started out as a way for people to get cheap butter .
last year over one million germans travelled to these tax-free waters .
but with poland 's entry into the european union on may 1 , the duty-free law will no longer be valid : germany 's " butterfahrt " industry seems doomed to melt away , leaving a puddle of unemployment , deserted ships and empty buses in its wake . free lunch and big savings on a chilly april morning in berlin , double-decker buses lined one of the main boulevards as far as the eye can see .
the passengers on the buses were destined for a " butterfahrt " on the oder .
currently a " butterfahrt " costs just a few euros , with the shipping companies paying subsidies of up to 50 percent to the bus companies that cart people their way .
" the ' butterfahrt ' is an excursion package of bus and ship travel , " anna wiese , marketing director for berlin-based holiday travels agency , told deutsche welle .
" our buses pick up guests in berlin and bring them to various ports on the oder , where they board the duty-free ships .
one tour also supplies lunch and a surprise gift to each guest . " in the buses , bargain hunters study the flyers announcing the latest sales awaiting them on-board the floating supermarkets .
brand-name liquor and cigarettes can be bought for a fraction of the price paid in german shops .
for example , a carton of philip morris cigarettes costs just € 8.50 -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- .
in germany , the same carton fetches up to € 36 . a culture of savings the incredible bargains make the " butterfahrt " irresistible , bus driver dieter draht said .
" some guests take the trip every day , just to buy duty-free cigarettes , whisky , and who knows what else , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on a recent " butter trip " boat on the oder river .
the " butterfahrt " has developed into nothing less than a tradition among berlin ’ s urban poor .
its popularity reflects the state of germany ’ s economy .
it has also become something of a social occasion , part of the rage for discount shopping that permeates germany . " good quality and cheap , " said one customer when asked why he had come along on the trip .
" all of us here are modest earners and people dependent on social welfare and unemployment money or retired . " get it while the goings good but starting in may , there will be no more subsidies for the bus companies or free lunches for the travelers .
the price of the trip will double and all goods bought on board will be taxed .
so in the final weeks of duty-free shopping , " butterfahrt " business has been booming . holiday travel said they were sending out twice as many buses a day , with customers cramming in as many cheap shopping trips as they could before the good times were over .
" last week we went three times , and this week we are going twice , " said one customer .
" we ’ ve got to take advantage of these last weeks as much as we can . " end of an era one of the regular guests was indignant about no longer being able to get around germany ’ s high tobacco tax .
" smokers are supporting the nation , " he said . the shipping industry is just as unhappy about the situation : hundreds of jobs will be lost after may 1 .
still , some hope to keep the " butterfahrt " alive by attracting a new clientele - one just as interested in the scenic bus and boat ride as in cheap booze and cigarettes . anna wiese from holiday travels pointed out that only time will tell .
" we will see a large chunk of our business fall away , but we will still continue to offer the ' butterfahrt ' excursions - but at a higher price , " she said .
" we must see what our guests are prepared to pay . "
goods on-board the ships will become more expensive , but they will still be cheaper than in germany , wiese added . leah mcdonnell -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe read dw-world 's eu expansion dossier .

wherever you look , young people occupy key positions .
raie says , " this is the transition process that we are going through .
it is just that in newly independent estonia so many new positions were created , so many new organisations were created that new leaders were needed .
so we didn ’ t have the whole big generation of leaders back then needed for the market economy – young people did have a real good chance to become executives . "
portraits of raie ’ s predecessors look down from the walls of the gallery at the chamber of commerce .
there are only two .
one led the organisation from 1925 to 1940 .
the next came only in 1989 , shortly before estonia gained independence and began to develop a market economy .
the chamber of commerce was re-established at that time .
the organisation is located right in the centre of tallinn , close to the seat of government and the ministries .
the site has made it easier to make many informal contacts , over lunch for example .
after all , siim raie is also the most important lobbyist in the estonian economy .
the country has developed rapidly in the past decade .
growth rates of between six and seven percent annually make it an interesting place for foreign investors to put their money .
delegations from industries and chamber of commerce representatives from other eu countries arrive regularly .
siim raie is their first contact .
he sends them on to possible partners in estonia .
three-quarters of all of the goods produced in estonia are already being exported to the eu .
raie believes membership will strengthen economic ties even further .
part of the credit for the economic upswing can go to the young leadership elite that took part in the transition to democracy and a market economy .
raie describes his work , " oh , it is exciting .
it is not only me , but the whole generation of young executives in the country .
we do have a unique experience , which people of our age in the other european countries probably don ’ t have .
we have been in the process of changes , we are the ones making the changes and it is exciting .
and it makes you feel like the sky is the limit .
and i guess that is what we bring along to the european union as well : a generation of young executives who know how to make changes , how to make things happen . "
siim raie was thirteen when estonia gained independence from the soviet union .
at the time , his country began to orient itself towards europe , politically , economically and culturally .
today , siim raie has no questions about his identity as a european .
he says , " when i was in the united states people asked me ‘ where are you from ? ’

the historic enlargement of the bloc is being hailed as a chance to spread political stability and economic prosperity , but it will also bring a host of challenges . several years in the making , the expansion of the european union next month will mark the beginning of a new era for a continent long separated by conflict and ideology .
with the cold war now consigned to memory , a large swathe of formerly communist eastern europe - as well as the mediterranean islands of malta and cyprus - will join the prosperous west . poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia , estonia , latvia and lithuania have all waited 15 years after emerging from the shadow of the soviet union to finally be part of europe 's most exclusive club .

the historic enlargement of the bloc is being hailed as a chance to spread political stability and economic prosperity , but it will also bring a host of challenges . several years in the making , the expansion of the european union next month will mark the beginning of a new era for a continent long separated by conflict and ideology .
with the cold war now consigned to memory , a large swathe of formerly communist eastern europe - as well as the mediterranean islands of malta and cyprus - will join the prosperous west . poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia , estonia , latvia and lithuania have all waited 15 years after emerging from the shadow of the soviet union to finally be part of europe 's most exclusive club .
that means for the first time in modern history , more than 450 million europeans will be united in a single political entity stretching from the atlantic ocean to the baltic states ' eastern border with russia . " first and foremost this is a peace project , " günter verheugen , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , told german public broadcaster ard last week .
" it creates peace , stability and security in the european region . " many eu citizens - both old and new - likely share those noble sentiments .
but unfortunately for public officials in brussels and national capitals across the continent , as may 1 approaches , ever more europeans are also beginning to question what other effects eastward expansion of the bloc will have . large and unmanageable ? some are worried a union of 25 will become unwieldy , unmanageable and less transparent than it is now .
others , especially in countries bordering the new member states like germany and austria , fear they will lose their jobs as businesses move east in search of cheap labor and poorer easterners come west looking work .
though many concerns may be overblown , experts do agree that there are a number of daunting challenges awaiting the enlarged eu . " it 's certainly going to exacerbate how the eu tries to manage things , " heather grabbe , the deputy director at the centre for european reform in london , told dw-world .
having followed eu expansion for the better part of a decade , grabbe believes adding members to the table at brussels will force members to push for further reform of eu decision-making .
" there wo n't be institutional gridlock - in the end it will muddle through . " she said she expected a number of issues to arise after the new members had settled in , which could then be tackled by the eu .
" hopefully any shortcomings should provoke more reform , " grabbe said . integration delayed economically , the 10 new members have been integrating with western europe for over a decade . but some aspects of integration will be delayed - because countries on both sides of the former east-west divide want it that way .
most glaring will be the lack of new eu citizens ' ability to work legally in the old eu countries .
all of the western nations , with the exception of britain and ireland , will impose some sort of restrictions on their labor markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fearing germany will be overrun by unemployed poles , the government in berlin is likely to refuse them working privileges for a full seven years as allowed by eu treaties .
this has naturally incensed poland , which calls german concerns irrational . " there is no reason to expect there will be a mass inflow of poles to the german labor market .
but the german domestic situation does not facilitate a rational approach to this issue , " outgoing polish prime minister leszek miller said last month . poland , however , has its own reservations .
despite desperately needing foreign investment from western eu countries , warsaw has negotiated a 12-year ban on foreigners buying agricultural land .
poland fought hard for the restrictions because many poles are worried germans may be inclined to try and buy back land and real estate that they or their families once owned prior to be expelled from areas belonging to germany before world war ii . poland also showed that the new members wo n't shy away from blocking eu decision-making if it is in their interest when it last year led the campaign against the draft constitution for the bloc due to a dispute over voting rights .
warsaw has since dropped its hardliner stance on the matter , but only because its main ally , the conservative-led government of spain , was voted out of office in march . row over budget issues the constitution , along with the future funding of the eu , will be two of the top issues in brussels immediately following the accession of the 10 new countries .
fearing the poor east could increase the demand for aid in coming years , net contributor nations have already been arguing for months that the eu budget should be capped at one percent of each country 's gross national product . the european commission has dismissed such calls , arguing brussels would be expected to achieve more with less .
and those countries that have been the biggest beneficiaries of eu structural funds in past , in particular spain , greece and portugal , are unhappy aid will be diverted to the less fortunate new member states .
but some experts counter the eu does n't need more money , brussels just needs change its spending habits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas mauer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin singled out the often criticized the eu 's common agricultural policy , which subsidizes europe 's farmers with nearly half of the bloc 's total € 100-billion budget . " we have to ask ourselves what do we want to pay for ?
that agriculture takes up so much is longer responsible .
those funds could be put into research and development or other investments that could help all of europe , " mauer told dw-world . such disputes over money may resolve themselves if expansion brings real economic benefits to members both old and new as is expected .
according to some estimates , the new members ' gross domestic product could increase by 1.5 percent and some 300,000 new jobs will be created in the old countries . and as may 1 approaches , quibbling over the budget and other typical eu quarrels are sure to fade into the background as the leaders of the expanded union bask in the glow of the historic moment .
but it 's only after the official festivities are over and the politicians have left the stage that the european union 's 75 million new citizens will begin to make their presence truly felt . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

it hopes that membership will strengthen already close economic ties to europe .
one of the most important contacts for foreign businesses is siim raie , 26 . siim raie is young , but he is already at the top .
at 26 , he is the general director of the estonian chamber of commerce in tallinn .
that he has managed to climb so high at such a tender age surprises him least of all .
he is no rarity in estonia .
wherever you look , young people occupy key positions .
raie says , " this is the transition process that we are going through .
it is just that in newly independent estonia so many new positions were created , so many new organisations were created that new leaders were needed .
so we didn ’ t have the whole big generation of leaders back then needed for the market economy – young people did have a real good chance to become executives . "
portraits of raie ’ s predecessors look down from the walls of the gallery at the chamber of commerce .
there are only two .
one led the organisation from 1925 to 1940 .
the next came only in 1989 , shortly before estonia gained independence and began to develop a market economy .
the chamber of commerce was re-established at that time .
the organisation is located right in the centre of tallinn , close to the seat of government and the ministries .
the site has made it easier to make many informal contacts , over lunch for example .
after all , siim raie is also the most important lobbyist in the estonian economy .
the country has developed rapidly in the past decade .
growth rates of between six and seven percent annually make it an interesting place for foreign investors to put their money .
delegations from industries and chamber of commerce representatives from other eu countries arrive regularly .
siim raie is their first contact .
he sends them on to possible partners in estonia .
three-quarters of all of the goods produced in estonia are already being exported to the eu .
raie believes membership will strengthen economic ties even further .
part of the credit for the economic upswing can go to the young leadership elite that took part in the transition to democracy and a market economy .
raie describes his work , " oh , it is exciting .
it is not only me , but the whole generation of young executives in the country .
we do have a unique experience , which people of our age in the other european countries probably don ’ t have .
we have been in the process of changes , we are the ones making the changes and it is exciting .
and it makes you feel like the sky is the limit .
and i guess that is what we bring along to the european union as well : a generation of young executives who know how to make changes , how to make things happen . "
siim raie was thirteen when estonia gained independence from the soviet union .
at the time , his country began to orient itself towards europe , politically , economically and culturally .
today , siim raie has no questions about his identity as a european .
he says , " when i was in the united states people asked me ‘ where are you from ? ’
i tried to explain to them ‘ estonia , close to finland , next to the baltic sea ... ’ and nobody really understood .

wherever you look , young people occupy key positions .
raie says , " this is the transition process that we are going through .
it is just that in newly independent estonia so many new positions were created , so many new organisations were created that new leaders were needed .
so we didn ’ t have the whole big generation of leaders back then needed for the market economy – young people did have a real good chance to become executives . "
portraits of raie ’ s predecessors look down from the walls of the gallery at the chamber of commerce .
there are only two .
one led the organisation from 1925 to 1940 .
the next came only in 1989 , shortly before estonia gained independence and began to develop a market economy .
the chamber of commerce was re-established at that time .
the organisation is located right in the centre of tallinn , close to the seat of government and the ministries .
the site has made it easier to make many informal contacts , over lunch for example .
after all , siim raie is also the most important lobbyist in the estonian economy .
the country has developed rapidly in the past decade .
growth rates of between six and seven percent annually make it an interesting place for foreign investors to put their money .
delegations from industries and chamber of commerce representatives from other eu countries arrive regularly .
siim raie is their first contact .
he sends them on to possible partners in estonia .
three-quarters of all of the goods produced in estonia are already being exported to the eu .
raie believes membership will strengthen economic ties even further .
part of the credit for the economic upswing can go to the young leadership elite that took part in the transition to democracy and a market economy .
raie describes his work , " oh , it is exciting .
it is not only me , but the whole generation of young executives in the country .
we do have a unique experience , which people of our age in the other european countries probably don ’ t have .
we have been in the process of changes , we are the ones making the changes and it is exciting .
and it makes you feel like the sky is the limit .
and i guess that is what we bring along to the european union as well : a generation of young executives who know how to make changes , how to make things happen . "
siim raie was thirteen when estonia gained independence from the soviet union .
at the time , his country began to orient itself towards europe , politically , economically and culturally .
today , siim raie has no questions about his identity as a european .
he says , " when i was in the united states people asked me ‘ where are you from ? ’
i tried to explain to them ‘ estonia , close to finland , next to the baltic sea ... ’ and nobody really understood .

after all , siim raie is also the most important lobbyist in the estonian economy .
the country has developed rapidly in the past decade .
growth rates of between six and seven percent annually make it an interesting place for foreign investors to put their money .
delegations from industries and chamber of commerce representatives from other eu countries arrive regularly .
siim raie is their first contact .
he sends them on to possible partners in estonia .
three-quarters of all of the goods produced in estonia are already being exported to the eu .
raie believes membership will strengthen economic ties even further .
part of the credit for the economic upswing can go to the young leadership elite that took part in the transition to democracy and a market economy .
raie describes his work , " oh , it is exciting .
it is not only me , but the whole generation of young executives in the country .
we do have a unique experience , which people of our age in the other european countries probably don ’ t have .
we have been in the process of changes , we are the ones making the changes and it is exciting .
and it makes you feel like the sky is the limit .
and i guess that is what we bring along to the european union as well : a generation of young executives who know how to make changes , how to make things happen . "
siim raie was thirteen when estonia gained independence from the soviet union .
at the time , his country began to orient itself towards europe , politically , economically and culturally .
today , siim raie has no questions about his identity as a european .
he says , " when i was in the united states people asked me ‘ where are you from ? ’
i tried to explain to them ‘ estonia , close to finland , next to the baltic sea ... ’ and nobody really understood .
but when you said that you are from europe , everybody knew it .
and that ’ s the truth .
i am a european , certainly . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live discover germany - the tv travel guide we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.04.2004 " butter trips " on the way out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruising the aisles of savings will soon come to an end .
eu enlargement will bring about many changes .
for bargain hunters fond of cruising duty-free zones along the polish border , it will mean the end of an era .
tour operators reliant on the trade are bracing for the blow . duty-free zones offering liquor , cigarettes and luxury items tax-free sprang up in germany in the mid-1950s - mostly in airports , but also on ships travelling in international waters .
one such zone is on the oder river that separates germany and poland .
since 1998 , a small section of the water on the polish side has been duty-free , and a lucrative business has built up on-board ships travelling in the area .
such an excursion has become known as a " butterfahrt " - literally “ butter trips ” - because they started out as a way for people to get cheap butter .
last year over one million germans travelled to these tax-free waters .
but with poland 's entry into the european union on may 1 , the duty-free law will no longer be valid : germany 's " butterfahrt " industry seems doomed to melt away , leaving a puddle of unemployment , deserted ships and empty buses in its wake . free lunch and big savings on a chilly april morning in berlin , double-decker buses lined one of the main boulevards as far as the eye can see .
the passengers on the buses were destined for a " butterfahrt " on the oder .
currently a " butterfahrt " costs just a few euros , with the shipping companies paying subsidies of up to 50 percent to the bus companies that cart people their way .
" the ' butterfahrt ' is an excursion package of bus and ship travel , " anna wiese , marketing director for berlin-based holiday travels agency , told deutsche welle .
" our buses pick up guests in berlin and bring them to various ports on the oder , where they board the duty-free ships .
one tour also supplies lunch and a surprise gift to each guest . " in the buses , bargain hunters study the flyers announcing the latest sales awaiting them on-board the floating supermarkets .
brand-name liquor and cigarettes can be bought for a fraction of the price paid in german shops .
for example , a carton of philip morris cigarettes costs just € 8.50 -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- .
in germany , the same carton fetches up to € 36 . a culture of savings the incredible bargains make the " butterfahrt " irresistible , bus driver dieter draht said .
" some guests take the trip every day , just to buy duty-free cigarettes , whisky , and who knows what else , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on a recent " butter trip " boat on the oder river .
the " butterfahrt " has developed into nothing less than a tradition among berlin ’ s urban poor .
its popularity reflects the state of germany ’ s economy .
it has also become something of a social occasion , part of the rage for discount shopping that permeates germany . " good quality and cheap , " said one customer when asked why he had come along on the trip .
" all of us here are modest earners and people dependent on social welfare and unemployment money or retired . " get it while the goings good but starting in may , there will be no more subsidies for the bus companies or free lunches for the travelers .
the price of the trip will double and all goods bought on board will be taxed .
so in the final weeks of duty-free shopping , " butterfahrt " business has been booming . holiday travel said they were sending out twice as many buses a day , with customers cramming in as many cheap shopping trips as they could before the good times were over .
" last week we went three times , and this week we are going twice , " said one customer .
" we ’ ve got to take advantage of these last weeks as much as we can . " end of an era one of the regular guests was indignant about no longer being able to get around germany ’ s high tobacco tax .
" smokers are supporting the nation , " he said . the shipping industry is just as unhappy about the situation : hundreds of jobs will be lost after may 1 .
still , some hope to keep the " butterfahrt " alive by attracting a new clientele - one just as interested in the scenic bus and boat ride as in cheap booze and cigarettes . anna wiese from holiday travels pointed out that only time will tell .
" we will see a large chunk of our business fall away , but we will still continue to offer the ' butterfahrt ' excursions - but at a higher price , " she said .
" we must see what our guests are prepared to pay . "
goods on-board the ships will become more expensive , but they will still be cheaper than in germany , wiese added . leah mcdonnell -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe read dw-world 's eu expansion dossier . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

eu enlargement will bring about many changes .
for bargain hunters fond of cruising duty-free zones along the polish border , it will mean the end of an era .
tour operators reliant on the trade are bracing for the blow . duty-free zones offering liquor , cigarettes and luxury items tax-free sprang up in germany in the mid-1950s - mostly in airports , but also on ships travelling in international waters .
one such zone is on the oder river that separates germany and poland .
since 1998 , a small section of the water on the polish side has been duty-free , and a lucrative business has built up on-board ships travelling in the area .
such an excursion has become known as a " butterfahrt " - literally “ butter trips ” - because they started out as a way for people to get cheap butter .
last year over one million germans travelled to these tax-free waters .
but with poland 's entry into the european union on may 1 , the duty-free law will no longer be valid : germany 's " butterfahrt " industry seems doomed to melt away , leaving a puddle of unemployment , deserted ships and empty buses in its wake . free lunch and big savings on a chilly april morning in berlin , double-decker buses lined one of the main boulevards as far as the eye can see .
the passengers on the buses were destined for a " butterfahrt " on the oder .
currently a " butterfahrt " costs just a few euros , with the shipping companies paying subsidies of up to 50 percent to the bus companies that cart people their way .
" the ' butterfahrt ' is an excursion package of bus and ship travel , " anna wiese , marketing director for berlin-based holiday travels agency , told deutsche welle .
" our buses pick up guests in berlin and bring them to various ports on the oder , where they board the duty-free ships .
one tour also supplies lunch and a surprise gift to each guest . " in the buses , bargain hunters study the flyers announcing the latest sales awaiting them on-board the floating supermarkets .
brand-name liquor and cigarettes can be bought for a fraction of the price paid in german shops .
for example , a carton of philip morris cigarettes costs just € 8.50 -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- .
in germany , the same carton fetches up to € 36 . a culture of savings the incredible bargains make the " butterfahrt " irresistible , bus driver dieter draht said .
" some guests take the trip every day , just to buy duty-free cigarettes , whisky , and who knows what else , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on a recent " butter trip " boat on the oder river .
the " butterfahrt " has developed into nothing less than a tradition among berlin ’ s urban poor .
its popularity reflects the state of germany ’ s economy .
it has also become something of a social occasion , part of the rage for discount shopping that permeates germany . " good quality and cheap , " said one customer when asked why he had come along on the trip .
" all of us here are modest earners and people dependent on social welfare and unemployment money or retired . " get it while the goings good but starting in may , there will be no more subsidies for the bus companies or free lunches for the travelers .
the price of the trip will double and all goods bought on board will be taxed .
so in the final weeks of duty-free shopping , " butterfahrt " business has been booming . holiday travel said they were sending out twice as many buses a day , with customers cramming in as many cheap shopping trips as they could before the good times were over .
" last week we went three times , and this week we are going twice , " said one customer .
" we ’ ve got to take advantage of these last weeks as much as we can . " end of an era one of the regular guests was indignant about no longer being able to get around germany ’ s high tobacco tax .
" smokers are supporting the nation , " he said . the shipping industry is just as unhappy about the situation : hundreds of jobs will be lost after may 1 .
still , some hope to keep the " butterfahrt " alive by attracting a new clientele - one just as interested in the scenic bus and boat ride as in cheap booze and cigarettes . anna wiese from holiday travels pointed out that only time will tell .
" we will see a large chunk of our business fall away , but we will still continue to offer the ' butterfahrt ' excursions - but at a higher price , " she said .
" we must see what our guests are prepared to pay . "
goods on-board the ships will become more expensive , but they will still be cheaper than in germany , wiese added . leah mcdonnell -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe read dw-world 's eu expansion dossier . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

eu enlargement will bring about many changes .
for bargain hunters fond of cruising duty-free zones along the polish border , it will mean the end of an era .
tour operators reliant on the trade are bracing for the blow . duty-free zones offering liquor , cigarettes and luxury items tax-free sprang up in germany in the mid-1950s - mostly in airports , but also on ships travelling in international waters .
one such zone is on the oder river that separates germany and poland .
since 1998 , a small section of the water on the polish side has been duty-free , and a lucrative business has built up on-board ships travelling in the area .
such an excursion has become known as a " butterfahrt " - literally “ butter trips ” - because they started out as a way for people to get cheap butter .
last year over one million germans travelled to these tax-free waters .
but with poland 's entry into the european union on may 1 , the duty-free law will no longer be valid : germany 's " butterfahrt " industry seems doomed to melt away , leaving a puddle of unemployment , deserted ships and empty buses in its wake . free lunch and big savings on a chilly april morning in berlin , double-decker buses lined one of the main boulevards as far as the eye can see .
the passengers on the buses were destined for a " butterfahrt " on the oder .
currently a " butterfahrt " costs just a few euros , with the shipping companies paying subsidies of up to 50 percent to the bus companies that cart people their way .
" the ' butterfahrt ' is an excursion package of bus and ship travel , " anna wiese , marketing director for berlin-based holiday travels agency , told deutsche welle .
" our buses pick up guests in berlin and bring them to various ports on the oder , where they board the duty-free ships .
one tour also supplies lunch and a surprise gift to each guest . " in the buses , bargain hunters study the flyers announcing the latest sales awaiting them on-board the floating supermarkets .
brand-name liquor and cigarettes can be bought for a fraction of the price paid in german shops .
for example , a carton of philip morris cigarettes costs just € 8.50 -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- .
in germany , the same carton fetches up to € 36 . a culture of savings the incredible bargains make the " butterfahrt " irresistible , bus driver dieter draht said .
" some guests take the trip every day , just to buy duty-free cigarettes , whisky , and who knows what else , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers on a recent " butter trip " boat on the oder river .
the " butterfahrt " has developed into nothing less than a tradition among berlin ’ s urban poor .
its popularity reflects the state of germany ’ s economy .
it has also become something of a social occasion , part of the rage for discount shopping that permeates germany . " good quality and cheap , " said one customer when asked why he had come along on the trip .
" all of us here are modest earners and people dependent on social welfare and unemployment money or retired . " get it while the goings good but starting in may , there will be no more subsidies for the bus companies or free lunches for the travelers .
the price of the trip will double and all goods bought on board will be taxed .
so in the final weeks of duty-free shopping , " butterfahrt " business has been booming . holiday travel said they were sending out twice as many buses a day , with customers cramming in as many cheap shopping trips as they could before the good times were over .
" last week we went three times , and this week we are going twice , " said one customer .
" we ’ ve got to take advantage of these last weeks as much as we can . " end of an era one of the regular guests was indignant about no longer being able to get around germany ’ s high tobacco tax .
" smokers are supporting the nation , " he said . the shipping industry is just as unhappy about the situation : hundreds of jobs will be lost after may 1 .
still , some hope to keep the " butterfahrt " alive by attracting a new clientele - one just as interested in the scenic bus and boat ride as in cheap booze and cigarettes . anna wiese from holiday travels pointed out that only time will tell .
" we will see a large chunk of our business fall away , but we will still continue to offer the ' butterfahrt ' excursions - but at a higher price , " she said .

" it would be naïve to believe that these days will pass peacefully . " in addition , some 2,500 neo-nazis plan to hold a rally in eastern berlin , with leftist counter-demonstrators vowing to stop them , setting the scene for possible clashes . berlin police president dieter glietsch has confirmed that the police will be more visible on may day this year and will clamp down on rioters .

as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers . it 's the time of the year when all hell breaks loose in berlin and neighborhoods like turkish-dominated kreuzberg become urban battle grounds , complete with burning cars , smashed shop windows and violent clashes between police and rampaging teenagers . may day rioting has become a tradition in berlin , harking back to may 1 , 1987 , when left-wing demonstrators first took to the streets to protest against what they called a " bourgeois " celebration of the 750th anniversary of the founding of berlin . since then , the rioting has returned to berlin with unfailing regularity each year , first in west berlin and then following german reunification in 1990 , in both halves of the united city . tougher , quicker action this year however , city authorities and police are clear they plan to put an end to the violence that mars the largely peaceful may day demonstrations and festive atmosphere of the street fairs and parties that dot berlin 's historic center near the brandenburg gate , the hip eastern neighborhood of prenzlauer berg as well as its western neighbor , the kreuzberg district . berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , whose administration has used a " soft glove " approach in the past , has said that the police will crack down on rioters this year . berlin 's interior minister erhart körting has announced that the police on saturday will take swifter and tougher action against vandals and rioters than last year and also keep a watch on small groups of rowdy teenagers in kreuzberg on may day eve to preempt any rioting . a strenuous week for the police may day will mark the culmination of a difficult week for berlin 's police , who have had to provide security for a series of high-profile events , starting with the two-day osce anti-semitism conference on april 28 and 29 .

the historic enlargement of the bloc is being hailed as a chance to spread political stability and economic prosperity , but it will also bring a host of challenges . several years in the making , the expansion of the european union next month will mark the beginning of a new era for a continent long separated by conflict and ideology .
with the cold war now consigned to memory , a large swathe of formerly communist eastern europe - as well as the mediterranean islands of malta and cyprus - will join the prosperous west . poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia , estonia , latvia and lithuania have all waited 15 years after emerging from the shadow of the soviet union to finally be part of europe 's most exclusive club .
that means for the first time in modern history , more than 450 million europeans will be united in a single political entity stretching from the atlantic ocean to the baltic states ' eastern border with russia . " first and foremost this is a peace project , " günter verheugen , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , told german public broadcaster ard last week .
" it creates peace , stability and security in the european region . " many eu citizens - both old and new - likely share those noble sentiments .
but unfortunately for public officials in brussels and national capitals across the continent , as may 1 approaches , ever more europeans are also beginning to question what other effects eastward expansion of the bloc will have . large and unmanageable ? some are worried a union of 25 will become unwieldy , unmanageable and less transparent than it is now .
others , especially in countries bordering the new member states like germany and austria , fear they will lose their jobs as businesses move east in search of cheap labor and poorer easterners come west looking work .
though many concerns may be overblown , experts do agree that there are a number of daunting challenges awaiting the enlarged eu . " it 's certainly going to exacerbate how the eu tries to manage things , " heather grabbe , the deputy director at the centre for european reform in london , told dw-world .
having followed eu expansion for the better part of a decade , grabbe believes adding members to the table at brussels will force members to push for further reform of eu decision-making .
" there wo n't be institutional gridlock - in the end it will muddle through . " she said she expected a number of issues to arise after the new members had settled in , which could then be tackled by the eu .
" hopefully any shortcomings should provoke more reform , " grabbe said . integration delayed economically , the 10 new members have been integrating with western europe for over a decade . but some aspects of integration will be delayed - because countries on both sides of the former east-west divide want it that way .
most glaring will be the lack of new eu citizens ' ability to work legally in the old eu countries .
all of the western nations , with the exception of britain and ireland , will impose some sort of restrictions on their labor markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fearing germany will be overrun by unemployed poles , the government in berlin is likely to refuse them working privileges for a full seven years as allowed by eu treaties .
this has naturally incensed poland , which calls german concerns irrational . " there is no reason to expect there will be a mass inflow of poles to the german labor market .
but the german domestic situation does not facilitate a rational approach to this issue , " outgoing polish prime minister leszek miller said last month . poland , however , has its own reservations .
despite desperately needing foreign investment from western eu countries , warsaw has negotiated a 12-year ban on foreigners buying agricultural land .
poland fought hard for the restrictions because many poles are worried germans may be inclined to try and buy back land and real estate that they or their families once owned prior to be expelled from areas belonging to germany before world war ii . poland also showed that the new members wo n't shy away from blocking eu decision-making if it is in their interest when it last year led the campaign against the draft constitution for the bloc due to a dispute over voting rights .
warsaw has since dropped its hardliner stance on the matter , but only because its main ally , the conservative-led government of spain , was voted out of office in march . row over budget issues the constitution , along with the future funding of the eu , will be two of the top issues in brussels immediately following the accession of the 10 new countries .
fearing the poor east could increase the demand for aid in coming years , net contributor nations have already been arguing for months that the eu budget should be capped at one percent of each country 's gross national product . the european commission has dismissed such calls , arguing brussels would be expected to achieve more with less .
and those countries that have been the biggest beneficiaries of eu structural funds in past , in particular spain , greece and portugal , are unhappy aid will be diverted to the less fortunate new member states .
but some experts counter the eu does n't need more money , brussels just needs change its spending habits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas mauer from the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin singled out the often criticized the eu 's common agricultural policy , which subsidizes europe 's farmers with nearly half of the bloc 's total € 100-billion budget . " we have to ask ourselves what do we want to pay for ?
that agriculture takes up so much is longer responsible .
those funds could be put into research and development or other investments that could help all of europe , " mauer told dw-world . such disputes over money may resolve themselves if expansion brings real economic benefits to members both old and new as is expected .
according to some estimates , the new members ' gross domestic product could increase by 1.5 percent and some 300,000 new jobs will be created in the old countries . and as may 1 approaches , quibbling over the budget and other typical eu quarrels are sure to fade into the background as the leaders of the expanded union bask in the glow of the historic moment .

the historic enlargement of the bloc is being hailed as a chance to spread political stability and economic prosperity , but it will also bring a host of challenges . several years in the making , the expansion of the european union next month will mark the beginning of a new era for a continent long separated by conflict and ideology .
with the cold war now consigned to memory , a large swathe of formerly communist eastern europe - as well as the mediterranean islands of malta and cyprus - will join the prosperous west . poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia , estonia , latvia and lithuania have all waited 15 years after emerging from the shadow of the soviet union to finally be part of europe 's most exclusive club .
that means for the first time in modern history , more than 450 million europeans will be united in a single political entity stretching from the atlantic ocean to the baltic states ' eastern border with russia . " first and foremost this is a peace project , " günter verheugen , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , told german public broadcaster ard last week .
" it creates peace , stability and security in the european region . " many eu citizens - both old and new - likely share those noble sentiments .
but unfortunately for public officials in brussels and national capitals across the continent , as may 1 approaches , ever more europeans are also beginning to question what other effects eastward expansion of the bloc will have . large and unmanageable ? some are worried a union of 25 will become unwieldy , unmanageable and less transparent than it is now .
others , especially in countries bordering the new member states like germany and austria , fear they will lose their jobs as businesses move east in search of cheap labor and poorer easterners come west looking work .
though many concerns may be overblown , experts do agree that there are a number of daunting challenges awaiting the enlarged eu . " it 's certainly going to exacerbate how the eu tries to manage things , " heather grabbe , the deputy director at the centre for european reform in london , told dw-world .
having followed eu expansion for the better part of a decade , grabbe believes adding members to the table at brussels will force members to push for further reform of eu decision-making .
" there wo n't be institutional gridlock - in the end it will muddle through . " she said she expected a number of issues to arise after the new members had settled in , which could then be tackled by the eu .
" hopefully any shortcomings should provoke more reform , " grabbe said . integration delayed economically , the 10 new members have been integrating with western europe for over a decade . but some aspects of integration will be delayed - because countries on both sides of the former east-west divide want it that way .

but the german domestic situation does not facilitate a rational approach to this issue , " outgoing polish prime minister leszek miller said last month . poland , however , has its own reservations .
despite desperately needing foreign investment from western eu countries , warsaw has negotiated a 12-year ban on foreigners buying agricultural land .
poland fought hard for the restrictions because many poles are worried germans may be inclined to try and buy back land and real estate that they or their families once owned prior to be expelled from areas belonging to germany before world war ii . poland also showed that the new members wo n't shy away from blocking eu decision-making if it is in their interest when it last year led the campaign against the draft constitution for the bloc due to a dispute over voting rights .
warsaw has since dropped its hardliner stance on the matter , but only because its main ally , the conservative-led government of spain , was voted out of office in march . row over budget issues the constitution , along with the future funding of the eu , will be two of the top issues in brussels immediately following the accession of the 10 new countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe a final report card for new eu members where is europe headed ? verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit getting the green light europe -pipe- 30.04.2004 the eve of enlargement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe : the world 's biggest building site on may 1 , the eu will accept 10 new members .
the historic enlargement of the bloc is being hailed as a chance to spread political stability and economic prosperity , but it will also bring a host of challenges . several years in the making , the expansion of the european union next month will mark the beginning of a new era for a continent long separated by conflict and ideology .
with the cold war now consigned to memory , a large swathe of formerly communist eastern europe - as well as the mediterranean islands of malta and cyprus - will join the prosperous west . poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia , estonia , latvia and lithuania have all waited 15 years after emerging from the shadow of the soviet union to finally be part of europe 's most exclusive club .
that means for the first time in modern history , more than 450 million europeans will be united in a single political entity stretching from the atlantic ocean to the baltic states ' eastern border with russia . " first and foremost this is a peace project , " günter verheugen , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , told german public broadcaster ard last week .
" it creates peace , stability and security in the european region . " many eu citizens - both old and new - likely share those noble sentiments .
but unfortunately for public officials in brussels and national capitals across the continent , as may 1 approaches , ever more europeans are also beginning to question what other effects eastward expansion of the bloc will have . large and unmanageable ? some are worried a union of 25 will become unwieldy , unmanageable and less transparent than it is now .
others , especially in countries bordering the new member states like germany and austria , fear they will lose their jobs as businesses move east in search of cheap labor and poorer easterners come west looking work .
though many concerns may be overblown , experts do agree that there are a number of daunting challenges awaiting the enlarged eu . " it 's certainly going to exacerbate how the eu tries to manage things , " heather grabbe , the deputy director at the centre for european reform in london , told dw-world .
having followed eu expansion for the better part of a decade , grabbe believes adding members to the table at brussels will force members to push for further reform of eu decision-making .
" there wo n't be institutional gridlock - in the end it will muddle through . " she said she expected a number of issues to arise after the new members had settled in , which could then be tackled by the eu .
" hopefully any shortcomings should provoke more reform , " grabbe said . integration delayed economically , the 10 new members have been integrating with western europe for over a decade . but some aspects of integration will be delayed - because countries on both sides of the former east-west divide want it that way .
most glaring will be the lack of new eu citizens ' ability to work legally in the old eu countries .
all of the western nations , with the exception of britain and ireland , will impose some sort of restrictions on their labor markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fearing germany will be overrun by unemployed poles , the government in berlin is likely to refuse them working privileges for a full seven years as allowed by eu treaties .
this has naturally incensed poland , which calls german concerns irrational . " there is no reason to expect there will be a mass inflow of poles to the german labor market .
but the german domestic situation does not facilitate a rational approach to this issue , " outgoing polish prime minister leszek miller said last month . poland , however , has its own reservations .
despite desperately needing foreign investment from western eu countries , warsaw has negotiated a 12-year ban on foreigners buying agricultural land .
poland fought hard for the restrictions because many poles are worried germans may be inclined to try and buy back land and real estate that they or their families once owned prior to be expelled from areas belonging to germany before world war ii . poland also showed that the new members wo n't shy away from blocking eu decision-making if it is in their interest when it last year led the campaign against the draft constitution for the bloc due to a dispute over voting rights .

as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers . it 's the time of the year when all hell breaks loose in berlin and neighborhoods like turkish-dominated kreuzberg become urban battle grounds , complete with burning cars , smashed shop windows and violent clashes between police and rampaging teenagers . may day rioting has become a tradition in berlin , harking back to may 1 , 1987 , when left-wing demonstrators first took to the streets to protest against what they called a " bourgeois " celebration of the 750th anniversary of the founding of berlin . since then , the rioting has returned to berlin with unfailing regularity each year , first in west berlin and then following german reunification in 1990 , in both halves of the united city . tougher , quicker action this year however , city authorities and police are clear they plan to put an end to the violence that mars the largely peaceful may day demonstrations and festive atmosphere of the street fairs and parties that dot berlin 's historic center near the brandenburg gate , the hip eastern neighborhood of prenzlauer berg as well as its western neighbor , the kreuzberg district . berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , whose administration has used a " soft glove " approach in the past , has said that the police will crack down on rioters this year . berlin 's interior minister erhart körting has announced that the police on saturday will take swifter and tougher action against vandals and rioters than last year and also keep a watch on small groups of rowdy teenagers in kreuzberg on may day eve to preempt any rioting . a strenuous week for the police may day will mark the culmination of a difficult week for berlin 's police , who have had to provide security for a series of high-profile events , starting with the two-day osce anti-semitism conference on april 28 and 29 .

police cars usually begin parking outside the park by early evening . angry protests set to heighten demonstrations despite the heightened security measures and the heightened police presence - some 8,000 will be on the streets - officials admit that this year 's demonstrations are likely to take on an even angrier tone than usual . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 200,000 trade unionists plan to take part in traditional may day parades through the heart of the city to protest the federal government 's cuts in health care , social services and retirement pensions .

as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers . it 's the time of the year when all hell breaks loose in berlin and neighborhoods like turkish-dominated kreuzberg become urban battle grounds , complete with burning cars , smashed shop windows and violent clashes between police and rampaging teenagers . may day rioting has become a tradition in berlin , harking back to may 1 , 1987 , when left-wing demonstrators first took to the streets to protest against what they called a " bourgeois " celebration of the 750th anniversary of the founding of berlin . since then , the rioting has returned to berlin with unfailing regularity each year , first in west berlin and then following german reunification in 1990 , in both halves of the united city . tougher , quicker action this year however , city authorities and police are clear they plan to put an end to the violence that mars the largely peaceful may day demonstrations and festive atmosphere of the street fairs and parties that dot berlin 's historic center near the brandenburg gate , the hip eastern neighborhood of prenzlauer berg as well as its western neighbor , the kreuzberg district . berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , whose administration has used a " soft glove " approach in the past , has said that the police will crack down on rioters this year . berlin 's interior minister erhart körting has announced that the police on saturday will take swifter and tougher action against vandals and rioters than last year and also keep a watch on small groups of rowdy teenagers in kreuzberg on may day eve to preempt any rioting . a strenuous week for the police may day will mark the culmination of a difficult week for berlin 's police , who have had to provide security for a series of high-profile events , starting with the two-day osce anti-semitism conference on april 28 and 29 .
the conference welcomed , among other dignitaries , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and israeli president moshe katsav .

as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers . it 's the time of the year when all hell breaks loose in berlin and neighborhoods like turkish-dominated kreuzberg become urban battle grounds , complete with burning cars , smashed shop windows and violent clashes between police and rampaging teenagers . may day rioting has become a tradition in berlin , harking back to may 1 , 1987 , when left-wing demonstrators first took to the streets to protest against what they called a " bourgeois " celebration of the 750th anniversary of the founding of berlin . since then , the rioting has returned to berlin with unfailing regularity each year , first in west berlin and then following german reunification in 1990 , in both halves of the united city . tougher , quicker action this year however , city authorities and police are clear they plan to put an end to the violence that mars the largely peaceful may day demonstrations and festive atmosphere of the street fairs and parties that dot berlin 's historic center near the brandenburg gate , the hip eastern neighborhood of prenzlauer berg as well as its western neighbor , the kreuzberg district . berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , whose administration has used a " soft glove " approach in the past , has said that the police will crack down on rioters this year . berlin 's interior minister erhart körting has announced that the police on saturday will take swifter and tougher action against vandals and rioters than last year and also keep a watch on small groups of rowdy teenagers in kreuzberg on may day eve to preempt any rioting . a strenuous week for the police may day will mark the culmination of a difficult week for berlin 's police , who have had to provide security for a series of high-profile events , starting with the two-day osce anti-semitism conference on april 28 and 29 .
the conference welcomed , among other dignitaries , u.s. secretary of state colin powell and israeli president moshe katsav .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police in berlin police reinforcements were called in from other german states to assist local police , taking the total count of police officers to around 15,000 this past week , turning downtown berlin into a virtual fortress . on friday night before may day , police will be kept busy as several hundred high-ranking officials from all across europe converge on berlin 's central gendarmen markt square to take part in ceremonies marking the expansion of the european union by ten new members . the night before may day is also celebrated in germany as walpurgisnacht , a pagan ritual to usher in the spring , but which is also used as an occasion by leftist young people in berlin to go on a violent , often drunken rampages in the prenzlauer berg district .
police cars usually begin parking outside the park by early evening . angry protests set to heighten demonstrations despite the heightened security measures and the heightened police presence - some 8,000 will be on the streets - officials admit that this year 's demonstrations are likely to take on an even angrier tone than usual . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 200,000 trade unionists plan to take part in traditional may day parades through the heart of the city to protest the federal government 's cuts in health care , social services and retirement pensions . " this will contribute to a greater emotional and political edge to the demonstrations , " interior minister körting told the daily berliner zeitung .
" it would be naïve to believe that these days will pass peacefully . " in addition , some 2,500 neo-nazis plan to hold a rally in eastern berlin , with leftist counter-demonstrators vowing to stop them , setting the scene for possible clashes . berlin police president dieter glietsch has confirmed that the police will be more visible on may day this year and will clamp down on rioters .

from early may , the cost of litre and half litre cartons will rise by one pence , though this will not apply to organic milk .
the last time the cost of milk in the bailiwick went up was in may 2003 .
the agriculture and countryside board says the latest increase is below inflation .
the board said a rise was fair , as farmers have not seen an increase in the price of their milk for two years .
it also said the below inflation rise was due to greater efficiency at the guernsey dairy .
the new prices will take effect on sunday , 2 may .

according to the principality building society , the average cost of a house in wales has increased by 32.2 % in the last 12 months to £ 115,287 .
it means an average house is now worth the equivalent of more than five times the average annual earnings of people in wales of £ 21,398 .
typical mortgages are set to three-and-a half times a person 's salary .
the areas to see the fastest house price increases were swansea and bangor , with rises of more than 40 % .

according to the wales-based principality , the average first time buyer is now in their 30s before they get on the housing ladder .
principality chief executive , peter griffiths , said : " contrary to predictions , property prices have continued to soar across wales .
" we are concerned that people are finding it increasingly difficult to get onto the housing ladder and recognise the problems faced by first time buyers and people living in rural wales in particular .
" across wales , and especially in rural areas , houses have traditionally been affordable compared to earnings - this is no longer the case . "
and mr griffiths predicted more rises to come .
" while there is evidence of a slowing down in prices in our capital city , cardiff , we believe that house prices across wales will continue to increase throughout the year at a higher rate than other parts of the uk .
" segments of the swansea and bangor markets remain exceedingly strong and we continue to see high demand for properties in these areas . "
the average cost of a home in swansea has risen to £ 114,029 in the last year , up 42.9 % on the previous figure of £ 79,807 while prices in cardiff have risen by an average of 27.1 % to £ 151,038 .

the decision by operators caledonian macbrayne to run services to the hebridean island on the sabbath has split its 200-strong population .
a local petition suggested that just over half the population opposed the sunday boats but others think they will benefit tourism and business .
the area 's msp has condemned calmac for a lack of public consultation .
john farquhar munro , the lib dem member for ross , skye and inverness west , said the community should be asked for their views .
calmac insists there has been a demand for the seven-day sailings but some islanders are fiercely protective of the sabbath being a day of strict religious observance .
however , other residents support the new service which will mean visitors can now spend the weekend on the island without having to wait until monday to leave .
two return services to sconser on skye will operate from sunday , 2 may .

shareholders were less than happy at the meeting the firm , the only japanese auto giant in the red , announced its new leader at a shareholder meeting in tokyo .
the meeting was unusually stormy by japanese standards , with shareholders raising their voices to scold executives and warn of crisis ahead .
reports say mitsubishi group firms are readying a $ 2.3bn -lrb- £ 1.29bn -rrb- bail-out .
the nihon keizai shimbun newspaper said that toyota , the richest and most successful of japan 's auto companies , had been approached to help .
but both toyota and mitsubishi denied the story .
anger whatever the shape of the new plan , shareholders lost no time in expressing their displeasure .
" we came here worrying that mitsubishi motors might disappear , " one shouted .
" i feel we were betrayed . "
rolf eckrodt was daimlerchrysler 's man at mitsubishi the company 's troubles stem from deep debts and sliding sales - themselves partly caused by repeated problems with defects .
four years ago , the firm was forced to admit to covering up a range of problems .
and police are still investigating the death of a housewife , who was crushed by a wheel which fell off a mitsubishi truck in 2002 , to see whether defects were the cause .
us and europe but much of the car maker 's current problems arose from a disastrous push into the us youth market where indiscriminate offers of credit - along with discounts for rental firms and companies - initially helped lift its market share .
but soon it all came down like a house of cards as a growing number of their young customers defaulted on their loans .
as soon as mitsubishi tightened the purse strings , sales took a dive - down 25 % in the us during 2003 .
bad news indeed , this , given that the american market accounts for about a third of mitsubishi motors ' sales .
in europe , mitsubishi motors has fared rather better , though .
last month , it reported its first profits yet in its european history of more than 30 years .
changeover the new man at the top of mitsubishi , the company said , is to be yoichiro okazaki , currently head of mitsubishi heavy industries .
rolf eckrodt , mitsubishi 's previous executive , resigned on monday .
he had been appointed by daimlerchrysler , owner of 37 % of mitsubishi motors .
the german-us giant is itself in some disarray following the change of strategy at mitsubishi .
after pouring money into the japanese firm to help cover its losses and underwrite its debts , the stuttgart-based company gave up a week ago .

shareholders were less than happy at the meeting the firm , the only japanese auto giant in the red , announced its new leader at a shareholder meeting in tokyo .
the meeting was unusually stormy by japanese standards , with shareholders raising their voices to scold executives and warn of crisis ahead .
reports say mitsubishi group firms are readying a $ 2.3bn -lrb- £ 1.29bn -rrb- bail-out .
the nihon keizai shimbun newspaper said that toyota , the richest and most successful of japan 's auto companies , had been approached to help .
but both toyota and mitsubishi denied the story .
anger whatever the shape of the new plan , shareholders lost no time in expressing their displeasure .
" we came here worrying that mitsubishi motors might disappear , " one shouted .
" i feel we were betrayed . "
rolf eckrodt was daimlerchrysler 's man at mitsubishi the company 's troubles stem from deep debts and sliding sales - themselves partly caused by repeated problems with defects .
four years ago , the firm was forced to admit to covering up a range of problems .
and police are still investigating the death of a housewife , who was crushed by a wheel which fell off a mitsubishi truck in 2002 , to see whether defects were the cause .
us and europe but much of the car maker 's current problems arose from a disastrous push into the us youth market where indiscriminate offers of credit - along with discounts for rental firms and companies - initially helped lift its market share .
but soon it all came down like a house of cards as a growing number of their young customers defaulted on their loans .
as soon as mitsubishi tightened the purse strings , sales took a dive - down 25 % in the us during 2003 .
bad news indeed , this , given that the american market accounts for about a third of mitsubishi motors ' sales .
in europe , mitsubishi motors has fared rather better , though .
last month , it reported its first profits yet in its european history of more than 30 years .
changeover the new man at the top of mitsubishi , the company said , is to be yoichiro okazaki , currently head of mitsubishi heavy industries .
rolf eckrodt , mitsubishi 's previous executive , resigned on monday .
he had been appointed by daimlerchrysler , owner of 37 % of mitsubishi motors .
the german-us giant is itself in some disarray following the change of strategy at mitsubishi .
after pouring money into the japanese firm to help cover its losses and underwrite its debts , the stuttgart-based company gave up a week ago .
another collaborator , hyundai , has also warned it plans to scale back its partnership with daimlerchrysler .
the architect of the asia strategy , daimlerchrysler 's chief executive juergen schrempp , survived a supervisory board meeting on thursday .

up to 100 people are expected to smoke cannabis in cannon hill park , in birmingham , on saturday .
despite a relaxation of drug laws , introduced in january , people can still be prosecuted for smoking and possessing cannabis .
anyone caught smoking the drug will be told to leave by officials from birmingham city council .
two years ago a similar event was held in the park which attracted about 20 people but organisers are expecting greater numbers this year .
cannabis has been downgraded from class b to c , which means police will no longer automatically arrest those caught in possession of it .
organisers said it was highly likely people would bring quantities of the drug to the festival for their own personal use and it was up to the police to confiscate the cannabis if they wanted to .
the council said the event had been banned because the park was used by families and children .

the ufo was spherical and had two arms , the paper said .

the miner 's institute in newbridge , south wales , the old workhouse at llanfyllin in powys and cardigan castle have made the shortlist .
last year , the victoria baths in manchester won £ 3.5m after winning the live national final .
in all , 21 buildings across the uk have been chosen for the series , which will be presented again by griff rhys jones .
cardigan castle , which hosted the first ever national eisteddfod , was bought by the county council last year , after falling into disrepair .
the castle has been at the centre of battles between welsh princes and norman invaders , and was given as a dowry to catherine of aragon when she married henry viii .
sue lewis , who is supporting its bid , said it had been " fantastic " to get the castle back into public ownership , but said a lot of work was still needed .
" any help we can have , be it money or publicity , then it 's great , " she said .
" by restoring it , and opening it up to public access , it will make it a draw for tourists and put cardigan on the map - cardigan deserves that . "
the grade 2-listed llanfyllin workhouse in powys was built in 1838 .
it is closely linked with memories of poverty and suffering , but local am mick bates said its legacy was worth saving .
" it is part of our heritage - suffering is an important part of it , " he said .
he added that it was a good opportunity to invest in the architectural heritage of mid wales . "
i could n't even have imagined one year ago we would be fortunate enough to be in this position " howard stone the youngest of the three nominations in wales is the workingman 's institute and memorial hall in newbridge in the south wales valleys .
once the centre of the community , it was paid for by the miners themselves from a welfare scheme they set up , but has now become structurally unsound .
it has been taken over in the last year by a restoration team , and chairman howard stone said he was still shocked it had made the shortlist .
" if i 'm absolutely honest , i 'm still reeling from it , " he said .
" i could n't even have imagined one year ago we would be fortunate enough to be in this position . "
last year a georgian town house , llanelly house in llanelli , was voted into the finals of the first restoration series , while the othe two welsh entries were vaynol old hall in gwynedd and amlwch port and parys mountain in anglesey .
the restoration series will be launched on 8 may .

a new zealand woman has been sentenced to 15 months in jail for the attempted murder of her dying mother .
lesley martin , a known campaigner for euthanasia , wrote a book in which she described injecting her mother joy with morphine .
the 69-year-old woman , who had terminal bowel cancer , died the next day .
the case has sparked a national debate in new zealand , and comes less than a year after parliament rejected legislation to legalise mercy killings .
martin , an intensive care nurse , cared for her mother joy for five months before she died .
three years later she published a book about the experience entitled " to die like a dog " .
in it , she said that she had twice tried to kill her mother to ease her suffering - once injecting her with morphine and then by trying to suffocate her with a pillow .
it was after reading the book that new zealand police decided to pursue a homicide investigation .
high court justice john wild said he accepted that martin had acted from love and compassion for her terminally ill mother .
but he criticised her for showing a lack of remorse and even arrogance , saying she had given the impression she thought she was above the law .
prosecutor andrew cameron said he felt compassion for martin , but had to balance that against the value of human life .
" sanctity of life underpins our law in the most fundamental way , " he said .
martin 's lawyer donald stevens said he would appeal both the conviction and the sentence .
lesley martin is one of new zealand 's leading pro-euthanasia campaigners .
she helped found exit new zealand , a voluntary euthanasia lobby group with links to exit australia , the group founded by australian mercy killing campaigner dr philip nitschke .

the authority was ordered to reduce its spending and set its council tax increase at 8.5 % by local government minister nick raynsford on thursday .
the council 's proposed rise of 9.9 % was described as " unacceptable " .
the council has 12 days to make its case against the decision to the office of the deputy prime minister .
how do we square that circle ?
andrea colborne , torbay council the government accused torbay and a handful of other local authorities , including herefordshire and nottingham , of setting " excessive " budgets .
nick raynsford is standing by his decision .
he said : " it 's caused a great deal of anger and concern among many people in torbay .
" i did warn them that there would be a considerable degree of unhappiness , in my judgement , if they were not able to make further reductions in their budget .
" i 'm sorry that they 've been unable to do that , and that is why we 've had no option but to apply the cap . "
but the deputy leader of torbay , andrea colborne , said they were not taking the order lying down .
she said : " we can now go back and say again : ' we have special difficulties that face torbay .
these are the things you want us to do .
this is the money you say we may not have .
how do we square that circle ? ' . "
torbay liberal democrat mp adrian sanders is supporting the council .
he said : " i think they 've got a just case .
" torbay has the lowest council tax of the councils the government says it wishes to cap .
" it has the second lowest council tax in devon , and the actual increase in council tax has been lower than that in devon or in plymouth .

he is presenting test your pet , a bbc one series encouraging viewers to put their animals through a series of simple challenges devised by animal behaviourists .
" from the enormous number of pets in this country we are trying to get a database of what pets people prefer and what their pets ' intelligence and memory is like , " harris told bbc news online .
" we are also trying to find out which is the most intelligent type of pet - the dog , cat , bird , rodent , horse , goldfish or rabbit . "
natural the series sees the australian entertainer enter his 51st year in broadcasting , a career which spanned children 's cartoon shows , natural history projects , arts series rolf on art and uk chart-topper two little boys .
following the success of veterinary series animal hospital , the 74-year-old said it was natural for him to front test your pet .
" a lot of viewers said the animal hospital theme used to bring their dogs racing in to sit in front of the tv set , " he said .
" i think a lot of people will be shocked at how intelligent their pets are . "
coinciding with national pet week , test your pet will quiz as many pet owners as possible in what aims to be the biggest national survey of its kind .
" we want viewers to engage with a natural history programme in a new way , " harris said .
" rather than sitting back and being told about animal behaviour , we would like them to check for themselves and share their findings with us . "
harris said he tested all its challenges on his own two dogs and five cats , with varying degrees of success .
" the dogs picked it up really quickly , " he said .
" i dropped a treat onto a chair so they could no longer see it , and they soon realised where it had gone .
the cats simply refused to join in . "
memory the series has enrolled oxford university animal behaviour expert dr tim guilford to examine whether pet responses are based upon instinct , intelligence , memory development or mere coincidence .
" we have already challenged the belief that goldfish have a five-minute memory , " harris said .
" as the fish were being fed , a few drops of coloured dye were put into their water .
two days later the dye was dropped in again , and the fish would go straight to the coloured area looking for food . "
pets including a hamster and a horse will also be filmed in a bid to track their behaviour while their owners are asleep or absent . "
viewers may be stunned if they assume their pet is very bright " rolf harris in addition to test your pet , harris is currently filming a new series of rolf on art and four animal hospital behind-the-scenes specials .
while he remains open-minded about the results of the test your pet survey , he has an idea which group of pets will be ranked most intelligent .
" it could be parrots because they normally fly around in flocks of several hundred and suffer total boredom when deprived of the companionship of other birds , " he said .
harris adds a note of caution : " some viewers may be stunned if they have gone for years assuming their pet is very bright .
it could turn out to be really quite dim . "

the 10 accession countries were also " keenly aware " of the role the us had played in helping them achieve their freedom , mr blair writes in the times .
the new states , which join the eu on saturday , share the same views for europe 's future policies , he said .
the move to push for enlargement " will be seen as the right one " , he added .
' catalyst for change ' mr blair 's article appears just days after his u-turn decision to hold a referendum on the eu constitution .
europe is strongest and most effective as america 's partner , not its rival or servant tony blair conservative leader michael howard outlined his party 's opposition to an eu constitution on thursday , by claiming : " we do n't want to be part of a country called europe . "
the nations joining the eu are : cyprus , czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
writing in the times , mr blair says : " i believe ... that the accession tomorrow will be a catalyst for change within the eu , helping to give a new push to britain 's agenda and fresh impetus to priorities which are already in the ascendancy in europe . "
independence he reiterated his warning that " no one will be able to come from the new accession countries to britain simply to claim benefits " or be eligible for housing " unless they are economically active " .
