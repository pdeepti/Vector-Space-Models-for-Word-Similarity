the case may revive the debate on antiquated soccer regulations . german sportswear manufacturer puma 's legal case against world soccer 's governing body fifa regarding the ban of a controversial one-piece kit worn by cameroon during this year 's african nations cup continues to be reviewed by a german court .
whatever the final judgment , companies with a soccer focus will have once again questioned the will of the powers-that-be to advance the game .
puma filed a lawsuit at a court in the german city of nuremberg this week claiming € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.41 million -rrb- in damages .
after fifa banned the german firm 's suit then imposed a six-point sanction on cameroon 's 2006 world cup qualifying campaign because the team continued to wear it at the nations cup .
fifa rescinded the ban , which would have seriously hindered cameroon 's chances of reaching the 2006 finals in germany , in may after the intervention of the african football federation -lrb- caf -rrb- .
cameroon courts controversy again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameroon players were forced to wear another shirt under their sleeveless ones in japan .
the indomitable lions are no strangers to kit controversy .
they turned up for the 2002 african nations cup in mali sporting sleeveless shirts which were subsequently banned by fifa .
they then sported the shirts at the world cup in japan / korea in the same year and were forced to wear t-shirts underneath .
" the misconduct of fifa and the damage caused by such will be challenged by puma in a court of law , " puma lawyer reinhard stünkel told reuters .
" fifa has imposed unclear boundaries and regulations that are open for interpretation , " added stünkel , who said official approval of the one-piece kit remained a primary objective for puma .
stünkel described the ban as " yet another example of fifa extending their power beyond the regulations and statutes provided " .
legal victory could revolutionize sport the case , if won , may not only rejuvenate cameroon 's world cup challenge but could also pep up a sport which has failed to adapt radically to the demands of the modern game .
a courtroom victory would be one over excessive puinishment but it could lead to a further modernizing of the equipment involved in the game , allowing clubs to provide innovative uniforms that enhance performance .
the cameroon kit is similar to the all-in-one body suits used by athletes such as sprinters to improve aerodynamics and increase speed .
balls and boots have changed with the times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old balls and boots were heavier and more uncomfortable in the " good " old days .
improvements have been made to other parts of soccer equipment over the years .
the balls recently seen flying through the air at the european championships in portugal in june were a world away from the inflated pig skins used in the early origins of the game and the heavy leather examples which followed later .
reduced weight and modern materials increased flight and bounce , making for a more exciting event .
boots have also advanced .
technological advances have been made in comfort , flexibility and performance , notably in the early 1990 's with the development of the first adidas predator boot which featured a scientifically designed in-step area to assist curling passes and control .
since then , soccer boots have incorporated separate impact zones , torsion bars and even their own suspension systems .
and just as the ford motor company eventually moved away from the philosophy of " any color you like as long as it is black , " soccer boots now come in all manner of shades and designs .
millennium sport , historical uniform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's temperature controlled away shirt was designed by nasa scientists .
while the soccer kit itself has advanced in recent years to add a higher degree of comfort and style to playing the game , the standard three-piece suit still harks back to the days when shorts were actually " longs " and shirts were a ninety minute sentence .
in the 21st century , soccer uniforms are still basically the same as those in the 19th .
when contacted by dw-world , a fifa representative refused to comment on the issue due to the on-going legal process but referred to the official regulations regarding kit in the fifa statute .
fifa lists shirts and shorts as basic equipment in its regulations and believes this implies the items have to be separate . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more than just the shirt on your back if stars like franz beckenbauer had looked into the future during the 1970 's and seen the soccer shirts of today , they would have thought they were looking at space age technology - and they would n't have been wrong !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.07.2004 puma lawsuit turns spotlight on dated soccer ideals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all for one and one for all : puma stands by its radical uniform german sports firm puma is suing world soccer body fifa after it punished the cameroon national team for wearing the company 's all-in-one uniform .
the case may revive the debate on antiquated soccer regulations . german sportswear manufacturer puma 's legal case against world soccer 's governing body fifa regarding the ban of a controversial one-piece kit worn by cameroon during this year 's african nations cup continues to be reviewed by a german court .
whatever the final judgment , companies with a soccer focus will have once again questioned the will of the powers-that-be to advance the game .
puma filed a lawsuit at a court in the german city of nuremberg this week claiming € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.41 million -rrb- in damages .
after fifa banned the german firm 's suit then imposed a six-point sanction on cameroon 's 2006 world cup qualifying campaign because the team continued to wear it at the nations cup .
fifa rescinded the ban , which would have seriously hindered cameroon 's chances of reaching the 2006 finals in germany , in may after the intervention of the african football federation -lrb- caf -rrb- .
cameroon courts controversy again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameroon players were forced to wear another shirt under their sleeveless ones in japan .
the indomitable lions are no strangers to kit controversy .
they turned up for the 2002 african nations cup in mali sporting sleeveless shirts which were subsequently banned by fifa .
they then sported the shirts at the world cup in japan / korea in the same year and were forced to wear t-shirts underneath .
" the misconduct of fifa and the damage caused by such will be challenged by puma in a court of law , " puma lawyer reinhard stünkel told reuters .
" fifa has imposed unclear boundaries and regulations that are open for interpretation , " added stünkel , who said official approval of the one-piece kit remained a primary objective for puma .
stünkel described the ban as " yet another example of fifa extending their power beyond the regulations and statutes provided " .
legal victory could revolutionize sport the case , if won , may not only rejuvenate cameroon 's world cup challenge but could also pep up a sport which has failed to adapt radically to the demands of the modern game .
a courtroom victory would be one over excessive puinishment but it could lead to a further modernizing of the equipment involved in the game , allowing clubs to provide innovative uniforms that enhance performance .
the cameroon kit is similar to the all-in-one body suits used by athletes such as sprinters to improve aerodynamics and increase speed .
balls and boots have changed with the times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old balls and boots were heavier and more uncomfortable in the " good " old days .
improvements have been made to other parts of soccer equipment over the years .
the balls recently seen flying through the air at the european championships in portugal in june were a world away from the inflated pig skins used in the early origins of the game and the heavy leather examples which followed later .
reduced weight and modern materials increased flight and bounce , making for a more exciting event .
boots have also advanced .
technological advances have been made in comfort , flexibility and performance , notably in the early 1990 's with the development of the first adidas predator boot which featured a scientifically designed in-step area to assist curling passes and control .
since then , soccer boots have incorporated separate impact zones , torsion bars and even their own suspension systems .
and just as the ford motor company eventually moved away from the philosophy of " any color you like as long as it is black , " soccer boots now come in all manner of shades and designs .
millennium sport , historical uniform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's temperature controlled away shirt was designed by nasa scientists .
while the soccer kit itself has advanced in recent years to add a higher degree of comfort and style to playing the game , the standard three-piece suit still harks back to the days when shorts were actually " longs " and shirts were a ninety minute sentence .
in the 21st century , soccer uniforms are still basically the same as those in the 19th .
when contacted by dw-world , a fifa representative refused to comment on the issue due to the on-going legal process but referred to the official regulations regarding kit in the fifa statute .

the case may revive the debate on antiquated soccer regulations . german sportswear manufacturer puma 's legal case against world soccer 's governing body fifa regarding the ban of a controversial one-piece kit worn by cameroon during this year 's african nations cup continues to be reviewed by a german court .
whatever the final judgment , companies with a soccer focus will have once again questioned the will of the powers-that-be to advance the game .
puma filed a lawsuit at a court in the german city of nuremberg this week claiming € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.41 million -rrb- in damages .
after fifa banned the german firm 's suit then imposed a six-point sanction on cameroon 's 2006 world cup qualifying campaign because the team continued to wear it at the nations cup .
fifa rescinded the ban , which would have seriously hindered cameroon 's chances of reaching the 2006 finals in germany , in may after the intervention of the african football federation -lrb- caf -rrb- .

they turned up for the 2002 african nations cup in mali sporting sleeveless shirts which were subsequently banned by fifa .
they then sported the shirts at the world cup in japan / korea in the same year and were forced to wear t-shirts underneath .
" the misconduct of fifa and the damage caused by such will be challenged by puma in a court of law , " puma lawyer reinhard stünkel told reuters .
" fifa has imposed unclear boundaries and regulations that are open for interpretation , " added stünkel , who said official approval of the one-piece kit remained a primary objective for puma .
stünkel described the ban as " yet another example of fifa extending their power beyond the regulations and statutes provided " .
legal victory could revolutionize sport the case , if won , may not only rejuvenate cameroon 's world cup challenge but could also pep up a sport which has failed to adapt radically to the demands of the modern game .
a courtroom victory would be one over excessive puinishment but it could lead to a further modernizing of the equipment involved in the game , allowing clubs to provide innovative uniforms that enhance performance .

fifa rescinded the ban , which would have seriously hindered cameroon 's chances of reaching the 2006 finals in germany , in may after the intervention of the african football federation -lrb- caf -rrb- .
cameroon courts controversy again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameroon players were forced to wear another shirt under their sleeveless ones in japan .
the indomitable lions are no strangers to kit controversy .
they turned up for the 2002 african nations cup in mali sporting sleeveless shirts which were subsequently banned by fifa .
they then sported the shirts at the world cup in japan / korea in the same year and were forced to wear t-shirts underneath .
" the misconduct of fifa and the damage caused by such will be challenged by puma in a court of law , " puma lawyer reinhard stünkel told reuters .
" fifa has imposed unclear boundaries and regulations that are open for interpretation , " added stünkel , who said official approval of the one-piece kit remained a primary objective for puma .
stünkel described the ban as " yet another example of fifa extending their power beyond the regulations and statutes provided " .
legal victory could revolutionize sport the case , if won , may not only rejuvenate cameroon 's world cup challenge but could also pep up a sport which has failed to adapt radically to the demands of the modern game .
a courtroom victory would be one over excessive puinishment but it could lead to a further modernizing of the equipment involved in the game , allowing clubs to provide innovative uniforms that enhance performance .

technological advances have been made in comfort , flexibility and performance , notably in the early 1990 's with the development of the first adidas predator boot which featured a scientifically designed in-step area to assist curling passes and control .
since then , soccer boots have incorporated separate impact zones , torsion bars and even their own suspension systems .

the case may revive the debate on antiquated soccer regulations . german sportswear manufacturer puma 's legal case against world soccer 's governing body fifa regarding the ban of a controversial one-piece kit worn by cameroon during this year 's african nations cup continues to be reviewed by a german court .
whatever the final judgment , companies with a soccer focus will have once again questioned the will of the powers-that-be to advance the game .
puma filed a lawsuit at a court in the german city of nuremberg this week claiming € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.41 million -rrb- in damages .
after fifa banned the german firm 's suit then imposed a six-point sanction on cameroon 's 2006 world cup qualifying campaign because the team continued to wear it at the nations cup .
fifa rescinded the ban , which would have seriously hindered cameroon 's chances of reaching the 2006 finals in germany , in may after the intervention of the african football federation -lrb- caf -rrb- .
cameroon courts controversy again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameroon players were forced to wear another shirt under their sleeveless ones in japan .
the indomitable lions are no strangers to kit controversy .
they turned up for the 2002 african nations cup in mali sporting sleeveless shirts which were subsequently banned by fifa .
they then sported the shirts at the world cup in japan / korea in the same year and were forced to wear t-shirts underneath .
" the misconduct of fifa and the damage caused by such will be challenged by puma in a court of law , " puma lawyer reinhard stünkel told reuters .
" fifa has imposed unclear boundaries and regulations that are open for interpretation , " added stünkel , who said official approval of the one-piece kit remained a primary objective for puma .
stünkel described the ban as " yet another example of fifa extending their power beyond the regulations and statutes provided " .
legal victory could revolutionize sport the case , if won , may not only rejuvenate cameroon 's world cup challenge but could also pep up a sport which has failed to adapt radically to the demands of the modern game .
a courtroom victory would be one over excessive puinishment but it could lead to a further modernizing of the equipment involved in the game , allowing clubs to provide innovative uniforms that enhance performance .
the cameroon kit is similar to the all-in-one body suits used by athletes such as sprinters to improve aerodynamics and increase speed .
balls and boots have changed with the times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old balls and boots were heavier and more uncomfortable in the " good " old days .
improvements have been made to other parts of soccer equipment over the years .
the balls recently seen flying through the air at the european championships in portugal in june were a world away from the inflated pig skins used in the early origins of the game and the heavy leather examples which followed later .
reduced weight and modern materials increased flight and bounce , making for a more exciting event .
boots have also advanced .
technological advances have been made in comfort , flexibility and performance , notably in the early 1990 's with the development of the first adidas predator boot which featured a scientifically designed in-step area to assist curling passes and control .
since then , soccer boots have incorporated separate impact zones , torsion bars and even their own suspension systems .
and just as the ford motor company eventually moved away from the philosophy of " any color you like as long as it is black , " soccer boots now come in all manner of shades and designs .
millennium sport , historical uniform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's temperature controlled away shirt was designed by nasa scientists .
while the soccer kit itself has advanced in recent years to add a higher degree of comfort and style to playing the game , the standard three-piece suit still harks back to the days when shorts were actually " longs " and shirts were a ninety minute sentence .
in the 21st century , soccer uniforms are still basically the same as those in the 19th .
when contacted by dw-world , a fifa representative refused to comment on the issue due to the on-going legal process but referred to the official regulations regarding kit in the fifa statute .

the case may revive the debate on antiquated soccer regulations . german sportswear manufacturer puma 's legal case against world soccer 's governing body fifa regarding the ban of a controversial one-piece kit worn by cameroon during this year 's african nations cup continues to be reviewed by a german court .
whatever the final judgment , companies with a soccer focus will have once again questioned the will of the powers-that-be to advance the game .
puma filed a lawsuit at a court in the german city of nuremberg this week claiming € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.41 million -rrb- in damages .
after fifa banned the german firm 's suit then imposed a six-point sanction on cameroon 's 2006 world cup qualifying campaign because the team continued to wear it at the nations cup .
fifa rescinded the ban , which would have seriously hindered cameroon 's chances of reaching the 2006 finals in germany , in may after the intervention of the african football federation -lrb- caf -rrb- .
cameroon courts controversy again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameroon players were forced to wear another shirt under their sleeveless ones in japan .
the indomitable lions are no strangers to kit controversy .
they turned up for the 2002 african nations cup in mali sporting sleeveless shirts which were subsequently banned by fifa .
they then sported the shirts at the world cup in japan / korea in the same year and were forced to wear t-shirts underneath .
" the misconduct of fifa and the damage caused by such will be challenged by puma in a court of law , " puma lawyer reinhard stünkel told reuters .
" fifa has imposed unclear boundaries and regulations that are open for interpretation , " added stünkel , who said official approval of the one-piece kit remained a primary objective for puma .
stünkel described the ban as " yet another example of fifa extending their power beyond the regulations and statutes provided " .
legal victory could revolutionize sport the case , if won , may not only rejuvenate cameroon 's world cup challenge but could also pep up a sport which has failed to adapt radically to the demands of the modern game .
a courtroom victory would be one over excessive puinishment but it could lead to a further modernizing of the equipment involved in the game , allowing clubs to provide innovative uniforms that enhance performance .
the cameroon kit is similar to the all-in-one body suits used by athletes such as sprinters to improve aerodynamics and increase speed .

technological advances have been made in comfort , flexibility and performance , notably in the early 1990 's with the development of the first adidas predator boot which featured a scientifically designed in-step area to assist curling passes and control .
since then , soccer boots have incorporated separate impact zones , torsion bars and even their own suspension systems .
and just as the ford motor company eventually moved away from the philosophy of " any color you like as long as it is black , " soccer boots now come in all manner of shades and designs .
millennium sport , historical uniform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's temperature controlled away shirt was designed by nasa scientists .
while the soccer kit itself has advanced in recent years to add a higher degree of comfort and style to playing the game , the standard three-piece suit still harks back to the days when shorts were actually " longs " and shirts were a ninety minute sentence .
in the 21st century , soccer uniforms are still basically the same as those in the 19th .
when contacted by dw-world , a fifa representative refused to comment on the issue due to the on-going legal process but referred to the official regulations regarding kit in the fifa statute .

the case may revive the debate on antiquated soccer regulations . german sportswear manufacturer puma 's legal case against world soccer 's governing body fifa regarding the ban of a controversial one-piece kit worn by cameroon during this year 's african nations cup continues to be reviewed by a german court .
whatever the final judgment , companies with a soccer focus will have once again questioned the will of the powers-that-be to advance the game .
puma filed a lawsuit at a court in the german city of nuremberg this week claiming € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.41 million -rrb- in damages .
after fifa banned the german firm 's suit then imposed a six-point sanction on cameroon 's 2006 world cup qualifying campaign because the team continued to wear it at the nations cup .
fifa rescinded the ban , which would have seriously hindered cameroon 's chances of reaching the 2006 finals in germany , in may after the intervention of the african football federation -lrb- caf -rrb- .
cameroon courts controversy again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameroon players were forced to wear another shirt under their sleeveless ones in japan .
the indomitable lions are no strangers to kit controversy .
they turned up for the 2002 african nations cup in mali sporting sleeveless shirts which were subsequently banned by fifa .
they then sported the shirts at the world cup in japan / korea in the same year and were forced to wear t-shirts underneath .
" the misconduct of fifa and the damage caused by such will be challenged by puma in a court of law , " puma lawyer reinhard stünkel told reuters .
" fifa has imposed unclear boundaries and regulations that are open for interpretation , " added stünkel , who said official approval of the one-piece kit remained a primary objective for puma .
stünkel described the ban as " yet another example of fifa extending their power beyond the regulations and statutes provided " .
legal victory could revolutionize sport the case , if won , may not only rejuvenate cameroon 's world cup challenge but could also pep up a sport which has failed to adapt radically to the demands of the modern game .
a courtroom victory would be one over excessive puinishment but it could lead to a further modernizing of the equipment involved in the game , allowing clubs to provide innovative uniforms that enhance performance .
the cameroon kit is similar to the all-in-one body suits used by athletes such as sprinters to improve aerodynamics and increase speed .
balls and boots have changed with the times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old balls and boots were heavier and more uncomfortable in the " good " old days .
improvements have been made to other parts of soccer equipment over the years .
the balls recently seen flying through the air at the european championships in portugal in june were a world away from the inflated pig skins used in the early origins of the game and the heavy leather examples which followed later .
reduced weight and modern materials increased flight and bounce , making for a more exciting event .
boots have also advanced .
technological advances have been made in comfort , flexibility and performance , notably in the early 1990 's with the development of the first adidas predator boot which featured a scientifically designed in-step area to assist curling passes and control .
since then , soccer boots have incorporated separate impact zones , torsion bars and even their own suspension systems .
and just as the ford motor company eventually moved away from the philosophy of " any color you like as long as it is black , " soccer boots now come in all manner of shades and designs .
millennium sport , historical uniform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's temperature controlled away shirt was designed by nasa scientists .
while the soccer kit itself has advanced in recent years to add a higher degree of comfort and style to playing the game , the standard three-piece suit still harks back to the days when shorts were actually " longs " and shirts were a ninety minute sentence .
in the 21st century , soccer uniforms are still basically the same as those in the 19th .

" the task was to preserve the character of the stadium while at the same time bringing it up to modern standards and giving it a lighter counterbalance through the roof compared to the heavy , massive stadium walls , " alexander goerbing , spokesman for the construction company overseeing the project , told the reuters news agency . and the reactions so far have been positive .
" the building is one of the few third reich buildings left , but the new stadium does n't exude the bombastic feeling of the nazi era , " hans joachim teichler , a member of the advisory panel supervising the renovation , told reuters . a taste of things to come the celebrations to mark the opening of the new stadium will get underway on saturday evening , with pop stars nena and p ! nk providing some of the musical entertainment .
they will be joined by the berlin star conductor daniel barenboim with the west eastern divan orchestra and the perfomance artists from the blue man group from the united states . as the night of entertainment reaches its end , the stadium will fall quiet again for a few hours before herta bsc start warming up for the first match under its new roof - a friendly against the top turkish team besiktas istanbul on sunday . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting the ball rolling recession-plagued germany plans to scrape up more than € 6 billion to prepare for the soccer world championship in 2006 , says economics minister clement .

the case may revive the debate on antiquated soccer regulations . german sportswear manufacturer puma 's legal case against world soccer 's governing body fifa regarding the ban of a controversial one-piece kit worn by cameroon during this year 's african nations cup continues to be reviewed by a german court .
whatever the final judgment , companies with a soccer focus will have once again questioned the will of the powers-that-be to advance the game .
puma filed a lawsuit at a court in the german city of nuremberg this week claiming € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.41 million -rrb- in damages .
after fifa banned the german firm 's suit then imposed a six-point sanction on cameroon 's 2006 world cup qualifying campaign because the team continued to wear it at the nations cup .
fifa rescinded the ban , which would have seriously hindered cameroon 's chances of reaching the 2006 finals in germany , in may after the intervention of the african football federation -lrb- caf -rrb- .

they turned up for the 2002 african nations cup in mali sporting sleeveless shirts which were subsequently banned by fifa .
they then sported the shirts at the world cup in japan / korea in the same year and were forced to wear t-shirts underneath .
" the misconduct of fifa and the damage caused by such will be challenged by puma in a court of law , " puma lawyer reinhard stünkel told reuters .
" fifa has imposed unclear boundaries and regulations that are open for interpretation , " added stünkel , who said official approval of the one-piece kit remained a primary objective for puma .
stünkel described the ban as " yet another example of fifa extending their power beyond the regulations and statutes provided " .
legal victory could revolutionize sport the case , if won , may not only rejuvenate cameroon 's world cup challenge but could also pep up a sport which has failed to adapt radically to the demands of the modern game .
a courtroom victory would be one over excessive puinishment but it could lead to a further modernizing of the equipment involved in the game , allowing clubs to provide innovative uniforms that enhance performance .
the cameroon kit is similar to the all-in-one body suits used by athletes such as sprinters to improve aerodynamics and increase speed .

reduced weight and modern materials increased flight and bounce , making for a more exciting event .
boots have also advanced .
technological advances have been made in comfort , flexibility and performance , notably in the early 1990 's with the development of the first adidas predator boot which featured a scientifically designed in-step area to assist curling passes and control .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.07.2004 puma lawsuit turns spotlight on dated soccer ideals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all for one and one for all : puma stands by its radical uniform german sports firm puma is suing world soccer body fifa after it punished the cameroon national team for wearing the company 's all-in-one uniform .
the case may revive the debate on antiquated soccer regulations . german sportswear manufacturer puma 's legal case against world soccer 's governing body fifa regarding the ban of a controversial one-piece kit worn by cameroon during this year 's african nations cup continues to be reviewed by a german court .
whatever the final judgment , companies with a soccer focus will have once again questioned the will of the powers-that-be to advance the game .
puma filed a lawsuit at a court in the german city of nuremberg this week claiming € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.41 million -rrb- in damages .
after fifa banned the german firm 's suit then imposed a six-point sanction on cameroon 's 2006 world cup qualifying campaign because the team continued to wear it at the nations cup .
fifa rescinded the ban , which would have seriously hindered cameroon 's chances of reaching the 2006 finals in germany , in may after the intervention of the african football federation -lrb- caf -rrb- .
cameroon courts controversy again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameroon players were forced to wear another shirt under their sleeveless ones in japan .
the indomitable lions are no strangers to kit controversy .
they turned up for the 2002 african nations cup in mali sporting sleeveless shirts which were subsequently banned by fifa .
they then sported the shirts at the world cup in japan / korea in the same year and were forced to wear t-shirts underneath .
" the misconduct of fifa and the damage caused by such will be challenged by puma in a court of law , " puma lawyer reinhard stünkel told reuters .
" fifa has imposed unclear boundaries and regulations that are open for interpretation , " added stünkel , who said official approval of the one-piece kit remained a primary objective for puma .
stünkel described the ban as " yet another example of fifa extending their power beyond the regulations and statutes provided " .
legal victory could revolutionize sport the case , if won , may not only rejuvenate cameroon 's world cup challenge but could also pep up a sport which has failed to adapt radically to the demands of the modern game .
a courtroom victory would be one over excessive puinishment but it could lead to a further modernizing of the equipment involved in the game , allowing clubs to provide innovative uniforms that enhance performance .
the cameroon kit is similar to the all-in-one body suits used by athletes such as sprinters to improve aerodynamics and increase speed .
balls and boots have changed with the times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old balls and boots were heavier and more uncomfortable in the " good " old days .
improvements have been made to other parts of soccer equipment over the years .
the balls recently seen flying through the air at the european championships in portugal in june were a world away from the inflated pig skins used in the early origins of the game and the heavy leather examples which followed later .
reduced weight and modern materials increased flight and bounce , making for a more exciting event .
boots have also advanced .
technological advances have been made in comfort , flexibility and performance , notably in the early 1990 's with the development of the first adidas predator boot which featured a scientifically designed in-step area to assist curling passes and control .
since then , soccer boots have incorporated separate impact zones , torsion bars and even their own suspension systems .
and just as the ford motor company eventually moved away from the philosophy of " any color you like as long as it is black , " soccer boots now come in all manner of shades and designs .
millennium sport , historical uniform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's temperature controlled away shirt was designed by nasa scientists .

the case may revive the debate on antiquated soccer regulations . german sportswear manufacturer puma 's legal case against world soccer 's governing body fifa regarding the ban of a controversial one-piece kit worn by cameroon during this year 's african nations cup continues to be reviewed by a german court .
whatever the final judgment , companies with a soccer focus will have once again questioned the will of the powers-that-be to advance the game .
puma filed a lawsuit at a court in the german city of nuremberg this week claiming € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.41 million -rrb- in damages .
after fifa banned the german firm 's suit then imposed a six-point sanction on cameroon 's 2006 world cup qualifying campaign because the team continued to wear it at the nations cup .
fifa rescinded the ban , which would have seriously hindered cameroon 's chances of reaching the 2006 finals in germany , in may after the intervention of the african football federation -lrb- caf -rrb- .

the indomitable lions are no strangers to kit controversy .
they turned up for the 2002 african nations cup in mali sporting sleeveless shirts which were subsequently banned by fifa .
they then sported the shirts at the world cup in japan / korea in the same year and were forced to wear t-shirts underneath .
" the misconduct of fifa and the damage caused by such will be challenged by puma in a court of law , " puma lawyer reinhard stünkel told reuters .
" fifa has imposed unclear boundaries and regulations that are open for interpretation , " added stünkel , who said official approval of the one-piece kit remained a primary objective for puma .
stünkel described the ban as " yet another example of fifa extending their power beyond the regulations and statutes provided " .
legal victory could revolutionize sport the case , if won , may not only rejuvenate cameroon 's world cup challenge but could also pep up a sport which has failed to adapt radically to the demands of the modern game .
a courtroom victory would be one over excessive puinishment but it could lead to a further modernizing of the equipment involved in the game , allowing clubs to provide innovative uniforms that enhance performance .
the cameroon kit is similar to the all-in-one body suits used by athletes such as sprinters to improve aerodynamics and increase speed .
balls and boots have changed with the times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old balls and boots were heavier and more uncomfortable in the " good " old days .

boots have also advanced .
technological advances have been made in comfort , flexibility and performance , notably in the early 1990 's with the development of the first adidas predator boot which featured a scientifically designed in-step area to assist curling passes and control .
since then , soccer boots have incorporated separate impact zones , torsion bars and even their own suspension systems .
and just as the ford motor company eventually moved away from the philosophy of " any color you like as long as it is black , " soccer boots now come in all manner of shades and designs .
millennium sport , historical uniform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's temperature controlled away shirt was designed by nasa scientists .
while the soccer kit itself has advanced in recent years to add a higher degree of comfort and style to playing the game , the standard three-piece suit still harks back to the days when shorts were actually " longs " and shirts were a ninety minute sentence .
in the 21st century , soccer uniforms are still basically the same as those in the 19th .
when contacted by dw-world , a fifa representative refused to comment on the issue due to the on-going legal process but referred to the official regulations regarding kit in the fifa statute .

the case may revive the debate on antiquated soccer regulations . german sportswear manufacturer puma 's legal case against world soccer 's governing body fifa regarding the ban of a controversial one-piece kit worn by cameroon during this year 's african nations cup continues to be reviewed by a german court .
whatever the final judgment , companies with a soccer focus will have once again questioned the will of the powers-that-be to advance the game .
puma filed a lawsuit at a court in the german city of nuremberg this week claiming € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.41 million -rrb- in damages .
after fifa banned the german firm 's suit then imposed a six-point sanction on cameroon 's 2006 world cup qualifying campaign because the team continued to wear it at the nations cup .
fifa rescinded the ban , which would have seriously hindered cameroon 's chances of reaching the 2006 finals in germany , in may after the intervention of the african football federation -lrb- caf -rrb- .
cameroon courts controversy again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameroon players were forced to wear another shirt under their sleeveless ones in japan .
the indomitable lions are no strangers to kit controversy .
they turned up for the 2002 african nations cup in mali sporting sleeveless shirts which were subsequently banned by fifa .
they then sported the shirts at the world cup in japan / korea in the same year and were forced to wear t-shirts underneath .
" the misconduct of fifa and the damage caused by such will be challenged by puma in a court of law , " puma lawyer reinhard stünkel told reuters .
" fifa has imposed unclear boundaries and regulations that are open for interpretation , " added stünkel , who said official approval of the one-piece kit remained a primary objective for puma .
stünkel described the ban as " yet another example of fifa extending their power beyond the regulations and statutes provided " .
legal victory could revolutionize sport the case , if won , may not only rejuvenate cameroon 's world cup challenge but could also pep up a sport which has failed to adapt radically to the demands of the modern game .
a courtroom victory would be one over excessive puinishment but it could lead to a further modernizing of the equipment involved in the game , allowing clubs to provide innovative uniforms that enhance performance .
the cameroon kit is similar to the all-in-one body suits used by athletes such as sprinters to improve aerodynamics and increase speed .

technological advances have been made in comfort , flexibility and performance , notably in the early 1990 's with the development of the first adidas predator boot which featured a scientifically designed in-step area to assist curling passes and control .
since then , soccer boots have incorporated separate impact zones , torsion bars and even their own suspension systems .

while the soccer kit itself has advanced in recent years to add a higher degree of comfort and style to playing the game , the standard three-piece suit still harks back to the days when shorts were actually " longs " and shirts were a ninety minute sentence .
in the 21st century , soccer uniforms are still basically the same as those in the 19th .

the case may revive the debate on antiquated soccer regulations . german sportswear manufacturer puma 's legal case against world soccer 's governing body fifa regarding the ban of a controversial one-piece kit worn by cameroon during this year 's african nations cup continues to be reviewed by a german court .
whatever the final judgment , companies with a soccer focus will have once again questioned the will of the powers-that-be to advance the game .
puma filed a lawsuit at a court in the german city of nuremberg this week claiming € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.41 million -rrb- in damages .
after fifa banned the german firm 's suit then imposed a six-point sanction on cameroon 's 2006 world cup qualifying campaign because the team continued to wear it at the nations cup .
fifa rescinded the ban , which would have seriously hindered cameroon 's chances of reaching the 2006 finals in germany , in may after the intervention of the african football federation -lrb- caf -rrb- .
cameroon courts controversy again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameroon players were forced to wear another shirt under their sleeveless ones in japan .
the indomitable lions are no strangers to kit controversy .
they turned up for the 2002 african nations cup in mali sporting sleeveless shirts which were subsequently banned by fifa .
they then sported the shirts at the world cup in japan / korea in the same year and were forced to wear t-shirts underneath .
" the misconduct of fifa and the damage caused by such will be challenged by puma in a court of law , " puma lawyer reinhard stünkel told reuters .
" fifa has imposed unclear boundaries and regulations that are open for interpretation , " added stünkel , who said official approval of the one-piece kit remained a primary objective for puma .
stünkel described the ban as " yet another example of fifa extending their power beyond the regulations and statutes provided " .
legal victory could revolutionize sport the case , if won , may not only rejuvenate cameroon 's world cup challenge but could also pep up a sport which has failed to adapt radically to the demands of the modern game .
a courtroom victory would be one over excessive puinishment but it could lead to a further modernizing of the equipment involved in the game , allowing clubs to provide innovative uniforms that enhance performance .
the cameroon kit is similar to the all-in-one body suits used by athletes such as sprinters to improve aerodynamics and increase speed .
balls and boots have changed with the times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old balls and boots were heavier and more uncomfortable in the " good " old days .
improvements have been made to other parts of soccer equipment over the years .
the balls recently seen flying through the air at the european championships in portugal in june were a world away from the inflated pig skins used in the early origins of the game and the heavy leather examples which followed later .
reduced weight and modern materials increased flight and bounce , making for a more exciting event .
boots have also advanced .
technological advances have been made in comfort , flexibility and performance , notably in the early 1990 's with the development of the first adidas predator boot which featured a scientifically designed in-step area to assist curling passes and control .
since then , soccer boots have incorporated separate impact zones , torsion bars and even their own suspension systems .
and just as the ford motor company eventually moved away from the philosophy of " any color you like as long as it is black , " soccer boots now come in all manner of shades and designs .
millennium sport , historical uniform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's temperature controlled away shirt was designed by nasa scientists .
while the soccer kit itself has advanced in recent years to add a higher degree of comfort and style to playing the game , the standard three-piece suit still harks back to the days when shorts were actually " longs " and shirts were a ninety minute sentence .
in the 21st century , soccer uniforms are still basically the same as those in the 19th .
when contacted by dw-world , a fifa representative refused to comment on the issue due to the on-going legal process but referred to the official regulations regarding kit in the fifa statute .
fifa lists shirts and shorts as basic equipment in its regulations and believes this implies the items have to be separate . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more than just the shirt on your back if stars like franz beckenbauer had looked into the future during the 1970 's and seen the soccer shirts of today , they would have thought they were looking at space age technology - and they would n't have been wrong !

the case may revive the debate on antiquated soccer regulations . german sportswear manufacturer puma 's legal case against world soccer 's governing body fifa regarding the ban of a controversial one-piece kit worn by cameroon during this year 's african nations cup continues to be reviewed by a german court .
whatever the final judgment , companies with a soccer focus will have once again questioned the will of the powers-that-be to advance the game .
puma filed a lawsuit at a court in the german city of nuremberg this week claiming € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.41 million -rrb- in damages .
after fifa banned the german firm 's suit then imposed a six-point sanction on cameroon 's 2006 world cup qualifying campaign because the team continued to wear it at the nations cup .
fifa rescinded the ban , which would have seriously hindered cameroon 's chances of reaching the 2006 finals in germany , in may after the intervention of the african football federation -lrb- caf -rrb- .
cameroon courts controversy again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameroon players were forced to wear another shirt under their sleeveless ones in japan .
the indomitable lions are no strangers to kit controversy .
they turned up for the 2002 african nations cup in mali sporting sleeveless shirts which were subsequently banned by fifa .
they then sported the shirts at the world cup in japan / korea in the same year and were forced to wear t-shirts underneath .
" the misconduct of fifa and the damage caused by such will be challenged by puma in a court of law , " puma lawyer reinhard stünkel told reuters .
" fifa has imposed unclear boundaries and regulations that are open for interpretation , " added stünkel , who said official approval of the one-piece kit remained a primary objective for puma .
stünkel described the ban as " yet another example of fifa extending their power beyond the regulations and statutes provided " .

the case may revive the debate on antiquated soccer regulations . german sportswear manufacturer puma 's legal case against world soccer 's governing body fifa regarding the ban of a controversial one-piece kit worn by cameroon during this year 's african nations cup continues to be reviewed by a german court .
whatever the final judgment , companies with a soccer focus will have once again questioned the will of the powers-that-be to advance the game .
puma filed a lawsuit at a court in the german city of nuremberg this week claiming € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.41 million -rrb- in damages .
after fifa banned the german firm 's suit then imposed a six-point sanction on cameroon 's 2006 world cup qualifying campaign because the team continued to wear it at the nations cup .
fifa rescinded the ban , which would have seriously hindered cameroon 's chances of reaching the 2006 finals in germany , in may after the intervention of the african football federation -lrb- caf -rrb- .
cameroon courts controversy again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameroon players were forced to wear another shirt under their sleeveless ones in japan .
the indomitable lions are no strangers to kit controversy .
they turned up for the 2002 african nations cup in mali sporting sleeveless shirts which were subsequently banned by fifa .
they then sported the shirts at the world cup in japan / korea in the same year and were forced to wear t-shirts underneath .
" the misconduct of fifa and the damage caused by such will be challenged by puma in a court of law , " puma lawyer reinhard stünkel told reuters .
" fifa has imposed unclear boundaries and regulations that are open for interpretation , " added stünkel , who said official approval of the one-piece kit remained a primary objective for puma .
stünkel described the ban as " yet another example of fifa extending their power beyond the regulations and statutes provided " .
legal victory could revolutionize sport the case , if won , may not only rejuvenate cameroon 's world cup challenge but could also pep up a sport which has failed to adapt radically to the demands of the modern game .
a courtroom victory would be one over excessive puinishment but it could lead to a further modernizing of the equipment involved in the game , allowing clubs to provide innovative uniforms that enhance performance .
the cameroon kit is similar to the all-in-one body suits used by athletes such as sprinters to improve aerodynamics and increase speed .
balls and boots have changed with the times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old balls and boots were heavier and more uncomfortable in the " good " old days .
improvements have been made to other parts of soccer equipment over the years .
the balls recently seen flying through the air at the european championships in portugal in june were a world away from the inflated pig skins used in the early origins of the game and the heavy leather examples which followed later .
reduced weight and modern materials increased flight and bounce , making for a more exciting event .
boots have also advanced .
technological advances have been made in comfort , flexibility and performance , notably in the early 1990 's with the development of the first adidas predator boot which featured a scientifically designed in-step area to assist curling passes and control .
since then , soccer boots have incorporated separate impact zones , torsion bars and even their own suspension systems .
and just as the ford motor company eventually moved away from the philosophy of " any color you like as long as it is black , " soccer boots now come in all manner of shades and designs .
millennium sport , historical uniform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's temperature controlled away shirt was designed by nasa scientists .
while the soccer kit itself has advanced in recent years to add a higher degree of comfort and style to playing the game , the standard three-piece suit still harks back to the days when shorts were actually " longs " and shirts were a ninety minute sentence .
in the 21st century , soccer uniforms are still basically the same as those in the 19th .
when contacted by dw-world , a fifa representative refused to comment on the issue due to the on-going legal process but referred to the official regulations regarding kit in the fifa statute .

duke university medical center researchers found a strong link between caffeine intake at mealtimes and higher blood glucose and insulin levels .
writing in diabetes care , they suggest people with diabetes cut down the amount of caffeine they have .
but uk experts said diabetics simply needed to check their blood sugar levels to see what triggers increases .
much more research is be needed to clarify the significance of these findings debbie hammond , diabetes uk in type 2 diabetes , the body either does not produce enough insulin , which the body needs to convert food into energy , or is unable to make proper use of it .
without enough insulin , the body can not move blood sugar into the cells .
sugar builds up in the bloodstream and causes health problems .
other research into caffeine and coffee has shown varying results .
some have suggested caffeine reduces the body 's sensitivity to insulin .
however others have found components in coffee , such as magnesium and chlorogenic acid , could help prevent people developing type 2 diabetes .
blood checks the us researchers studied 14 habitual coffee drinkers with type 2 diabetes .
study participants were put on to a controlled diet in which they took their medications , had their blood tested and then were given caffeine capsules .
they then had another blood test before being given a liquid meal supplement and undergoing a third blood test .

geoff adams-spink bbc news online disability affairs reporter by 2006 barcelona 's transport will be fully accessible with the summer holidays upon us , people are heading for an ever wider variety of foreign destinations thanks to last minute deals and low-cost airlines .
but for disabled travellers finding a location that they can explore with ease requires careful research and forward planning .
bbc news online visits two leading european cities to see how they shape up .
city of access : barcelona , spain the city of barcelona did n't realise how difficult it was for disabled people to get around until the detailed planning work started for the 1992 olympics and paralympics .
in the short term the only answer was to borrow a fleet of buses from berlin to transport the teams of disabled athletes from one venue to another .
access equality it 's not just about seeing the film , it 's about a social activity , going out with friends nora bednarski picture gallery : accessible europe ?
the games were the catalyst for making barcelona one of the most disabled friendly cities in europe - and work is still going on to improve its accessibility .
eighty-five percent of barcelona 's buses are now equipped for wheelchair users , with the rest soon to follow .
it is a similar story on the city 's metro : of 121 stations , 39 are completely accessible to disabled passengers , 14 more are in the process of being adapted and a further 52 will be worked on during the course of this year .
" our aim is to make it easy for disabled people to be able to use the underground by themselves , " said belén rodríguez who runs barcelona 's metro system .
" two of our seven lines are now completely accessible , and we 'll have all of the work completed by the end of 2005 . "
these giant leaps forward in improving the lives of disabled people have been achieved by an alliance of disability campaigners and local politicians .
the result was an agreement signed by both parties which promised a fully accessible city by 2006 .
disabled bathers can enjoy the water with everyone else " it 's great for disabled people in barcelona , " rosa romia pastor told bbc news online .
when she is not at work in one of the city 's shops , ms romia pastor enjoys going to the beach .
barcelona has six beaches which have been adapted for disabled access .
the nova icária beach has accessible changing rooms , boardwalks all the way down to the water and a team of red cross volunteers who can assist people into amphibious chairs .
although barcelona has improved public spaces as well as its transport system , it lacks the sort of legislation that will force businesses in the uk to make their services available to disabled people in britain from october 1 this year .
but here , too , campaigners are now lobbying catalonia 's regional government to enact more stringent laws .
" most businesses do n't have a basic level of accessibility , " said ricard gomá who runs barcelona 's institute for people with disabilities .
" we need a regional law because , as a local authority , we do n't have the power to enforce these rules . "
mr gomá is confident that once the new laws are on the statute books his organisation will be able to champion disabled people 's rights in the private sector as it already has done in the public domain .
city of barriers : brussels , belgium in brussels - at the heart of the eu - disabled people have a very different experience of moving around the city .
although the metro was built 50 years after barcelona 's , it only has 10 accessible stations and wo n't be fully adapted until 2012 .
brussels : nul points heritage over access makeshift wheelchair ramps businesses not duty bound to change " there 's a lot to do in brussels and we are 20 years behind everyone else , " said cleon angelo who runs a local association of wheelchair users .
" this is very bad because brussels is the capital of europe and we should be showing a good example . "
in the city 's historic , cobbled streets preserving heritage has triumphed over providing access .
even the town hall - where people who get married are obliged to attend a civil ceremony - has no step free entrance .
wheelchair users have to be manhandled into the building or use with a makeshift ramp made of two planks of wood .
there is no obligation on businesses to make newly refurbished facilities accessibility either .
nora bednarski - a wheelchair user who works for the european disability forum - is unable to access any of the auditoria in her local ugc multiplex , the toisan d 'or .
" it 's not just about seeing the film , it 's about a social activity , going out with friends , " she said .
" for a person with reduced mobility in brussels that 's a very limited reality . "
until eu member states can agree on common standards of accessibility , travelling within and between them will continue to be something of a lottery for disabled people .

in the short term the only answer was to borrow a fleet of buses from berlin to transport the teams of disabled athletes from one venue to another .
access equality it 's not just about seeing the film , it 's about a social activity , going out with friends nora bednarski picture gallery : accessible europe ?
the games were the catalyst for making barcelona one of the most disabled friendly cities in europe - and work is still going on to improve its accessibility .
eighty-five percent of barcelona 's buses are now equipped for wheelchair users , with the rest soon to follow .
it is a similar story on the city 's metro : of 121 stations , 39 are completely accessible to disabled passengers , 14 more are in the process of being adapted and a further 52 will be worked on during the course of this year .
" our aim is to make it easy for disabled people to be able to use the underground by themselves , " said belén rodríguez who runs barcelona 's metro system .
" two of our seven lines are now completely accessible , and we 'll have all of the work completed by the end of 2005 . "
these giant leaps forward in improving the lives of disabled people have been achieved by an alliance of disability campaigners and local politicians .
the result was an agreement signed by both parties which promised a fully accessible city by 2006 .
disabled bathers can enjoy the water with everyone else " it 's great for disabled people in barcelona , " rosa romia pastor told bbc news online .
when she is not at work in one of the city 's shops , ms romia pastor enjoys going to the beach .
barcelona has six beaches which have been adapted for disabled access .
the nova icária beach has accessible changing rooms , boardwalks all the way down to the water and a team of red cross volunteers who can assist people into amphibious chairs .
although barcelona has improved public spaces as well as its transport system , it lacks the sort of legislation that will force businesses in the uk to make their services available to disabled people in britain from october 1 this year .
but here , too , campaigners are now lobbying catalonia 's regional government to enact more stringent laws .
" most businesses do n't have a basic level of accessibility , " said ricard gomá who runs barcelona 's institute for people with disabilities .
" we need a regional law because , as a local authority , we do n't have the power to enforce these rules . "
mr gomá is confident that once the new laws are on the statute books his organisation will be able to champion disabled people 's rights in the private sector as it already has done in the public domain .
city of barriers : brussels , belgium in brussels - at the heart of the eu - disabled people have a very different experience of moving around the city .
although the metro was built 50 years after barcelona 's , it only has 10 accessible stations and wo n't be fully adapted until 2012 .
brussels : nul points heritage over access makeshift wheelchair ramps businesses not duty bound to change " there 's a lot to do in brussels and we are 20 years behind everyone else , " said cleon angelo who runs a local association of wheelchair users .
" this is very bad because brussels is the capital of europe and we should be showing a good example . "
in the city 's historic , cobbled streets preserving heritage has triumphed over providing access .
even the town hall - where people who get married are obliged to attend a civil ceremony - has no step free entrance .
wheelchair users have to be manhandled into the building or use with a makeshift ramp made of two planks of wood .
there is no obligation on businesses to make newly refurbished facilities accessibility either .
nora bednarski - a wheelchair user who works for the european disability forum - is unable to access any of the auditoria in her local ugc multiplex , the toisan d 'or .
" it 's not just about seeing the film , it 's about a social activity , going out with friends , " she said .
" for a person with reduced mobility in brussels that 's a very limited reality . "
until eu member states can agree on common standards of accessibility , travelling within and between them will continue to be something of a lottery for disabled people .

disabled bathers can enjoy the water with everyone else " it 's great for disabled people in barcelona , " rosa romia pastor told bbc news online .

barcelona has six beaches which have been adapted for disabled access .
the nova icária beach has accessible changing rooms , boardwalks all the way down to the water and a team of red cross volunteers who can assist people into amphibious chairs .
although barcelona has improved public spaces as well as its transport system , it lacks the sort of legislation that will force businesses in the uk to make their services available to disabled people in britain from october 1 this year .
but here , too , campaigners are now lobbying catalonia 's regional government to enact more stringent laws .
" most businesses do n't have a basic level of accessibility , " said ricard gomá who runs barcelona 's institute for people with disabilities .
" we need a regional law because , as a local authority , we do n't have the power to enforce these rules . "
mr gomá is confident that once the new laws are on the statute books his organisation will be able to champion disabled people 's rights in the private sector as it already has done in the public domain .

cage married alice kim , a 20-year-old former sushi waitress , at a private ceremony in northern california .
the couple met five months ago when she served him in a los angeles restaurant .
cage and presley 's marriage broke down in 2002 after less than four months .
he had previously been married to actress patricia arquette for six years .
cage , 40 , and korean-american kim started dating in february and reportedly became engaged after two months .
their marriage was confirmed by the actor 's publicist , annett wolf .
turbulent cage 's romantic impulsiveness is well known .
he told arquette he intended to marry her only hours after their first meeting in 1987 .
the actress declined , though they eventually did marry eight years later after a chance meeting .
cage said at the time the two were " definitely soul mates " , but the marriage was a turbulent one - the couple split up only nine months after the wedding .
the pair eventually reunited , only to divorce in 2001 citing " irreconcilable differences " .
cage wed presley in august 2002 in a secret ceremony in hawaii , but the marriage lasted just 107 days .
at the time presley called the wedding " a big mistake " , saying the couple " should n't have been married in the first place " .
cage - who won an oscar for playing a drunkard in leaving las vegas - has a son , weston , born in 1990 from a relationship with the model kristina fulton .
his recent films include matchstick men and adaptation , for which he received his second oscar nomination .
he will next be seen in the action adventure movie national treasure .

ali joined bbc scotland as a travel reporter in the 1980s and went on to publish several books and become a champion for the gaelic language .
he was well-known for his wit and warmth , and was hugely popular with staff and listeners alike .
bbc scotland controller ken macquarrie said : " ali was one of those characters who always had a word to say to everyone who came into bbc scotland and he was soon on first name terms with scores of our contributors , who subsequently turned out in force to support his charity book .
" the glasgow newsroom wo n't be the same place without him and our thoughts go out to his family and friends at this very difficult time . "
your memories of ali .
i would like to thank all who took time to share their kind thoughts and memories of my dear uncle ali .
he will be sadly missed not only by his family , but also by the many people all over scotland , from his friends to radio listeners alike .
he was such a unique character , who always put others before himself .
my uncle ali has touched many people 's lives , and will continue to be a true inspiration to many , i am sure .
ali was a loving son , a caring brother , and a devoted uncle , and will continue to be in our hearts forever more .
love you always ...
nisha abbasi on behalf of myself , ali 's mum fatima , ali 's favourite nieces sophia and shreen , my husband erich , daughter celine and granddaughter anais , my brothers roshan , munsif , rizwan , reno , davaar and gohar ; i would like to thank everyone who sent in lovely , kind tributes to my handsome , talented , loving brother who is in our hearts and memories every single day and forever .
many thanks to stuart from cumbernauld whose suggestion of an ali abbasi 's junction sounds just right for a travel reporter .
mono -lrb- as the family called him -rrb- would have been chuffed at that !
ali would have been 43 years old on friday 6th august , and a little prayer from everyone who cared about him would be nice .
rest in peace my wee brother , love you always .
till we meet again .
your loving sister mussie abbasi harrison we will miss you very much .
there will never be another ali .
louise and geoff webster and family ali 's personal style - upbeat yet earthy - had an essential warmth , exuberance , and depth of interest that marked him out as offering so much more than the average radio presenter .
yet it was his commitment to his country 's culture , and particularly to gaelic , that made him uniquely special .
he showed a forward-looking commitment to the cause of a struggling indigenous language , and laying down an inspirational marker to other scots - all done with a bright and humorous outlook .
this country has lost a great character , and an irreplaceable asset .
dougie , dyce , aberdeen i would just like to say thank you to everyone for the lovely comments and support on behalf of the abbasi family .
ali was my uncle and was the most kind-hearted and generous person i know and was proud of him being my uncle .
his family will miss him dearly and will continue to keep his memory alive .
huma abbasi , glasgow ali , you were a ray of sunshine in our lives .
we will miss your fun and laughter .
early shift was always so much easier with you around .
sleep well mate .
penny macmillan & family ali 's easy , natural style of presentation told you all you needed to know about the man .
his loss is a tragedy .
i never liked " auchenkilns roundabout " anyway , why not rename the new intersection the " ali abbasi junction " ?
ali would chuckle i am sure .
rest in peace mate .
stuart , cumbernauld , scotland i agree with stuart from cumbernauld - an ali abbasi roundabout or bypass would be a fitting tribute .
he 'll be sadly missed for both his radio work and his contribution to the gaelic language - which so desperately needs people like ali to stay relevant in a modern scotland .
heartfelt condolences to his family and friends .
malcolm combe , kilbarchan , alba slàn leat ali .
bidh sinn uile gad ionndrainn .
iain , inverness ali was a great friend of ours .
i liked the time when he came for lunch and pretended to eat a whole box of chocolates , but they really went into the neck of his jacket .
i love his joke book .
lots of love from sophie whiteford age 9 .
sophie whiteford , bonnybridge i was so sorry to hear of ali 's passing .
i did n't ever meet him but my husband , john robertson , met him several years ago in the mishnish hotel on mull and they used to go for a " dram " when they were at the mull music festival and the tobermory games .
john aways enjoyed a blether with ali .
john died very suddenly in march - i would like to think they are having a " dram " together now !
sandra robertson , oban , scotland i had the great pleasure of working with ali while on work experience at radio scotland news .
a wonderful , funny , inspirational man , and a great loss to all who knew him .
andrew gilfillan , douglas , isle of man no life can be reduced to a single word but if we must pick one for ali it is " irrepressible " .
as the rest of us shivered in the cranreuch cauld of winter , he would march around the newsroom , eyes twinkling under the baseball cap , shouting : " it 's ice station zebra ! " .
his egalitarian friendships meant that ali - a most modern scot - reflected an older national sentiment : " that man to man , the world o 'er , shall brithers be for a ' that . "
james cook , glasgow so sorry to hear about ali .
he was a joyous presence at queen margaret drive .
irrepressible and irreplaceable .
kirsty scott , the guardian , i was saddened to hear of ali 's death .
i never met him but chatted a time or two by phone when i lived in scotland .
my thoughts and sympathy to his family .
jim akers , morges , switzerland we were deeply saddened to hear of the untimely passing of ali .
we listened to him every morning on good morning scotland and we will miss him .
he was one of us .
our deepest sympathy and love to his family at this sad time .
james and brenda murray , balintore , rossshire missed your voice recently but thought you 'd moved on .
sorry that your ' moving on ' was this way .
did n't know you but spoke to you once to report a jam .
god bless you .
must look out that joke book .
steve , bathgate it just wont seem right with the travel news without ali abbasi david birch , lockerbie scotland ali 's jokes will be missed by many !
has there ever been a travel reporter anywhere that has been held in such high esteem ?
i will miss his reports about traffic jams at the haudagain roundabout .
cllr kvin stewart , aberdeen ali was a good friend .
whenever his name appeared on my phone , i left whichever room i was in at the time and prepared to be entertained by one of the smartest , wittiest guys i have ever known .
most conversations began with an order not to tell my wife or mother what was to follow .
i will miss him .
malcolm robertson , edinburgh i knew ali when he was on glasgow city council 's equal opportunities committee .
his day job was in the art galleries but he used to get up at the crack of dawn and do a stint at the bbc before work .
i think he also helped out at a family shop - endless energy and all with great warmth and humour .
i convey my sadness at the loss of someone who contributed , in more ways than people know about , to the richness and diversity of scotland and glasgow .
jess fitzgerald , glasgow , scotland .
i was lucky enough to go to school with ali and back then he already had the ability to make you smile .
a genuine gift in this world .
i am shocked and saddened by his passing but will remember him with a smile .
my thoughts are with his family at this difficult time .
gary riddick , glasgow loved that line - a leak was found in the clyde tunnel , fell off the greengrocers lorry .
we need another comedian tom dunlop , east kilbride -lrb- near the clyde tunnel -rrb- this is a sad day .
i was shocked to read of ali 's passing .
my trips home will never be the same without listening to ali on the radio .
thank you to ali for all the pleasure he has given me , with his wit and charm .
he will be sadly missed .
stewart gray , juffair , bahrain margaret and i used to love his banter and jokes .
he will be missed by thousands of listeners .
our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this sad time .
iain and margaret ferguson , stevenston , ayrshire i was deeply shocked to hear this sad news .
hanging out with ali as teenagers and into our twenties was always a great laugh .
such a kind , warm and funny guy .
going on a weekend trip to london with ali , we laughed the entire time .
" it 's the law of the land " was a joke we shared for quite some time afterwards .
ali , you 'll remember the fun you poked at me about that on-liner , eh .
sincere sympathy to his family .
god bless audrey malloy , glasgow although i never met him , i have two striking images of ali abbasi : firstly , as an example of the kind of modern scotland we want , respectful of his own heritage , and enthusiastic for the country he has adopted ; secondly , as a thoroughly good bloke .
my sincere condolences to his family , friends and colleagues .
paddy , newtongrange , midlothian i was shocked to hear that ali had died - travel reports could be boring , but never with ali doing them .
please let his family know that many people in their adopted country are thinking of them in this awful time for them .
anne , perth what a terrible shocck to learn of ali 's untimely death .
my deepest sympathies to ai 's family and friends .
his capacity to turn a relatively mundane item into a cult classic is unrivalled .
i will miss him dearly and needless to say the travel bulletins will never be the same again .
what a tragedy for his family and for the rest of us to lose someone of such quick wit and good humour .
he was always so natural on the radio - many other broadcasters should take heed of ali 's broadcasting style .
may those who are with ali now enjoy his humour as much as have i over the years .
louise dods , alba ali was a very special human being -he had a wicked sense of humour ; a fine broadcasting style , and a rare ability to put people at their ease - be they newsroom trainee or government minister .
the world will be a poorer place without him .
carole bentley , nantwich over the years i 've called radio scotland travel to report problems on the roads in central scotland - ali was always very pleasant to speak to and i will miss him very much .
fiona , ayrshire it seems that certain folks we meet are just thoughts for a while .
and others are remembered for a special deed or smile .
but those who stay within our memories & hearts are very very few .
and that is just the kind of friendship that we had in you .
your cousin brother raju from glasgow mr & mrs usman shaikh , glasgow good guy , ali .
take it easy .
david murphy , bearsden i know the loss of ali is felt well beyond the glasgow newsroom .
for colleagues , his verbal and practical jokes often helped us through early shifts .
all of us can recall a story of some jape he got up to .. and now that sparkle is gone .
phillip cottrell , glasgow , scotland you would have thought listening to travel reports would be the highlight of your day .
i do hope bbc scotland is going to organise a tribute so we can hear some of that abbasi banter again .
scott , glasgow ali abbasi .
their will never be another like you .
you 'll be sadly missed big man .
your memories will live with us through your corny jokes and exellent curries .
rip davie mcguire , barrhead scotland i am deeply saddened at this news .
ali was a breath of fresh air ... even when you were stuck in the worst of traffic jam his cheery voice always helped you see the brighter side of things. my thoughts are with those closest to him , but i shall miss him .
graeme walker , kilwinning just read the sad news about ali and wanted to email .
he and i had huge rows at times , and called each other blind .
he was a good man , though .
i 'll miss him .
god rest helen blaby , bbc travel such a loss , i think i met ali one sunday morning on a single track road on skye .
i was in the police then and while having a run about saw him walking .
needless to say i did not know him but on stopping to speak i knew the voice , who really would not have.a ordinary down to earth man , no airs or graces , in fact he never said who he was and i never told him i knew who he was .
the staff at skye bridge thought a lot of him as he phoned them a lot regarding his traffic reports .
i would very much appreciete if you would let his family know that my thoughts are with them at this time and there will be a hole in bbc scotland morning radio without him .
dennis hyndman , kingussie he will be greatly missed - i loved his silly jokes and his way of telling them and i was greatly impressed with his command of gaelic - being a learner for many years and still barely able to say ' how are you ' .
he was like a funny big brother and i feel really sad at his passing .
morag giblin , ayr , scotland i first met ali when he made us all a christmas curry on a cathy macdonald festive special .
he then came up to stornoway where we met up regularly and he was always the same - witty , wise , willing to learn gaelic and caring .
he even contributed a small column to the hebridean which was avidly read and greatly missed .
we will all miss him in the legion .
iain maciver , stornoway your death was unexpected and your passing was truly sad .
your joke books were awful but we loved you just the same .
there 's only one super ali .
stuart and tam from off the ball -lrb- tam cowan and stuart cosgrove -rrb- glasgow you always heard ali before you saw him - usually it was his wicked cackle reverberating around the newsroom -lrb- he always laughed at his own jokes -rrb- .
but i never heard a joke made with malicious intent .
he was a great and unique broadcaster - a rare thing these days .
jane and i will miss you .
our thoughts are with your family .
david robertson , glasgow had noticed he had had disappeared from radio scotland - sorry to hear of his death .
infamous ' fog around harthill ' will never quite seem the same again !
sympathy to family and collegues .
steve webster , harthill , scotland i was shocked to read this news on the bbc scotland website this morning .
i remember ali 's distinctive voice and banter on bbc radio scotland and it brings back fond memories .
my thoughts are with his family and his colleagues at bbc radio scotland .
angus macdonald , edinburgh > midlothian > arizona so sorry to hear about this tragic loss .
my prayers to his family , friends and colleagues .
i will miss his style of broadcasting .
george jaconelli , prestwick , scotland this is tragic indeed .
as a coach driver i relied on his reporting of jams .
on the days when it was n't ali , things were n't the same .
none of the stand-ins came close .
mr abassi was a true " modern scot " , and he 'll be dearly missed .
my thoughts are with his family .
they can be very proud .
gordon , alba really sad to hear about ali - from when we started our radio scotland addiction a few years ago , he has been one of the highlights .
despite the fact that we do n't have a car so did n't actually need to listen to his reports , he was unmissable .
and his joke books were the best !
fiona & pietro , edinburgh my husband and i were saying to each other just a few days ago , " where is ali ? " .
we love to hear him so much .
especially a few years ago when he got to blether with fred or tell a joke or two .
so what was ali abbasi 's ugly woman in the supermarket gag ?
beannachd leibh .
our are thoughts are with all his family and all at bbc radio scotland .
fiona duncan , thornhill , alba working with ali on the first joke book was a dangerously funny occupation .
here 's hoping this favourite gag of his does n't come back to haunt him : why do only 30 % of women get into heaven ?
if it were more it would be hell !
cheerio mate , this time i 'm sorry you had the last laugh .
stewart prodger , scotland have missed ali over the past few months on the travel reports on gms - was beginning to think he may have realised his dream and be doing a stint in the gaelic dept of the bbc !
first met him at a burns supper in point , isle of lewis 18 months ago where he was the main guest speaker and truly hilarious .
he was in stornoway at the time learning gaelic but i reckon his gaelic was far more advanced than his tutors realised !
-lrb- according to him the main attraction of being a student was the student card which gave him half fare on public transport ! -rrb-
loved chatting with him on isles fm - what an original character , able to laugh at himself , great fun and a great ambassador for multiculturalism in scotland .
the world will be a sadder place without scotland 's glaswegian from karachi .

i have a lovely husband who helps a lot but i always keep the radio on through 5 live and when i heard ali early morning sorting out everyones ' travel problems i knew i was back in the real world again which made the rest of my day ok .
my bed , which had been the scene of horror , with ali became a place of tranquil calm in the face of all the problems people were facing on the roads -and i had to go nowhere - luxury - and all of a sudden he made me feel very lucky .
when you have a constancy like ali over so many years and he always seemed to be there , when did he take time off ? , it was the trigger that told me it was only all a dream almost every day .
i loved the links he had with the other presenters who obviously thought the world of him , his jokes and that beautiful voice .
i wish i had written to tell him what a special part he pla yed for me in my life but i suppose many people will feel the same on this sad day .

ali joined bbc scotland as a travel reporter in the 1980s and went on to publish several books and become a champion for the gaelic language .
he was well-known for his wit and warmth , and was hugely popular with staff and listeners alike .
bbc scotland controller ken macquarrie said : " ali was one of those characters who always had a word to say to everyone who came into bbc scotland and he was soon on first name terms with scores of our contributors , who subsequently turned out in force to support his charity book .
" the glasgow newsroom wo n't be the same place without him and our thoughts go out to his family and friends at this very difficult time . "
your memories of ali .
i would like to thank all who took time to share their kind thoughts and memories of my dear uncle ali .
he will be sadly missed not only by his family , but also by the many people all over scotland , from his friends to radio listeners alike .
he was such a unique character , who always put others before himself .
my uncle ali has touched many people 's lives , and will continue to be a true inspiration to many , i am sure .
ali was a loving son , a caring brother , and a devoted uncle , and will continue to be in our hearts forever more .
love you always ...
nisha abbasi on behalf of myself , ali 's mum fatima , ali 's favourite nieces sophia and shreen , my husband erich , daughter celine and granddaughter anais , my brothers roshan , munsif , rizwan , reno , davaar and gohar ; i would like to thank everyone who sent in lovely , kind tributes to my handsome , talented , loving brother who is in our hearts and memories every single day and forever .
many thanks to stuart from cumbernauld whose suggestion of an ali abbasi 's junction sounds just right for a travel reporter .
mono -lrb- as the family called him -rrb- would have been chuffed at that !
ali would have been 43 years old on friday 6th august , and a little prayer from everyone who cared about him would be nice .
rest in peace my wee brother , love you always .
till we meet again .
your loving sister mussie abbasi harrison we will miss you very much .
there will never be another ali .
louise and geoff webster and family ali 's personal style - upbeat yet earthy - had an essential warmth , exuberance , and depth of interest that marked him out as offering so much more than the average radio presenter .
yet it was his commitment to his country 's culture , and particularly to gaelic , that made him uniquely special .
he showed a forward-looking commitment to the cause of a struggling indigenous language , and laying down an inspirational marker to other scots - all done with a bright and humorous outlook .
this country has lost a great character , and an irreplaceable asset .
dougie , dyce , aberdeen i would just like to say thank you to everyone for the lovely comments and support on behalf of the abbasi family .
ali was my uncle and was the most kind-hearted and generous person i know and was proud of him being my uncle .
his family will miss him dearly and will continue to keep his memory alive .
huma abbasi , glasgow ali , you were a ray of sunshine in our lives .
we will miss your fun and laughter .
early shift was always so much easier with you around .
sleep well mate .
penny macmillan & family ali 's easy , natural style of presentation told you all you needed to know about the man .
his loss is a tragedy .
i never liked " auchenkilns roundabout " anyway , why not rename the new intersection the " ali abbasi junction " ?
ali would chuckle i am sure .
rest in peace mate .
stuart , cumbernauld , scotland i agree with stuart from cumbernauld - an ali abbasi roundabout or bypass would be a fitting tribute .
he 'll be sadly missed for both his radio work and his contribution to the gaelic language - which so desperately needs people like ali to stay relevant in a modern scotland .
heartfelt condolences to his family and friends .
malcolm combe , kilbarchan , alba slàn leat ali .
bidh sinn uile gad ionndrainn .
iain , inverness ali was a great friend of ours .
i liked the time when he came for lunch and pretended to eat a whole box of chocolates , but they really went into the neck of his jacket .
i love his joke book .
lots of love from sophie whiteford age 9 .
sophie whiteford , bonnybridge i was so sorry to hear of ali 's passing .
i did n't ever meet him but my husband , john robertson , met him several years ago in the mishnish hotel on mull and they used to go for a " dram " when they were at the mull music festival and the tobermory games .
john aways enjoyed a blether with ali .
john died very suddenly in march - i would like to think they are having a " dram " together now !
sandra robertson , oban , scotland i had the great pleasure of working with ali while on work experience at radio scotland news .
a wonderful , funny , inspirational man , and a great loss to all who knew him .
andrew gilfillan , douglas , isle of man no life can be reduced to a single word but if we must pick one for ali it is " irrepressible " .
as the rest of us shivered in the cranreuch cauld of winter , he would march around the newsroom , eyes twinkling under the baseball cap , shouting : " it 's ice station zebra ! " .
his egalitarian friendships meant that ali - a most modern scot - reflected an older national sentiment : " that man to man , the world o 'er , shall brithers be for a ' that . "
james cook , glasgow so sorry to hear about ali .
he was a joyous presence at queen margaret drive .
irrepressible and irreplaceable .
kirsty scott , the guardian , i was saddened to hear of ali 's death .
i never met him but chatted a time or two by phone when i lived in scotland .
my thoughts and sympathy to his family .
jim akers , morges , switzerland we were deeply saddened to hear of the untimely passing of ali .
we listened to him every morning on good morning scotland and we will miss him .
he was one of us .
our deepest sympathy and love to his family at this sad time .
james and brenda murray , balintore , rossshire missed your voice recently but thought you 'd moved on .
sorry that your ' moving on ' was this way .
did n't know you but spoke to you once to report a jam .
god bless you .
must look out that joke book .
steve , bathgate it just wont seem right with the travel news without ali abbasi david birch , lockerbie scotland ali 's jokes will be missed by many !
has there ever been a travel reporter anywhere that has been held in such high esteem ?
i will miss his reports about traffic jams at the haudagain roundabout .
cllr kvin stewart , aberdeen ali was a good friend .
whenever his name appeared on my phone , i left whichever room i was in at the time and prepared to be entertained by one of the smartest , wittiest guys i have ever known .
most conversations began with an order not to tell my wife or mother what was to follow .
i will miss him .
malcolm robertson , edinburgh i knew ali when he was on glasgow city council 's equal opportunities committee .
his day job was in the art galleries but he used to get up at the crack of dawn and do a stint at the bbc before work .
i think he also helped out at a family shop - endless energy and all with great warmth and humour .
i convey my sadness at the loss of someone who contributed , in more ways than people know about , to the richness and diversity of scotland and glasgow .
jess fitzgerald , glasgow , scotland .
i was lucky enough to go to school with ali and back then he already had the ability to make you smile .
a genuine gift in this world .
i am shocked and saddened by his passing but will remember him with a smile .
my thoughts are with his family at this difficult time .
gary riddick , glasgow loved that line - a leak was found in the clyde tunnel , fell off the greengrocers lorry .
we need another comedian tom dunlop , east kilbride -lrb- near the clyde tunnel -rrb- this is a sad day .
i was shocked to read of ali 's passing .
my trips home will never be the same without listening to ali on the radio .
thank you to ali for all the pleasure he has given me , with his wit and charm .
he will be sadly missed .
stewart gray , juffair , bahrain margaret and i used to love his banter and jokes .
he will be missed by thousands of listeners .
our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this sad time .
iain and margaret ferguson , stevenston , ayrshire i was deeply shocked to hear this sad news .
hanging out with ali as teenagers and into our twenties was always a great laugh .
such a kind , warm and funny guy .
going on a weekend trip to london with ali , we laughed the entire time .
" it 's the law of the land " was a joke we shared for quite some time afterwards .
ali , you 'll remember the fun you poked at me about that on-liner , eh .
sincere sympathy to his family .
god bless audrey malloy , glasgow although i never met him , i have two striking images of ali abbasi : firstly , as an example of the kind of modern scotland we want , respectful of his own heritage , and enthusiastic for the country he has adopted ; secondly , as a thoroughly good bloke .
my sincere condolences to his family , friends and colleagues .
paddy , newtongrange , midlothian i was shocked to hear that ali had died - travel reports could be boring , but never with ali doing them .
please let his family know that many people in their adopted country are thinking of them in this awful time for them .
anne , perth what a terrible shocck to learn of ali 's untimely death .
my deepest sympathies to ai 's family and friends .
his capacity to turn a relatively mundane item into a cult classic is unrivalled .
i will miss him dearly and needless to say the travel bulletins will never be the same again .
what a tragedy for his family and for the rest of us to lose someone of such quick wit and good humour .
he was always so natural on the radio - many other broadcasters should take heed of ali 's broadcasting style .
may those who are with ali now enjoy his humour as much as have i over the years .
louise dods , alba ali was a very special human being -he had a wicked sense of humour ; a fine broadcasting style , and a rare ability to put people at their ease - be they newsroom trainee or government minister .
the world will be a poorer place without him .
carole bentley , nantwich over the years i 've called radio scotland travel to report problems on the roads in central scotland - ali was always very pleasant to speak to and i will miss him very much .
fiona , ayrshire it seems that certain folks we meet are just thoughts for a while .
and others are remembered for a special deed or smile .
but those who stay within our memories & hearts are very very few .
and that is just the kind of friendship that we had in you .
your cousin brother raju from glasgow mr & mrs usman shaikh , glasgow good guy , ali .
take it easy .
david murphy , bearsden i know the loss of ali is felt well beyond the glasgow newsroom .
for colleagues , his verbal and practical jokes often helped us through early shifts .
all of us can recall a story of some jape he got up to .. and now that sparkle is gone .
phillip cottrell , glasgow , scotland you would have thought listening to travel reports would be the highlight of your day .
i do hope bbc scotland is going to organise a tribute so we can hear some of that abbasi banter again .
scott , glasgow ali abbasi .
their will never be another like you .
you 'll be sadly missed big man .
your memories will live with us through your corny jokes and exellent curries .
rip davie mcguire , barrhead scotland i am deeply saddened at this news .
ali was a breath of fresh air ... even when you were stuck in the worst of traffic jam his cheery voice always helped you see the brighter side of things. my thoughts are with those closest to him , but i shall miss him .
graeme walker , kilwinning just read the sad news about ali and wanted to email .
he and i had huge rows at times , and called each other blind .
he was a good man , though .
i 'll miss him .
god rest helen blaby , bbc travel such a loss , i think i met ali one sunday morning on a single track road on skye .
i was in the police then and while having a run about saw him walking .
needless to say i did not know him but on stopping to speak i knew the voice , who really would not have.a ordinary down to earth man , no airs or graces , in fact he never said who he was and i never told him i knew who he was .
the staff at skye bridge thought a lot of him as he phoned them a lot regarding his traffic reports .
i would very much appreciete if you would let his family know that my thoughts are with them at this time and there will be a hole in bbc scotland morning radio without him .
dennis hyndman , kingussie he will be greatly missed - i loved his silly jokes and his way of telling them and i was greatly impressed with his command of gaelic - being a learner for many years and still barely able to say ' how are you ' .
he was like a funny big brother and i feel really sad at his passing .
morag giblin , ayr , scotland i first met ali when he made us all a christmas curry on a cathy macdonald festive special .
he then came up to stornoway where we met up regularly and he was always the same - witty , wise , willing to learn gaelic and caring .
he even contributed a small column to the hebridean which was avidly read and greatly missed .
we will all miss him in the legion .
iain maciver , stornoway your death was unexpected and your passing was truly sad .
your joke books were awful but we loved you just the same .
there 's only one super ali .
stuart and tam from off the ball -lrb- tam cowan and stuart cosgrove -rrb- glasgow you always heard ali before you saw him - usually it was his wicked cackle reverberating around the newsroom -lrb- he always laughed at his own jokes -rrb- .
but i never heard a joke made with malicious intent .
he was a great and unique broadcaster - a rare thing these days .
jane and i will miss you .
our thoughts are with your family .
david robertson , glasgow had noticed he had had disappeared from radio scotland - sorry to hear of his death .
infamous ' fog around harthill ' will never quite seem the same again !
sympathy to family and collegues .
steve webster , harthill , scotland i was shocked to read this news on the bbc scotland website this morning .
i remember ali 's distinctive voice and banter on bbc radio scotland and it brings back fond memories .
my thoughts are with his family and his colleagues at bbc radio scotland .
angus macdonald , edinburgh > midlothian > arizona so sorry to hear about this tragic loss .
my prayers to his family , friends and colleagues .
i will miss his style of broadcasting .
george jaconelli , prestwick , scotland this is tragic indeed .
as a coach driver i relied on his reporting of jams .
on the days when it was n't ali , things were n't the same .
none of the stand-ins came close .
mr abassi was a true " modern scot " , and he 'll be dearly missed .
my thoughts are with his family .
they can be very proud .
gordon , alba really sad to hear about ali - from when we started our radio scotland addiction a few years ago , he has been one of the highlights .
despite the fact that we do n't have a car so did n't actually need to listen to his reports , he was unmissable .
and his joke books were the best !
fiona & pietro , edinburgh my husband and i were saying to each other just a few days ago , " where is ali ? " .
we love to hear him so much .
especially a few years ago when he got to blether with fred or tell a joke or two .
so what was ali abbasi 's ugly woman in the supermarket gag ?
beannachd leibh .
our are thoughts are with all his family and all at bbc radio scotland .
fiona duncan , thornhill , alba working with ali on the first joke book was a dangerously funny occupation .
here 's hoping this favourite gag of his does n't come back to haunt him : why do only 30 % of women get into heaven ?

" i do n't want to say anything , no way " she said , responding to each of mccall 's queries with the words : " no comment . "
michelle - who polled 67 % of the 2,370,374 votes cast - has been labelled a " bunny boiler " in then british press , a reference to glenn close 's psychotic character in the 1987 film fatal attraction .
earlier this week the 23-year-old , who has become renowned for repeatedly using the word " chicken " , threatened in jest to attack stuart 's friends if they introduced him to any women outside the big brother house .
the show has now entered its final week , with viewers voting for who of the five remaining housemates they want to win .
mccall announced on friday that the housemate with the least number of votes would be evicted on wednesday night .
