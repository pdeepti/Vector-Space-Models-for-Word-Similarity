the catholic church thinks charles was a miracle worker .
the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .
news that the deceased monarch will become blessed charles has prompted many to question the pontiff ’ s choice . controversy is brewing over reports that the pope is to beatify charles i of austria , the last habsburg emperor who came to the throne during world war i and ended his days in exile on the island of madeira in 1922 at the age of 35 . some , including cardinal christoph schönborn , the archbishop of vienna , a leading campaigner among the admirers calling for the monarch ’ s beatification , consider charles to have been " a man of peace , " a gentle person surrounded and overwhelmed by the backstabbing diplomats , ministers , and generals who conspired to bring about the end of his reign and the end of his empire . a final failure on the habsburg throne ? but others consider the kaiser to have been an incompetent leader who brought about his own demise , consigned his lineage to the annals of history and instigated the fall of the habsburg empire . these same critics believe that charles was the man responsible for ordering the use of poison gas by his troops during the war ; the man whose leadership led to hundreds of thousands of austrian soldiers being captured during the closing days of the conflict and a man with such an ability to spin great untruths that his claims to christian grace are considered a mockery . sole wartime leader in pursuit of peace ? however , in the eyes of the catholic church , charles i of austria was a devout man , a worker of miracles , a man whose actions proved that politicians could be good christians and man deemed to be worthy of being set on the road to becoming a religious icon . these conflicting views are accepted by the church which maintains that the decision to beatify is a suitable one .
" the figure of the kaiser is viewed differently , " admitted erich leitenberger , the church 's spokesman in vienna in an interview with the british daily broadsheet the guardian .
" but he led a very religious life , especially in his latter stages . " experts confirmation in december , the congregation for the causes of saints - the vatican commission responsible for examining claims to sainthood - officially declared that charles was to be credited with a miracle that occurred in 1960 , backed up with the requisite evidence of three expert medical opinions needed to pursue the case for beatification . the alleged miracle was experienced by a nun in a brazilian convent who prayed for the late emperor 's beatification and woke up the next morning able to walk for the first time in years .
since this event has been certified by the catholic church , charles is now well on his way to his imminent beatification , the intermediate stage to canonisation , which will be formally acknowledged in september . sainthood just a miracle away despite this fast track to piety , his supporters will have to wait a while if they hope to see the soon-to-be blessed charles reach sainthood .
one more miracle has to be attributed to him before that step can be taken . the ascension to beatified status is unlikely , however , to alter the views of those historians who have plotted the career of charles and have recorded less than christian behaviour in their accounts . helmut rumpler , a history professor who heads the habsburg commission of the austrian academy of sciences told the guardian , “ he was a dilettante , far too weak for the challenges facing him .
out of his depth , not really a politician .
i do n't know why he is being beatified . ” ridiculed by staff and entourage coming to the throne on the death of emperor franz josef in 1916 mid-way through “ the great war ” and with the austro-hungarian empire in tatters , many within the royal entourage viewed the new kaiser with contempt .
" he ca n't even write properly , " complained his chief of staff while one of his prime ministers quipped : " he is 30 years old , looks 20 , and thinks like a 10-year-old . " in 1917 , with the war still raging , charles made a secret plea for peace with france assisted by his french brother-in-law .
the proposed agreement would have seen the austrian emperor deserting his german ally at a critical stage of the conflict . denial leads to widespread mockery when news of the proposal leaked , charles denied having ever entertained such an idea .
the furious french then published letters signed by him , infuriating the germans and making him a comic figure on both sides . a year later when the war was over , charles fled to switzerland , leaving his empire to collapse without him , and yet he refused to abdicate the throne .
after two failed , and embarrassing , attempts at reclaiming the throne in budapest , charles was taken by the british and forced into exile on the island of madeira where he eventually died of pneumonia . if charles does eventually make it to sainthood , the austrian weekly profil already has a section of the population earmarked for his patronage .
the magazine believes that charles should be nominated as the patron saint of losers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback would the beatification of charles i devalue the catholic church 's credibilty in its choices for such awards ?

the catholic church thinks charles was a miracle worker .
the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .
news that the deceased monarch will become blessed charles has prompted many to question the pontiff ’ s choice . controversy is brewing over reports that the pope is to beatify charles i of austria , the last habsburg emperor who came to the throne during world war i and ended his days in exile on the island of madeira in 1922 at the age of 35 . some , including cardinal christoph schönborn , the archbishop of vienna , a leading campaigner among the admirers calling for the monarch ’ s beatification , consider charles to have been " a man of peace , " a gentle person surrounded and overwhelmed by the backstabbing diplomats , ministers , and generals who conspired to bring about the end of his reign and the end of his empire . a final failure on the habsburg throne ? but others consider the kaiser to have been an incompetent leader who brought about his own demise , consigned his lineage to the annals of history and instigated the fall of the habsburg empire . these same critics believe that charles was the man responsible for ordering the use of poison gas by his troops during the war ; the man whose leadership led to hundreds of thousands of austrian soldiers being captured during the closing days of the conflict and a man with such an ability to spin great untruths that his claims to christian grace are considered a mockery . sole wartime leader in pursuit of peace ? however , in the eyes of the catholic church , charles i of austria was a devout man , a worker of miracles , a man whose actions proved that politicians could be good christians and man deemed to be worthy of being set on the road to becoming a religious icon . these conflicting views are accepted by the church which maintains that the decision to beatify is a suitable one .
" the figure of the kaiser is viewed differently , " admitted erich leitenberger , the church 's spokesman in vienna in an interview with the british daily broadsheet the guardian .
" but he led a very religious life , especially in his latter stages . " experts confirmation in december , the congregation for the causes of saints - the vatican commission responsible for examining claims to sainthood - officially declared that charles was to be credited with a miracle that occurred in 1960 , backed up with the requisite evidence of three expert medical opinions needed to pursue the case for beatification . the alleged miracle was experienced by a nun in a brazilian convent who prayed for the late emperor 's beatification and woke up the next morning able to walk for the first time in years .

the proposed agreement would have seen the austrian emperor deserting his german ally at a critical stage of the conflict . denial leads to widespread mockery when news of the proposal leaked , charles denied having ever entertained such an idea .
the furious french then published letters signed by him , infuriating the germans and making him a comic figure on both sides . a year later when the war was over , charles fled to switzerland , leaving his empire to collapse without him , and yet he refused to abdicate the throne .
after two failed , and embarrassing , attempts at reclaiming the throne in budapest , charles was taken by the british and forced into exile on the island of madeira where he eventually died of pneumonia . if charles does eventually make it to sainthood , the austrian weekly profil already has a section of the population earmarked for his patronage .
the magazine believes that charles should be nominated as the patron saint of losers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback would the beatification of charles i devalue the catholic church 's credibilty in its choices for such awards ?

the latest addition : a ritz carlton luxury hotel that brings the number of five-star hotels in berlin up to 17 .
potsdamer platz was one of the most vibrant city squares in europe in the 1920s , a crossroads of trains and trolleys , cafes and clubs .
in its day , the platz was the center of nightlife in berlin – and therefore , europe .
but in world war ii the badly damaged platz became a ruined no man 's land between east and west .
after reunification , it was the biggest construction site in europe .

the hotels are part of the € 450 million beisheim center , an art deco style complex of offices , shops , restaurants and 50 luxury apartments .
two existing buildings from the time of the fall of the wall were used in building the complex .
millions were spent to move the imperial banquet hall of the previously standing hotel esplanade , where the last german kaiser wilhelm ii liked to eat , in order to integrate it into potsdamer platz 's centerpiece sony center , which was finished some five years ago .
and the historic wine bar huth , which was used as a viewing platform during the construction years , is integrated into the nearby daimler city .

the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money . after chastising germany and france for overstepping the euro zone ’ s budget guidelines and slapping finance ministers with a court case for ignoring the eu ’ s deficit rules , it would appear the european commission wants to increase its own spending over the next several years .
according to several media reports , eu commission president romano prodi will push for a one trillion euro spending program over the next seven years , the maximum level for the eu allowed under current budgetary rules .
increasing the eu budget runs counter to the aims of several member states , in particular germany , britain and france , which have all demanded the commission reign in its spending in the upcoming years .
prodi , however , has rejected an initiative from the six big net contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - to cap spending at 1 percent of total gross national income .
the eu chief executive has called such proposals " unrealistic , " and says brussels can only reach its goals and boost eu competitiveness if spending rises .
increasing competitive advantage germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday quoted sources saying that prodi and budget commissioner michaele schreyer were in favor of increasing spending to 1.24 percent of gni , as opposed to 1.15 percent proposed earlier .
in upping the expenditures , the commission has not only demonstrated its willingness to demand the maximum amount but also its readiness to risk a clash with member states .
according to a document reviewed by the financial times , the eu commission has set its sites on 2010 as the date for catching up with the united states as the world ’ s most competitive economy .
in order to achieve this " increasingly forlorn target , " brussels must increase its research spending by 300 percent and its budget for transportation and infrastructure by 400 percent .
the commission has also earmarked foreign and security policy as key areas for a budget increase as well as measures aimed at combating illegal immigration and organized crime .
a program of regional aid would also be introduced to bring poorer eu areas up to par , particularly those in the new member states from eastern europe which join the bloc in may .
this would even out the playing field in what is now being referred to as a " two-speed europe . "
details of the budget will be adopted at a feb.10 meeting of the commission , but the final say rests with the member states , who have already indicated they would put up a fight .

but it remains to be seen whether the city can use another luxury accommodation . after nine years of construction at berlin 's potsdamer platz , the building projects have come to an end – for now .
the latest addition : a ritz carlton luxury hotel that brings the number of five-star hotels in berlin up to 17 .
potsdamer platz was one of the most vibrant city squares in europe in the 1920s , a crossroads of trains and trolleys , cafes and clubs .
in its day , the platz was the center of nightlife in berlin – and therefore , europe .
but in world war ii the badly damaged platz became a ruined no man 's land between east and west .
after reunification , it was the biggest construction site in europe .
a tony new center now , two new five-star properties - next to the ritz carlton , a marriott is soon to open up - should bring yet more life to the area .
the hotels are part of the € 450 million beisheim center , an art deco style complex of offices , shops , restaurants and 50 luxury apartments .
two existing buildings from the time of the fall of the wall were used in building the complex .
millions were spent to move the imperial banquet hall of the previously standing hotel esplanade , where the last german kaiser wilhelm ii liked to eat , in order to integrate it into potsdamer platz 's centerpiece sony center , which was finished some five years ago .
and the historic wine bar huth , which was used as a viewing platform during the construction years , is integrated into the nearby daimler city .

overnight stays from domestic clients were down nearly 6 percent , too .
however , a ritz spokesman said the hotel 's clients come predominantly from great britain , america and asia , and berlin saw an increase of 3 percent in the number of foreign visitors in 2002 over 2001 .
whatever the numbers , ritz general director junger says he is n't worried about the competition .

the catholic church thinks charles was a miracle worker .
the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .
news that the deceased monarch will become blessed charles has prompted many to question the pontiff ’ s choice . controversy is brewing over reports that the pope is to beatify charles i of austria , the last habsburg emperor who came to the throne during world war i and ended his days in exile on the island of madeira in 1922 at the age of 35 . some , including cardinal christoph schönborn , the archbishop of vienna , a leading campaigner among the admirers calling for the monarch ’ s beatification , consider charles to have been " a man of peace , " a gentle person surrounded and overwhelmed by the backstabbing diplomats , ministers , and generals who conspired to bring about the end of his reign and the end of his empire . a final failure on the habsburg throne ? but others consider the kaiser to have been an incompetent leader who brought about his own demise , consigned his lineage to the annals of history and instigated the fall of the habsburg empire . these same critics believe that charles was the man responsible for ordering the use of poison gas by his troops during the war ; the man whose leadership led to hundreds of thousands of austrian soldiers being captured during the closing days of the conflict and a man with such an ability to spin great untruths that his claims to christian grace are considered a mockery . sole wartime leader in pursuit of peace ? however , in the eyes of the catholic church , charles i of austria was a devout man , a worker of miracles , a man whose actions proved that politicians could be good christians and man deemed to be worthy of being set on the road to becoming a religious icon . these conflicting views are accepted by the church which maintains that the decision to beatify is a suitable one .
" the figure of the kaiser is viewed differently , " admitted erich leitenberger , the church 's spokesman in vienna in an interview with the british daily broadsheet the guardian .
" but he led a very religious life , especially in his latter stages . " experts confirmation in december , the congregation for the causes of saints - the vatican commission responsible for examining claims to sainthood - officially declared that charles was to be credited with a miracle that occurred in 1960 , backed up with the requisite evidence of three expert medical opinions needed to pursue the case for beatification . the alleged miracle was experienced by a nun in a brazilian convent who prayed for the late emperor 's beatification and woke up the next morning able to walk for the first time in years .
since this event has been certified by the catholic church , charles is now well on his way to his imminent beatification , the intermediate stage to canonisation , which will be formally acknowledged in september . sainthood just a miracle away despite this fast track to piety , his supporters will have to wait a while if they hope to see the soon-to-be blessed charles reach sainthood .
one more miracle has to be attributed to him before that step can be taken . the ascension to beatified status is unlikely , however , to alter the views of those historians who have plotted the career of charles and have recorded less than christian behaviour in their accounts . helmut rumpler , a history professor who heads the habsburg commission of the austrian academy of sciences told the guardian , “ he was a dilettante , far too weak for the challenges facing him .
out of his depth , not really a politician .
i do n't know why he is being beatified . ” ridiculed by staff and entourage coming to the throne on the death of emperor franz josef in 1916 mid-way through “ the great war ” and with the austro-hungarian empire in tatters , many within the royal entourage viewed the new kaiser with contempt .
" he ca n't even write properly , " complained his chief of staff while one of his prime ministers quipped : " he is 30 years old , looks 20 , and thinks like a 10-year-old . " in 1917 , with the war still raging , charles made a secret plea for peace with france assisted by his french brother-in-law .
the proposed agreement would have seen the austrian emperor deserting his german ally at a critical stage of the conflict . denial leads to widespread mockery when news of the proposal leaked , charles denied having ever entertained such an idea .
the furious french then published letters signed by him , infuriating the germans and making him a comic figure on both sides . a year later when the war was over , charles fled to switzerland , leaving his empire to collapse without him , and yet he refused to abdicate the throne .
after two failed , and embarrassing , attempts at reclaiming the throne in budapest , charles was taken by the british and forced into exile on the island of madeira where he eventually died of pneumonia . if charles does eventually make it to sainthood , the austrian weekly profil already has a section of the population earmarked for his patronage .
the magazine believes that charles should be nominated as the patron saint of losers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback would the beatification of charles i devalue the catholic church 's credibilty in its choices for such awards ?

news that the deceased monarch will become blessed charles has prompted many to question the pontiff ’ s choice . controversy is brewing over reports that the pope is to beatify charles i of austria , the last habsburg emperor who came to the throne during world war i and ended his days in exile on the island of madeira in 1922 at the age of 35 . some , including cardinal christoph schönborn , the archbishop of vienna , a leading campaigner among the admirers calling for the monarch ’ s beatification , consider charles to have been " a man of peace , " a gentle person surrounded and overwhelmed by the backstabbing diplomats , ministers , and generals who conspired to bring about the end of his reign and the end of his empire . a final failure on the habsburg throne ? but others consider the kaiser to have been an incompetent leader who brought about his own demise , consigned his lineage to the annals of history and instigated the fall of the habsburg empire . these same critics believe that charles was the man responsible for ordering the use of poison gas by his troops during the war ; the man whose leadership led to hundreds of thousands of austrian soldiers being captured during the closing days of the conflict and a man with such an ability to spin great untruths that his claims to christian grace are considered a mockery . sole wartime leader in pursuit of peace ? however , in the eyes of the catholic church , charles i of austria was a devout man , a worker of miracles , a man whose actions proved that politicians could be good christians and man deemed to be worthy of being set on the road to becoming a religious icon . these conflicting views are accepted by the church which maintains that the decision to beatify is a suitable one .
" the figure of the kaiser is viewed differently , " admitted erich leitenberger , the church 's spokesman in vienna in an interview with the british daily broadsheet the guardian .
" but he led a very religious life , especially in his latter stages . " experts confirmation in december , the congregation for the causes of saints - the vatican commission responsible for examining claims to sainthood - officially declared that charles was to be credited with a miracle that occurred in 1960 , backed up with the requisite evidence of three expert medical opinions needed to pursue the case for beatification . the alleged miracle was experienced by a nun in a brazilian convent who prayed for the late emperor 's beatification and woke up the next morning able to walk for the first time in years .
since this event has been certified by the catholic church , charles is now well on his way to his imminent beatification , the intermediate stage to canonisation , which will be formally acknowledged in september . sainthood just a miracle away despite this fast track to piety , his supporters will have to wait a while if they hope to see the soon-to-be blessed charles reach sainthood .
one more miracle has to be attributed to him before that step can be taken . the ascension to beatified status is unlikely , however , to alter the views of those historians who have plotted the career of charles and have recorded less than christian behaviour in their accounts . helmut rumpler , a history professor who heads the habsburg commission of the austrian academy of sciences told the guardian , “ he was a dilettante , far too weak for the challenges facing him .
out of his depth , not really a politician .
i do n't know why he is being beatified . ” ridiculed by staff and entourage coming to the throne on the death of emperor franz josef in 1916 mid-way through “ the great war ” and with the austro-hungarian empire in tatters , many within the royal entourage viewed the new kaiser with contempt .
" he ca n't even write properly , " complained his chief of staff while one of his prime ministers quipped : " he is 30 years old , looks 20 , and thinks like a 10-year-old . " in 1917 , with the war still raging , charles made a secret plea for peace with france assisted by his french brother-in-law .
the proposed agreement would have seen the austrian emperor deserting his german ally at a critical stage of the conflict . denial leads to widespread mockery when news of the proposal leaked , charles denied having ever entertained such an idea .
the furious french then published letters signed by him , infuriating the germans and making him a comic figure on both sides . a year later when the war was over , charles fled to switzerland , leaving his empire to collapse without him , and yet he refused to abdicate the throne .
after two failed , and embarrassing , attempts at reclaiming the throne in budapest , charles was taken by the british and forced into exile on the island of madeira where he eventually died of pneumonia . if charles does eventually make it to sainthood , the austrian weekly profil already has a section of the population earmarked for his patronage .
the magazine believes that charles should be nominated as the patron saint of losers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback would the beatification of charles i devalue the catholic church 's credibilty in its choices for such awards ?

the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money . after chastising germany and france for overstepping the euro zone ’ s budget guidelines and slapping finance ministers with a court case for ignoring the eu ’ s deficit rules , it would appear the european commission wants to increase its own spending over the next several years .
according to several media reports , eu commission president romano prodi will push for a one trillion euro spending program over the next seven years , the maximum level for the eu allowed under current budgetary rules .
increasing the eu budget runs counter to the aims of several member states , in particular germany , britain and france , which have all demanded the commission reign in its spending in the upcoming years .
prodi , however , has rejected an initiative from the six big net contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - to cap spending at 1 percent of total gross national income .
the eu chief executive has called such proposals " unrealistic , " and says brussels can only reach its goals and boost eu competitiveness if spending rises .
increasing competitive advantage germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday quoted sources saying that prodi and budget commissioner michaele schreyer were in favor of increasing spending to 1.24 percent of gni , as opposed to 1.15 percent proposed earlier .
in upping the expenditures , the commission has not only demonstrated its willingness to demand the maximum amount but also its readiness to risk a clash with member states .
according to a document reviewed by the financial times , the eu commission has set its sites on 2010 as the date for catching up with the united states as the world ’ s most competitive economy .
in order to achieve this " increasingly forlorn target , " brussels must increase its research spending by 300 percent and its budget for transportation and infrastructure by 400 percent .
the commission has also earmarked foreign and security policy as key areas for a budget increase as well as measures aimed at combating illegal immigration and organized crime .
a program of regional aid would also be introduced to bring poorer eu areas up to par , particularly those in the new member states from eastern europe which join the bloc in may .
this would even out the playing field in what is now being referred to as a " two-speed europe . "
details of the budget will be adopted at a feb.10 meeting of the commission , but the final say rests with the member states , who have already indicated they would put up a fight .

the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money . after chastising germany and france for overstepping the euro zone ’ s budget guidelines and slapping finance ministers with a court case for ignoring the eu ’ s deficit rules , it would appear the european commission wants to increase its own spending over the next several years .
according to several media reports , eu commission president romano prodi will push for a one trillion euro spending program over the next seven years , the maximum level for the eu allowed under current budgetary rules .
increasing the eu budget runs counter to the aims of several member states , in particular germany , britain and france , which have all demanded the commission reign in its spending in the upcoming years .
prodi , however , has rejected an initiative from the six big net contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - to cap spending at 1 percent of total gross national income .
the eu chief executive has called such proposals " unrealistic , " and says brussels can only reach its goals and boost eu competitiveness if spending rises .
increasing competitive advantage germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday quoted sources saying that prodi and budget commissioner michaele schreyer were in favor of increasing spending to 1.24 percent of gni , as opposed to 1.15 percent proposed earlier .
in upping the expenditures , the commission has not only demonstrated its willingness to demand the maximum amount but also its readiness to risk a clash with member states .

the catholic church thinks charles was a miracle worker .
the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .
news that the deceased monarch will become blessed charles has prompted many to question the pontiff ’ s choice . controversy is brewing over reports that the pope is to beatify charles i of austria , the last habsburg emperor who came to the throne during world war i and ended his days in exile on the island of madeira in 1922 at the age of 35 . some , including cardinal christoph schönborn , the archbishop of vienna , a leading campaigner among the admirers calling for the monarch ’ s beatification , consider charles to have been " a man of peace , " a gentle person surrounded and overwhelmed by the backstabbing diplomats , ministers , and generals who conspired to bring about the end of his reign and the end of his empire . a final failure on the habsburg throne ? but others consider the kaiser to have been an incompetent leader who brought about his own demise , consigned his lineage to the annals of history and instigated the fall of the habsburg empire . these same critics believe that charles was the man responsible for ordering the use of poison gas by his troops during the war ; the man whose leadership led to hundreds of thousands of austrian soldiers being captured during the closing days of the conflict and a man with such an ability to spin great untruths that his claims to christian grace are considered a mockery . sole wartime leader in pursuit of peace ? however , in the eyes of the catholic church , charles i of austria was a devout man , a worker of miracles , a man whose actions proved that politicians could be good christians and man deemed to be worthy of being set on the road to becoming a religious icon . these conflicting views are accepted by the church which maintains that the decision to beatify is a suitable one .
" the figure of the kaiser is viewed differently , " admitted erich leitenberger , the church 's spokesman in vienna in an interview with the british daily broadsheet the guardian .
" but he led a very religious life , especially in his latter stages . " experts confirmation in december , the congregation for the causes of saints - the vatican commission responsible for examining claims to sainthood - officially declared that charles was to be credited with a miracle that occurred in 1960 , backed up with the requisite evidence of three expert medical opinions needed to pursue the case for beatification . the alleged miracle was experienced by a nun in a brazilian convent who prayed for the late emperor 's beatification and woke up the next morning able to walk for the first time in years .
since this event has been certified by the catholic church , charles is now well on his way to his imminent beatification , the intermediate stage to canonisation , which will be formally acknowledged in september . sainthood just a miracle away despite this fast track to piety , his supporters will have to wait a while if they hope to see the soon-to-be blessed charles reach sainthood .
one more miracle has to be attributed to him before that step can be taken . the ascension to beatified status is unlikely , however , to alter the views of those historians who have plotted the career of charles and have recorded less than christian behaviour in their accounts . helmut rumpler , a history professor who heads the habsburg commission of the austrian academy of sciences told the guardian , “ he was a dilettante , far too weak for the challenges facing him .
out of his depth , not really a politician .
i do n't know why he is being beatified . ” ridiculed by staff and entourage coming to the throne on the death of emperor franz josef in 1916 mid-way through “ the great war ” and with the austro-hungarian empire in tatters , many within the royal entourage viewed the new kaiser with contempt .
" he ca n't even write properly , " complained his chief of staff while one of his prime ministers quipped : " he is 30 years old , looks 20 , and thinks like a 10-year-old . " in 1917 , with the war still raging , charles made a secret plea for peace with france assisted by his french brother-in-law .
the proposed agreement would have seen the austrian emperor deserting his german ally at a critical stage of the conflict . denial leads to widespread mockery when news of the proposal leaked , charles denied having ever entertained such an idea .
the furious french then published letters signed by him , infuriating the germans and making him a comic figure on both sides . a year later when the war was over , charles fled to switzerland , leaving his empire to collapse without him , and yet he refused to abdicate the throne .
after two failed , and embarrassing , attempts at reclaiming the throne in budapest , charles was taken by the british and forced into exile on the island of madeira where he eventually died of pneumonia . if charles does eventually make it to sainthood , the austrian weekly profil already has a section of the population earmarked for his patronage .
the magazine believes that charles should be nominated as the patron saint of losers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

two existing buildings from the time of the fall of the wall were used in building the complex .

potsdamer platz was one of the most vibrant city squares in europe in the 1920s , a crossroads of trains and trolleys , cafes and clubs .
in its day , the platz was the center of nightlife in berlin – and therefore , europe .

the hotels are part of the € 450 million beisheim center , an art deco style complex of offices , shops , restaurants and 50 luxury apartments .
two existing buildings from the time of the fall of the wall were used in building the complex .
millions were spent to move the imperial banquet hall of the previously standing hotel esplanade , where the last german kaiser wilhelm ii liked to eat , in order to integrate it into potsdamer platz 's centerpiece sony center , which was finished some five years ago .
and the historic wine bar huth , which was used as a viewing platform during the construction years , is integrated into the nearby daimler city .

the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money . after chastising germany and france for overstepping the euro zone ’ s budget guidelines and slapping finance ministers with a court case for ignoring the eu ’ s deficit rules , it would appear the european commission wants to increase its own spending over the next several years .
according to several media reports , eu commission president romano prodi will push for a one trillion euro spending program over the next seven years , the maximum level for the eu allowed under current budgetary rules .
increasing the eu budget runs counter to the aims of several member states , in particular germany , britain and france , which have all demanded the commission reign in its spending in the upcoming years .
prodi , however , has rejected an initiative from the six big net contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - to cap spending at 1 percent of total gross national income .
the eu chief executive has called such proposals " unrealistic , " and says brussels can only reach its goals and boost eu competitiveness if spending rises .
increasing competitive advantage germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday quoted sources saying that prodi and budget commissioner michaele schreyer were in favor of increasing spending to 1.24 percent of gni , as opposed to 1.15 percent proposed earlier .
in upping the expenditures , the commission has not only demonstrated its willingness to demand the maximum amount but also its readiness to risk a clash with member states .
according to a document reviewed by the financial times , the eu commission has set its sites on 2010 as the date for catching up with the united states as the world ’ s most competitive economy .
in order to achieve this " increasingly forlorn target , " brussels must increase its research spending by 300 percent and its budget for transportation and infrastructure by 400 percent .
the commission has also earmarked foreign and security policy as key areas for a budget increase as well as measures aimed at combating illegal immigration and organized crime .
a program of regional aid would also be introduced to bring poorer eu areas up to par , particularly those in the new member states from eastern europe which join the bloc in may .
this would even out the playing field in what is now being referred to as a " two-speed europe . "
details of the budget will be adopted at a feb.10 meeting of the commission , but the final say rests with the member states , who have already indicated they would put up a fight .
back in december the six big net contributors warned the commission that the eu ’ s budget should be subject to the same " painful " considerations as national governments . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes eu to court the european commission decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .

hope for the future schröder met with ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi and acknowledged ethiopia ’ s role as the headquarters of the african union , a nascent body that seeks to integrate african states in ways that mirror those of the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder shares bread with the chairperson of the african union -lrb- au -rrb- alpha oumar konare .
the african union has brought with it hope for a new africa – one that isn ’ t merely identified by crises , wars , illness and catastrophe .
germany has said it would provide € 650,000 in seed funding for the development of the african union .
schröder also said germany would forgive € 60 million in ethiopian debts .
fighting terrorism and strife schröder said that security and the fight against terrorism are also important pillars in the german-african relationship .
" no one can live in security if there is insecurity and strife in the neighborhood , " he said .
" state and continental borders are incapable of holding at bay not just armed conflict , failing states , poverty and underdevelopment , but also epidemics and influxes of refugees . "
the chancellor reiterated his support for the africa action plan of the g8 , the group the world ’ s biggest industrial powers , for conflict resolution and crisis prevention in africa .
to that end , the german government is subsidizing the kofi annan international peacekeeping center in accra , ghana ; the training center of the nairobi peace initiative in kenya ; and the future european union peace facility for africa .
small businesses seek to invest in africa germany is also seeking to provide economic stimulus for african nations .
schröder hopes to fuel economies through initiatives with german businesses – not multinationals , but small and medium-sized businesses that are seeking to gain a foothold in africa .
berlin is seeking bilateral investor protection treaties that will build trust of investors interested in putting money into african countries .
on monday , ethiopia was expected signed the first deal .
schröder said germany also wanted to help increase peace and economic progress in africa by helping countries improve their professional training and to gain access to a functioning health system as well as drinking water , which is in many areas in short supply and the subject of turf wars .
" our joint efforts to achieve security and peace are doomed to failure if they do not also include the fight against hunger and poverty , the containment of aids and other diseases , as well as the preservation of our natural resources , " said schröder .
schröder also called for patience as africa journeys forth on the road ahead .
" we all know that changes require time .
this also holds true for africa , " schröder said .
" i would like to emphasize how highly particularly we germans value the readiness of africans to take on more responsibility for their own future .

but it remains to be seen whether the city can use another luxury accommodation . after nine years of construction at berlin 's potsdamer platz , the building projects have come to an end – for now .
the latest addition : a ritz carlton luxury hotel that brings the number of five-star hotels in berlin up to 17 .
potsdamer platz was one of the most vibrant city squares in europe in the 1920s , a crossroads of trains and trolleys , cafes and clubs .
in its day , the platz was the center of nightlife in berlin – and therefore , europe .
but in world war ii the badly damaged platz became a ruined no man 's land between east and west .
after reunification , it was the biggest construction site in europe .
a tony new center now , two new five-star properties - next to the ritz carlton , a marriott is soon to open up - should bring yet more life to the area .
the hotels are part of the € 450 million beisheim center , an art deco style complex of offices , shops , restaurants and 50 luxury apartments .
two existing buildings from the time of the fall of the wall were used in building the complex .
millions were spent to move the imperial banquet hall of the previously standing hotel esplanade , where the last german kaiser wilhelm ii liked to eat , in order to integrate it into potsdamer platz 's centerpiece sony center , which was finished some five years ago .
and the historic wine bar huth , which was used as a viewing platform during the construction years , is integrated into the nearby daimler city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das ritz-carlton am potzdamer platz , berlin , wenige wochen vor der für den januar 2004 geplanten eröffnung .
foto : ritz-carlton berlin at the hotel , 350 full time and 100 part time workers provide service for the well-to-do .
ritz carlton general director walter junger says he expects that the ritz-carlton will become the priciest hotel in berlin .
an overcrowded market but does berlin need another expensive hotel ?
the first test is coming in february , when international film stars will flood to the city for the berlin international film festival , berlinale . the question is whether the rich and famous will choose the new ritz carlton over established , sometimes historic , competitors like the famed hotel adlon or the four seasons , or over artier , upscale design hotels .
berlinale or no , the numbers do n't look good for more hotel properties in the city .
economically beleaguered berlin now has a total of 17 five-star hotels , and insiders are warning of a market glut .
in 2002 , the last year that numbers were published , 3.6 percent fewer tourists visited the city than in 2001 , and there were nearly 3 percent fewer hotel stays .
overnight stays from domestic clients were down nearly 6 percent , too .
however , a ritz spokesman said the hotel 's clients come predominantly from great britain , america and asia , and berlin saw an increase of 3 percent in the number of foreign visitors in 2002 over 2001 .
whatever the numbers , ritz general director junger says he is n't worried about the competition .
he 's banking on his hotel chain 's reputation for service – together with its location on potsdamer platz , one of berlin 's prime real estate locations . dw staff -lrb- jab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 07 dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit tagesthema we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.01.2004 -pipe- 19:00 utc jacques delors : eu in state of ‘ latent crisis ’ in an interview with the times of london , the former president of the european commission , jacques delors , said that the eu is now in " a state of latent crisis " due to weak leadership .
" the men who took europe forward had three qualities : vision , heart and a strategic realism .
today these are in short supply , " he said .
the 78 year-old frenchman also took swipes at fellow countryman jacques chirac , criticizing him for attacks on poland and other future eu member states .
in another bold statement , delors , who is recognized as one of the main architects of the euro , said that he could understand britain 's decision to stay out of the single currency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.01.2004 -pipe- 19:00 utc brazil set for stake in galileo brazil may be about to buy into the controversial european satellite navigation system , galileo , despite misgivings from their neighbor to the north , the united states .
the euobserver has learned that brasilia is currently weighing up its participation in the € 3.2 billion euro project which is due to be launched in 2008 .
although no formal decision has yet been made , according to brazilian diplomats the visit to brazil by european commissioner for external relations , chris patten , may result in an announcement .
patten will meet with the brazilian president , foreign minister and defense minister this week as part of a three-country tour of south america .
the satellite system has caused controversy in washington because it uses some of the same frequencies as the u.s. military system known as gps -lrb- global positioning system -rrb- .

the euobserver has learned that brasilia is currently weighing up its participation in the € 3.2 billion euro project which is due to be launched in 2008 .
although no formal decision has yet been made , according to brazilian diplomats the visit to brazil by european commissioner for external relations , chris patten , may result in an announcement .
patten will meet with the brazilian president , foreign minister and defense minister this week as part of a three-country tour of south america .
the satellite system has caused controversy in washington because it uses some of the same frequencies as the u.s. military system known as gps -lrb- global positioning system -rrb- .

the latest addition : a ritz carlton luxury hotel that brings the number of five-star hotels in berlin up to 17 .
potsdamer platz was one of the most vibrant city squares in europe in the 1920s , a crossroads of trains and trolleys , cafes and clubs .
in its day , the platz was the center of nightlife in berlin – and therefore , europe .
but in world war ii the badly damaged platz became a ruined no man 's land between east and west .
after reunification , it was the biggest construction site in europe .

the hotels are part of the € 450 million beisheim center , an art deco style complex of offices , shops , restaurants and 50 luxury apartments .
two existing buildings from the time of the fall of the wall were used in building the complex .
millions were spent to move the imperial banquet hall of the previously standing hotel esplanade , where the last german kaiser wilhelm ii liked to eat , in order to integrate it into potsdamer platz 's centerpiece sony center , which was finished some five years ago .
and the historic wine bar huth , which was used as a viewing platform during the construction years , is integrated into the nearby daimler city .

foto : ritz-carlton berlin at the hotel , 350 full time and 100 part time workers provide service for the well-to-do .
ritz carlton general director walter junger says he expects that the ritz-carlton will become the priciest hotel in berlin .
an overcrowded market but does berlin need another expensive hotel ?
the first test is coming in february , when international film stars will flood to the city for the berlin international film festival , berlinale . the question is whether the rich and famous will choose the new ritz carlton over established , sometimes historic , competitors like the famed hotel adlon or the four seasons , or over artier , upscale design hotels .
berlinale or no , the numbers do n't look good for more hotel properties in the city .
economically beleaguered berlin now has a total of 17 five-star hotels , and insiders are warning of a market glut .
in 2002 , the last year that numbers were published , 3.6 percent fewer tourists visited the city than in 2001 , and there were nearly 3 percent fewer hotel stays .
overnight stays from domestic clients were down nearly 6 percent , too .
however , a ritz spokesman said the hotel 's clients come predominantly from great britain , america and asia , and berlin saw an increase of 3 percent in the number of foreign visitors in 2002 over 2001 .
whatever the numbers , ritz general director junger says he is n't worried about the competition .
he 's banking on his hotel chain 's reputation for service – together with its location on potsdamer platz , one of berlin 's prime real estate locations . dw staff -lrb- jab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live talking germany we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

schröder is traveling to ethiopia , kenya , south africa and ghana in an effort to support african initiatives aimed at promoting peace and economic development .
in his speech in the ethiopian city addis ababa , schröder pledged an " honest partnership " between europe and africa aimed at working together " to achieve regional cooperation , peace and sustainable development . "
" we are determined to help africa tackle its serious problems , ranging from poverty and unemployment to epidemics and ethnic wars , " he said .
indeed , millions of lives have been lost in armed conflicts in africa , and the in-fighting has also served as spanner in the works for africa 's economic development .
" this is not only a moral imperative , but it also makes good political and economic sense , " the chancellor said .

schröder also said germany would forgive € 60 million in ethiopian debts .
fighting terrorism and strife schröder said that security and the fight against terrorism are also important pillars in the german-african relationship .
" no one can live in security if there is insecurity and strife in the neighborhood , " he said .
" state and continental borders are incapable of holding at bay not just armed conflict , failing states , poverty and underdevelopment , but also epidemics and influxes of refugees . "
the chancellor reiterated his support for the africa action plan of the g8 , the group the world ’ s biggest industrial powers , for conflict resolution and crisis prevention in africa .
to that end , the german government is subsidizing the kofi annan international peacekeeping center in accra , ghana ; the training center of the nairobi peace initiative in kenya ; and the future european union peace facility for africa .

schröder hopes to fuel economies through initiatives with german businesses – not multinationals , but small and medium-sized businesses that are seeking to gain a foothold in africa .
berlin is seeking bilateral investor protection treaties that will build trust of investors interested in putting money into african countries .
on monday , ethiopia was expected signed the first deal .
schröder said germany also wanted to help increase peace and economic progress in africa by helping countries improve their professional training and to gain access to a functioning health system as well as drinking water , which is in many areas in short supply and the subject of turf wars .
" our joint efforts to achieve security and peace are doomed to failure if they do not also include the fight against hunger and poverty , the containment of aids and other diseases , as well as the preservation of our natural resources , " said schröder .
schröder also called for patience as africa journeys forth on the road ahead .
" we all know that changes require time .
this also holds true for africa , " schröder said .
" i would like to emphasize how highly particularly we germans value the readiness of africans to take on more responsibility for their own future .

business leaders from both countries held a conference in paris on monday to see how they can help resolve some of those difficulties .
with over 400 business representatives attending , interest in the franco-german conference was substantial .
the business leaders all agreed that they must work more closely together in the future .
" it 's important for us not to fall asleep at the wheel , but rather make the necessary reforms , " said philippe carli of the german-french chamber of commerce .
" social reforms are especially important so that france and german remain attractive in europe . "
with its higher wages , non-wage costs and taxes , europe is having a tough time remaining attractive on the world market .
" i think the importance of europe on the world market is not as defined as the u.s. for example , " said siemens executive group manager rudi lamprecht .
" i think the german-french partnership is very important in this respect .
because both countries are important factors on the world stage and it can only help us if both come closer to each other . "
both countries hope to profit from closer cooperation . more briefs 19.01.2004 -pipe- infineon reports profits , improved conditions 19.01.2004 -pipe- volkswagen considering increased u.s. production 19.01.2004 -pipe- used cars get more expensive in germany 19.01.2004 -pipe- business groups expect better 2004 growth 19.01.2004 -pipe- countdown for postbank ipo begins 16.01.2004 -pipe- ecb 's issing " worried " over euro rise 16.01.2004 -pipe- germany becoming more popular with tourists 16.01.2004 -pipe- universal and bmg part with german label bosses radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the catholic church thinks charles was a miracle worker .
the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .
news that the deceased monarch will become blessed charles has prompted many to question the pontiff ’ s choice . controversy is brewing over reports that the pope is to beatify charles i of austria , the last habsburg emperor who came to the throne during world war i and ended his days in exile on the island of madeira in 1922 at the age of 35 . some , including cardinal christoph schönborn , the archbishop of vienna , a leading campaigner among the admirers calling for the monarch ’ s beatification , consider charles to have been " a man of peace , " a gentle person surrounded and overwhelmed by the backstabbing diplomats , ministers , and generals who conspired to bring about the end of his reign and the end of his empire . a final failure on the habsburg throne ? but others consider the kaiser to have been an incompetent leader who brought about his own demise , consigned his lineage to the annals of history and instigated the fall of the habsburg empire . these same critics believe that charles was the man responsible for ordering the use of poison gas by his troops during the war ; the man whose leadership led to hundreds of thousands of austrian soldiers being captured during the closing days of the conflict and a man with such an ability to spin great untruths that his claims to christian grace are considered a mockery . sole wartime leader in pursuit of peace ? however , in the eyes of the catholic church , charles i of austria was a devout man , a worker of miracles , a man whose actions proved that politicians could be good christians and man deemed to be worthy of being set on the road to becoming a religious icon . these conflicting views are accepted by the church which maintains that the decision to beatify is a suitable one .
" the figure of the kaiser is viewed differently , " admitted erich leitenberger , the church 's spokesman in vienna in an interview with the british daily broadsheet the guardian .
" but he led a very religious life , especially in his latter stages . " experts confirmation in december , the congregation for the causes of saints - the vatican commission responsible for examining claims to sainthood - officially declared that charles was to be credited with a miracle that occurred in 1960 , backed up with the requisite evidence of three expert medical opinions needed to pursue the case for beatification . the alleged miracle was experienced by a nun in a brazilian convent who prayed for the late emperor 's beatification and woke up the next morning able to walk for the first time in years .
since this event has been certified by the catholic church , charles is now well on his way to his imminent beatification , the intermediate stage to canonisation , which will be formally acknowledged in september . sainthood just a miracle away despite this fast track to piety , his supporters will have to wait a while if they hope to see the soon-to-be blessed charles reach sainthood .
one more miracle has to be attributed to him before that step can be taken . the ascension to beatified status is unlikely , however , to alter the views of those historians who have plotted the career of charles and have recorded less than christian behaviour in their accounts . helmut rumpler , a history professor who heads the habsburg commission of the austrian academy of sciences told the guardian , “ he was a dilettante , far too weak for the challenges facing him .
out of his depth , not really a politician .
i do n't know why he is being beatified . ” ridiculed by staff and entourage coming to the throne on the death of emperor franz josef in 1916 mid-way through “ the great war ” and with the austro-hungarian empire in tatters , many within the royal entourage viewed the new kaiser with contempt .
" he ca n't even write properly , " complained his chief of staff while one of his prime ministers quipped : " he is 30 years old , looks 20 , and thinks like a 10-year-old . " in 1917 , with the war still raging , charles made a secret plea for peace with france assisted by his french brother-in-law .
the proposed agreement would have seen the austrian emperor deserting his german ally at a critical stage of the conflict . denial leads to widespread mockery when news of the proposal leaked , charles denied having ever entertained such an idea .
the furious french then published letters signed by him , infuriating the germans and making him a comic figure on both sides . a year later when the war was over , charles fled to switzerland , leaving his empire to collapse without him , and yet he refused to abdicate the throne .
after two failed , and embarrassing , attempts at reclaiming the throne in budapest , charles was taken by the british and forced into exile on the island of madeira where he eventually died of pneumonia . if charles does eventually make it to sainthood , the austrian weekly profil already has a section of the population earmarked for his patronage .
the magazine believes that charles should be nominated as the patron saint of losers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback would the beatification of charles i devalue the catholic church 's credibilty in its choices for such awards ?

the catholic church thinks charles was a miracle worker .
the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .
news that the deceased monarch will become blessed charles has prompted many to question the pontiff ’ s choice . controversy is brewing over reports that the pope is to beatify charles i of austria , the last habsburg emperor who came to the throne during world war i and ended his days in exile on the island of madeira in 1922 at the age of 35 . some , including cardinal christoph schönborn , the archbishop of vienna , a leading campaigner among the admirers calling for the monarch ’ s beatification , consider charles to have been " a man of peace , " a gentle person surrounded and overwhelmed by the backstabbing diplomats , ministers , and generals who conspired to bring about the end of his reign and the end of his empire . a final failure on the habsburg throne ? but others consider the kaiser to have been an incompetent leader who brought about his own demise , consigned his lineage to the annals of history and instigated the fall of the habsburg empire . these same critics believe that charles was the man responsible for ordering the use of poison gas by his troops during the war ; the man whose leadership led to hundreds of thousands of austrian soldiers being captured during the closing days of the conflict and a man with such an ability to spin great untruths that his claims to christian grace are considered a mockery . sole wartime leader in pursuit of peace ? however , in the eyes of the catholic church , charles i of austria was a devout man , a worker of miracles , a man whose actions proved that politicians could be good christians and man deemed to be worthy of being set on the road to becoming a religious icon . these conflicting views are accepted by the church which maintains that the decision to beatify is a suitable one .
" the figure of the kaiser is viewed differently , " admitted erich leitenberger , the church 's spokesman in vienna in an interview with the british daily broadsheet the guardian .
" but he led a very religious life , especially in his latter stages . " experts confirmation in december , the congregation for the causes of saints - the vatican commission responsible for examining claims to sainthood - officially declared that charles was to be credited with a miracle that occurred in 1960 , backed up with the requisite evidence of three expert medical opinions needed to pursue the case for beatification . the alleged miracle was experienced by a nun in a brazilian convent who prayed for the late emperor 's beatification and woke up the next morning able to walk for the first time in years .
since this event has been certified by the catholic church , charles is now well on his way to his imminent beatification , the intermediate stage to canonisation , which will be formally acknowledged in september . sainthood just a miracle away despite this fast track to piety , his supporters will have to wait a while if they hope to see the soon-to-be blessed charles reach sainthood .
one more miracle has to be attributed to him before that step can be taken . the ascension to beatified status is unlikely , however , to alter the views of those historians who have plotted the career of charles and have recorded less than christian behaviour in their accounts . helmut rumpler , a history professor who heads the habsburg commission of the austrian academy of sciences told the guardian , “ he was a dilettante , far too weak for the challenges facing him .
out of his depth , not really a politician .
i do n't know why he is being beatified . ” ridiculed by staff and entourage coming to the throne on the death of emperor franz josef in 1916 mid-way through “ the great war ” and with the austro-hungarian empire in tatters , many within the royal entourage viewed the new kaiser with contempt .
" he ca n't even write properly , " complained his chief of staff while one of his prime ministers quipped : " he is 30 years old , looks 20 , and thinks like a 10-year-old . " in 1917 , with the war still raging , charles made a secret plea for peace with france assisted by his french brother-in-law .
the proposed agreement would have seen the austrian emperor deserting his german ally at a critical stage of the conflict . denial leads to widespread mockery when news of the proposal leaked , charles denied having ever entertained such an idea .
the furious french then published letters signed by him , infuriating the germans and making him a comic figure on both sides . a year later when the war was over , charles fled to switzerland , leaving his empire to collapse without him , and yet he refused to abdicate the throne .
after two failed , and embarrassing , attempts at reclaiming the throne in budapest , charles was taken by the british and forced into exile on the island of madeira where he eventually died of pneumonia . if charles does eventually make it to sainthood , the austrian weekly profil already has a section of the population earmarked for his patronage .

one more miracle has to be attributed to him before that step can be taken . the ascension to beatified status is unlikely , however , to alter the views of those historians who have plotted the career of charles and have recorded less than christian behaviour in their accounts . helmut rumpler , a history professor who heads the habsburg commission of the austrian academy of sciences told the guardian , “ he was a dilettante , far too weak for the challenges facing him .
out of his depth , not really a politician .
i do n't know why he is being beatified . ” ridiculed by staff and entourage coming to the throne on the death of emperor franz josef in 1916 mid-way through “ the great war ” and with the austro-hungarian empire in tatters , many within the royal entourage viewed the new kaiser with contempt .
" he ca n't even write properly , " complained his chief of staff while one of his prime ministers quipped : " he is 30 years old , looks 20 , and thinks like a 10-year-old . " in 1917 , with the war still raging , charles made a secret plea for peace with france assisted by his french brother-in-law .
the proposed agreement would have seen the austrian emperor deserting his german ally at a critical stage of the conflict . denial leads to widespread mockery when news of the proposal leaked , charles denied having ever entertained such an idea .
the furious french then published letters signed by him , infuriating the germans and making him a comic figure on both sides . a year later when the war was over , charles fled to switzerland , leaving his empire to collapse without him , and yet he refused to abdicate the throne .
after two failed , and embarrassing , attempts at reclaiming the throne in budapest , charles was taken by the british and forced into exile on the island of madeira where he eventually died of pneumonia . if charles does eventually make it to sainthood , the austrian weekly profil already has a section of the population earmarked for his patronage .

the catholic church thinks charles was a miracle worker .
the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .
news that the deceased monarch will become blessed charles has prompted many to question the pontiff ’ s choice . controversy is brewing over reports that the pope is to beatify charles i of austria , the last habsburg emperor who came to the throne during world war i and ended his days in exile on the island of madeira in 1922 at the age of 35 . some , including cardinal christoph schönborn , the archbishop of vienna , a leading campaigner among the admirers calling for the monarch ’ s beatification , consider charles to have been " a man of peace , " a gentle person surrounded and overwhelmed by the backstabbing diplomats , ministers , and generals who conspired to bring about the end of his reign and the end of his empire . a final failure on the habsburg throne ? but others consider the kaiser to have been an incompetent leader who brought about his own demise , consigned his lineage to the annals of history and instigated the fall of the habsburg empire . these same critics believe that charles was the man responsible for ordering the use of poison gas by his troops during the war ; the man whose leadership led to hundreds of thousands of austrian soldiers being captured during the closing days of the conflict and a man with such an ability to spin great untruths that his claims to christian grace are considered a mockery . sole wartime leader in pursuit of peace ? however , in the eyes of the catholic church , charles i of austria was a devout man , a worker of miracles , a man whose actions proved that politicians could be good christians and man deemed to be worthy of being set on the road to becoming a religious icon . these conflicting views are accepted by the church which maintains that the decision to beatify is a suitable one .
" the figure of the kaiser is viewed differently , " admitted erich leitenberger , the church 's spokesman in vienna in an interview with the british daily broadsheet the guardian .
" but he led a very religious life , especially in his latter stages . " experts confirmation in december , the congregation for the causes of saints - the vatican commission responsible for examining claims to sainthood - officially declared that charles was to be credited with a miracle that occurred in 1960 , backed up with the requisite evidence of three expert medical opinions needed to pursue the case for beatification . the alleged miracle was experienced by a nun in a brazilian convent who prayed for the late emperor 's beatification and woke up the next morning able to walk for the first time in years .

the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money . after chastising germany and france for overstepping the euro zone ’ s budget guidelines and slapping finance ministers with a court case for ignoring the eu ’ s deficit rules , it would appear the european commission wants to increase its own spending over the next several years .
according to several media reports , eu commission president romano prodi will push for a one trillion euro spending program over the next seven years , the maximum level for the eu allowed under current budgetary rules .
increasing the eu budget runs counter to the aims of several member states , in particular germany , britain and france , which have all demanded the commission reign in its spending in the upcoming years .
prodi , however , has rejected an initiative from the six big net contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - to cap spending at 1 percent of total gross national income .
the eu chief executive has called such proposals " unrealistic , " and says brussels can only reach its goals and boost eu competitiveness if spending rises .
increasing competitive advantage germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday quoted sources saying that prodi and budget commissioner michaele schreyer were in favor of increasing spending to 1.24 percent of gni , as opposed to 1.15 percent proposed earlier .
in upping the expenditures , the commission has not only demonstrated its willingness to demand the maximum amount but also its readiness to risk a clash with member states .
according to a document reviewed by the financial times , the eu commission has set its sites on 2010 as the date for catching up with the united states as the world ’ s most competitive economy .
in order to achieve this " increasingly forlorn target , " brussels must increase its research spending by 300 percent and its budget for transportation and infrastructure by 400 percent .
the commission has also earmarked foreign and security policy as key areas for a budget increase as well as measures aimed at combating illegal immigration and organized crime .
a program of regional aid would also be introduced to bring poorer eu areas up to par , particularly those in the new member states from eastern europe which join the bloc in may .
this would even out the playing field in what is now being referred to as a " two-speed europe . "
details of the budget will be adopted at a feb.10 meeting of the commission , but the final say rests with the member states , who have already indicated they would put up a fight .

the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money . after chastising germany and france for overstepping the euro zone ’ s budget guidelines and slapping finance ministers with a court case for ignoring the eu ’ s deficit rules , it would appear the european commission wants to increase its own spending over the next several years .
according to several media reports , eu commission president romano prodi will push for a one trillion euro spending program over the next seven years , the maximum level for the eu allowed under current budgetary rules .
increasing the eu budget runs counter to the aims of several member states , in particular germany , britain and france , which have all demanded the commission reign in its spending in the upcoming years .
prodi , however , has rejected an initiative from the six big net contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - to cap spending at 1 percent of total gross national income .
the eu chief executive has called such proposals " unrealistic , " and says brussels can only reach its goals and boost eu competitiveness if spending rises .
increasing competitive advantage germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday quoted sources saying that prodi and budget commissioner michaele schreyer were in favor of increasing spending to 1.24 percent of gni , as opposed to 1.15 percent proposed earlier .
in upping the expenditures , the commission has not only demonstrated its willingness to demand the maximum amount but also its readiness to risk a clash with member states .
according to a document reviewed by the financial times , the eu commission has set its sites on 2010 as the date for catching up with the united states as the world ’ s most competitive economy .
in order to achieve this " increasingly forlorn target , " brussels must increase its research spending by 300 percent and its budget for transportation and infrastructure by 400 percent .
the commission has also earmarked foreign and security policy as key areas for a budget increase as well as measures aimed at combating illegal immigration and organized crime .
a program of regional aid would also be introduced to bring poorer eu areas up to par , particularly those in the new member states from eastern europe which join the bloc in may .

the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money . after chastising germany and france for overstepping the euro zone ’ s budget guidelines and slapping finance ministers with a court case for ignoring the eu ’ s deficit rules , it would appear the european commission wants to increase its own spending over the next several years .
according to several media reports , eu commission president romano prodi will push for a one trillion euro spending program over the next seven years , the maximum level for the eu allowed under current budgetary rules .
increasing the eu budget runs counter to the aims of several member states , in particular germany , britain and france , which have all demanded the commission reign in its spending in the upcoming years .
prodi , however , has rejected an initiative from the six big net contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - to cap spending at 1 percent of total gross national income .
the eu chief executive has called such proposals " unrealistic , " and says brussels can only reach its goals and boost eu competitiveness if spending rises .
increasing competitive advantage germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday quoted sources saying that prodi and budget commissioner michaele schreyer were in favor of increasing spending to 1.24 percent of gni , as opposed to 1.15 percent proposed earlier .
in upping the expenditures , the commission has not only demonstrated its willingness to demand the maximum amount but also its readiness to risk a clash with member states .
according to a document reviewed by the financial times , the eu commission has set its sites on 2010 as the date for catching up with the united states as the world ’ s most competitive economy .
in order to achieve this " increasingly forlorn target , " brussels must increase its research spending by 300 percent and its budget for transportation and infrastructure by 400 percent .
the commission has also earmarked foreign and security policy as key areas for a budget increase as well as measures aimed at combating illegal immigration and organized crime .
a program of regional aid would also be introduced to bring poorer eu areas up to par , particularly those in the new member states from eastern europe which join the bloc in may .
this would even out the playing field in what is now being referred to as a " two-speed europe . "
details of the budget will be adopted at a feb.10 meeting of the commission , but the final say rests with the member states , who have already indicated they would put up a fight .

but it remains to be seen whether the city can use another luxury accommodation . after nine years of construction at berlin 's potsdamer platz , the building projects have come to an end – for now .
the latest addition : a ritz carlton luxury hotel that brings the number of five-star hotels in berlin up to 17 .
potsdamer platz was one of the most vibrant city squares in europe in the 1920s , a crossroads of trains and trolleys , cafes and clubs .
in its day , the platz was the center of nightlife in berlin – and therefore , europe .
but in world war ii the badly damaged platz became a ruined no man 's land between east and west .
after reunification , it was the biggest construction site in europe .
a tony new center now , two new five-star properties - next to the ritz carlton , a marriott is soon to open up - should bring yet more life to the area .
the hotels are part of the € 450 million beisheim center , an art deco style complex of offices , shops , restaurants and 50 luxury apartments .
two existing buildings from the time of the fall of the wall were used in building the complex .
millions were spent to move the imperial banquet hall of the previously standing hotel esplanade , where the last german kaiser wilhelm ii liked to eat , in order to integrate it into potsdamer platz 's centerpiece sony center , which was finished some five years ago .
and the historic wine bar huth , which was used as a viewing platform during the construction years , is integrated into the nearby daimler city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das ritz-carlton am potzdamer platz , berlin , wenige wochen vor der für den januar 2004 geplanten eröffnung .
foto : ritz-carlton berlin at the hotel , 350 full time and 100 part time workers provide service for the well-to-do .
ritz carlton general director walter junger says he expects that the ritz-carlton will become the priciest hotel in berlin .
an overcrowded market but does berlin need another expensive hotel ?
the first test is coming in february , when international film stars will flood to the city for the berlin international film festival , berlinale . the question is whether the rich and famous will choose the new ritz carlton over established , sometimes historic , competitors like the famed hotel adlon or the four seasons , or over artier , upscale design hotels .

but it remains to be seen whether the city can use another luxury accommodation . after nine years of construction at berlin 's potsdamer platz , the building projects have come to an end – for now .
the latest addition : a ritz carlton luxury hotel that brings the number of five-star hotels in berlin up to 17 .
potsdamer platz was one of the most vibrant city squares in europe in the 1920s , a crossroads of trains and trolleys , cafes and clubs .
in its day , the platz was the center of nightlife in berlin – and therefore , europe .
but in world war ii the badly damaged platz became a ruined no man 's land between east and west .
after reunification , it was the biggest construction site in europe .
a tony new center now , two new five-star properties - next to the ritz carlton , a marriott is soon to open up - should bring yet more life to the area .
the hotels are part of the € 450 million beisheim center , an art deco style complex of offices , shops , restaurants and 50 luxury apartments .
two existing buildings from the time of the fall of the wall were used in building the complex .
millions were spent to move the imperial banquet hall of the previously standing hotel esplanade , where the last german kaiser wilhelm ii liked to eat , in order to integrate it into potsdamer platz 's centerpiece sony center , which was finished some five years ago .
and the historic wine bar huth , which was used as a viewing platform during the construction years , is integrated into the nearby daimler city .

foto : ritz-carlton berlin at the hotel , 350 full time and 100 part time workers provide service for the well-to-do .
ritz carlton general director walter junger says he expects that the ritz-carlton will become the priciest hotel in berlin .
an overcrowded market but does berlin need another expensive hotel ?
the first test is coming in february , when international film stars will flood to the city for the berlin international film festival , berlinale . the question is whether the rich and famous will choose the new ritz carlton over established , sometimes historic , competitors like the famed hotel adlon or the four seasons , or over artier , upscale design hotels .
berlinale or no , the numbers do n't look good for more hotel properties in the city .
economically beleaguered berlin now has a total of 17 five-star hotels , and insiders are warning of a market glut .

the catholic church thinks charles was a miracle worker .
the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .
news that the deceased monarch will become blessed charles has prompted many to question the pontiff ’ s choice . controversy is brewing over reports that the pope is to beatify charles i of austria , the last habsburg emperor who came to the throne during world war i and ended his days in exile on the island of madeira in 1922 at the age of 35 . some , including cardinal christoph schönborn , the archbishop of vienna , a leading campaigner among the admirers calling for the monarch ’ s beatification , consider charles to have been " a man of peace , " a gentle person surrounded and overwhelmed by the backstabbing diplomats , ministers , and generals who conspired to bring about the end of his reign and the end of his empire . a final failure on the habsburg throne ? but others consider the kaiser to have been an incompetent leader who brought about his own demise , consigned his lineage to the annals of history and instigated the fall of the habsburg empire . these same critics believe that charles was the man responsible for ordering the use of poison gas by his troops during the war ; the man whose leadership led to hundreds of thousands of austrian soldiers being captured during the closing days of the conflict and a man with such an ability to spin great untruths that his claims to christian grace are considered a mockery . sole wartime leader in pursuit of peace ? however , in the eyes of the catholic church , charles i of austria was a devout man , a worker of miracles , a man whose actions proved that politicians could be good christians and man deemed to be worthy of being set on the road to becoming a religious icon . these conflicting views are accepted by the church which maintains that the decision to beatify is a suitable one .
" the figure of the kaiser is viewed differently , " admitted erich leitenberger , the church 's spokesman in vienna in an interview with the british daily broadsheet the guardian .
" but he led a very religious life , especially in his latter stages . " experts confirmation in december , the congregation for the causes of saints - the vatican commission responsible for examining claims to sainthood - officially declared that charles was to be credited with a miracle that occurred in 1960 , backed up with the requisite evidence of three expert medical opinions needed to pursue the case for beatification . the alleged miracle was experienced by a nun in a brazilian convent who prayed for the late emperor 's beatification and woke up the next morning able to walk for the first time in years .
since this event has been certified by the catholic church , charles is now well on his way to his imminent beatification , the intermediate stage to canonisation , which will be formally acknowledged in september . sainthood just a miracle away despite this fast track to piety , his supporters will have to wait a while if they hope to see the soon-to-be blessed charles reach sainthood .
one more miracle has to be attributed to him before that step can be taken . the ascension to beatified status is unlikely , however , to alter the views of those historians who have plotted the career of charles and have recorded less than christian behaviour in their accounts . helmut rumpler , a history professor who heads the habsburg commission of the austrian academy of sciences told the guardian , “ he was a dilettante , far too weak for the challenges facing him .
out of his depth , not really a politician .
i do n't know why he is being beatified . ” ridiculed by staff and entourage coming to the throne on the death of emperor franz josef in 1916 mid-way through “ the great war ” and with the austro-hungarian empire in tatters , many within the royal entourage viewed the new kaiser with contempt .
" he ca n't even write properly , " complained his chief of staff while one of his prime ministers quipped : " he is 30 years old , looks 20 , and thinks like a 10-year-old . " in 1917 , with the war still raging , charles made a secret plea for peace with france assisted by his french brother-in-law .
the proposed agreement would have seen the austrian emperor deserting his german ally at a critical stage of the conflict . denial leads to widespread mockery when news of the proposal leaked , charles denied having ever entertained such an idea .
the furious french then published letters signed by him , infuriating the germans and making him a comic figure on both sides . a year later when the war was over , charles fled to switzerland , leaving his empire to collapse without him , and yet he refused to abdicate the throne .
after two failed , and embarrassing , attempts at reclaiming the throne in budapest , charles was taken by the british and forced into exile on the island of madeira where he eventually died of pneumonia . if charles does eventually make it to sainthood , the austrian weekly profil already has a section of the population earmarked for his patronage .

on the first stop of his six-day trip to africa , germany 's chancellor pledged development aid , security aid and debt forgiveness to ethiopia and other sub-saharan nations . german chancellor gerhard schröder gave the first speech of his first official trip to africa on monday – highlighting political and development progress that has been made by countries on the continent .
at the same time , schröder acknowledged that it would take time before africa can " shed ist image as the continent of wars and crises , of diseases and catastrophes . "
schröder is traveling to ethiopia , kenya , south africa and ghana in an effort to support african initiatives aimed at promoting peace and economic development .
in his speech in the ethiopian city addis ababa , schröder pledged an " honest partnership " between europe and africa aimed at working together " to achieve regional cooperation , peace and sustainable development . "
" we are determined to help africa tackle its serious problems , ranging from poverty and unemployment to epidemics and ethnic wars , " he said .
indeed , millions of lives have been lost in armed conflicts in africa , and the in-fighting has also served as spanner in the works for africa 's economic development .
" this is not only a moral imperative , but it also makes good political and economic sense , " the chancellor said .
hope for the future schröder met with ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi and acknowledged ethiopia ’ s role as the headquarters of the african union , a nascent body that seeks to integrate african states in ways that mirror those of the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder shares bread with the chairperson of the african union -lrb- au -rrb- alpha oumar konare .
the african union has brought with it hope for a new africa – one that isn ’ t merely identified by crises , wars , illness and catastrophe .
germany has said it would provide € 650,000 in seed funding for the development of the african union .

the catholic church thinks charles was a miracle worker .
the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .
news that the deceased monarch will become blessed charles has prompted many to question the pontiff ’ s choice . controversy is brewing over reports that the pope is to beatify charles i of austria , the last habsburg emperor who came to the throne during world war i and ended his days in exile on the island of madeira in 1922 at the age of 35 . some , including cardinal christoph schönborn , the archbishop of vienna , a leading campaigner among the admirers calling for the monarch ’ s beatification , consider charles to have been " a man of peace , " a gentle person surrounded and overwhelmed by the backstabbing diplomats , ministers , and generals who conspired to bring about the end of his reign and the end of his empire . a final failure on the habsburg throne ? but others consider the kaiser to have been an incompetent leader who brought about his own demise , consigned his lineage to the annals of history and instigated the fall of the habsburg empire . these same critics believe that charles was the man responsible for ordering the use of poison gas by his troops during the war ; the man whose leadership led to hundreds of thousands of austrian soldiers being captured during the closing days of the conflict and a man with such an ability to spin great untruths that his claims to christian grace are considered a mockery . sole wartime leader in pursuit of peace ? however , in the eyes of the catholic church , charles i of austria was a devout man , a worker of miracles , a man whose actions proved that politicians could be good christians and man deemed to be worthy of being set on the road to becoming a religious icon . these conflicting views are accepted by the church which maintains that the decision to beatify is a suitable one .
" the figure of the kaiser is viewed differently , " admitted erich leitenberger , the church 's spokesman in vienna in an interview with the british daily broadsheet the guardian .
" but he led a very religious life , especially in his latter stages . " experts confirmation in december , the congregation for the causes of saints - the vatican commission responsible for examining claims to sainthood - officially declared that charles was to be credited with a miracle that occurred in 1960 , backed up with the requisite evidence of three expert medical opinions needed to pursue the case for beatification . the alleged miracle was experienced by a nun in a brazilian convent who prayed for the late emperor 's beatification and woke up the next morning able to walk for the first time in years .
since this event has been certified by the catholic church , charles is now well on his way to his imminent beatification , the intermediate stage to canonisation , which will be formally acknowledged in september . sainthood just a miracle away despite this fast track to piety , his supporters will have to wait a while if they hope to see the soon-to-be blessed charles reach sainthood .
one more miracle has to be attributed to him before that step can be taken . the ascension to beatified status is unlikely , however , to alter the views of those historians who have plotted the career of charles and have recorded less than christian behaviour in their accounts . helmut rumpler , a history professor who heads the habsburg commission of the austrian academy of sciences told the guardian , “ he was a dilettante , far too weak for the challenges facing him .
out of his depth , not really a politician .
i do n't know why he is being beatified . ” ridiculed by staff and entourage coming to the throne on the death of emperor franz josef in 1916 mid-way through “ the great war ” and with the austro-hungarian empire in tatters , many within the royal entourage viewed the new kaiser with contempt .
" he ca n't even write properly , " complained his chief of staff while one of his prime ministers quipped : " he is 30 years old , looks 20 , and thinks like a 10-year-old . " in 1917 , with the war still raging , charles made a secret plea for peace with france assisted by his french brother-in-law .

the catholic church thinks charles was a miracle worker .
the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .
news that the deceased monarch will become blessed charles has prompted many to question the pontiff ’ s choice . controversy is brewing over reports that the pope is to beatify charles i of austria , the last habsburg emperor who came to the throne during world war i and ended his days in exile on the island of madeira in 1922 at the age of 35 . some , including cardinal christoph schönborn , the archbishop of vienna , a leading campaigner among the admirers calling for the monarch ’ s beatification , consider charles to have been " a man of peace , " a gentle person surrounded and overwhelmed by the backstabbing diplomats , ministers , and generals who conspired to bring about the end of his reign and the end of his empire . a final failure on the habsburg throne ? but others consider the kaiser to have been an incompetent leader who brought about his own demise , consigned his lineage to the annals of history and instigated the fall of the habsburg empire . these same critics believe that charles was the man responsible for ordering the use of poison gas by his troops during the war ; the man whose leadership led to hundreds of thousands of austrian soldiers being captured during the closing days of the conflict and a man with such an ability to spin great untruths that his claims to christian grace are considered a mockery . sole wartime leader in pursuit of peace ? however , in the eyes of the catholic church , charles i of austria was a devout man , a worker of miracles , a man whose actions proved that politicians could be good christians and man deemed to be worthy of being set on the road to becoming a religious icon . these conflicting views are accepted by the church which maintains that the decision to beatify is a suitable one .
" the figure of the kaiser is viewed differently , " admitted erich leitenberger , the church 's spokesman in vienna in an interview with the british daily broadsheet the guardian .
" but he led a very religious life , especially in his latter stages . " experts confirmation in december , the congregation for the causes of saints - the vatican commission responsible for examining claims to sainthood - officially declared that charles was to be credited with a miracle that occurred in 1960 , backed up with the requisite evidence of three expert medical opinions needed to pursue the case for beatification . the alleged miracle was experienced by a nun in a brazilian convent who prayed for the late emperor 's beatification and woke up the next morning able to walk for the first time in years .
since this event has been certified by the catholic church , charles is now well on his way to his imminent beatification , the intermediate stage to canonisation , which will be formally acknowledged in september . sainthood just a miracle away despite this fast track to piety , his supporters will have to wait a while if they hope to see the soon-to-be blessed charles reach sainthood .
one more miracle has to be attributed to him before that step can be taken . the ascension to beatified status is unlikely , however , to alter the views of those historians who have plotted the career of charles and have recorded less than christian behaviour in their accounts . helmut rumpler , a history professor who heads the habsburg commission of the austrian academy of sciences told the guardian , “ he was a dilettante , far too weak for the challenges facing him .
out of his depth , not really a politician .
i do n't know why he is being beatified . ” ridiculed by staff and entourage coming to the throne on the death of emperor franz josef in 1916 mid-way through “ the great war ” and with the austro-hungarian empire in tatters , many within the royal entourage viewed the new kaiser with contempt .
" he ca n't even write properly , " complained his chief of staff while one of his prime ministers quipped : " he is 30 years old , looks 20 , and thinks like a 10-year-old .

but it remains to be seen whether the city can use another luxury accommodation . after nine years of construction at berlin 's potsdamer platz , the building projects have come to an end – for now .
the latest addition : a ritz carlton luxury hotel that brings the number of five-star hotels in berlin up to 17 .
potsdamer platz was one of the most vibrant city squares in europe in the 1920s , a crossroads of trains and trolleys , cafes and clubs .
in its day , the platz was the center of nightlife in berlin – and therefore , europe .
but in world war ii the badly damaged platz became a ruined no man 's land between east and west .
after reunification , it was the biggest construction site in europe .
a tony new center now , two new five-star properties - next to the ritz carlton , a marriott is soon to open up - should bring yet more life to the area .
the hotels are part of the € 450 million beisheim center , an art deco style complex of offices , shops , restaurants and 50 luxury apartments .
two existing buildings from the time of the fall of the wall were used in building the complex .
millions were spent to move the imperial banquet hall of the previously standing hotel esplanade , where the last german kaiser wilhelm ii liked to eat , in order to integrate it into potsdamer platz 's centerpiece sony center , which was finished some five years ago .
and the historic wine bar huth , which was used as a viewing platform during the construction years , is integrated into the nearby daimler city .

ritz carlton general director walter junger says he expects that the ritz-carlton will become the priciest hotel in berlin .
an overcrowded market but does berlin need another expensive hotel ?
the first test is coming in february , when international film stars will flood to the city for the berlin international film festival , berlinale . the question is whether the rich and famous will choose the new ritz carlton over established , sometimes historic , competitors like the famed hotel adlon or the four seasons , or over artier , upscale design hotels .
berlinale or no , the numbers do n't look good for more hotel properties in the city .
economically beleaguered berlin now has a total of 17 five-star hotels , and insiders are warning of a market glut .
in 2002 , the last year that numbers were published , 3.6 percent fewer tourists visited the city than in 2001 , and there were nearly 3 percent fewer hotel stays .
overnight stays from domestic clients were down nearly 6 percent , too .
however , a ritz spokesman said the hotel 's clients come predominantly from great britain , america and asia , and berlin saw an increase of 3 percent in the number of foreign visitors in 2002 over 2001 .
whatever the numbers , ritz general director junger says he is n't worried about the competition .
he 's banking on his hotel chain 's reputation for service – together with its location on potsdamer platz , one of berlin 's prime real estate locations . dw staff -lrb- jab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 dw-tv europe live quadriga - the international talk show we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money . after chastising germany and france for overstepping the euro zone ’ s budget guidelines and slapping finance ministers with a court case for ignoring the eu ’ s deficit rules , it would appear the european commission wants to increase its own spending over the next several years .
according to several media reports , eu commission president romano prodi will push for a one trillion euro spending program over the next seven years , the maximum level for the eu allowed under current budgetary rules .

the catholic church thinks charles was a miracle worker .
the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .
news that the deceased monarch will become blessed charles has prompted many to question the pontiff ’ s choice . controversy is brewing over reports that the pope is to beatify charles i of austria , the last habsburg emperor who came to the throne during world war i and ended his days in exile on the island of madeira in 1922 at the age of 35 . some , including cardinal christoph schönborn , the archbishop of vienna , a leading campaigner among the admirers calling for the monarch ’ s beatification , consider charles to have been " a man of peace , " a gentle person surrounded and overwhelmed by the backstabbing diplomats , ministers , and generals who conspired to bring about the end of his reign and the end of his empire . a final failure on the habsburg throne ? but others consider the kaiser to have been an incompetent leader who brought about his own demise , consigned his lineage to the annals of history and instigated the fall of the habsburg empire . these same critics believe that charles was the man responsible for ordering the use of poison gas by his troops during the war ; the man whose leadership led to hundreds of thousands of austrian soldiers being captured during the closing days of the conflict and a man with such an ability to spin great untruths that his claims to christian grace are considered a mockery . sole wartime leader in pursuit of peace ? however , in the eyes of the catholic church , charles i of austria was a devout man , a worker of miracles , a man whose actions proved that politicians could be good christians and man deemed to be worthy of being set on the road to becoming a religious icon . these conflicting views are accepted by the church which maintains that the decision to beatify is a suitable one .
" the figure of the kaiser is viewed differently , " admitted erich leitenberger , the church 's spokesman in vienna in an interview with the british daily broadsheet the guardian .
" but he led a very religious life , especially in his latter stages . " experts confirmation in december , the congregation for the causes of saints - the vatican commission responsible for examining claims to sainthood - officially declared that charles was to be credited with a miracle that occurred in 1960 , backed up with the requisite evidence of three expert medical opinions needed to pursue the case for beatification . the alleged miracle was experienced by a nun in a brazilian convent who prayed for the late emperor 's beatification and woke up the next morning able to walk for the first time in years .
since this event has been certified by the catholic church , charles is now well on his way to his imminent beatification , the intermediate stage to canonisation , which will be formally acknowledged in september . sainthood just a miracle away despite this fast track to piety , his supporters will have to wait a while if they hope to see the soon-to-be blessed charles reach sainthood .
one more miracle has to be attributed to him before that step can be taken . the ascension to beatified status is unlikely , however , to alter the views of those historians who have plotted the career of charles and have recorded less than christian behaviour in their accounts . helmut rumpler , a history professor who heads the habsburg commission of the austrian academy of sciences told the guardian , “ he was a dilettante , far too weak for the challenges facing him .
out of his depth , not really a politician .
i do n't know why he is being beatified . ” ridiculed by staff and entourage coming to the throne on the death of emperor franz josef in 1916 mid-way through “ the great war ” and with the austro-hungarian empire in tatters , many within the royal entourage viewed the new kaiser with contempt .
" he ca n't even write properly , " complained his chief of staff while one of his prime ministers quipped : " he is 30 years old , looks 20 , and thinks like a 10-year-old . " in 1917 , with the war still raging , charles made a secret plea for peace with france assisted by his french brother-in-law .
the proposed agreement would have seen the austrian emperor deserting his german ally at a critical stage of the conflict . denial leads to widespread mockery when news of the proposal leaked , charles denied having ever entertained such an idea .
the furious french then published letters signed by him , infuriating the germans and making him a comic figure on both sides . a year later when the war was over , charles fled to switzerland , leaving his empire to collapse without him , and yet he refused to abdicate the throne .
after two failed , and embarrassing , attempts at reclaiming the throne in budapest , charles was taken by the british and forced into exile on the island of madeira where he eventually died of pneumonia . if charles does eventually make it to sainthood , the austrian weekly profil already has a section of the population earmarked for his patronage .
the magazine believes that charles should be nominated as the patron saint of losers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback would the beatification of charles i devalue the catholic church 's credibilty in its choices for such awards ?

the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money . after chastising germany and france for overstepping the euro zone ’ s budget guidelines and slapping finance ministers with a court case for ignoring the eu ’ s deficit rules , it would appear the european commission wants to increase its own spending over the next several years .
according to several media reports , eu commission president romano prodi will push for a one trillion euro spending program over the next seven years , the maximum level for the eu allowed under current budgetary rules .
increasing the eu budget runs counter to the aims of several member states , in particular germany , britain and france , which have all demanded the commission reign in its spending in the upcoming years .
prodi , however , has rejected an initiative from the six big net contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - to cap spending at 1 percent of total gross national income .
the eu chief executive has called such proposals " unrealistic , " and says brussels can only reach its goals and boost eu competitiveness if spending rises .
increasing competitive advantage germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday quoted sources saying that prodi and budget commissioner michaele schreyer were in favor of increasing spending to 1.24 percent of gni , as opposed to 1.15 percent proposed earlier .
in upping the expenditures , the commission has not only demonstrated its willingness to demand the maximum amount but also its readiness to risk a clash with member states .
according to a document reviewed by the financial times , the eu commission has set its sites on 2010 as the date for catching up with the united states as the world ’ s most competitive economy .
in order to achieve this " increasingly forlorn target , " brussels must increase its research spending by 300 percent and its budget for transportation and infrastructure by 400 percent .
the commission has also earmarked foreign and security policy as key areas for a budget increase as well as measures aimed at combating illegal immigration and organized crime .
a program of regional aid would also be introduced to bring poorer eu areas up to par , particularly those in the new member states from eastern europe which join the bloc in may .
this would even out the playing field in what is now being referred to as a " two-speed europe . "
details of the budget will be adopted at a feb.10 meeting of the commission , but the final say rests with the member states , who have already indicated they would put up a fight .

at the same time , schröder acknowledged that it would take time before africa can " shed ist image as the continent of wars and crises , of diseases and catastrophes . "
schröder is traveling to ethiopia , kenya , south africa and ghana in an effort to support african initiatives aimed at promoting peace and economic development .
in his speech in the ethiopian city addis ababa , schröder pledged an " honest partnership " between europe and africa aimed at working together " to achieve regional cooperation , peace and sustainable development . "
" we are determined to help africa tackle its serious problems , ranging from poverty and unemployment to epidemics and ethnic wars , " he said .
indeed , millions of lives have been lost in armed conflicts in africa , and the in-fighting has also served as spanner in the works for africa 's economic development .
" this is not only a moral imperative , but it also makes good political and economic sense , " the chancellor said .
hope for the future schröder met with ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi and acknowledged ethiopia ’ s role as the headquarters of the african union , a nascent body that seeks to integrate african states in ways that mirror those of the european union .

germany has said it would provide € 650,000 in seed funding for the development of the african union .
schröder also said germany would forgive € 60 million in ethiopian debts .
fighting terrorism and strife schröder said that security and the fight against terrorism are also important pillars in the german-african relationship .
" no one can live in security if there is insecurity and strife in the neighborhood , " he said .
" state and continental borders are incapable of holding at bay not just armed conflict , failing states , poverty and underdevelopment , but also epidemics and influxes of refugees . "
the chancellor reiterated his support for the africa action plan of the g8 , the group the world ’ s biggest industrial powers , for conflict resolution and crisis prevention in africa .
to that end , the german government is subsidizing the kofi annan international peacekeeping center in accra , ghana ; the training center of the nairobi peace initiative in kenya ; and the future european union peace facility for africa .
small businesses seek to invest in africa germany is also seeking to provide economic stimulus for african nations .
schröder hopes to fuel economies through initiatives with german businesses – not multinationals , but small and medium-sized businesses that are seeking to gain a foothold in africa .
berlin is seeking bilateral investor protection treaties that will build trust of investors interested in putting money into african countries .
on monday , ethiopia was expected signed the first deal .
schröder said germany also wanted to help increase peace and economic progress in africa by helping countries improve their professional training and to gain access to a functioning health system as well as drinking water , which is in many areas in short supply and the subject of turf wars .
" our joint efforts to achieve security and peace are doomed to failure if they do not also include the fight against hunger and poverty , the containment of aids and other diseases , as well as the preservation of our natural resources , " said schröder .
schröder also called for patience as africa journeys forth on the road ahead .
" we all know that changes require time .
this also holds true for africa , " schröder said .
" i would like to emphasize how highly particularly we germans value the readiness of africans to take on more responsibility for their own future .

the catholic church thinks charles was a miracle worker .
the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .
news that the deceased monarch will become blessed charles has prompted many to question the pontiff ’ s choice . controversy is brewing over reports that the pope is to beatify charles i of austria , the last habsburg emperor who came to the throne during world war i and ended his days in exile on the island of madeira in 1922 at the age of 35 . some , including cardinal christoph schönborn , the archbishop of vienna , a leading campaigner among the admirers calling for the monarch ’ s beatification , consider charles to have been " a man of peace , " a gentle person surrounded and overwhelmed by the backstabbing diplomats , ministers , and generals who conspired to bring about the end of his reign and the end of his empire . a final failure on the habsburg throne ? but others consider the kaiser to have been an incompetent leader who brought about his own demise , consigned his lineage to the annals of history and instigated the fall of the habsburg empire . these same critics believe that charles was the man responsible for ordering the use of poison gas by his troops during the war ; the man whose leadership led to hundreds of thousands of austrian soldiers being captured during the closing days of the conflict and a man with such an ability to spin great untruths that his claims to christian grace are considered a mockery . sole wartime leader in pursuit of peace ? however , in the eyes of the catholic church , charles i of austria was a devout man , a worker of miracles , a man whose actions proved that politicians could be good christians and man deemed to be worthy of being set on the road to becoming a religious icon . these conflicting views are accepted by the church which maintains that the decision to beatify is a suitable one .
" the figure of the kaiser is viewed differently , " admitted erich leitenberger , the church 's spokesman in vienna in an interview with the british daily broadsheet the guardian .
" but he led a very religious life , especially in his latter stages . " experts confirmation in december , the congregation for the causes of saints - the vatican commission responsible for examining claims to sainthood - officially declared that charles was to be credited with a miracle that occurred in 1960 , backed up with the requisite evidence of three expert medical opinions needed to pursue the case for beatification . the alleged miracle was experienced by a nun in a brazilian convent who prayed for the late emperor 's beatification and woke up the next morning able to walk for the first time in years .
since this event has been certified by the catholic church , charles is now well on his way to his imminent beatification , the intermediate stage to canonisation , which will be formally acknowledged in september . sainthood just a miracle away despite this fast track to piety , his supporters will have to wait a while if they hope to see the soon-to-be blessed charles reach sainthood .
one more miracle has to be attributed to him before that step can be taken . the ascension to beatified status is unlikely , however , to alter the views of those historians who have plotted the career of charles and have recorded less than christian behaviour in their accounts . helmut rumpler , a history professor who heads the habsburg commission of the austrian academy of sciences told the guardian , “ he was a dilettante , far too weak for the challenges facing him .
out of his depth , not really a politician .
i do n't know why he is being beatified . ” ridiculed by staff and entourage coming to the throne on the death of emperor franz josef in 1916 mid-way through “ the great war ” and with the austro-hungarian empire in tatters , many within the royal entourage viewed the new kaiser with contempt .
" he ca n't even write properly , " complained his chief of staff while one of his prime ministers quipped : " he is 30 years old , looks 20 , and thinks like a 10-year-old . " in 1917 , with the war still raging , charles made a secret plea for peace with france assisted by his french brother-in-law .
the proposed agreement would have seen the austrian emperor deserting his german ally at a critical stage of the conflict . denial leads to widespread mockery when news of the proposal leaked , charles denied having ever entertained such an idea .
the furious french then published letters signed by him , infuriating the germans and making him a comic figure on both sides . a year later when the war was over , charles fled to switzerland , leaving his empire to collapse without him , and yet he refused to abdicate the throne .
after two failed , and embarrassing , attempts at reclaiming the throne in budapest , charles was taken by the british and forced into exile on the island of madeira where he eventually died of pneumonia . if charles does eventually make it to sainthood , the austrian weekly profil already has a section of the population earmarked for his patronage .
the magazine believes that charles should be nominated as the patron saint of losers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but it remains to be seen whether the city can use another luxury accommodation . after nine years of construction at berlin 's potsdamer platz , the building projects have come to an end – for now .
the latest addition : a ritz carlton luxury hotel that brings the number of five-star hotels in berlin up to 17 .
potsdamer platz was one of the most vibrant city squares in europe in the 1920s , a crossroads of trains and trolleys , cafes and clubs .
in its day , the platz was the center of nightlife in berlin – and therefore , europe .
but in world war ii the badly damaged platz became a ruined no man 's land between east and west .
after reunification , it was the biggest construction site in europe .
a tony new center now , two new five-star properties - next to the ritz carlton , a marriott is soon to open up - should bring yet more life to the area .
the hotels are part of the € 450 million beisheim center , an art deco style complex of offices , shops , restaurants and 50 luxury apartments .
two existing buildings from the time of the fall of the wall were used in building the complex .
millions were spent to move the imperial banquet hall of the previously standing hotel esplanade , where the last german kaiser wilhelm ii liked to eat , in order to integrate it into potsdamer platz 's centerpiece sony center , which was finished some five years ago .
and the historic wine bar huth , which was used as a viewing platform during the construction years , is integrated into the nearby daimler city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das ritz-carlton am potzdamer platz , berlin , wenige wochen vor der für den januar 2004 geplanten eröffnung .
foto : ritz-carlton berlin at the hotel , 350 full time and 100 part time workers provide service for the well-to-do .
ritz carlton general director walter junger says he expects that the ritz-carlton will become the priciest hotel in berlin .
an overcrowded market but does berlin need another expensive hotel ?
the first test is coming in february , when international film stars will flood to the city for the berlin international film festival , berlinale . the question is whether the rich and famous will choose the new ritz carlton over established , sometimes historic , competitors like the famed hotel adlon or the four seasons , or over artier , upscale design hotels .
berlinale or no , the numbers do n't look good for more hotel properties in the city .
economically beleaguered berlin now has a total of 17 five-star hotels , and insiders are warning of a market glut .
in 2002 , the last year that numbers were published , 3.6 percent fewer tourists visited the city than in 2001 , and there were nearly 3 percent fewer hotel stays .
overnight stays from domestic clients were down nearly 6 percent , too .
however , a ritz spokesman said the hotel 's clients come predominantly from great britain , america and asia , and berlin saw an increase of 3 percent in the number of foreign visitors in 2002 over 2001 .
whatever the numbers , ritz general director junger says he is n't worried about the competition .
he 's banking on his hotel chain 's reputation for service – together with its location on potsdamer platz , one of berlin 's prime real estate locations . dw staff -lrb- jab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

but it remains to be seen whether the city can use another luxury accommodation . after nine years of construction at berlin 's potsdamer platz , the building projects have come to an end – for now .
the latest addition : a ritz carlton luxury hotel that brings the number of five-star hotels in berlin up to 17 .
potsdamer platz was one of the most vibrant city squares in europe in the 1920s , a crossroads of trains and trolleys , cafes and clubs .
in its day , the platz was the center of nightlife in berlin – and therefore , europe .
but in world war ii the badly damaged platz became a ruined no man 's land between east and west .
after reunification , it was the biggest construction site in europe .
a tony new center now , two new five-star properties - next to the ritz carlton , a marriott is soon to open up - should bring yet more life to the area .
the hotels are part of the € 450 million beisheim center , an art deco style complex of offices , shops , restaurants and 50 luxury apartments .
two existing buildings from the time of the fall of the wall were used in building the complex .
millions were spent to move the imperial banquet hall of the previously standing hotel esplanade , where the last german kaiser wilhelm ii liked to eat , in order to integrate it into potsdamer platz 's centerpiece sony center , which was finished some five years ago .
and the historic wine bar huth , which was used as a viewing platform during the construction years , is integrated into the nearby daimler city .

ritz carlton general director walter junger says he expects that the ritz-carlton will become the priciest hotel in berlin .
an overcrowded market but does berlin need another expensive hotel ?
the first test is coming in february , when international film stars will flood to the city for the berlin international film festival , berlinale . the question is whether the rich and famous will choose the new ritz carlton over established , sometimes historic , competitors like the famed hotel adlon or the four seasons , or over artier , upscale design hotels .
berlinale or no , the numbers do n't look good for more hotel properties in the city .
economically beleaguered berlin now has a total of 17 five-star hotels , and insiders are warning of a market glut .
in 2002 , the last year that numbers were published , 3.6 percent fewer tourists visited the city than in 2001 , and there were nearly 3 percent fewer hotel stays .
overnight stays from domestic clients were down nearly 6 percent , too .
however , a ritz spokesman said the hotel 's clients come predominantly from great britain , america and asia , and berlin saw an increase of 3 percent in the number of foreign visitors in 2002 over 2001 .
whatever the numbers , ritz general director junger says he is n't worried about the competition .
he 's banking on his hotel chain 's reputation for service – together with its location on potsdamer platz , one of berlin 's prime real estate locations . dw staff -lrb- jab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 dw-tv europe live tomorrow today we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the catholic church thinks charles was a miracle worker .
the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .
news that the deceased monarch will become blessed charles has prompted many to question the pontiff ’ s choice . controversy is brewing over reports that the pope is to beatify charles i of austria , the last habsburg emperor who came to the throne during world war i and ended his days in exile on the island of madeira in 1922 at the age of 35 . some , including cardinal christoph schönborn , the archbishop of vienna , a leading campaigner among the admirers calling for the monarch ’ s beatification , consider charles to have been " a man of peace , " a gentle person surrounded and overwhelmed by the backstabbing diplomats , ministers , and generals who conspired to bring about the end of his reign and the end of his empire . a final failure on the habsburg throne ? but others consider the kaiser to have been an incompetent leader who brought about his own demise , consigned his lineage to the annals of history and instigated the fall of the habsburg empire . these same critics believe that charles was the man responsible for ordering the use of poison gas by his troops during the war ; the man whose leadership led to hundreds of thousands of austrian soldiers being captured during the closing days of the conflict and a man with such an ability to spin great untruths that his claims to christian grace are considered a mockery . sole wartime leader in pursuit of peace ? however , in the eyes of the catholic church , charles i of austria was a devout man , a worker of miracles , a man whose actions proved that politicians could be good christians and man deemed to be worthy of being set on the road to becoming a religious icon . these conflicting views are accepted by the church which maintains that the decision to beatify is a suitable one .
" the figure of the kaiser is viewed differently , " admitted erich leitenberger , the church 's spokesman in vienna in an interview with the british daily broadsheet the guardian .
" but he led a very religious life , especially in his latter stages . " experts confirmation in december , the congregation for the causes of saints - the vatican commission responsible for examining claims to sainthood - officially declared that charles was to be credited with a miracle that occurred in 1960 , backed up with the requisite evidence of three expert medical opinions needed to pursue the case for beatification . the alleged miracle was experienced by a nun in a brazilian convent who prayed for the late emperor 's beatification and woke up the next morning able to walk for the first time in years .
since this event has been certified by the catholic church , charles is now well on his way to his imminent beatification , the intermediate stage to canonisation , which will be formally acknowledged in september . sainthood just a miracle away despite this fast track to piety , his supporters will have to wait a while if they hope to see the soon-to-be blessed charles reach sainthood .
one more miracle has to be attributed to him before that step can be taken . the ascension to beatified status is unlikely , however , to alter the views of those historians who have plotted the career of charles and have recorded less than christian behaviour in their accounts . helmut rumpler , a history professor who heads the habsburg commission of the austrian academy of sciences told the guardian , “ he was a dilettante , far too weak for the challenges facing him .
out of his depth , not really a politician .
i do n't know why he is being beatified . ” ridiculed by staff and entourage coming to the throne on the death of emperor franz josef in 1916 mid-way through “ the great war ” and with the austro-hungarian empire in tatters , many within the royal entourage viewed the new kaiser with contempt .
" he ca n't even write properly , " complained his chief of staff while one of his prime ministers quipped : " he is 30 years old , looks 20 , and thinks like a 10-year-old . " in 1917 , with the war still raging , charles made a secret plea for peace with france assisted by his french brother-in-law .
the proposed agreement would have seen the austrian emperor deserting his german ally at a critical stage of the conflict . denial leads to widespread mockery when news of the proposal leaked , charles denied having ever entertained such an idea .
the furious french then published letters signed by him , infuriating the germans and making him a comic figure on both sides . a year later when the war was over , charles fled to switzerland , leaving his empire to collapse without him , and yet he refused to abdicate the throne .
after two failed , and embarrassing , attempts at reclaiming the throne in budapest , charles was taken by the british and forced into exile on the island of madeira where he eventually died of pneumonia . if charles does eventually make it to sainthood , the austrian weekly profil already has a section of the population earmarked for his patronage .

the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money . after chastising germany and france for overstepping the euro zone ’ s budget guidelines and slapping finance ministers with a court case for ignoring the eu ’ s deficit rules , it would appear the european commission wants to increase its own spending over the next several years .
according to several media reports , eu commission president romano prodi will push for a one trillion euro spending program over the next seven years , the maximum level for the eu allowed under current budgetary rules .
increasing the eu budget runs counter to the aims of several member states , in particular germany , britain and france , which have all demanded the commission reign in its spending in the upcoming years .
prodi , however , has rejected an initiative from the six big net contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - to cap spending at 1 percent of total gross national income .
the eu chief executive has called such proposals " unrealistic , " and says brussels can only reach its goals and boost eu competitiveness if spending rises .
increasing competitive advantage germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday quoted sources saying that prodi and budget commissioner michaele schreyer were in favor of increasing spending to 1.24 percent of gni , as opposed to 1.15 percent proposed earlier .
in upping the expenditures , the commission has not only demonstrated its willingness to demand the maximum amount but also its readiness to risk a clash with member states .
according to a document reviewed by the financial times , the eu commission has set its sites on 2010 as the date for catching up with the united states as the world ’ s most competitive economy .
in order to achieve this " increasingly forlorn target , " brussels must increase its research spending by 300 percent and its budget for transportation and infrastructure by 400 percent .
the commission has also earmarked foreign and security policy as key areas for a budget increase as well as measures aimed at combating illegal immigration and organized crime .
a program of regional aid would also be introduced to bring poorer eu areas up to par , particularly those in the new member states from eastern europe which join the bloc in may .
this would even out the playing field in what is now being referred to as a " two-speed europe . "
details of the budget will be adopted at a feb.10 meeting of the commission , but the final say rests with the member states , who have already indicated they would put up a fight .
back in december the six big net contributors warned the commission that the eu ’ s budget should be subject to the same " painful " considerations as national governments . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes eu to court the european commission decided to seek a court ruling to overturn finance ministers ’ suspension of eu budget rules for france and germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.01.2004 eu commission budget plan likely to irk member states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission and member states do n't always go the same way .
the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money . after chastising germany and france for overstepping the euro zone ’ s budget guidelines and slapping finance ministers with a court case for ignoring the eu ’ s deficit rules , it would appear the european commission wants to increase its own spending over the next several years .
according to several media reports , eu commission president romano prodi will push for a one trillion euro spending program over the next seven years , the maximum level for the eu allowed under current budgetary rules .
increasing the eu budget runs counter to the aims of several member states , in particular germany , britain and france , which have all demanded the commission reign in its spending in the upcoming years .
prodi , however , has rejected an initiative from the six big net contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - to cap spending at 1 percent of total gross national income .
the eu chief executive has called such proposals " unrealistic , " and says brussels can only reach its goals and boost eu competitiveness if spending rises .
increasing competitive advantage germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday quoted sources saying that prodi and budget commissioner michaele schreyer were in favor of increasing spending to 1.24 percent of gni , as opposed to 1.15 percent proposed earlier .
in upping the expenditures , the commission has not only demonstrated its willingness to demand the maximum amount but also its readiness to risk a clash with member states .
according to a document reviewed by the financial times , the eu commission has set its sites on 2010 as the date for catching up with the united states as the world ’ s most competitive economy .
in order to achieve this " increasingly forlorn target , " brussels must increase its research spending by 300 percent and its budget for transportation and infrastructure by 400 percent .
the commission has also earmarked foreign and security policy as key areas for a budget increase as well as measures aimed at combating illegal immigration and organized crime .
a program of regional aid would also be introduced to bring poorer eu areas up to par , particularly those in the new member states from eastern europe which join the bloc in may .
this would even out the playing field in what is now being referred to as a " two-speed europe . "
details of the budget will be adopted at a feb.10 meeting of the commission , but the final say rests with the member states , who have already indicated they would put up a fight .

the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money . after chastising germany and france for overstepping the euro zone ’ s budget guidelines and slapping finance ministers with a court case for ignoring the eu ’ s deficit rules , it would appear the european commission wants to increase its own spending over the next several years .
according to several media reports , eu commission president romano prodi will push for a one trillion euro spending program over the next seven years , the maximum level for the eu allowed under current budgetary rules .
increasing the eu budget runs counter to the aims of several member states , in particular germany , britain and france , which have all demanded the commission reign in its spending in the upcoming years .
prodi , however , has rejected an initiative from the six big net contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - to cap spending at 1 percent of total gross national income .
the eu chief executive has called such proposals " unrealistic , " and says brussels can only reach its goals and boost eu competitiveness if spending rises .
increasing competitive advantage germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday quoted sources saying that prodi and budget commissioner michaele schreyer were in favor of increasing spending to 1.24 percent of gni , as opposed to 1.15 percent proposed earlier .
in upping the expenditures , the commission has not only demonstrated its willingness to demand the maximum amount but also its readiness to risk a clash with member states .
according to a document reviewed by the financial times , the eu commission has set its sites on 2010 as the date for catching up with the united states as the world ’ s most competitive economy .
in order to achieve this " increasingly forlorn target , " brussels must increase its research spending by 300 percent and its budget for transportation and infrastructure by 400 percent .
the commission has also earmarked foreign and security policy as key areas for a budget increase as well as measures aimed at combating illegal immigration and organized crime .
a program of regional aid would also be introduced to bring poorer eu areas up to par , particularly those in the new member states from eastern europe which join the bloc in may .
this would even out the playing field in what is now being referred to as a " two-speed europe . "
details of the budget will be adopted at a feb.10 meeting of the commission , but the final say rests with the member states , who have already indicated they would put up a fight .

on the first stop of his six-day trip to africa , germany 's chancellor pledged development aid , security aid and debt forgiveness to ethiopia and other sub-saharan nations . german chancellor gerhard schröder gave the first speech of his first official trip to africa on monday – highlighting political and development progress that has been made by countries on the continent .
at the same time , schröder acknowledged that it would take time before africa can " shed ist image as the continent of wars and crises , of diseases and catastrophes . "
schröder is traveling to ethiopia , kenya , south africa and ghana in an effort to support african initiatives aimed at promoting peace and economic development .
in his speech in the ethiopian city addis ababa , schröder pledged an " honest partnership " between europe and africa aimed at working together " to achieve regional cooperation , peace and sustainable development . "
" we are determined to help africa tackle its serious problems , ranging from poverty and unemployment to epidemics and ethnic wars , " he said .
indeed , millions of lives have been lost in armed conflicts in africa , and the in-fighting has also served as spanner in the works for africa 's economic development .
" this is not only a moral imperative , but it also makes good political and economic sense , " the chancellor said .
hope for the future schröder met with ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi and acknowledged ethiopia ’ s role as the headquarters of the african union , a nascent body that seeks to integrate african states in ways that mirror those of the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder shares bread with the chairperson of the african union -lrb- au -rrb- alpha oumar konare .
the african union has brought with it hope for a new africa – one that isn ’ t merely identified by crises , wars , illness and catastrophe .
germany has said it would provide € 650,000 in seed funding for the development of the african union .
schröder also said germany would forgive € 60 million in ethiopian debts .
fighting terrorism and strife schröder said that security and the fight against terrorism are also important pillars in the german-african relationship .
" no one can live in security if there is insecurity and strife in the neighborhood , " he said .
" state and continental borders are incapable of holding at bay not just armed conflict , failing states , poverty and underdevelopment , but also epidemics and influxes of refugees . "
the chancellor reiterated his support for the africa action plan of the g8 , the group the world ’ s biggest industrial powers , for conflict resolution and crisis prevention in africa .
to that end , the german government is subsidizing the kofi annan international peacekeeping center in accra , ghana ; the training center of the nairobi peace initiative in kenya ; and the future european union peace facility for africa .
small businesses seek to invest in africa germany is also seeking to provide economic stimulus for african nations .
schröder hopes to fuel economies through initiatives with german businesses – not multinationals , but small and medium-sized businesses that are seeking to gain a foothold in africa .
berlin is seeking bilateral investor protection treaties that will build trust of investors interested in putting money into african countries .
on monday , ethiopia was expected signed the first deal .
schröder said germany also wanted to help increase peace and economic progress in africa by helping countries improve their professional training and to gain access to a functioning health system as well as drinking water , which is in many areas in short supply and the subject of turf wars .
" our joint efforts to achieve security and peace are doomed to failure if they do not also include the fight against hunger and poverty , the containment of aids and other diseases , as well as the preservation of our natural resources , " said schröder .
schröder also called for patience as africa journeys forth on the road ahead .
" we all know that changes require time .
this also holds true for africa , " schröder said .

the catholic church thinks charles was a miracle worker .
the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .
news that the deceased monarch will become blessed charles has prompted many to question the pontiff ’ s choice . controversy is brewing over reports that the pope is to beatify charles i of austria , the last habsburg emperor who came to the throne during world war i and ended his days in exile on the island of madeira in 1922 at the age of 35 . some , including cardinal christoph schönborn , the archbishop of vienna , a leading campaigner among the admirers calling for the monarch ’ s beatification , consider charles to have been " a man of peace , " a gentle person surrounded and overwhelmed by the backstabbing diplomats , ministers , and generals who conspired to bring about the end of his reign and the end of his empire . a final failure on the habsburg throne ? but others consider the kaiser to have been an incompetent leader who brought about his own demise , consigned his lineage to the annals of history and instigated the fall of the habsburg empire . these same critics believe that charles was the man responsible for ordering the use of poison gas by his troops during the war ; the man whose leadership led to hundreds of thousands of austrian soldiers being captured during the closing days of the conflict and a man with such an ability to spin great untruths that his claims to christian grace are considered a mockery . sole wartime leader in pursuit of peace ? however , in the eyes of the catholic church , charles i of austria was a devout man , a worker of miracles , a man whose actions proved that politicians could be good christians and man deemed to be worthy of being set on the road to becoming a religious icon . these conflicting views are accepted by the church which maintains that the decision to beatify is a suitable one .
" the figure of the kaiser is viewed differently , " admitted erich leitenberger , the church 's spokesman in vienna in an interview with the british daily broadsheet the guardian .
" but he led a very religious life , especially in his latter stages . " experts confirmation in december , the congregation for the causes of saints - the vatican commission responsible for examining claims to sainthood - officially declared that charles was to be credited with a miracle that occurred in 1960 , backed up with the requisite evidence of three expert medical opinions needed to pursue the case for beatification . the alleged miracle was experienced by a nun in a brazilian convent who prayed for the late emperor 's beatification and woke up the next morning able to walk for the first time in years .
since this event has been certified by the catholic church , charles is now well on his way to his imminent beatification , the intermediate stage to canonisation , which will be formally acknowledged in september . sainthood just a miracle away despite this fast track to piety , his supporters will have to wait a while if they hope to see the soon-to-be blessed charles reach sainthood .
one more miracle has to be attributed to him before that step can be taken . the ascension to beatified status is unlikely , however , to alter the views of those historians who have plotted the career of charles and have recorded less than christian behaviour in their accounts . helmut rumpler , a history professor who heads the habsburg commission of the austrian academy of sciences told the guardian , “ he was a dilettante , far too weak for the challenges facing him .
out of his depth , not really a politician .
i do n't know why he is being beatified . ” ridiculed by staff and entourage coming to the throne on the death of emperor franz josef in 1916 mid-way through “ the great war ” and with the austro-hungarian empire in tatters , many within the royal entourage viewed the new kaiser with contempt .
" he ca n't even write properly , " complained his chief of staff while one of his prime ministers quipped : " he is 30 years old , looks 20 , and thinks like a 10-year-old . " in 1917 , with the war still raging , charles made a secret plea for peace with france assisted by his french brother-in-law .
the proposed agreement would have seen the austrian emperor deserting his german ally at a critical stage of the conflict . denial leads to widespread mockery when news of the proposal leaked , charles denied having ever entertained such an idea .
the furious french then published letters signed by him , infuriating the germans and making him a comic figure on both sides . a year later when the war was over , charles fled to switzerland , leaving his empire to collapse without him , and yet he refused to abdicate the throne .
after two failed , and embarrassing , attempts at reclaiming the throne in budapest , charles was taken by the british and forced into exile on the island of madeira where he eventually died of pneumonia . if charles does eventually make it to sainthood , the austrian weekly profil already has a section of the population earmarked for his patronage .
the magazine believes that charles should be nominated as the patron saint of losers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback would the beatification of charles i devalue the catholic church 's credibilty in its choices for such awards ?

but it remains to be seen whether the city can use another luxury accommodation . after nine years of construction at berlin 's potsdamer platz , the building projects have come to an end – for now .
the latest addition : a ritz carlton luxury hotel that brings the number of five-star hotels in berlin up to 17 .
potsdamer platz was one of the most vibrant city squares in europe in the 1920s , a crossroads of trains and trolleys , cafes and clubs .
in its day , the platz was the center of nightlife in berlin – and therefore , europe .
but in world war ii the badly damaged platz became a ruined no man 's land between east and west .
after reunification , it was the biggest construction site in europe .
a tony new center now , two new five-star properties - next to the ritz carlton , a marriott is soon to open up - should bring yet more life to the area .
the hotels are part of the € 450 million beisheim center , an art deco style complex of offices , shops , restaurants and 50 luxury apartments .
two existing buildings from the time of the fall of the wall were used in building the complex .
millions were spent to move the imperial banquet hall of the previously standing hotel esplanade , where the last german kaiser wilhelm ii liked to eat , in order to integrate it into potsdamer platz 's centerpiece sony center , which was finished some five years ago .
and the historic wine bar huth , which was used as a viewing platform during the construction years , is integrated into the nearby daimler city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das ritz-carlton am potzdamer platz , berlin , wenige wochen vor der für den januar 2004 geplanten eröffnung .
foto : ritz-carlton berlin at the hotel , 350 full time and 100 part time workers provide service for the well-to-do .
ritz carlton general director walter junger says he expects that the ritz-carlton will become the priciest hotel in berlin .
an overcrowded market but does berlin need another expensive hotel ?
the first test is coming in february , when international film stars will flood to the city for the berlin international film festival , berlinale . the question is whether the rich and famous will choose the new ritz carlton over established , sometimes historic , competitors like the famed hotel adlon or the four seasons , or over artier , upscale design hotels .
berlinale or no , the numbers do n't look good for more hotel properties in the city .
economically beleaguered berlin now has a total of 17 five-star hotels , and insiders are warning of a market glut .
in 2002 , the last year that numbers were published , 3.6 percent fewer tourists visited the city than in 2001 , and there were nearly 3 percent fewer hotel stays .
overnight stays from domestic clients were down nearly 6 percent , too .
however , a ritz spokesman said the hotel 's clients come predominantly from great britain , america and asia , and berlin saw an increase of 3 percent in the number of foreign visitors in 2002 over 2001 .
whatever the numbers , ritz general director junger says he is n't worried about the competition .
he 's banking on his hotel chain 's reputation for service – together with its location on potsdamer platz , one of berlin 's prime real estate locations . dw staff -lrb- jab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 dw-tv europe live tomorrow today we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the catholic church thinks charles was a miracle worker .
the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .
news that the deceased monarch will become blessed charles has prompted many to question the pontiff ’ s choice . controversy is brewing over reports that the pope is to beatify charles i of austria , the last habsburg emperor who came to the throne during world war i and ended his days in exile on the island of madeira in 1922 at the age of 35 . some , including cardinal christoph schönborn , the archbishop of vienna , a leading campaigner among the admirers calling for the monarch ’ s beatification , consider charles to have been " a man of peace , " a gentle person surrounded and overwhelmed by the backstabbing diplomats , ministers , and generals who conspired to bring about the end of his reign and the end of his empire . a final failure on the habsburg throne ? but others consider the kaiser to have been an incompetent leader who brought about his own demise , consigned his lineage to the annals of history and instigated the fall of the habsburg empire . these same critics believe that charles was the man responsible for ordering the use of poison gas by his troops during the war ; the man whose leadership led to hundreds of thousands of austrian soldiers being captured during the closing days of the conflict and a man with such an ability to spin great untruths that his claims to christian grace are considered a mockery . sole wartime leader in pursuit of peace ? however , in the eyes of the catholic church , charles i of austria was a devout man , a worker of miracles , a man whose actions proved that politicians could be good christians and man deemed to be worthy of being set on the road to becoming a religious icon . these conflicting views are accepted by the church which maintains that the decision to beatify is a suitable one .
" the figure of the kaiser is viewed differently , " admitted erich leitenberger , the church 's spokesman in vienna in an interview with the british daily broadsheet the guardian .
" but he led a very religious life , especially in his latter stages . " experts confirmation in december , the congregation for the causes of saints - the vatican commission responsible for examining claims to sainthood - officially declared that charles was to be credited with a miracle that occurred in 1960 , backed up with the requisite evidence of three expert medical opinions needed to pursue the case for beatification . the alleged miracle was experienced by a nun in a brazilian convent who prayed for the late emperor 's beatification and woke up the next morning able to walk for the first time in years .
since this event has been certified by the catholic church , charles is now well on his way to his imminent beatification , the intermediate stage to canonisation , which will be formally acknowledged in september . sainthood just a miracle away despite this fast track to piety , his supporters will have to wait a while if they hope to see the soon-to-be blessed charles reach sainthood .
one more miracle has to be attributed to him before that step can be taken . the ascension to beatified status is unlikely , however , to alter the views of those historians who have plotted the career of charles and have recorded less than christian behaviour in their accounts . helmut rumpler , a history professor who heads the habsburg commission of the austrian academy of sciences told the guardian , “ he was a dilettante , far too weak for the challenges facing him .
out of his depth , not really a politician .
i do n't know why he is being beatified . ” ridiculed by staff and entourage coming to the throne on the death of emperor franz josef in 1916 mid-way through “ the great war ” and with the austro-hungarian empire in tatters , many within the royal entourage viewed the new kaiser with contempt .
" he ca n't even write properly , " complained his chief of staff while one of his prime ministers quipped : " he is 30 years old , looks 20 , and thinks like a 10-year-old . " in 1917 , with the war still raging , charles made a secret plea for peace with france assisted by his french brother-in-law .
the proposed agreement would have seen the austrian emperor deserting his german ally at a critical stage of the conflict . denial leads to widespread mockery when news of the proposal leaked , charles denied having ever entertained such an idea .

at the same time , schröder acknowledged that it would take time before africa can " shed ist image as the continent of wars and crises , of diseases and catastrophes . "
schröder is traveling to ethiopia , kenya , south africa and ghana in an effort to support african initiatives aimed at promoting peace and economic development .
in his speech in the ethiopian city addis ababa , schröder pledged an " honest partnership " between europe and africa aimed at working together " to achieve regional cooperation , peace and sustainable development . "
" we are determined to help africa tackle its serious problems , ranging from poverty and unemployment to epidemics and ethnic wars , " he said .
indeed , millions of lives have been lost in armed conflicts in africa , and the in-fighting has also served as spanner in the works for africa 's economic development .
" this is not only a moral imperative , but it also makes good political and economic sense , " the chancellor said .
hope for the future schröder met with ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi and acknowledged ethiopia ’ s role as the headquarters of the african union , a nascent body that seeks to integrate african states in ways that mirror those of the european union .

schröder also said germany would forgive € 60 million in ethiopian debts .
fighting terrorism and strife schröder said that security and the fight against terrorism are also important pillars in the german-african relationship .
" no one can live in security if there is insecurity and strife in the neighborhood , " he said .
" state and continental borders are incapable of holding at bay not just armed conflict , failing states , poverty and underdevelopment , but also epidemics and influxes of refugees . "
the chancellor reiterated his support for the africa action plan of the g8 , the group the world ’ s biggest industrial powers , for conflict resolution and crisis prevention in africa .
to that end , the german government is subsidizing the kofi annan international peacekeeping center in accra , ghana ; the training center of the nairobi peace initiative in kenya ; and the future european union peace facility for africa .
small businesses seek to invest in africa germany is also seeking to provide economic stimulus for african nations .

berlin is seeking bilateral investor protection treaties that will build trust of investors interested in putting money into african countries .
on monday , ethiopia was expected signed the first deal .
schröder said germany also wanted to help increase peace and economic progress in africa by helping countries improve their professional training and to gain access to a functioning health system as well as drinking water , which is in many areas in short supply and the subject of turf wars .
" our joint efforts to achieve security and peace are doomed to failure if they do not also include the fight against hunger and poverty , the containment of aids and other diseases , as well as the preservation of our natural resources , " said schröder .
schröder also called for patience as africa journeys forth on the road ahead .
" we all know that changes require time .
this also holds true for africa , " schröder said .
" i would like to emphasize how highly particularly we germans value the readiness of africans to take on more responsibility for their own future .

but it remains to be seen whether the city can use another luxury accommodation . after nine years of construction at berlin 's potsdamer platz , the building projects have come to an end – for now .
the latest addition : a ritz carlton luxury hotel that brings the number of five-star hotels in berlin up to 17 .
potsdamer platz was one of the most vibrant city squares in europe in the 1920s , a crossroads of trains and trolleys , cafes and clubs .
in its day , the platz was the center of nightlife in berlin – and therefore , europe .
but in world war ii the badly damaged platz became a ruined no man 's land between east and west .
after reunification , it was the biggest construction site in europe .
a tony new center now , two new five-star properties - next to the ritz carlton , a marriott is soon to open up - should bring yet more life to the area .
the hotels are part of the € 450 million beisheim center , an art deco style complex of offices , shops , restaurants and 50 luxury apartments .
two existing buildings from the time of the fall of the wall were used in building the complex .
millions were spent to move the imperial banquet hall of the previously standing hotel esplanade , where the last german kaiser wilhelm ii liked to eat , in order to integrate it into potsdamer platz 's centerpiece sony center , which was finished some five years ago .
and the historic wine bar huth , which was used as a viewing platform during the construction years , is integrated into the nearby daimler city .

ritz carlton general director walter junger says he expects that the ritz-carlton will become the priciest hotel in berlin .
an overcrowded market but does berlin need another expensive hotel ?
the first test is coming in february , when international film stars will flood to the city for the berlin international film festival , berlinale . the question is whether the rich and famous will choose the new ritz carlton over established , sometimes historic , competitors like the famed hotel adlon or the four seasons , or over artier , upscale design hotels .
berlinale or no , the numbers do n't look good for more hotel properties in the city .
economically beleaguered berlin now has a total of 17 five-star hotels , and insiders are warning of a market glut .
in 2002 , the last year that numbers were published , 3.6 percent fewer tourists visited the city than in 2001 , and there were nearly 3 percent fewer hotel stays .
overnight stays from domestic clients were down nearly 6 percent , too .
however , a ritz spokesman said the hotel 's clients come predominantly from great britain , america and asia , and berlin saw an increase of 3 percent in the number of foreign visitors in 2002 over 2001 .
whatever the numbers , ritz general director junger says he is n't worried about the competition .
he 's banking on his hotel chain 's reputation for service – together with its location on potsdamer platz , one of berlin 's prime real estate locations . dw staff -lrb- jab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 dw-tv europe live global 3000 we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the catholic church thinks charles was a miracle worker .
the last emperor of the habsburg dynasty , charles the first of austria , is to be beatified by the pope .
news that the deceased monarch will become blessed charles has prompted many to question the pontiff ’ s choice . controversy is brewing over reports that the pope is to beatify charles i of austria , the last habsburg emperor who came to the throne during world war i and ended his days in exile on the island of madeira in 1922 at the age of 35 . some , including cardinal christoph schönborn , the archbishop of vienna , a leading campaigner among the admirers calling for the monarch ’ s beatification , consider charles to have been " a man of peace , " a gentle person surrounded and overwhelmed by the backstabbing diplomats , ministers , and generals who conspired to bring about the end of his reign and the end of his empire . a final failure on the habsburg throne ? but others consider the kaiser to have been an incompetent leader who brought about his own demise , consigned his lineage to the annals of history and instigated the fall of the habsburg empire . these same critics believe that charles was the man responsible for ordering the use of poison gas by his troops during the war ; the man whose leadership led to hundreds of thousands of austrian soldiers being captured during the closing days of the conflict and a man with such an ability to spin great untruths that his claims to christian grace are considered a mockery . sole wartime leader in pursuit of peace ? however , in the eyes of the catholic church , charles i of austria was a devout man , a worker of miracles , a man whose actions proved that politicians could be good christians and man deemed to be worthy of being set on the road to becoming a religious icon . these conflicting views are accepted by the church which maintains that the decision to beatify is a suitable one .
" the figure of the kaiser is viewed differently , " admitted erich leitenberger , the church 's spokesman in vienna in an interview with the british daily broadsheet the guardian .
" but he led a very religious life , especially in his latter stages . " experts confirmation in december , the congregation for the causes of saints - the vatican commission responsible for examining claims to sainthood - officially declared that charles was to be credited with a miracle that occurred in 1960 , backed up with the requisite evidence of three expert medical opinions needed to pursue the case for beatification . the alleged miracle was experienced by a nun in a brazilian convent who prayed for the late emperor 's beatification and woke up the next morning able to walk for the first time in years .
since this event has been certified by the catholic church , charles is now well on his way to his imminent beatification , the intermediate stage to canonisation , which will be formally acknowledged in september . sainthood just a miracle away despite this fast track to piety , his supporters will have to wait a while if they hope to see the soon-to-be blessed charles reach sainthood .
one more miracle has to be attributed to him before that step can be taken . the ascension to beatified status is unlikely , however , to alter the views of those historians who have plotted the career of charles and have recorded less than christian behaviour in their accounts . helmut rumpler , a history professor who heads the habsburg commission of the austrian academy of sciences told the guardian , “ he was a dilettante , far too weak for the challenges facing him .
out of his depth , not really a politician .
i do n't know why he is being beatified . ” ridiculed by staff and entourage coming to the throne on the death of emperor franz josef in 1916 mid-way through “ the great war ” and with the austro-hungarian empire in tatters , many within the royal entourage viewed the new kaiser with contempt .
" he ca n't even write properly , " complained his chief of staff while one of his prime ministers quipped : " he is 30 years old , looks 20 , and thinks like a 10-year-old . " in 1917 , with the war still raging , charles made a secret plea for peace with france assisted by his french brother-in-law .
the proposed agreement would have seen the austrian emperor deserting his german ally at a critical stage of the conflict . denial leads to widespread mockery when news of the proposal leaked , charles denied having ever entertained such an idea .
the furious french then published letters signed by him , infuriating the germans and making him a comic figure on both sides . a year later when the war was over , charles fled to switzerland , leaving his empire to collapse without him , and yet he refused to abdicate the throne .
after two failed , and embarrassing , attempts at reclaiming the throne in budapest , charles was taken by the british and forced into exile on the island of madeira where he eventually died of pneumonia . if charles does eventually make it to sainthood , the austrian weekly profil already has a section of the population earmarked for his patronage .
the magazine believes that charles should be nominated as the patron saint of losers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback feedback : would the beatification of charles i devalue the catholic church 's credibilty in its choices for such awards ?

but it remains to be seen whether the city can use another luxury accommodation . after nine years of construction at berlin 's potsdamer platz , the building projects have come to an end – for now .
the latest addition : a ritz carlton luxury hotel that brings the number of five-star hotels in berlin up to 17 .
potsdamer platz was one of the most vibrant city squares in europe in the 1920s , a crossroads of trains and trolleys , cafes and clubs .
in its day , the platz was the center of nightlife in berlin – and therefore , europe .
but in world war ii the badly damaged platz became a ruined no man 's land between east and west .
after reunification , it was the biggest construction site in europe .
a tony new center now , two new five-star properties - next to the ritz carlton , a marriott is soon to open up - should bring yet more life to the area .
the hotels are part of the € 450 million beisheim center , an art deco style complex of offices , shops , restaurants and 50 luxury apartments .
two existing buildings from the time of the fall of the wall were used in building the complex .
millions were spent to move the imperial banquet hall of the previously standing hotel esplanade , where the last german kaiser wilhelm ii liked to eat , in order to integrate it into potsdamer platz 's centerpiece sony center , which was finished some five years ago .
and the historic wine bar huth , which was used as a viewing platform during the construction years , is integrated into the nearby daimler city .

usdaw general secretary-elect john hannett said : " we have always maintained that the key to solving this pay dispute lies in keeping dialogue open with sainsbury 's .

national australia bank -lrb- nab -rrb- said losses run up by the four staff it suspended last week for rogue trading could go as high as a $ 600m -lrb- $ 455m -rrb- .
it initially estimated the losses at a $ 180m but has now added a further a $ 5m to its known losses .
the rogue trades are being investigated by australian police and financial regulators as well as an nab inquiry .
losses set to rise nab chief executive frank cicutto said the bank was carrying out a revaluation of its foreign exchange options trading .
" our initial view indicated that this revaluation will lead to additional losses , " mr cicutto said .
" there is a low probability that the total losses will be as high as market speculation of a $ 600m , " he added .
nab has appointed auditors pricewaterhouse coopers to get to the bottom of the scandal ; that inquiry is due to report before the end of february .
nab has suspended four traders in its melbourne office and one of its london staff .
nab owns just over 5 % of troubled australian insurance business amp and has tipped in the past as a potential buyer for the rest of the business , which owns pearl , npi and london life in the uk .
if nab 's losses from the rogue trading scandal do approach a $ 600m that would represent a hefty blow to the bank , which posted 2002 net profits of a $ 3.9bn.

the rogue trades are being investigated by australian police and financial regulators as well as an nab inquiry .
losses set to rise nab chief executive frank cicutto said the bank was carrying out a revaluation of its foreign exchange options trading .
" our initial view indicated that this revaluation will lead to additional losses , " mr cicutto said .
" there is a low probability that the total losses will be as high as market speculation of a $ 600m , " he added .
nab has appointed auditors pricewaterhouse coopers to get to the bottom of the scandal ; that inquiry is due to report before the end of february .
nab has suspended four traders in its melbourne office and one of its london staff .
nab owns just over 5 % of troubled australian insurance business amp and has tipped in the past as a potential buyer for the rest of the business , which owns pearl , npi and london life in the uk .
if nab 's losses from the rogue trading scandal do approach a $ 600m that would represent a hefty blow to the bank , which posted 2002 net profits of a $ 3.9bn.

it covers the north-east coast of scotland to northumberland and also includes the wee bankie off the firth of forth .
the ban was first introduced in 2000 to safeguard populations of puffins and kittiwakes .
rspb scotland said it " applauded " efforts to protect seabirds .
puffins and kittiwakes depend on sandeels for food during the breeding season .
commercial fish species such as cod and mackerel also feed on sandeels .
the ban was secured at december 's european union fisheries council meeting in brussels , with the backing of the uk .
research last year found that sandeels stocks in the north sea were seriously depleted .
the sandeel quota for 2004 should have been slashed by brussels here euan dunn , rspb scotland the danish fleet , which dominates north sea sandeel fishing , had a catch limit of nearly one million tonnes last year but could only catch 300,000 tonnes .
rspb scotland said this statistic should have been cause for concern but eu ministers went against scientific advice and agreed a catch limit of 826,000 tonnes for 2004 .
euan dunn , senior marine policy officer for rspb scotland , said : " these are stormy and difficult times for our fishing industry and any shred of good news is to be welcomed .
" we applaud the government 's efforts in securing the ban on sandeel fishing off our coast .
" however , the total lack of precaution towards catch limits for industrial fisheries in the wider north sea is not good news for the seabirds or commercial fish , whose diet is crucially dependent on sandeels .

it covers the north-east coast of scotland to northumberland and also includes the wee bankie off the firth of forth .
the ban was first introduced in 2000 to safeguard populations of puffins and kittiwakes .
rspb scotland said it " applauded " efforts to protect seabirds .
puffins and kittiwakes depend on sandeels for food during the breeding season .
commercial fish species such as cod and mackerel also feed on sandeels .

euan dunn , senior marine policy officer for rspb scotland , said : " these are stormy and difficult times for our fishing industry and any shred of good news is to be welcomed .
" we applaud the government 's efforts in securing the ban on sandeel fishing off our coast .
" however , the total lack of precaution towards catch limits for industrial fisheries in the wider north sea is not good news for the seabirds or commercial fish , whose diet is crucially dependent on sandeels .

tintagel castle , in north cornwall , will be given better roads and pavements in an effort to attract more visitors to the site .
work starts on monday on the £ 2.5m scheme which will also bring improvements to the nearby town .
other work includes new street lights and placing overhead power and telephone cables underground .
tintagel occupation of the site at tintagel castle dates back to roman times historians believe the castle was built in the early 13th century by earl richard of cornwall by the late 15th century the castle was ruined and deserted street parking will be banned in the summer and a shoppers ' car park will be provided .
the overall aim is to revive the local economy by increasing the appeal and extending the season of this key tourism area .
the town already attracts an estimated 27,000 visitors a year who spend about £ 5.5m on local products and services .
tintagel 's claim to being linked to king arthur became more solid after an ancient stone bearing a 6th century inscription similar to the name arthur was unearthed at tintagel castle in 1998 .
the castle was already the mythical birthplace of the legendary king , and for some , the discovery proved king arthur had his headquarters , the court of camelot , at the site .
