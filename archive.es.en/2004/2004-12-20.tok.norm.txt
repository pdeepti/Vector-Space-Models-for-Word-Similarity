the target of their ire is santa , an american import who they say does n't represent what the holiday is all about . bettina schade says she does n't have anything personal against santa claus .
in fact , she likes a lot of things about today 's celebrations of christmas - the lighted trees , the gold ornaments , the silver stars .
but all the material things , the hectic rush to buy gifts , and the ubiquity of the bearded man in the red suit are taking away from the core meaning of christmas .
she 'd like to see things changed , or at least toned down a little .
" the christian origins of christmas , like the birth of jesus , have receded into the background , " she said .
" it 's becoming more and more a festival that is reduced to simply worldly gifts and to commerce . " she is part of a campaign called the frankfurter nicholas initiative , founded by a roman catholic priest in frankfurt , eckhard bieger .
alarmed by the growing commercialization of christmas in germany , he launched the initiative that 's aimed at putting st. nicholas , a fourth-century monk , back in the christmas spotlight where he used to be . it 's an uphill battle , however , since st. nicholas ' successor , the american-inspired jolly old st. nick , or santa claus , has been edging the miter-wearing historical figure out of the german christmas landscape of late .
german kids do set out their shoes on dec .
6 for st. nicholas to fill them with sweets , but that holiday now pales in comparison with santa 's sleigh-ride night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate santa dressed up at st. nicholas to counter this trend , the frankfurt initiative along with another catholic organization , the bonifatiuswerk , has launched pro-nicholas campaign .
they show kids how to turn chocolate santas into chocolate nicholas figures and have been handing out stickers in stores and at christmas markets featuring a bar cutting across an image of kriss kringle .
it proclaims the area a " santa-free zone . " " santa claus is a creation of the advertising industry and coca-cola to further commercial interests , " bieger told reuters . santa 's origins the image of santa most known today - fat , white bearded and in a red suit - is indeed a creation of the coca-cola company , which was looking for a new figure to use in its advertising campaigns in the 1930s and 1940s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa claus , inspired by coke a swedish-american artist , haddon sundblom , created the jolly , benevolent character for coke based on a previous figure created for harper 's weekly in the 19th century by thomas nast , a german immigrant to the united states . for the small but vocal anti-santa movement , which has also gained momentum in austria , santa claus is a poor reflection of the original st. nicholas , who is believed to have been a fourth-century bishop in myra , in present-day turkey .
he had a reputation for generosity and kindness , which gave rise to legends of miracles that he performed for the poor and unhappy . " st. nicholas was a man who helped the poor , saved people who were unjustly condemned , freed prisoners , " schade said .
" you could say he was a forerunner of amnesty international .
santa is much less than that - just about giving gifts .

nevertheless , technology is improving rapidly in germany despite a very small budget . just when it looked like doping controllers were slowly catching up to the much fitter athletes , a huge hurdle got in their way .
the story broke in september 2003 when the balco laboratory was raided by united states criminal investigators .
this came after a tip-off to the united states anti-doping agency -lrb- usada -rrb- from a leading track coach . thg , a designer steroid , was the super drug and anti-doping agencies around the world had to scramble to try and preserve an already tarnished sports image .
despite thg and the increase of doping cases in germany — an increase from 50 in 2003 to 80 in 2004 — roland augustin , head of germany 's national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- , said that analysis has improved on all levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costas kenteris - gold in sydney with steroids ?

in some countries there is no functioning control system , particularly when it concerns testing outside of international competitions . to address the difficulties present in countries where testing is not so thorough , investigators from abroad could be sent in .

christian democratic union leader angela merkel is reportedly considering replacing the party 's secretary general , who 's come under fire for accepting money from utility giant rwe . before laurenz meyer was appointed as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- secretary general in the year 2000 , he worked as a manager for rwe , one of germany 's major energy producers and water management enterprises .
following a string of investigative reports last week , meyer was forced to admit that he received some € 40,000 -lrb- $ 53,000 -rrb- from rwe in 2000 while already occupying the post of cdu secretary general . the 56-year-old jack of all trades brushed aside all criticism on friday , saying that he was entitled to those payments for his efforts to achieve a smooth handover of affairs at managerial level before he took up the post as the cdu chief 's mouthpiece .
but according to der spiegel newsmagazine , meyer enjoyed an additional financial bonus from rwe at a later stage of some € 66,000 to sweeten his already decent salary as a federal parliamentarian and cdu secretary general .
moreover , laurenz meyer has said there was anything wrong in his getting rwe electricity and gas supplies in his home at a much reduced rate , while the bulk of the population has to put up with price hikes in this sector almost every year . closing ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe utility company headquarters in essen meyer himself has promised to reveal as soon as possible exactly what payments he 's received from rwe but insists that the whole affair is nothing but a huge misunderstanding .
various newspapers wrote on monday that it would be a big surprise if meyer were to survive this week as cdu secretary general .
hardly anyone in his party has put in a good word for him in recent days : they 're worried that the former rwe manager 's behavior may be damaging to their chances in regional elections in meyer 's home state of north-rhine westphalia in 2005 . " i think it 's absolutely right that cdu chief angela merkel has decided to investigate the matter fully , " christian wulff , cdu premier of lower saxony , said over the weekend .
" when all the details are out of the bag , she 'll analyze them in a non-partisan way and draw the right conclusion .
i do n't think there 's anyone in our party who wants her to sweep the matter under the carpet . " even the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- seem to be concerned about the implications of the scandal . " the meyer affair is something that all mainstream parties in this country should be worried about , " meyer 's spd counterpart , klaus-uwe benneter benneter said .
" we simply ca n't afford to fuel voter disenchantment any further - we 've had enough of that already in the past few years .
angela merkel would be well-advised to look into the matter speedily and not run away from what i agree is an unpleasant task for her . " merkel probed , too apparently alerted to the possibilities of another - possibly more damaging scandal - the " meyer affair " has led the cdu to examine party chief merkel 's income , according to the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . merkel was the first cdu head paid a salary from the party treasury , as past leaders either earned above average incomes as germany 's chancellor or as head of the cdu parliamentary group .
from april 2000 to late sept .
2002 , when she was finally elected head of the parliamentary group , merkel received € 10,000 per month from party coffers - payments that continued for several afterwards , the paper wrote quoting " cdu politicians well acquainted with the finances . " if laurenz meyer is forced to step down from his post as secretary general , the opposition conservatives would face yet another untimely reshuffle following the recent resignation of parliamentary finance spokesman friedrich merz and the resignation of health expert horst seehofer over irreconcilable differences regarding the country 's social and economic reform endeavors . the conservatives thus stand to lose important expertise in two regional elections next year and gamble their good starting position for the 2006 general election . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de decision time for germany 's " iron lady " opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .

following a string of investigative reports last week , meyer was forced to admit that he received some € 40,000 -lrb- $ 53,000 -rrb- from rwe in 2000 while already occupying the post of cdu secretary general . the 56-year-old jack of all trades brushed aside all criticism on friday , saying that he was entitled to those payments for his efforts to achieve a smooth handover of affairs at managerial level before he took up the post as the cdu chief 's mouthpiece .
but according to der spiegel newsmagazine , meyer enjoyed an additional financial bonus from rwe at a later stage of some € 66,000 to sweeten his already decent salary as a federal parliamentarian and cdu secretary general .
moreover , laurenz meyer has said there was anything wrong in his getting rwe electricity and gas supplies in his home at a much reduced rate , while the bulk of the population has to put up with price hikes in this sector almost every year . closing ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe utility company headquarters in essen meyer himself has promised to reveal as soon as possible exactly what payments he 's received from rwe but insists that the whole affair is nothing but a huge misunderstanding .
various newspapers wrote on monday that it would be a big surprise if meyer were to survive this week as cdu secretary general .
hardly anyone in his party has put in a good word for him in recent days : they 're worried that the former rwe manager 's behavior may be damaging to their chances in regional elections in meyer 's home state of north-rhine westphalia in 2005 . " i think it 's absolutely right that cdu chief angela merkel has decided to investigate the matter fully , " christian wulff , cdu premier of lower saxony , said over the weekend .
" when all the details are out of the bag , she 'll analyze them in a non-partisan way and draw the right conclusion .
i do n't think there 's anyone in our party who wants her to sweep the matter under the carpet . " even the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- seem to be concerned about the implications of the scandal . " the meyer affair is something that all mainstream parties in this country should be worried about , " meyer 's spd counterpart , klaus-uwe benneter benneter said .
" we simply ca n't afford to fuel voter disenchantment any further - we 've had enough of that already in the past few years .
angela merkel would be well-advised to look into the matter speedily and not run away from what i agree is an unpleasant task for her . " merkel probed , too apparently alerted to the possibilities of another - possibly more damaging scandal - the " meyer affair " has led the cdu to examine party chief merkel 's income , according to the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . merkel was the first cdu head paid a salary from the party treasury , as past leaders either earned above average incomes as germany 's chancellor or as head of the cdu parliamentary group .

they feel the time of the year that should encourage people to be thoughtful and contemplative is being drowned out by jingle bells and ho ho ho . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what is the meaning of christmas ?
the meaning of christmas is , in the first place , not shopping , " said reverend volker faigle , a lutheran pastor and representative of the protestant church to the german government and the eu . he said the protestant church also did not hold any particular grudge against santa , or the gift-giving he represents .
it is just a matter of keeping what many see as the excesses of the christmas season in check . " our shopping centers want to make money and they have a right to make money , we have no problem with that , " he said .
" but if you already start the season in september , people think christmas is just about shopping , shopping , shopping .
then we think christmas is misused . " the protestant church has started a program called " christmas in december , " selling things such as advent calendars without the chocolates and cartoon figures .
church representatives even approached german retailers and marketers asking them to keep the christmas overkill in check . crucial for sales but according to the german retailing association , christmas is a critical time for retailers : what some see as santa surfeit , shop owners see as a lifeline . from the looks of shops in berlin , retailers have not held back when it comes to promoting santa and gift-giving .
that is perhaps understandable , since according to the hde retailers ' association , about 20 percent of annual sales are made in the last two months of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas shoppers " we did n't have a good year in 2004 , but in december the mood has picked up , " said hubertus pellengahr , hde 's spokesman .
" presents are being bought , people have finally found a little joy in buying again . " but talking to shoppers in front of one of berlin 's premier department stores , kadewe , it appears some holiday fatigue might be setting in . " there are many good things that comes over from america , but this kitsch christmas style is getting the upper hand , " said hella wichman , 55 , who was visiting berlin from hamburg and doing a little window shopping . " there 's too much of everything , too many lights , too much money spent , too much santa , " she said .
" there is nothing thoughtful about christmas anymore . " but jolly old santa himself , talking to children amid glittering ornaments on kadewe 's fifth floor , finds the groups who would like to lower his profile somewhat alarmist .
he said there 's room for both him and his predecessor st. nicholas during the yuletide season . " santa brings joy , and children grow up so fast anyway , " he said .
" why not let them enjoy his magic for as long as they can ?

nevertheless , technology is improving rapidly in germany despite a very small budget . just when it looked like doping controllers were slowly catching up to the much fitter athletes , a huge hurdle got in their way .
the story broke in september 2003 when the balco laboratory was raided by united states criminal investigators .
this came after a tip-off to the united states anti-doping agency -lrb- usada -rrb- from a leading track coach . thg , a designer steroid , was the super drug and anti-doping agencies around the world had to scramble to try and preserve an already tarnished sports image .
despite thg and the increase of doping cases in germany — an increase from 50 in 2003 to 80 in 2004 — roland augustin , head of germany 's national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- , said that analysis has improved on all levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costas kenteris - gold in sydney with steroids ?
athletes who thought they could skirt around drugs tests by discontinuing usage shortly before screenings were caught unawares .
augustin said he was nevertheless surprised by the patent use of steroids and the investigations from the athens games .

they feel the time of the year that should encourage people to be thoughtful and contemplative is being drowned out by jingle bells and ho ho ho . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what is the meaning of christmas ?
the meaning of christmas is , in the first place , not shopping , " said reverend volker faigle , a lutheran pastor and representative of the protestant church to the german government and the eu . he said the protestant church also did not hold any particular grudge against santa , or the gift-giving he represents .
it is just a matter of keeping what many see as the excesses of the christmas season in check . " our shopping centers want to make money and they have a right to make money , we have no problem with that , " he said .
" but if you already start the season in september , people think christmas is just about shopping , shopping , shopping .
then we think christmas is misused . " the protestant church has started a program called " christmas in december , " selling things such as advent calendars without the chocolates and cartoon figures .
church representatives even approached german retailers and marketers asking them to keep the christmas overkill in check . crucial for sales but according to the german retailing association , christmas is a critical time for retailers : what some see as santa surfeit , shop owners see as a lifeline . from the looks of shops in berlin , retailers have not held back when it comes to promoting santa and gift-giving .
that is perhaps understandable , since according to the hde retailers ' association , about 20 percent of annual sales are made in the last two months of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas shoppers " we did n't have a good year in 2004 , but in december the mood has picked up , " said hubertus pellengahr , hde 's spokesman .
" presents are being bought , people have finally found a little joy in buying again . " but talking to shoppers in front of one of berlin 's premier department stores , kadewe , it appears some holiday fatigue might be setting in . " there are many good things that comes over from america , but this kitsch christmas style is getting the upper hand , " said hella wichman , 55 , who was visiting berlin from hamburg and doing a little window shopping . " there 's too much of everything , too many lights , too much money spent , too much santa , " she said .
" there is nothing thoughtful about christmas anymore . " but jolly old santa himself , talking to children amid glittering ornaments on kadewe 's fifth floor , finds the groups who would like to lower his profile somewhat alarmist .
he said there 's room for both him and his predecessor st. nicholas during the yuletide season . " santa brings joy , and children grow up so fast anyway , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.12.2004 dealing with doping großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athletes stop at almost nothing when it comes to urine samples international doping investigators must admit that 2004 was probably the worst ever in sports .
nevertheless , technology is improving rapidly in germany despite a very small budget . just when it looked like doping controllers were slowly catching up to the much fitter athletes , a huge hurdle got in their way .
the story broke in september 2003 when the balco laboratory was raided by united states criminal investigators .
this came after a tip-off to the united states anti-doping agency -lrb- usada -rrb- from a leading track coach . thg , a designer steroid , was the super drug and anti-doping agencies around the world had to scramble to try and preserve an already tarnished sports image .
despite thg and the increase of doping cases in germany — an increase from 50 in 2003 to 80 in 2004 — roland augustin , head of germany 's national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- , said that analysis has improved on all levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costas kenteris - gold in sydney with steroids ?
athletes who thought they could skirt around drugs tests by discontinuing usage shortly before screenings were caught unawares .
augustin said he was nevertheless surprised by the patent use of steroids and the investigations from the athens games .
the most spectacular case was the fall of costas kenteris , the greek 200 meters gold medal winner at the sydney olympics . german athletes feel discriminated drugs tests are not conducted with the same frequency and the same thoroughness around the world .
germany 's athletes complain that they are tested too often .
augustin did not refute that . " internationally speaking , there are clearly shortfalls in drug testing , " he said .
in some countries there is no functioning control system , particularly when it concerns testing outside of international competitions . to address the difficulties present in countries where testing is not so thorough , investigators from abroad could be sent in .
but augustin pointed out that there are two large hurdles . firstly , visas must be issued and that often happens with great delay so that an athlete could be warned , he said .
secondly , even if samples are taken , the probes sometimes ca n't be taken out of the country or are held up in customs and are then unusable . budgets too small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balco founder victor conte was behind thg designer steroid the battle against doping is particularly difficult in the entire arab and asia regions , where such countries as iran , vietnam and also china head the list for drug use .
but belarus and ukraine are also among some of the top offenders . investigators are the first to admit that if the international sports community hopes to address the issue of doping effectively , it 's going to need financial backing .
nada has a measly € 1.2 million -lrb- $ 1.6 million -rrb- budget . the state provides just 13 percent of that backing , while allotting € 2 million each year for sport sponsoring . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germany 's doping legacy returns german athletics coach thomas springstein has been sacked by his club and faces criminal charges after an investigation found banned substances at his home .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.12.2004 conservatives face kickback scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer and merkel : can the cdu stomach more personnel losses ?
christian democratic union leader angela merkel is reportedly considering replacing the party 's secretary general , who 's come under fire for accepting money from utility giant rwe . before laurenz meyer was appointed as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- secretary general in the year 2000 , he worked as a manager for rwe , one of germany 's major energy producers and water management enterprises .
following a string of investigative reports last week , meyer was forced to admit that he received some € 40,000 -lrb- $ 53,000 -rrb- from rwe in 2000 while already occupying the post of cdu secretary general . the 56-year-old jack of all trades brushed aside all criticism on friday , saying that he was entitled to those payments for his efforts to achieve a smooth handover of affairs at managerial level before he took up the post as the cdu chief 's mouthpiece .
but according to der spiegel newsmagazine , meyer enjoyed an additional financial bonus from rwe at a later stage of some € 66,000 to sweeten his already decent salary as a federal parliamentarian and cdu secretary general .
moreover , laurenz meyer has said there was anything wrong in his getting rwe electricity and gas supplies in his home at a much reduced rate , while the bulk of the population has to put up with price hikes in this sector almost every year . closing ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe utility company headquarters in essen meyer himself has promised to reveal as soon as possible exactly what payments he 's received from rwe but insists that the whole affair is nothing but a huge misunderstanding .
various newspapers wrote on monday that it would be a big surprise if meyer were to survive this week as cdu secretary general .
hardly anyone in his party has put in a good word for him in recent days : they 're worried that the former rwe manager 's behavior may be damaging to their chances in regional elections in meyer 's home state of north-rhine westphalia in 2005 . " i think it 's absolutely right that cdu chief angela merkel has decided to investigate the matter fully , " christian wulff , cdu premier of lower saxony , said over the weekend .
" when all the details are out of the bag , she 'll analyze them in a non-partisan way and draw the right conclusion .
i do n't think there 's anyone in our party who wants her to sweep the matter under the carpet . " even the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- seem to be concerned about the implications of the scandal . " the meyer affair is something that all mainstream parties in this country should be worried about , " meyer 's spd counterpart , klaus-uwe benneter benneter said .
" we simply ca n't afford to fuel voter disenchantment any further - we 've had enough of that already in the past few years .
angela merkel would be well-advised to look into the matter speedily and not run away from what i agree is an unpleasant task for her . " merkel probed , too apparently alerted to the possibilities of another - possibly more damaging scandal - the " meyer affair " has led the cdu to examine party chief merkel 's income , according to the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . merkel was the first cdu head paid a salary from the party treasury , as past leaders either earned above average incomes as germany 's chancellor or as head of the cdu parliamentary group .
from april 2000 to late sept .
2002 , when she was finally elected head of the parliamentary group , merkel received € 10,000 per month from party coffers - payments that continued for several afterwards , the paper wrote quoting " cdu politicians well acquainted with the finances . " if laurenz meyer is forced to step down from his post as secretary general , the opposition conservatives would face yet another untimely reshuffle following the recent resignation of parliamentary finance spokesman friedrich merz and the resignation of health expert horst seehofer over irreconcilable differences regarding the country 's social and economic reform endeavors . the conservatives thus stand to lose important expertise in two regional elections next year and gamble their good starting position for the 2006 general election . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de decision time for germany 's " iron lady " opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .

christian democratic union leader angela merkel is reportedly considering replacing the party 's secretary general , who 's come under fire for accepting money from utility giant rwe . before laurenz meyer was appointed as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- secretary general in the year 2000 , he worked as a manager for rwe , one of germany 's major energy producers and water management enterprises .
following a string of investigative reports last week , meyer was forced to admit that he received some € 40,000 -lrb- $ 53,000 -rrb- from rwe in 2000 while already occupying the post of cdu secretary general . the 56-year-old jack of all trades brushed aside all criticism on friday , saying that he was entitled to those payments for his efforts to achieve a smooth handover of affairs at managerial level before he took up the post as the cdu chief 's mouthpiece .
but according to der spiegel newsmagazine , meyer enjoyed an additional financial bonus from rwe at a later stage of some € 66,000 to sweeten his already decent salary as a federal parliamentarian and cdu secretary general .
moreover , laurenz meyer has said there was anything wrong in his getting rwe electricity and gas supplies in his home at a much reduced rate , while the bulk of the population has to put up with price hikes in this sector almost every year . closing ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe utility company headquarters in essen meyer himself has promised to reveal as soon as possible exactly what payments he 's received from rwe but insists that the whole affair is nothing but a huge misunderstanding .
various newspapers wrote on monday that it would be a big surprise if meyer were to survive this week as cdu secretary general .
hardly anyone in his party has put in a good word for him in recent days : they 're worried that the former rwe manager 's behavior may be damaging to their chances in regional elections in meyer 's home state of north-rhine westphalia in 2005 . " i think it 's absolutely right that cdu chief angela merkel has decided to investigate the matter fully , " christian wulff , cdu premier of lower saxony , said over the weekend .
" when all the details are out of the bag , she 'll analyze them in a non-partisan way and draw the right conclusion .
i do n't think there 's anyone in our party who wants her to sweep the matter under the carpet . " even the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- seem to be concerned about the implications of the scandal . " the meyer affair is something that all mainstream parties in this country should be worried about , " meyer 's spd counterpart , klaus-uwe benneter benneter said .
" we simply ca n't afford to fuel voter disenchantment any further - we 've had enough of that already in the past few years .
angela merkel would be well-advised to look into the matter speedily and not run away from what i agree is an unpleasant task for her . " merkel probed , too apparently alerted to the possibilities of another - possibly more damaging scandal - the " meyer affair " has led the cdu to examine party chief merkel 's income , according to the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . merkel was the first cdu head paid a salary from the party treasury , as past leaders either earned above average incomes as germany 's chancellor or as head of the cdu parliamentary group .
from april 2000 to late sept .
2002 , when she was finally elected head of the parliamentary group , merkel received € 10,000 per month from party coffers - payments that continued for several afterwards , the paper wrote quoting " cdu politicians well acquainted with the finances . " if laurenz meyer is forced to step down from his post as secretary general , the opposition conservatives would face yet another untimely reshuffle following the recent resignation of parliamentary finance spokesman friedrich merz and the resignation of health expert horst seehofer over irreconcilable differences regarding the country 's social and economic reform endeavors . the conservatives thus stand to lose important expertise in two regional elections next year and gamble their good starting position for the 2006 general election . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de decision time for germany 's " iron lady " opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .

christian democratic union leader angela merkel is reportedly considering replacing the party 's secretary general , who 's come under fire for accepting money from utility giant rwe . before laurenz meyer was appointed as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- secretary general in the year 2000 , he worked as a manager for rwe , one of germany 's major energy producers and water management enterprises .
following a string of investigative reports last week , meyer was forced to admit that he received some € 40,000 -lrb- $ 53,000 -rrb- from rwe in 2000 while already occupying the post of cdu secretary general . the 56-year-old jack of all trades brushed aside all criticism on friday , saying that he was entitled to those payments for his efforts to achieve a smooth handover of affairs at managerial level before he took up the post as the cdu chief 's mouthpiece .
but according to der spiegel newsmagazine , meyer enjoyed an additional financial bonus from rwe at a later stage of some € 66,000 to sweeten his already decent salary as a federal parliamentarian and cdu secretary general .
moreover , laurenz meyer has said there was anything wrong in his getting rwe electricity and gas supplies in his home at a much reduced rate , while the bulk of the population has to put up with price hikes in this sector almost every year . closing ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe utility company headquarters in essen meyer himself has promised to reveal as soon as possible exactly what payments he 's received from rwe but insists that the whole affair is nothing but a huge misunderstanding .
various newspapers wrote on monday that it would be a big surprise if meyer were to survive this week as cdu secretary general .
hardly anyone in his party has put in a good word for him in recent days : they 're worried that the former rwe manager 's behavior may be damaging to their chances in regional elections in meyer 's home state of north-rhine westphalia in 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.12.2004 conservatives face kickback scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer and merkel : can the cdu stomach more personnel losses ?
christian democratic union leader angela merkel is reportedly considering replacing the party 's secretary general , who 's come under fire for accepting money from utility giant rwe . before laurenz meyer was appointed as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- secretary general in the year 2000 , he worked as a manager for rwe , one of germany 's major energy producers and water management enterprises .
following a string of investigative reports last week , meyer was forced to admit that he received some € 40,000 -lrb- $ 53,000 -rrb- from rwe in 2000 while already occupying the post of cdu secretary general . the 56-year-old jack of all trades brushed aside all criticism on friday , saying that he was entitled to those payments for his efforts to achieve a smooth handover of affairs at managerial level before he took up the post as the cdu chief 's mouthpiece .
but according to der spiegel newsmagazine , meyer enjoyed an additional financial bonus from rwe at a later stage of some € 66,000 to sweeten his already decent salary as a federal parliamentarian and cdu secretary general .
moreover , laurenz meyer has said there was anything wrong in his getting rwe electricity and gas supplies in his home at a much reduced rate , while the bulk of the population has to put up with price hikes in this sector almost every year . closing ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe utility company headquarters in essen meyer himself has promised to reveal as soon as possible exactly what payments he 's received from rwe but insists that the whole affair is nothing but a huge misunderstanding .
various newspapers wrote on monday that it would be a big surprise if meyer were to survive this week as cdu secretary general .
hardly anyone in his party has put in a good word for him in recent days : they 're worried that the former rwe manager 's behavior may be damaging to their chances in regional elections in meyer 's home state of north-rhine westphalia in 2005 . " i think it 's absolutely right that cdu chief angela merkel has decided to investigate the matter fully , " christian wulff , cdu premier of lower saxony , said over the weekend .
" when all the details are out of the bag , she 'll analyze them in a non-partisan way and draw the right conclusion .
i do n't think there 's anyone in our party who wants her to sweep the matter under the carpet . " even the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- seem to be concerned about the implications of the scandal . " the meyer affair is something that all mainstream parties in this country should be worried about , " meyer 's spd counterpart , klaus-uwe benneter benneter said .
" we simply ca n't afford to fuel voter disenchantment any further - we 've had enough of that already in the past few years .
angela merkel would be well-advised to look into the matter speedily and not run away from what i agree is an unpleasant task for her . " merkel probed , too apparently alerted to the possibilities of another - possibly more damaging scandal - the " meyer affair " has led the cdu to examine party chief merkel 's income , according to the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . merkel was the first cdu head paid a salary from the party treasury , as past leaders either earned above average incomes as germany 's chancellor or as head of the cdu parliamentary group .
from april 2000 to late sept .
2002 , when she was finally elected head of the parliamentary group , merkel received € 10,000 per month from party coffers - payments that continued for several afterwards , the paper wrote quoting " cdu politicians well acquainted with the finances . " if laurenz meyer is forced to step down from his post as secretary general , the opposition conservatives would face yet another untimely reshuffle following the recent resignation of parliamentary finance spokesman friedrich merz and the resignation of health expert horst seehofer over irreconcilable differences regarding the country 's social and economic reform endeavors . the conservatives thus stand to lose important expertise in two regional elections next year and gamble their good starting position for the 2006 general election . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de decision time for germany 's " iron lady " opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .

christian democratic union leader angela merkel is reportedly considering replacing the party 's secretary general , who 's come under fire for accepting money from utility giant rwe . before laurenz meyer was appointed as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- secretary general in the year 2000 , he worked as a manager for rwe , one of germany 's major energy producers and water management enterprises .
following a string of investigative reports last week , meyer was forced to admit that he received some € 40,000 -lrb- $ 53,000 -rrb- from rwe in 2000 while already occupying the post of cdu secretary general . the 56-year-old jack of all trades brushed aside all criticism on friday , saying that he was entitled to those payments for his efforts to achieve a smooth handover of affairs at managerial level before he took up the post as the cdu chief 's mouthpiece .
but according to der spiegel newsmagazine , meyer enjoyed an additional financial bonus from rwe at a later stage of some € 66,000 to sweeten his already decent salary as a federal parliamentarian and cdu secretary general .
moreover , laurenz meyer has said there was anything wrong in his getting rwe electricity and gas supplies in his home at a much reduced rate , while the bulk of the population has to put up with price hikes in this sector almost every year . closing ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe utility company headquarters in essen meyer himself has promised to reveal as soon as possible exactly what payments he 's received from rwe but insists that the whole affair is nothing but a huge misunderstanding .
various newspapers wrote on monday that it would be a big surprise if meyer were to survive this week as cdu secretary general .
hardly anyone in his party has put in a good word for him in recent days : they 're worried that the former rwe manager 's behavior may be damaging to their chances in regional elections in meyer 's home state of north-rhine westphalia in 2005 . " i think it 's absolutely right that cdu chief angela merkel has decided to investigate the matter fully , " christian wulff , cdu premier of lower saxony , said over the weekend .
" when all the details are out of the bag , she 'll analyze them in a non-partisan way and draw the right conclusion .
i do n't think there 's anyone in our party who wants her to sweep the matter under the carpet . " even the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- seem to be concerned about the implications of the scandal . " the meyer affair is something that all mainstream parties in this country should be worried about , " meyer 's spd counterpart , klaus-uwe benneter benneter said .
" we simply ca n't afford to fuel voter disenchantment any further - we 've had enough of that already in the past few years .
angela merkel would be well-advised to look into the matter speedily and not run away from what i agree is an unpleasant task for her . " merkel probed , too apparently alerted to the possibilities of another - possibly more damaging scandal - the " meyer affair " has led the cdu to examine party chief merkel 's income , according to the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . merkel was the first cdu head paid a salary from the party treasury , as past leaders either earned above average incomes as germany 's chancellor or as head of the cdu parliamentary group .
from april 2000 to late sept .
2002 , when she was finally elected head of the parliamentary group , merkel received € 10,000 per month from party coffers - payments that continued for several afterwards , the paper wrote quoting " cdu politicians well acquainted with the finances . " if laurenz meyer is forced to step down from his post as secretary general , the opposition conservatives would face yet another untimely reshuffle following the recent resignation of parliamentary finance spokesman friedrich merz and the resignation of health expert horst seehofer over irreconcilable differences regarding the country 's social and economic reform endeavors . the conservatives thus stand to lose important expertise in two regional elections next year and gamble their good starting position for the 2006 general election . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de decision time for germany 's " iron lady " opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .

the judges acknowledged that daschner had hoped the information would have allowed the police to save the boy 's life , without knowing that gäfgen had already killed him . ortwin e. , 51 , who interrogated gäfgen and made the threat , was sentenced to a € 3,600 fine .
the two men got off lightly as the normal penalty for such a crime is six months to five years imprisonment .
the defense had argued for acquitting the two men .

they feel the time of the year that should encourage people to be thoughtful and contemplative is being drowned out by jingle bells and ho ho ho . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what is the meaning of christmas ?
the meaning of christmas is , in the first place , not shopping , " said reverend volker faigle , a lutheran pastor and representative of the protestant church to the german government and the eu . he said the protestant church also did not hold any particular grudge against santa , or the gift-giving he represents .
it is just a matter of keeping what many see as the excesses of the christmas season in check . " our shopping centers want to make money and they have a right to make money , we have no problem with that , " he said .
" but if you already start the season in september , people think christmas is just about shopping , shopping , shopping .
then we think christmas is misused . " the protestant church has started a program called " christmas in december , " selling things such as advent calendars without the chocolates and cartoon figures .
church representatives even approached german retailers and marketers asking them to keep the christmas overkill in check . crucial for sales but according to the german retailing association , christmas is a critical time for retailers : what some see as santa surfeit , shop owners see as a lifeline . from the looks of shops in berlin , retailers have not held back when it comes to promoting santa and gift-giving .
that is perhaps understandable , since according to the hde retailers ' association , about 20 percent of annual sales are made in the last two months of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas shoppers " we did n't have a good year in 2004 , but in december the mood has picked up , " said hubertus pellengahr , hde 's spokesman .
" presents are being bought , people have finally found a little joy in buying again . " but talking to shoppers in front of one of berlin 's premier department stores , kadewe , it appears some holiday fatigue might be setting in . " there are many good things that comes over from america , but this kitsch christmas style is getting the upper hand , " said hella wichman , 55 , who was visiting berlin from hamburg and doing a little window shopping . " there 's too much of everything , too many lights , too much money spent , too much santa , " she said .
" there is nothing thoughtful about christmas anymore . " but jolly old santa himself , talking to children amid glittering ornaments on kadewe 's fifth floor , finds the groups who would like to lower his profile somewhat alarmist .
he said there 's room for both him and his predecessor st. nicholas during the yuletide season . " santa brings joy , and children grow up so fast anyway , " he said .
" why not let them enjoy his magic for as long as they can ?

the judges acknowledged that daschner had hoped the information would have allowed the police to save the boy 's life , without knowing that gäfgen had already killed him . ortwin e. , 51 , who interrogated gäfgen and made the threat , was sentenced to a € 3,600 fine .
the two men got off lightly as the normal penalty for such a crime is six months to five years imprisonment .
the defense had argued for acquitting the two men .

he gave evidence in daschner 's eight-day trial , though the district attorney did not focus his case on the 28-year-old 's testimony . daschner had noted in a memorandum on oct .
1 , 2002 that gäfgen , who had been arrested the previous day , would be interrogated anew after threats of " the infliction of pain under medical supervision .

christian democratic union leader angela merkel is reportedly considering replacing the party 's secretary general , who 's come under fire for accepting money from utility giant rwe . before laurenz meyer was appointed as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- secretary general in the year 2000 , he worked as a manager for rwe , one of germany 's major energy producers and water management enterprises .
following a string of investigative reports last week , meyer was forced to admit that he received some € 40,000 -lrb- $ 53,000 -rrb- from rwe in 2000 while already occupying the post of cdu secretary general . the 56-year-old jack of all trades brushed aside all criticism on friday , saying that he was entitled to those payments for his efforts to achieve a smooth handover of affairs at managerial level before he took up the post as the cdu chief 's mouthpiece .
but according to der spiegel newsmagazine , meyer enjoyed an additional financial bonus from rwe at a later stage of some € 66,000 to sweeten his already decent salary as a federal parliamentarian and cdu secretary general .
moreover , laurenz meyer has said there was anything wrong in his getting rwe electricity and gas supplies in his home at a much reduced rate , while the bulk of the population has to put up with price hikes in this sector almost every year . closing ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe utility company headquarters in essen meyer himself has promised to reveal as soon as possible exactly what payments he 's received from rwe but insists that the whole affair is nothing but a huge misunderstanding .
various newspapers wrote on monday that it would be a big surprise if meyer were to survive this week as cdu secretary general .
hardly anyone in his party has put in a good word for him in recent days : they 're worried that the former rwe manager 's behavior may be damaging to their chances in regional elections in meyer 's home state of north-rhine westphalia in 2005 . " i think it 's absolutely right that cdu chief angela merkel has decided to investigate the matter fully , " christian wulff , cdu premier of lower saxony , said over the weekend .
" when all the details are out of the bag , she 'll analyze them in a non-partisan way and draw the right conclusion .
i do n't think there 's anyone in our party who wants her to sweep the matter under the carpet . " even the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- seem to be concerned about the implications of the scandal . " the meyer affair is something that all mainstream parties in this country should be worried about , " meyer 's spd counterpart , klaus-uwe benneter benneter said .
" we simply ca n't afford to fuel voter disenchantment any further - we 've had enough of that already in the past few years .
angela merkel would be well-advised to look into the matter speedily and not run away from what i agree is an unpleasant task for her . " merkel probed , too apparently alerted to the possibilities of another - possibly more damaging scandal - the " meyer affair " has led the cdu to examine party chief merkel 's income , according to the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . merkel was the first cdu head paid a salary from the party treasury , as past leaders either earned above average incomes as germany 's chancellor or as head of the cdu parliamentary group .
from april 2000 to late sept .
2002 , when she was finally elected head of the parliamentary group , merkel received € 10,000 per month from party coffers - payments that continued for several afterwards , the paper wrote quoting " cdu politicians well acquainted with the finances . " if laurenz meyer is forced to step down from his post as secretary general , the opposition conservatives would face yet another untimely reshuffle following the recent resignation of parliamentary finance spokesman friedrich merz and the resignation of health expert horst seehofer over irreconcilable differences regarding the country 's social and economic reform endeavors . the conservatives thus stand to lose important expertise in two regional elections next year and gamble their good starting position for the 2006 general election . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de decision time for germany 's " iron lady " opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .

the target of their ire is santa , an american import who they say does n't represent what the holiday is all about . bettina schade says she does n't have anything personal against santa claus .
in fact , she likes a lot of things about today 's celebrations of christmas - the lighted trees , the gold ornaments , the silver stars .
but all the material things , the hectic rush to buy gifts , and the ubiquity of the bearded man in the red suit are taking away from the core meaning of christmas .
she 'd like to see things changed , or at least toned down a little .
" the christian origins of christmas , like the birth of jesus , have receded into the background , " she said .
" it 's becoming more and more a festival that is reduced to simply worldly gifts and to commerce . " she is part of a campaign called the frankfurter nicholas initiative , founded by a roman catholic priest in frankfurt , eckhard bieger .
alarmed by the growing commercialization of christmas in germany , he launched the initiative that 's aimed at putting st. nicholas , a fourth-century monk , back in the christmas spotlight where he used to be . it 's an uphill battle , however , since st. nicholas ' successor , the american-inspired jolly old st. nick , or santa claus , has been edging the miter-wearing historical figure out of the german christmas landscape of late .

they show kids how to turn chocolate santas into chocolate nicholas figures and have been handing out stickers in stores and at christmas markets featuring a bar cutting across an image of kriss kringle .
it proclaims the area a " santa-free zone . " " santa claus is a creation of the advertising industry and coca-cola to further commercial interests , " bieger told reuters . santa 's origins the image of santa most known today - fat , white bearded and in a red suit - is indeed a creation of the coca-cola company , which was looking for a new figure to use in its advertising campaigns in the 1930s and 1940s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa claus , inspired by coke a swedish-american artist , haddon sundblom , created the jolly , benevolent character for coke based on a previous figure created for harper 's weekly in the 19th century by thomas nast , a german immigrant to the united states . for the small but vocal anti-santa movement , which has also gained momentum in austria , santa claus is a poor reflection of the original st. nicholas , who is believed to have been a fourth-century bishop in myra , in present-day turkey .
he had a reputation for generosity and kindness , which gave rise to legends of miracles that he performed for the poor and unhappy . " st. nicholas was a man who helped the poor , saved people who were unjustly condemned , freed prisoners , " schade said .
" you could say he was a forerunner of amnesty international .

alarmed by the growing commercialization of christmas in germany , he launched the initiative that 's aimed at putting st. nicholas , a fourth-century monk , back in the christmas spotlight where he used to be . it 's an uphill battle , however , since st. nicholas ' successor , the american-inspired jolly old st. nick , or santa claus , has been edging the miter-wearing historical figure out of the german christmas landscape of late .
german kids do set out their shoes on dec .
6 for st. nicholas to fill them with sweets , but that holiday now pales in comparison with santa 's sleigh-ride night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate santa dressed up at st. nicholas to counter this trend , the frankfurt initiative along with another catholic organization , the bonifatiuswerk , has launched pro-nicholas campaign .
they show kids how to turn chocolate santas into chocolate nicholas figures and have been handing out stickers in stores and at christmas markets featuring a bar cutting across an image of kriss kringle .
it proclaims the area a " santa-free zone . " " santa claus is a creation of the advertising industry and coca-cola to further commercial interests , " bieger told reuters . santa 's origins the image of santa most known today - fat , white bearded and in a red suit - is indeed a creation of the coca-cola company , which was looking for a new figure to use in its advertising campaigns in the 1930s and 1940s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa claus , inspired by coke a swedish-american artist , haddon sundblom , created the jolly , benevolent character for coke based on a previous figure created for harper 's weekly in the 19th century by thomas nast , a german immigrant to the united states . for the small but vocal anti-santa movement , which has also gained momentum in austria , santa claus is a poor reflection of the original st. nicholas , who is believed to have been a fourth-century bishop in myra , in present-day turkey .
he had a reputation for generosity and kindness , which gave rise to legends of miracles that he performed for the poor and unhappy . " st. nicholas was a man who helped the poor , saved people who were unjustly condemned , freed prisoners , " schade said .
" you could say he was a forerunner of amnesty international .
santa is much less than that - just about giving gifts .

they feel the time of the year that should encourage people to be thoughtful and contemplative is being drowned out by jingle bells and ho ho ho . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what is the meaning of christmas ?
the meaning of christmas is , in the first place , not shopping , " said reverend volker faigle , a lutheran pastor and representative of the protestant church to the german government and the eu . he said the protestant church also did not hold any particular grudge against santa , or the gift-giving he represents .
it is just a matter of keeping what many see as the excesses of the christmas season in check . " our shopping centers want to make money and they have a right to make money , we have no problem with that , " he said .
" but if you already start the season in september , people think christmas is just about shopping , shopping , shopping .
then we think christmas is misused . " the protestant church has started a program called " christmas in december , " selling things such as advent calendars without the chocolates and cartoon figures .
church representatives even approached german retailers and marketers asking them to keep the christmas overkill in check . crucial for sales but according to the german retailing association , christmas is a critical time for retailers : what some see as santa surfeit , shop owners see as a lifeline . from the looks of shops in berlin , retailers have not held back when it comes to promoting santa and gift-giving .
that is perhaps understandable , since according to the hde retailers ' association , about 20 percent of annual sales are made in the last two months of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas shoppers " we did n't have a good year in 2004 , but in december the mood has picked up , " said hubertus pellengahr , hde 's spokesman .
" presents are being bought , people have finally found a little joy in buying again . " but talking to shoppers in front of one of berlin 's premier department stores , kadewe , it appears some holiday fatigue might be setting in . " there are many good things that comes over from america , but this kitsch christmas style is getting the upper hand , " said hella wichman , 55 , who was visiting berlin from hamburg and doing a little window shopping . " there 's too much of everything , too many lights , too much money spent , too much santa , " she said .
" there is nothing thoughtful about christmas anymore . " but jolly old santa himself , talking to children amid glittering ornaments on kadewe 's fifth floor , finds the groups who would like to lower his profile somewhat alarmist .
he said there 's room for both him and his predecessor st. nicholas during the yuletide season . " santa brings joy , and children grow up so fast anyway , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.12.2004 conservatives face kickback scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer and merkel : can the cdu stomach more personnel losses ?
christian democratic union leader angela merkel is reportedly considering replacing the party 's secretary general , who 's come under fire for accepting money from utility giant rwe . before laurenz meyer was appointed as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- secretary general in the year 2000 , he worked as a manager for rwe , one of germany 's major energy producers and water management enterprises .
following a string of investigative reports last week , meyer was forced to admit that he received some € 40,000 -lrb- $ 53,000 -rrb- from rwe in 2000 while already occupying the post of cdu secretary general . the 56-year-old jack of all trades brushed aside all criticism on friday , saying that he was entitled to those payments for his efforts to achieve a smooth handover of affairs at managerial level before he took up the post as the cdu chief 's mouthpiece .
but according to der spiegel newsmagazine , meyer enjoyed an additional financial bonus from rwe at a later stage of some € 66,000 to sweeten his already decent salary as a federal parliamentarian and cdu secretary general .
moreover , laurenz meyer has said there was anything wrong in his getting rwe electricity and gas supplies in his home at a much reduced rate , while the bulk of the population has to put up with price hikes in this sector almost every year . closing ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe utility company headquarters in essen meyer himself has promised to reveal as soon as possible exactly what payments he 's received from rwe but insists that the whole affair is nothing but a huge misunderstanding .
various newspapers wrote on monday that it would be a big surprise if meyer were to survive this week as cdu secretary general .
hardly anyone in his party has put in a good word for him in recent days : they 're worried that the former rwe manager 's behavior may be damaging to their chances in regional elections in meyer 's home state of north-rhine westphalia in 2005 . " i think it 's absolutely right that cdu chief angela merkel has decided to investigate the matter fully , " christian wulff , cdu premier of lower saxony , said over the weekend .
" when all the details are out of the bag , she 'll analyze them in a non-partisan way and draw the right conclusion .
i do n't think there 's anyone in our party who wants her to sweep the matter under the carpet . " even the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- seem to be concerned about the implications of the scandal . " the meyer affair is something that all mainstream parties in this country should be worried about , " meyer 's spd counterpart , klaus-uwe benneter benneter said .
" we simply ca n't afford to fuel voter disenchantment any further - we 've had enough of that already in the past few years .
angela merkel would be well-advised to look into the matter speedily and not run away from what i agree is an unpleasant task for her . " merkel probed , too apparently alerted to the possibilities of another - possibly more damaging scandal - the " meyer affair " has led the cdu to examine party chief merkel 's income , according to the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . merkel was the first cdu head paid a salary from the party treasury , as past leaders either earned above average incomes as germany 's chancellor or as head of the cdu parliamentary group .
from april 2000 to late sept .
2002 , when she was finally elected head of the parliamentary group , merkel received € 10,000 per month from party coffers - payments that continued for several afterwards , the paper wrote quoting " cdu politicians well acquainted with the finances . " if laurenz meyer is forced to step down from his post as secretary general , the opposition conservatives would face yet another untimely reshuffle following the recent resignation of parliamentary finance spokesman friedrich merz and the resignation of health expert horst seehofer over irreconcilable differences regarding the country 's social and economic reform endeavors . the conservatives thus stand to lose important expertise in two regional elections next year and gamble their good starting position for the 2006 general election . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de decision time for germany 's " iron lady " opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.12.2004 dealing with doping großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athletes stop at almost nothing when it comes to urine samples international doping investigators must admit that 2004 was probably the worst ever in sports .
nevertheless , technology is improving rapidly in germany despite a very small budget . just when it looked like doping controllers were slowly catching up to the much fitter athletes , a huge hurdle got in their way .
the story broke in september 2003 when the balco laboratory was raided by united states criminal investigators .
this came after a tip-off to the united states anti-doping agency -lrb- usada -rrb- from a leading track coach . thg , a designer steroid , was the super drug and anti-doping agencies around the world had to scramble to try and preserve an already tarnished sports image .
despite thg and the increase of doping cases in germany — an increase from 50 in 2003 to 80 in 2004 — roland augustin , head of germany 's national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- , said that analysis has improved on all levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costas kenteris - gold in sydney with steroids ?
athletes who thought they could skirt around drugs tests by discontinuing usage shortly before screenings were caught unawares .
augustin said he was nevertheless surprised by the patent use of steroids and the investigations from the athens games .
the most spectacular case was the fall of costas kenteris , the greek 200 meters gold medal winner at the sydney olympics . german athletes feel discriminated drugs tests are not conducted with the same frequency and the same thoroughness around the world .
germany 's athletes complain that they are tested too often .
augustin did not refute that . " internationally speaking , there are clearly shortfalls in drug testing , " he said .
in some countries there is no functioning control system , particularly when it concerns testing outside of international competitions . to address the difficulties present in countries where testing is not so thorough , investigators from abroad could be sent in .
but augustin pointed out that there are two large hurdles . firstly , visas must be issued and that often happens with great delay so that an athlete could be warned , he said .
secondly , even if samples are taken , the probes sometimes ca n't be taken out of the country or are held up in customs and are then unusable . budgets too small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balco founder victor conte was behind thg designer steroid the battle against doping is particularly difficult in the entire arab and asia regions , where such countries as iran , vietnam and also china head the list for drug use .

nevertheless , technology is improving rapidly in germany despite a very small budget . just when it looked like doping controllers were slowly catching up to the much fitter athletes , a huge hurdle got in their way .

the target of their ire is santa , an american import who they say does n't represent what the holiday is all about . bettina schade says she does n't have anything personal against santa claus .
in fact , she likes a lot of things about today 's celebrations of christmas - the lighted trees , the gold ornaments , the silver stars .
but all the material things , the hectic rush to buy gifts , and the ubiquity of the bearded man in the red suit are taking away from the core meaning of christmas .
she 'd like to see things changed , or at least toned down a little .
" the christian origins of christmas , like the birth of jesus , have receded into the background , " she said .
" it 's becoming more and more a festival that is reduced to simply worldly gifts and to commerce . " she is part of a campaign called the frankfurter nicholas initiative , founded by a roman catholic priest in frankfurt , eckhard bieger .
alarmed by the growing commercialization of christmas in germany , he launched the initiative that 's aimed at putting st. nicholas , a fourth-century monk , back in the christmas spotlight where he used to be . it 's an uphill battle , however , since st. nicholas ' successor , the american-inspired jolly old st. nick , or santa claus , has been edging the miter-wearing historical figure out of the german christmas landscape of late .
german kids do set out their shoes on dec .
6 for st. nicholas to fill them with sweets , but that holiday now pales in comparison with santa 's sleigh-ride night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate santa dressed up at st. nicholas to counter this trend , the frankfurt initiative along with another catholic organization , the bonifatiuswerk , has launched pro-nicholas campaign .
they show kids how to turn chocolate santas into chocolate nicholas figures and have been handing out stickers in stores and at christmas markets featuring a bar cutting across an image of kriss kringle .
it proclaims the area a " santa-free zone . " " santa claus is a creation of the advertising industry and coca-cola to further commercial interests , " bieger told reuters . santa 's origins the image of santa most known today - fat , white bearded and in a red suit - is indeed a creation of the coca-cola company , which was looking for a new figure to use in its advertising campaigns in the 1930s and 1940s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa claus , inspired by coke a swedish-american artist , haddon sundblom , created the jolly , benevolent character for coke based on a previous figure created for harper 's weekly in the 19th century by thomas nast , a german immigrant to the united states . for the small but vocal anti-santa movement , which has also gained momentum in austria , santa claus is a poor reflection of the original st. nicholas , who is believed to have been a fourth-century bishop in myra , in present-day turkey .
he had a reputation for generosity and kindness , which gave rise to legends of miracles that he performed for the poor and unhappy . " st. nicholas was a man who helped the poor , saved people who were unjustly condemned , freed prisoners , " schade said .
" you could say he was a forerunner of amnesty international .
santa is much less than that - just about giving gifts .

the target of their ire is santa , an american import who they say does n't represent what the holiday is all about . bettina schade says she does n't have anything personal against santa claus .
in fact , she likes a lot of things about today 's celebrations of christmas - the lighted trees , the gold ornaments , the silver stars .
but all the material things , the hectic rush to buy gifts , and the ubiquity of the bearded man in the red suit are taking away from the core meaning of christmas .
she 'd like to see things changed , or at least toned down a little .
" the christian origins of christmas , like the birth of jesus , have receded into the background , " she said .
" it 's becoming more and more a festival that is reduced to simply worldly gifts and to commerce . " she is part of a campaign called the frankfurter nicholas initiative , founded by a roman catholic priest in frankfurt , eckhard bieger .
alarmed by the growing commercialization of christmas in germany , he launched the initiative that 's aimed at putting st. nicholas , a fourth-century monk , back in the christmas spotlight where he used to be . it 's an uphill battle , however , since st. nicholas ' successor , the american-inspired jolly old st. nick , or santa claus , has been edging the miter-wearing historical figure out of the german christmas landscape of late .

it proclaims the area a " santa-free zone . " " santa claus is a creation of the advertising industry and coca-cola to further commercial interests , " bieger told reuters . santa 's origins the image of santa most known today - fat , white bearded and in a red suit - is indeed a creation of the coca-cola company , which was looking for a new figure to use in its advertising campaigns in the 1930s and 1940s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa claus , inspired by coke a swedish-american artist , haddon sundblom , created the jolly , benevolent character for coke based on a previous figure created for harper 's weekly in the 19th century by thomas nast , a german immigrant to the united states . for the small but vocal anti-santa movement , which has also gained momentum in austria , santa claus is a poor reflection of the original st. nicholas , who is believed to have been a fourth-century bishop in myra , in present-day turkey .
he had a reputation for generosity and kindness , which gave rise to legends of miracles that he performed for the poor and unhappy . " st. nicholas was a man who helped the poor , saved people who were unjustly condemned , freed prisoners , " schade said .

they feel the time of the year that should encourage people to be thoughtful and contemplative is being drowned out by jingle bells and ho ho ho . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what is the meaning of christmas ?
the meaning of christmas is , in the first place , not shopping , " said reverend volker faigle , a lutheran pastor and representative of the protestant church to the german government and the eu . he said the protestant church also did not hold any particular grudge against santa , or the gift-giving he represents .
it is just a matter of keeping what many see as the excesses of the christmas season in check . " our shopping centers want to make money and they have a right to make money , we have no problem with that , " he said .
" but if you already start the season in september , people think christmas is just about shopping , shopping , shopping .
then we think christmas is misused . " the protestant church has started a program called " christmas in december , " selling things such as advent calendars without the chocolates and cartoon figures .
church representatives even approached german retailers and marketers asking them to keep the christmas overkill in check . crucial for sales but according to the german retailing association , christmas is a critical time for retailers : what some see as santa surfeit , shop owners see as a lifeline . from the looks of shops in berlin , retailers have not held back when it comes to promoting santa and gift-giving .
that is perhaps understandable , since according to the hde retailers ' association , about 20 percent of annual sales are made in the last two months of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas shoppers " we did n't have a good year in 2004 , but in december the mood has picked up , " said hubertus pellengahr , hde 's spokesman .
" presents are being bought , people have finally found a little joy in buying again . " but talking to shoppers in front of one of berlin 's premier department stores , kadewe , it appears some holiday fatigue might be setting in . " there are many good things that comes over from america , but this kitsch christmas style is getting the upper hand , " said hella wichman , 55 , who was visiting berlin from hamburg and doing a little window shopping . " there 's too much of everything , too many lights , too much money spent , too much santa , " she said .
" there is nothing thoughtful about christmas anymore . " but jolly old santa himself , talking to children amid glittering ornaments on kadewe 's fifth floor , finds the groups who would like to lower his profile somewhat alarmist .
he said there 's room for both him and his predecessor st. nicholas during the yuletide season . " santa brings joy , and children grow up so fast anyway , " he said .

they feel the time of the year that should encourage people to be thoughtful and contemplative is being drowned out by jingle bells and ho ho ho . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what is the meaning of christmas ?
the meaning of christmas is , in the first place , not shopping , " said reverend volker faigle , a lutheran pastor and representative of the protestant church to the german government and the eu . he said the protestant church also did not hold any particular grudge against santa , or the gift-giving he represents .
it is just a matter of keeping what many see as the excesses of the christmas season in check . " our shopping centers want to make money and they have a right to make money , we have no problem with that , " he said .
" but if you already start the season in september , people think christmas is just about shopping , shopping , shopping .
then we think christmas is misused . " the protestant church has started a program called " christmas in december , " selling things such as advent calendars without the chocolates and cartoon figures .
church representatives even approached german retailers and marketers asking them to keep the christmas overkill in check . crucial for sales but according to the german retailing association , christmas is a critical time for retailers : what some see as santa surfeit , shop owners see as a lifeline . from the looks of shops in berlin , retailers have not held back when it comes to promoting santa and gift-giving .
that is perhaps understandable , since according to the hde retailers ' association , about 20 percent of annual sales are made in the last two months of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas shoppers " we did n't have a good year in 2004 , but in december the mood has picked up , " said hubertus pellengahr , hde 's spokesman .

" but talking to shoppers in front of one of berlin 's premier department stores , kadewe , it appears some holiday fatigue might be setting in . " there are many good things that comes over from america , but this kitsch christmas style is getting the upper hand , " said hella wichman , 55 , who was visiting berlin from hamburg and doing a little window shopping . " there 's too much of everything , too many lights , too much money spent , too much santa , " she said .
" there is nothing thoughtful about christmas anymore . " but jolly old santa himself , talking to children amid glittering ornaments on kadewe 's fifth floor , finds the groups who would like to lower his profile somewhat alarmist .
he said there 's room for both him and his predecessor st. nicholas during the yuletide season . " santa brings joy , and children grow up so fast anyway , " he said .

nevertheless , technology is improving rapidly in germany despite a very small budget . just when it looked like doping controllers were slowly catching up to the much fitter athletes , a huge hurdle got in their way .
the story broke in september 2003 when the balco laboratory was raided by united states criminal investigators .
this came after a tip-off to the united states anti-doping agency -lrb- usada -rrb- from a leading track coach . thg , a designer steroid , was the super drug and anti-doping agencies around the world had to scramble to try and preserve an already tarnished sports image .
despite thg and the increase of doping cases in germany — an increase from 50 in 2003 to 80 in 2004 — roland augustin , head of germany 's national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- , said that analysis has improved on all levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costas kenteris - gold in sydney with steroids ?
athletes who thought they could skirt around drugs tests by discontinuing usage shortly before screenings were caught unawares .
augustin said he was nevertheless surprised by the patent use of steroids and the investigations from the athens games .
the most spectacular case was the fall of costas kenteris , the greek 200 meters gold medal winner at the sydney olympics . german athletes feel discriminated drugs tests are not conducted with the same frequency and the same thoroughness around the world .
germany 's athletes complain that they are tested too often .
augustin did not refute that . " internationally speaking , there are clearly shortfalls in drug testing , " he said .
in some countries there is no functioning control system , particularly when it concerns testing outside of international competitions . to address the difficulties present in countries where testing is not so thorough , investigators from abroad could be sent in .
but augustin pointed out that there are two large hurdles . firstly , visas must be issued and that often happens with great delay so that an athlete could be warned , he said .
secondly , even if samples are taken , the probes sometimes ca n't be taken out of the country or are held up in customs and are then unusable . budgets too small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balco founder victor conte was behind thg designer steroid the battle against doping is particularly difficult in the entire arab and asia regions , where such countries as iran , vietnam and also china head the list for drug use .
but belarus and ukraine are also among some of the top offenders . investigators are the first to admit that if the international sports community hopes to address the issue of doping effectively , it 's going to need financial backing .
nada has a measly € 1.2 million -lrb- $ 1.6 million -rrb- budget . the state provides just 13 percent of that backing , while allotting € 2 million each year for sport sponsoring . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germany 's doping legacy returns german athletics coach thomas springstein has been sacked by his club and faces criminal charges after an investigation found banned substances at his home .

the target of their ire is santa , an american import who they say does n't represent what the holiday is all about . bettina schade says she does n't have anything personal against santa claus .
in fact , she likes a lot of things about today 's celebrations of christmas - the lighted trees , the gold ornaments , the silver stars .
but all the material things , the hectic rush to buy gifts , and the ubiquity of the bearded man in the red suit are taking away from the core meaning of christmas .
she 'd like to see things changed , or at least toned down a little .
" the christian origins of christmas , like the birth of jesus , have receded into the background , " she said .
" it 's becoming more and more a festival that is reduced to simply worldly gifts and to commerce . " she is part of a campaign called the frankfurter nicholas initiative , founded by a roman catholic priest in frankfurt , eckhard bieger .
alarmed by the growing commercialization of christmas in germany , he launched the initiative that 's aimed at putting st. nicholas , a fourth-century monk , back in the christmas spotlight where he used to be . it 's an uphill battle , however , since st. nicholas ' successor , the american-inspired jolly old st. nick , or santa claus , has been edging the miter-wearing historical figure out of the german christmas landscape of late .
german kids do set out their shoes on dec .
6 for st. nicholas to fill them with sweets , but that holiday now pales in comparison with santa 's sleigh-ride night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate santa dressed up at st. nicholas to counter this trend , the frankfurt initiative along with another catholic organization , the bonifatiuswerk , has launched pro-nicholas campaign .
they show kids how to turn chocolate santas into chocolate nicholas figures and have been handing out stickers in stores and at christmas markets featuring a bar cutting across an image of kriss kringle .
it proclaims the area a " santa-free zone . " " santa claus is a creation of the advertising industry and coca-cola to further commercial interests , " bieger told reuters . santa 's origins the image of santa most known today - fat , white bearded and in a red suit - is indeed a creation of the coca-cola company , which was looking for a new figure to use in its advertising campaigns in the 1930s and 1940s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa claus , inspired by coke a swedish-american artist , haddon sundblom , created the jolly , benevolent character for coke based on a previous figure created for harper 's weekly in the 19th century by thomas nast , a german immigrant to the united states . for the small but vocal anti-santa movement , which has also gained momentum in austria , santa claus is a poor reflection of the original st. nicholas , who is believed to have been a fourth-century bishop in myra , in present-day turkey .
he had a reputation for generosity and kindness , which gave rise to legends of miracles that he performed for the poor and unhappy . " st. nicholas was a man who helped the poor , saved people who were unjustly condemned , freed prisoners , " schade said .
" you could say he was a forerunner of amnesty international .

christian democratic union leader angela merkel is reportedly considering replacing the party 's secretary general , who 's come under fire for accepting money from utility giant rwe . before laurenz meyer was appointed as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- secretary general in the year 2000 , he worked as a manager for rwe , one of germany 's major energy producers and water management enterprises .
following a string of investigative reports last week , meyer was forced to admit that he received some € 40,000 -lrb- $ 53,000 -rrb- from rwe in 2000 while already occupying the post of cdu secretary general . the 56-year-old jack of all trades brushed aside all criticism on friday , saying that he was entitled to those payments for his efforts to achieve a smooth handover of affairs at managerial level before he took up the post as the cdu chief 's mouthpiece .
but according to der spiegel newsmagazine , meyer enjoyed an additional financial bonus from rwe at a later stage of some € 66,000 to sweeten his already decent salary as a federal parliamentarian and cdu secretary general .
moreover , laurenz meyer has said there was anything wrong in his getting rwe electricity and gas supplies in his home at a much reduced rate , while the bulk of the population has to put up with price hikes in this sector almost every year . closing ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe utility company headquarters in essen meyer himself has promised to reveal as soon as possible exactly what payments he 's received from rwe but insists that the whole affair is nothing but a huge misunderstanding .
various newspapers wrote on monday that it would be a big surprise if meyer were to survive this week as cdu secretary general .
hardly anyone in his party has put in a good word for him in recent days : they 're worried that the former rwe manager 's behavior may be damaging to their chances in regional elections in meyer 's home state of north-rhine westphalia in 2005 . " i think it 's absolutely right that cdu chief angela merkel has decided to investigate the matter fully , " christian wulff , cdu premier of lower saxony , said over the weekend .
" when all the details are out of the bag , she 'll analyze them in a non-partisan way and draw the right conclusion .
i do n't think there 's anyone in our party who wants her to sweep the matter under the carpet . " even the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- seem to be concerned about the implications of the scandal . " the meyer affair is something that all mainstream parties in this country should be worried about , " meyer 's spd counterpart , klaus-uwe benneter benneter said .
" we simply ca n't afford to fuel voter disenchantment any further - we 've had enough of that already in the past few years .
angela merkel would be well-advised to look into the matter speedily and not run away from what i agree is an unpleasant task for her . " merkel probed , too apparently alerted to the possibilities of another - possibly more damaging scandal - the " meyer affair " has led the cdu to examine party chief merkel 's income , according to the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . merkel was the first cdu head paid a salary from the party treasury , as past leaders either earned above average incomes as germany 's chancellor or as head of the cdu parliamentary group .
from april 2000 to late sept .
2002 , when she was finally elected head of the parliamentary group , merkel received € 10,000 per month from party coffers - payments that continued for several afterwards , the paper wrote quoting " cdu politicians well acquainted with the finances . " if laurenz meyer is forced to step down from his post as secretary general , the opposition conservatives would face yet another untimely reshuffle following the recent resignation of parliamentary finance spokesman friedrich merz and the resignation of health expert horst seehofer over irreconcilable differences regarding the country 's social and economic reform endeavors . the conservatives thus stand to lose important expertise in two regional elections next year and gamble their good starting position for the 2006 general election . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de decision time for germany 's " iron lady " opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .

christian democratic union leader angela merkel is reportedly considering replacing the party 's secretary general , who 's come under fire for accepting money from utility giant rwe . before laurenz meyer was appointed as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- secretary general in the year 2000 , he worked as a manager for rwe , one of germany 's major energy producers and water management enterprises .
following a string of investigative reports last week , meyer was forced to admit that he received some € 40,000 -lrb- $ 53,000 -rrb- from rwe in 2000 while already occupying the post of cdu secretary general . the 56-year-old jack of all trades brushed aside all criticism on friday , saying that he was entitled to those payments for his efforts to achieve a smooth handover of affairs at managerial level before he took up the post as the cdu chief 's mouthpiece .
but according to der spiegel newsmagazine , meyer enjoyed an additional financial bonus from rwe at a later stage of some € 66,000 to sweeten his already decent salary as a federal parliamentarian and cdu secretary general .
moreover , laurenz meyer has said there was anything wrong in his getting rwe electricity and gas supplies in his home at a much reduced rate , while the bulk of the population has to put up with price hikes in this sector almost every year . closing ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe utility company headquarters in essen meyer himself has promised to reveal as soon as possible exactly what payments he 's received from rwe but insists that the whole affair is nothing but a huge misunderstanding .
various newspapers wrote on monday that it would be a big surprise if meyer were to survive this week as cdu secretary general .
hardly anyone in his party has put in a good word for him in recent days : they 're worried that the former rwe manager 's behavior may be damaging to their chances in regional elections in meyer 's home state of north-rhine westphalia in 2005 . " i think it 's absolutely right that cdu chief angela merkel has decided to investigate the matter fully , " christian wulff , cdu premier of lower saxony , said over the weekend .
" when all the details are out of the bag , she 'll analyze them in a non-partisan way and draw the right conclusion .
i do n't think there 's anyone in our party who wants her to sweep the matter under the carpet . " even the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- seem to be concerned about the implications of the scandal . " the meyer affair is something that all mainstream parties in this country should be worried about , " meyer 's spd counterpart , klaus-uwe benneter benneter said .
" we simply ca n't afford to fuel voter disenchantment any further - we 've had enough of that already in the past few years .
angela merkel would be well-advised to look into the matter speedily and not run away from what i agree is an unpleasant task for her . " merkel probed , too apparently alerted to the possibilities of another - possibly more damaging scandal - the " meyer affair " has led the cdu to examine party chief merkel 's income , according to the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . merkel was the first cdu head paid a salary from the party treasury , as past leaders either earned above average incomes as germany 's chancellor or as head of the cdu parliamentary group .
from april 2000 to late sept .
2002 , when she was finally elected head of the parliamentary group , merkel received € 10,000 per month from party coffers - payments that continued for several afterwards , the paper wrote quoting " cdu politicians well acquainted with the finances . " if laurenz meyer is forced to step down from his post as secretary general , the opposition conservatives would face yet another untimely reshuffle following the recent resignation of parliamentary finance spokesman friedrich merz and the resignation of health expert horst seehofer over irreconcilable differences regarding the country 's social and economic reform endeavors . the conservatives thus stand to lose important expertise in two regional elections next year and gamble their good starting position for the 2006 general election . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de decision time for germany 's " iron lady " opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .

the target of their ire is santa , an american import who they say does n't represent what the holiday is all about . bettina schade says she does n't have anything personal against santa claus .
in fact , she likes a lot of things about today 's celebrations of christmas - the lighted trees , the gold ornaments , the silver stars .
but all the material things , the hectic rush to buy gifts , and the ubiquity of the bearded man in the red suit are taking away from the core meaning of christmas .
she 'd like to see things changed , or at least toned down a little .
" the christian origins of christmas , like the birth of jesus , have receded into the background , " she said .
" it 's becoming more and more a festival that is reduced to simply worldly gifts and to commerce . " she is part of a campaign called the frankfurter nicholas initiative , founded by a roman catholic priest in frankfurt , eckhard bieger .
alarmed by the growing commercialization of christmas in germany , he launched the initiative that 's aimed at putting st. nicholas , a fourth-century monk , back in the christmas spotlight where he used to be . it 's an uphill battle , however , since st. nicholas ' successor , the american-inspired jolly old st. nick , or santa claus , has been edging the miter-wearing historical figure out of the german christmas landscape of late .
german kids do set out their shoes on dec .
6 for st. nicholas to fill them with sweets , but that holiday now pales in comparison with santa 's sleigh-ride night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate santa dressed up at st. nicholas to counter this trend , the frankfurt initiative along with another catholic organization , the bonifatiuswerk , has launched pro-nicholas campaign .
they show kids how to turn chocolate santas into chocolate nicholas figures and have been handing out stickers in stores and at christmas markets featuring a bar cutting across an image of kriss kringle .
it proclaims the area a " santa-free zone . " " santa claus is a creation of the advertising industry and coca-cola to further commercial interests , " bieger told reuters . santa 's origins the image of santa most known today - fat , white bearded and in a red suit - is indeed a creation of the coca-cola company , which was looking for a new figure to use in its advertising campaigns in the 1930s and 1940s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa claus , inspired by coke a swedish-american artist , haddon sundblom , created the jolly , benevolent character for coke based on a previous figure created for harper 's weekly in the 19th century by thomas nast , a german immigrant to the united states . for the small but vocal anti-santa movement , which has also gained momentum in austria , santa claus is a poor reflection of the original st. nicholas , who is believed to have been a fourth-century bishop in myra , in present-day turkey .
he had a reputation for generosity and kindness , which gave rise to legends of miracles that he performed for the poor and unhappy . " st. nicholas was a man who helped the poor , saved people who were unjustly condemned , freed prisoners , " schade said .
" you could say he was a forerunner of amnesty international .
santa is much less than that - just about giving gifts .

the target of their ire is santa , an american import who they say does n't represent what the holiday is all about . bettina schade says she does n't have anything personal against santa claus .
in fact , she likes a lot of things about today 's celebrations of christmas - the lighted trees , the gold ornaments , the silver stars .
but all the material things , the hectic rush to buy gifts , and the ubiquity of the bearded man in the red suit are taking away from the core meaning of christmas .
she 'd like to see things changed , or at least toned down a little .
" the christian origins of christmas , like the birth of jesus , have receded into the background , " she said .
" it 's becoming more and more a festival that is reduced to simply worldly gifts and to commerce . " she is part of a campaign called the frankfurter nicholas initiative , founded by a roman catholic priest in frankfurt , eckhard bieger .
alarmed by the growing commercialization of christmas in germany , he launched the initiative that 's aimed at putting st. nicholas , a fourth-century monk , back in the christmas spotlight where he used to be . it 's an uphill battle , however , since st. nicholas ' successor , the american-inspired jolly old st. nick , or santa claus , has been edging the miter-wearing historical figure out of the german christmas landscape of late .
german kids do set out their shoes on dec .
6 for st. nicholas to fill them with sweets , but that holiday now pales in comparison with santa 's sleigh-ride night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate santa dressed up at st. nicholas to counter this trend , the frankfurt initiative along with another catholic organization , the bonifatiuswerk , has launched pro-nicholas campaign .
they show kids how to turn chocolate santas into chocolate nicholas figures and have been handing out stickers in stores and at christmas markets featuring a bar cutting across an image of kriss kringle .
it proclaims the area a " santa-free zone . " " santa claus is a creation of the advertising industry and coca-cola to further commercial interests , " bieger told reuters . santa 's origins the image of santa most known today - fat , white bearded and in a red suit - is indeed a creation of the coca-cola company , which was looking for a new figure to use in its advertising campaigns in the 1930s and 1940s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa claus , inspired by coke a swedish-american artist , haddon sundblom , created the jolly , benevolent character for coke based on a previous figure created for harper 's weekly in the 19th century by thomas nast , a german immigrant to the united states . for the small but vocal anti-santa movement , which has also gained momentum in austria , santa claus is a poor reflection of the original st. nicholas , who is believed to have been a fourth-century bishop in myra , in present-day turkey .
he had a reputation for generosity and kindness , which gave rise to legends of miracles that he performed for the poor and unhappy . " st. nicholas was a man who helped the poor , saved people who were unjustly condemned , freed prisoners , " schade said .
" you could say he was a forerunner of amnesty international .
santa is much less than that - just about giving gifts .

christian democratic union leader angela merkel is reportedly considering replacing the party 's secretary general , who 's come under fire for accepting money from utility giant rwe . before laurenz meyer was appointed as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- secretary general in the year 2000 , he worked as a manager for rwe , one of germany 's major energy producers and water management enterprises .
following a string of investigative reports last week , meyer was forced to admit that he received some € 40,000 -lrb- $ 53,000 -rrb- from rwe in 2000 while already occupying the post of cdu secretary general . the 56-year-old jack of all trades brushed aside all criticism on friday , saying that he was entitled to those payments for his efforts to achieve a smooth handover of affairs at managerial level before he took up the post as the cdu chief 's mouthpiece .
but according to der spiegel newsmagazine , meyer enjoyed an additional financial bonus from rwe at a later stage of some € 66,000 to sweeten his already decent salary as a federal parliamentarian and cdu secretary general .
moreover , laurenz meyer has said there was anything wrong in his getting rwe electricity and gas supplies in his home at a much reduced rate , while the bulk of the population has to put up with price hikes in this sector almost every year . closing ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe utility company headquarters in essen meyer himself has promised to reveal as soon as possible exactly what payments he 's received from rwe but insists that the whole affair is nothing but a huge misunderstanding .
various newspapers wrote on monday that it would be a big surprise if meyer were to survive this week as cdu secretary general .
hardly anyone in his party has put in a good word for him in recent days : they 're worried that the former rwe manager 's behavior may be damaging to their chances in regional elections in meyer 's home state of north-rhine westphalia in 2005 . " i think it 's absolutely right that cdu chief angela merkel has decided to investigate the matter fully , " christian wulff , cdu premier of lower saxony , said over the weekend .
" when all the details are out of the bag , she 'll analyze them in a non-partisan way and draw the right conclusion .
i do n't think there 's anyone in our party who wants her to sweep the matter under the carpet . " even the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- seem to be concerned about the implications of the scandal . " the meyer affair is something that all mainstream parties in this country should be worried about , " meyer 's spd counterpart , klaus-uwe benneter benneter said .
" we simply ca n't afford to fuel voter disenchantment any further - we 've had enough of that already in the past few years .
angela merkel would be well-advised to look into the matter speedily and not run away from what i agree is an unpleasant task for her . " merkel probed , too apparently alerted to the possibilities of another - possibly more damaging scandal - the " meyer affair " has led the cdu to examine party chief merkel 's income , according to the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . merkel was the first cdu head paid a salary from the party treasury , as past leaders either earned above average incomes as germany 's chancellor or as head of the cdu parliamentary group .
from april 2000 to late sept .
2002 , when she was finally elected head of the parliamentary group , merkel received € 10,000 per month from party coffers - payments that continued for several afterwards , the paper wrote quoting " cdu politicians well acquainted with the finances . " if laurenz meyer is forced to step down from his post as secretary general , the opposition conservatives would face yet another untimely reshuffle following the recent resignation of parliamentary finance spokesman friedrich merz and the resignation of health expert horst seehofer over irreconcilable differences regarding the country 's social and economic reform endeavors . the conservatives thus stand to lose important expertise in two regional elections next year and gamble their good starting position for the 2006 general election . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de decision time for germany 's " iron lady " opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .

christian democratic union leader angela merkel is reportedly considering replacing the party 's secretary general , who 's come under fire for accepting money from utility giant rwe . before laurenz meyer was appointed as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- secretary general in the year 2000 , he worked as a manager for rwe , one of germany 's major energy producers and water management enterprises .
following a string of investigative reports last week , meyer was forced to admit that he received some € 40,000 -lrb- $ 53,000 -rrb- from rwe in 2000 while already occupying the post of cdu secretary general . the 56-year-old jack of all trades brushed aside all criticism on friday , saying that he was entitled to those payments for his efforts to achieve a smooth handover of affairs at managerial level before he took up the post as the cdu chief 's mouthpiece .
but according to der spiegel newsmagazine , meyer enjoyed an additional financial bonus from rwe at a later stage of some € 66,000 to sweeten his already decent salary as a federal parliamentarian and cdu secretary general .
moreover , laurenz meyer has said there was anything wrong in his getting rwe electricity and gas supplies in his home at a much reduced rate , while the bulk of the population has to put up with price hikes in this sector almost every year . closing ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe utility company headquarters in essen meyer himself has promised to reveal as soon as possible exactly what payments he 's received from rwe but insists that the whole affair is nothing but a huge misunderstanding .
various newspapers wrote on monday that it would be a big surprise if meyer were to survive this week as cdu secretary general .
hardly anyone in his party has put in a good word for him in recent days : they 're worried that the former rwe manager 's behavior may be damaging to their chances in regional elections in meyer 's home state of north-rhine westphalia in 2005 . " i think it 's absolutely right that cdu chief angela merkel has decided to investigate the matter fully , " christian wulff , cdu premier of lower saxony , said over the weekend .
" when all the details are out of the bag , she 'll analyze them in a non-partisan way and draw the right conclusion .
i do n't think there 's anyone in our party who wants her to sweep the matter under the carpet . " even the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- seem to be concerned about the implications of the scandal . " the meyer affair is something that all mainstream parties in this country should be worried about , " meyer 's spd counterpart , klaus-uwe benneter benneter said .
" we simply ca n't afford to fuel voter disenchantment any further - we 've had enough of that already in the past few years .
angela merkel would be well-advised to look into the matter speedily and not run away from what i agree is an unpleasant task for her . " merkel probed , too apparently alerted to the possibilities of another - possibly more damaging scandal - the " meyer affair " has led the cdu to examine party chief merkel 's income , according to the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . merkel was the first cdu head paid a salary from the party treasury , as past leaders either earned above average incomes as germany 's chancellor or as head of the cdu parliamentary group .

nevertheless , technology is improving rapidly in germany despite a very small budget . just when it looked like doping controllers were slowly catching up to the much fitter athletes , a huge hurdle got in their way .
the story broke in september 2003 when the balco laboratory was raided by united states criminal investigators .
this came after a tip-off to the united states anti-doping agency -lrb- usada -rrb- from a leading track coach . thg , a designer steroid , was the super drug and anti-doping agencies around the world had to scramble to try and preserve an already tarnished sports image .

in some countries there is no functioning control system , particularly when it concerns testing outside of international competitions . to address the difficulties present in countries where testing is not so thorough , investigators from abroad could be sent in .
but augustin pointed out that there are two large hurdles . firstly , visas must be issued and that often happens with great delay so that an athlete could be warned , he said .
secondly , even if samples are taken , the probes sometimes ca n't be taken out of the country or are held up in customs and are then unusable . budgets too small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balco founder victor conte was behind thg designer steroid the battle against doping is particularly difficult in the entire arab and asia regions , where such countries as iran , vietnam and also china head the list for drug use .
but belarus and ukraine are also among some of the top offenders . investigators are the first to admit that if the international sports community hopes to address the issue of doping effectively , it 's going to need financial backing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.12.2004 conservatives face kickback scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meyer and merkel : can the cdu stomach more personnel losses ?
christian democratic union leader angela merkel is reportedly considering replacing the party 's secretary general , who 's come under fire for accepting money from utility giant rwe . before laurenz meyer was appointed as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- secretary general in the year 2000 , he worked as a manager for rwe , one of germany 's major energy producers and water management enterprises .
following a string of investigative reports last week , meyer was forced to admit that he received some € 40,000 -lrb- $ 53,000 -rrb- from rwe in 2000 while already occupying the post of cdu secretary general . the 56-year-old jack of all trades brushed aside all criticism on friday , saying that he was entitled to those payments for his efforts to achieve a smooth handover of affairs at managerial level before he took up the post as the cdu chief 's mouthpiece .
but according to der spiegel newsmagazine , meyer enjoyed an additional financial bonus from rwe at a later stage of some € 66,000 to sweeten his already decent salary as a federal parliamentarian and cdu secretary general .
moreover , laurenz meyer has said there was anything wrong in his getting rwe electricity and gas supplies in his home at a much reduced rate , while the bulk of the population has to put up with price hikes in this sector almost every year . closing ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe utility company headquarters in essen meyer himself has promised to reveal as soon as possible exactly what payments he 's received from rwe but insists that the whole affair is nothing but a huge misunderstanding .
various newspapers wrote on monday that it would be a big surprise if meyer were to survive this week as cdu secretary general .
hardly anyone in his party has put in a good word for him in recent days : they 're worried that the former rwe manager 's behavior may be damaging to their chances in regional elections in meyer 's home state of north-rhine westphalia in 2005 . " i think it 's absolutely right that cdu chief angela merkel has decided to investigate the matter fully , " christian wulff , cdu premier of lower saxony , said over the weekend .
" when all the details are out of the bag , she 'll analyze them in a non-partisan way and draw the right conclusion .
i do n't think there 's anyone in our party who wants her to sweep the matter under the carpet . " even the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- seem to be concerned about the implications of the scandal . " the meyer affair is something that all mainstream parties in this country should be worried about , " meyer 's spd counterpart , klaus-uwe benneter benneter said .
" we simply ca n't afford to fuel voter disenchantment any further - we 've had enough of that already in the past few years .
angela merkel would be well-advised to look into the matter speedily and not run away from what i agree is an unpleasant task for her .

christian democratic union leader angela merkel is reportedly considering replacing the party 's secretary general , who 's come under fire for accepting money from utility giant rwe . before laurenz meyer was appointed as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- secretary general in the year 2000 , he worked as a manager for rwe , one of germany 's major energy producers and water management enterprises .
following a string of investigative reports last week , meyer was forced to admit that he received some € 40,000 -lrb- $ 53,000 -rrb- from rwe in 2000 while already occupying the post of cdu secretary general . the 56-year-old jack of all trades brushed aside all criticism on friday , saying that he was entitled to those payments for his efforts to achieve a smooth handover of affairs at managerial level before he took up the post as the cdu chief 's mouthpiece .
but according to der spiegel newsmagazine , meyer enjoyed an additional financial bonus from rwe at a later stage of some € 66,000 to sweeten his already decent salary as a federal parliamentarian and cdu secretary general .
moreover , laurenz meyer has said there was anything wrong in his getting rwe electricity and gas supplies in his home at a much reduced rate , while the bulk of the population has to put up with price hikes in this sector almost every year . closing ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe utility company headquarters in essen meyer himself has promised to reveal as soon as possible exactly what payments he 's received from rwe but insists that the whole affair is nothing but a huge misunderstanding .
various newspapers wrote on monday that it would be a big surprise if meyer were to survive this week as cdu secretary general .
hardly anyone in his party has put in a good word for him in recent days : they 're worried that the former rwe manager 's behavior may be damaging to their chances in regional elections in meyer 's home state of north-rhine westphalia in 2005 . " i think it 's absolutely right that cdu chief angela merkel has decided to investigate the matter fully , " christian wulff , cdu premier of lower saxony , said over the weekend .
" when all the details are out of the bag , she 'll analyze them in a non-partisan way and draw the right conclusion .
i do n't think there 's anyone in our party who wants her to sweep the matter under the carpet . " even the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- seem to be concerned about the implications of the scandal . " the meyer affair is something that all mainstream parties in this country should be worried about , " meyer 's spd counterpart , klaus-uwe benneter benneter said .
" we simply ca n't afford to fuel voter disenchantment any further - we 've had enough of that already in the past few years .
angela merkel would be well-advised to look into the matter speedily and not run away from what i agree is an unpleasant task for her .

christian democratic union leader angela merkel is reportedly considering replacing the party 's secretary general , who 's come under fire for accepting money from utility giant rwe . before laurenz meyer was appointed as christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- secretary general in the year 2000 , he worked as a manager for rwe , one of germany 's major energy producers and water management enterprises .
following a string of investigative reports last week , meyer was forced to admit that he received some € 40,000 -lrb- $ 53,000 -rrb- from rwe in 2000 while already occupying the post of cdu secretary general . the 56-year-old jack of all trades brushed aside all criticism on friday , saying that he was entitled to those payments for his efforts to achieve a smooth handover of affairs at managerial level before he took up the post as the cdu chief 's mouthpiece .
but according to der spiegel newsmagazine , meyer enjoyed an additional financial bonus from rwe at a later stage of some € 66,000 to sweeten his already decent salary as a federal parliamentarian and cdu secretary general .
moreover , laurenz meyer has said there was anything wrong in his getting rwe electricity and gas supplies in his home at a much reduced rate , while the bulk of the population has to put up with price hikes in this sector almost every year . closing ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe utility company headquarters in essen meyer himself has promised to reveal as soon as possible exactly what payments he 's received from rwe but insists that the whole affair is nothing but a huge misunderstanding .
various newspapers wrote on monday that it would be a big surprise if meyer were to survive this week as cdu secretary general .
hardly anyone in his party has put in a good word for him in recent days : they 're worried that the former rwe manager 's behavior may be damaging to their chances in regional elections in meyer 's home state of north-rhine westphalia in 2005 . " i think it 's absolutely right that cdu chief angela merkel has decided to investigate the matter fully , " christian wulff , cdu premier of lower saxony , said over the weekend .
" when all the details are out of the bag , she 'll analyze them in a non-partisan way and draw the right conclusion .
i do n't think there 's anyone in our party who wants her to sweep the matter under the carpet . " even the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- seem to be concerned about the implications of the scandal . " the meyer affair is something that all mainstream parties in this country should be worried about , " meyer 's spd counterpart , klaus-uwe benneter benneter said .
" we simply ca n't afford to fuel voter disenchantment any further - we 've had enough of that already in the past few years .
angela merkel would be well-advised to look into the matter speedily and not run away from what i agree is an unpleasant task for her . " merkel probed , too apparently alerted to the possibilities of another - possibly more damaging scandal - the " meyer affair " has led the cdu to examine party chief merkel 's income , according to the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . merkel was the first cdu head paid a salary from the party treasury , as past leaders either earned above average incomes as germany 's chancellor or as head of the cdu parliamentary group .

2002 , when she was finally elected head of the parliamentary group , merkel received € 10,000 per month from party coffers - payments that continued for several afterwards , the paper wrote quoting " cdu politicians well acquainted with the finances .

" when all the details are out of the bag , she 'll analyze them in a non-partisan way and draw the right conclusion .
i do n't think there 's anyone in our party who wants her to sweep the matter under the carpet . " even the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- seem to be concerned about the implications of the scandal . " the meyer affair is something that all mainstream parties in this country should be worried about , " meyer 's spd counterpart , klaus-uwe benneter benneter said .
" we simply ca n't afford to fuel voter disenchantment any further - we 've had enough of that already in the past few years .
angela merkel would be well-advised to look into the matter speedily and not run away from what i agree is an unpleasant task for her . " merkel probed , too apparently alerted to the possibilities of another - possibly more damaging scandal - the " meyer affair " has led the cdu to examine party chief merkel 's income , according to the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . merkel was the first cdu head paid a salary from the party treasury , as past leaders either earned above average incomes as germany 's chancellor or as head of the cdu parliamentary group .
from april 2000 to late sept .
2002 , when she was finally elected head of the parliamentary group , merkel received € 10,000 per month from party coffers - payments that continued for several afterwards , the paper wrote quoting " cdu politicians well acquainted with the finances . " if laurenz meyer is forced to step down from his post as secretary general , the opposition conservatives would face yet another untimely reshuffle following the recent resignation of parliamentary finance spokesman friedrich merz and the resignation of health expert horst seehofer over irreconcilable differences regarding the country 's social and economic reform endeavors . the conservatives thus stand to lose important expertise in two regional elections next year and gamble their good starting position for the 2006 general election . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de decision time for germany 's " iron lady " opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .

two months ago , german immigration authorities finally deported the islamic figurehead from the country back to his native turkey — a country he had left over two decades ago .
the charges there are high treason .
turkey is accusing him of plotting to depose the country 's leaders and it was supposed to happen in dramatic fashion . in 1998 , kaplan supposedly masterminded a plot to have a small aircraft packed with explosives flown into the mausoleum where mustafa kemal ataturk , the country 's secular founder , lies in state , as turkish leaders were attending a memorial .
in addition , the prosecution claims that followers of kaplan would raise flags of the " caliphate " over mosques in istanbul . kaplan denies the charges , something his attorney stressed before the trial . " there is no doubt that kaplan has adopted positions against turkey in his speeches and writing , but he has never used violence , " said defense lawyer husnu tuna . thorn in the side of the german justice system during his 20 years of asylum in germany , kaplan and his father , cameleddin kaplan , had been under the watchful eye of the german police .
metin kaplan took over the leadership of the " caliphate , " from his father in 1995 , who was nicknamed the " khomeini of cologne . " later his rival for leadership , ibrahim sofu , was shot dead in berlin in 1997 as he lay in bed between his wife and newborn baby .

when they finally succeeded in october , schily said kaplan 's deportation was a " symbol for a democracy able to defend itself .

in october , the iwh institute in halle had predicted the german economy would grow 1.8 percent in 2005 in a forecast in september .
but economists have revised that number down to 1.3 percent , partly due to fact that the euro 's 10 percent rise in value against the dollar in the last six months is making exports , a key driver of the german economy , more expensive abroad just as global economic growth is slowing .
in addition , unemployment in germany has hit a six-year high which is putting a damper on consumer spending .
udo ludwig , chief economist at the iwh institute , said in an interview that consumer spending should start picking up in the second half of next year .
iwh is the third of six institutes for lower its growth forecasts this month . dw-world.de gloom deepens over german economy the german economy is recovering , but the modest upturn will lose momentum as early as next year as a result of surging oil prices and a slowdown in exports , leading economic research institutes said tuesday .

nevertheless , technology is improving rapidly in germany despite a very small budget . just when it looked like doping controllers were slowly catching up to the much fitter athletes , a huge hurdle got in their way .
the story broke in september 2003 when the balco laboratory was raided by united states criminal investigators .
this came after a tip-off to the united states anti-doping agency -lrb- usada -rrb- from a leading track coach . thg , a designer steroid , was the super drug and anti-doping agencies around the world had to scramble to try and preserve an already tarnished sports image .
despite thg and the increase of doping cases in germany — an increase from 50 in 2003 to 80 in 2004 — roland augustin , head of germany 's national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- , said that analysis has improved on all levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costas kenteris - gold in sydney with steroids ?
athletes who thought they could skirt around drugs tests by discontinuing usage shortly before screenings were caught unawares .
augustin said he was nevertheless surprised by the patent use of steroids and the investigations from the athens games .
the most spectacular case was the fall of costas kenteris , the greek 200 meters gold medal winner at the sydney olympics . german athletes feel discriminated drugs tests are not conducted with the same frequency and the same thoroughness around the world .
germany 's athletes complain that they are tested too often .
augustin did not refute that . " internationally speaking , there are clearly shortfalls in drug testing , " he said .
in some countries there is no functioning control system , particularly when it concerns testing outside of international competitions . to address the difficulties present in countries where testing is not so thorough , investigators from abroad could be sent in .
but augustin pointed out that there are two large hurdles . firstly , visas must be issued and that often happens with great delay so that an athlete could be warned , he said .
secondly , even if samples are taken , the probes sometimes ca n't be taken out of the country or are held up in customs and are then unusable . budgets too small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balco founder victor conte was behind thg designer steroid the battle against doping is particularly difficult in the entire arab and asia regions , where such countries as iran , vietnam and also china head the list for drug use .
but belarus and ukraine are also among some of the top offenders . investigators are the first to admit that if the international sports community hopes to address the issue of doping effectively , it 's going to need financial backing .
nada has a measly € 1.2 million -lrb- $ 1.6 million -rrb- budget . the state provides just 13 percent of that backing , while allotting € 2 million each year for sport sponsoring . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germany 's doping legacy returns german athletics coach thomas springstein has been sacked by his club and faces criminal charges after an investigation found banned substances at his home .

they feel the time of the year that should encourage people to be thoughtful and contemplative is being drowned out by jingle bells and ho ho ho . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what is the meaning of christmas ?
the meaning of christmas is , in the first place , not shopping , " said reverend volker faigle , a lutheran pastor and representative of the protestant church to the german government and the eu . he said the protestant church also did not hold any particular grudge against santa , or the gift-giving he represents .
it is just a matter of keeping what many see as the excesses of the christmas season in check . " our shopping centers want to make money and they have a right to make money , we have no problem with that , " he said .
" but if you already start the season in september , people think christmas is just about shopping , shopping , shopping .
then we think christmas is misused . " the protestant church has started a program called " christmas in december , " selling things such as advent calendars without the chocolates and cartoon figures .
church representatives even approached german retailers and marketers asking them to keep the christmas overkill in check . crucial for sales but according to the german retailing association , christmas is a critical time for retailers : what some see as santa surfeit , shop owners see as a lifeline . from the looks of shops in berlin , retailers have not held back when it comes to promoting santa and gift-giving .
that is perhaps understandable , since according to the hde retailers ' association , about 20 percent of annual sales are made in the last two months of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas shoppers " we did n't have a good year in 2004 , but in december the mood has picked up , " said hubertus pellengahr , hde 's spokesman .
" presents are being bought , people have finally found a little joy in buying again . " but talking to shoppers in front of one of berlin 's premier department stores , kadewe , it appears some holiday fatigue might be setting in . " there are many good things that comes over from america , but this kitsch christmas style is getting the upper hand , " said hella wichman , 55 , who was visiting berlin from hamburg and doing a little window shopping . " there 's too much of everything , too many lights , too much money spent , too much santa , " she said .
" there is nothing thoughtful about christmas anymore . " but jolly old santa himself , talking to children amid glittering ornaments on kadewe 's fifth floor , finds the groups who would like to lower his profile somewhat alarmist .
he said there 's room for both him and his predecessor st. nicholas during the yuletide season . " santa brings joy , and children grow up so fast anyway , " he said .
" why not let them enjoy his magic for as long as they can ?

the target of their ire is santa , an american import who they say does n't represent what the holiday is all about . bettina schade says she does n't have anything personal against santa claus .
in fact , she likes a lot of things about today 's celebrations of christmas - the lighted trees , the gold ornaments , the silver stars .
but all the material things , the hectic rush to buy gifts , and the ubiquity of the bearded man in the red suit are taking away from the core meaning of christmas .
she 'd like to see things changed , or at least toned down a little .
" the christian origins of christmas , like the birth of jesus , have receded into the background , " she said .
" it 's becoming more and more a festival that is reduced to simply worldly gifts and to commerce . " she is part of a campaign called the frankfurter nicholas initiative , founded by a roman catholic priest in frankfurt , eckhard bieger .
alarmed by the growing commercialization of christmas in germany , he launched the initiative that 's aimed at putting st. nicholas , a fourth-century monk , back in the christmas spotlight where he used to be . it 's an uphill battle , however , since st. nicholas ' successor , the american-inspired jolly old st. nick , or santa claus , has been edging the miter-wearing historical figure out of the german christmas landscape of late .
german kids do set out their shoes on dec .
6 for st. nicholas to fill them with sweets , but that holiday now pales in comparison with santa 's sleigh-ride night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chocolate santa dressed up at st. nicholas to counter this trend , the frankfurt initiative along with another catholic organization , the bonifatiuswerk , has launched pro-nicholas campaign .
they show kids how to turn chocolate santas into chocolate nicholas figures and have been handing out stickers in stores and at christmas markets featuring a bar cutting across an image of kriss kringle .
it proclaims the area a " santa-free zone . " " santa claus is a creation of the advertising industry and coca-cola to further commercial interests , " bieger told reuters . santa 's origins the image of santa most known today - fat , white bearded and in a red suit - is indeed a creation of the coca-cola company , which was looking for a new figure to use in its advertising campaigns in the 1930s and 1940s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa claus , inspired by coke a swedish-american artist , haddon sundblom , created the jolly , benevolent character for coke based on a previous figure created for harper 's weekly in the 19th century by thomas nast , a german immigrant to the united states . for the small but vocal anti-santa movement , which has also gained momentum in austria , santa claus is a poor reflection of the original st. nicholas , who is believed to have been a fourth-century bishop in myra , in present-day turkey .
he had a reputation for generosity and kindness , which gave rise to legends of miracles that he performed for the poor and unhappy . " st. nicholas was a man who helped the poor , saved people who were unjustly condemned , freed prisoners , " schade said .
" you could say he was a forerunner of amnesty international .
santa is much less than that - just about giving gifts .

members of the gmb union have voted to strike on two of the busiest days of the year .
the dispute centres on drivers and conductors having to work beyond 8pm on christmas eve and new year 's eve .
but the union says it wants to maintain a dialogue with operators net and hopes it can avoid the first action scheduled in just four days ' time .
on friday , members of the gmb voted in favour of industrial action - saying it was only fair to wind down services in line with other public transport operators .
net has so far refused to comment on the dispute , saying talks are at a sensitive stage .
a deal which offered improved pay for the extra hours has already been rejected by the workers .

by marie jackson bbc news , london they may well be , but do they really want it written on their ruler ?
no-one , it would appear , is exempt from the tightening reins slowly squeezing the spirit out of giving and receiving gifts .
first , the clintons were pushed into paying for almost half the gifts they kept when leaving the white house .
then prince charles ' household was criticised for the way it handled official gifts .
and now some teachers are having to take special care when accepting christmas presents from their young charges .
while some take home enough chocolate to put willy wonka out of business every christmas , others have found themselves unwrapping a small-boxed meteorite specimen , two plastic bears which appear to be trying to become three , and even a bacon sandwich in the past .
if any teacher receives a present whether it 's a box of chocolates or an apple , they must inform the head teacher westminster council spokeswoman in pictures : pupils ' unusual gifts all are small gifts of little value .
but what should teachers do when they find themselves in the often awkward and embarrassing position of receiving a bottle of lambrini from an eager-to-please seven-year-old or a plane ticket from a hopelessly generous parent ?
three years ago , leicestershire county council ruled teachers should not accept alcohol from pupils .
for london local education authorities the matter is not as clear-cut .
a westminster council spokeswoman said : " if any teacher receives a present whether it 's a box of chocolates or an apple , they must inform the head teacher and it is up to the head .
if the gift is inappropriate , it can be declined .
" if a student or pupil was to give their teacher a bottle of wine that would not be considered appropriate . "
but not all head teachers agree .
' bribe gifts ' gabrielle weber , head teacher of independent woodside park international in north finchley , north london , is happy for her teachers to accept bottles of wine or champagne .
" i do not have a problem with it - it is up to the parents , " she said .
" i do understand that gifts could be seen as a bribe or as a way of getting preferential treatment .
" if i found that one teacher was using it in that way then the rules would change .
every time i opened another victoriana cat in a basket , i had to say ' oh , that 's lovely ' teacher jayne gilbert she said the trend now was for parents to club together to buy teachers more expensive gifts such as a day at a health spa or theatre vouchers .
but what if that expensive gift comes from just one parent ?
tim harrison , london east regional secretary for the national union of teachers -lrb- nut -rrb- , said : " if it was a high value gift we would advise them to explain that they have been advised not to accept it . "
but he disagrees with westminster council .
" teachers should be able to exercise their own discretion and should not be required to automatically inform the teacher , " he said .
many teachers anticipate 30 boxes of chocolates at the end of term gaelle graham , a modern languages teacher for 25 years and who now works for the nut , said there can sometimes be a case for accepting even the most expensive of presents .
she said : " three or four years ago a young teacher from ireland was working in greenwich .
a mum , in passing , said ' are you going home for christmas ?
he said ' i ca n't afford it ' .
" the next day , she came in to school with a plane ticket .
" the teacher felt very uncomfortable so he phoned the local authority , who then phoned the union .
" because he had reported it immediately and we discussed it , in the end it was all above board and the family could afford it , so he went home for christmas .
for most though , a plane ticket is the last thing they will be expecting .
pink presents jayne gilbert , a shoe addict who loves pink , guesses she will be taking home bagfuls of pink things and shoe-related items at the end of term .
" i have been given bottles of wine or champagne in the past , " said ms gilbert , who teaches at meridian school in greenwich , south-east london .
" the parents will bring it in and give it to you .
to be honest , we probably do n't get enough alcohol .
" sometimes the children go to the nearest cheap shop and one year i ended up with six individual victoriana cats in a basket .
" every time i opened another victoriana cat in a basket , i had to say ' oh , that 's lovely ' . "
ms gilbert is not alone .
children 's choices of porcelain puppies and rash-inducing glitter spray has given rise to an entire website .
anti-wrinkle cream cheesy gifts , the brainchild of a primary school teacher from birmingham , celebrates the more unusual choice of gifts from youngsters - from a gyrating stunt pig to a sphinx encapsulated in a golden sandstorm pyramid .
the site has been visited by almost 50,000 people and seems to generate as much criticism for its mocking , tongue in cheek tone as it has fans who see it as a bit of fun and a suitable home for their seasonal collection of the kitsch and the downright tat .
so teachers , well known for their resourcefulness , seem able to get the most out of children and parents ' generosity in whatever form whether plane tickets , a bottle of bubbly or a nodding dog .
but if you are a parent or pupil stuck for ideas this christmas , heed ms gilbert 's advice and leave the anti-wrinkle cream on the chemist 's shelf .

three years ago , leicestershire county council ruled teachers should not accept alcohol from pupils .
for london local education authorities the matter is not as clear-cut .
a westminster council spokeswoman said : " if any teacher receives a present whether it 's a box of chocolates or an apple , they must inform the head teacher and it is up to the head .
if the gift is inappropriate , it can be declined .
" if a student or pupil was to give their teacher a bottle of wine that would not be considered appropriate . "
but not all head teachers agree .
' bribe gifts ' gabrielle weber , head teacher of independent woodside park international in north finchley , north london , is happy for her teachers to accept bottles of wine or champagne .
" i do not have a problem with it - it is up to the parents , " she said .
" i do understand that gifts could be seen as a bribe or as a way of getting preferential treatment .
" if i found that one teacher was using it in that way then the rules would change .
every time i opened another victoriana cat in a basket , i had to say ' oh , that 's lovely ' teacher jayne gilbert she said the trend now was for parents to club together to buy teachers more expensive gifts such as a day at a health spa or theatre vouchers .
but what if that expensive gift comes from just one parent ?
tim harrison , london east regional secretary for the national union of teachers -lrb- nut -rrb- , said : " if it was a high value gift we would advise them to explain that they have been advised not to accept it . "
but he disagrees with westminster council .
" teachers should be able to exercise their own discretion and should not be required to automatically inform the teacher , " he said .
many teachers anticipate 30 boxes of chocolates at the end of term gaelle graham , a modern languages teacher for 25 years and who now works for the nut , said there can sometimes be a case for accepting even the most expensive of presents .
she said : " three or four years ago a young teacher from ireland was working in greenwich .
a mum , in passing , said ' are you going home for christmas ?
he said ' i ca n't afford it ' .
" the next day , she came in to school with a plane ticket .
" the teacher felt very uncomfortable so he phoned the local authority , who then phoned the union .
" because he had reported it immediately and we discussed it , in the end it was all above board and the family could afford it , so he went home for christmas .
for most though , a plane ticket is the last thing they will be expecting .
pink presents jayne gilbert , a shoe addict who loves pink , guesses she will be taking home bagfuls of pink things and shoe-related items at the end of term .
" i have been given bottles of wine or champagne in the past , " said ms gilbert , who teaches at meridian school in greenwich , south-east london .
" the parents will bring it in and give it to you .
to be honest , we probably do n't get enough alcohol .
" sometimes the children go to the nearest cheap shop and one year i ended up with six individual victoriana cats in a basket .
" every time i opened another victoriana cat in a basket , i had to say ' oh , that 's lovely ' . "
ms gilbert is not alone .
children 's choices of porcelain puppies and rash-inducing glitter spray has given rise to an entire website .
anti-wrinkle cream cheesy gifts , the brainchild of a primary school teacher from birmingham , celebrates the more unusual choice of gifts from youngsters - from a gyrating stunt pig to a sphinx encapsulated in a golden sandstorm pyramid .
the site has been visited by almost 50,000 people and seems to generate as much criticism for its mocking , tongue in cheek tone as it has fans who see it as a bit of fun and a suitable home for their seasonal collection of the kitsch and the downright tat .
so teachers , well known for their resourcefulness , seem able to get the most out of children and parents ' generosity in whatever form whether plane tickets , a bottle of bubbly or a nodding dog .
but if you are a parent or pupil stuck for ideas this christmas , heed ms gilbert 's advice and leave the anti-wrinkle cream on the chemist 's shelf .

no-one , it would appear , is exempt from the tightening reins slowly squeezing the spirit out of giving and receiving gifts .
first , the clintons were pushed into paying for almost half the gifts they kept when leaving the white house .
then prince charles ' household was criticised for the way it handled official gifts .
and now some teachers are having to take special care when accepting christmas presents from their young charges .
while some take home enough chocolate to put willy wonka out of business every christmas , others have found themselves unwrapping a small-boxed meteorite specimen , two plastic bears which appear to be trying to become three , and even a bacon sandwich in the past .
if any teacher receives a present whether it 's a box of chocolates or an apple , they must inform the head teacher westminster council spokeswoman in pictures : pupils ' unusual gifts all are small gifts of little value .
but what should teachers do when they find themselves in the often awkward and embarrassing position of receiving a bottle of lambrini from an eager-to-please seven-year-old or a plane ticket from a hopelessly generous parent ?
three years ago , leicestershire county council ruled teachers should not accept alcohol from pupils .
for london local education authorities the matter is not as clear-cut .
a westminster council spokeswoman said : " if any teacher receives a present whether it 's a box of chocolates or an apple , they must inform the head teacher and it is up to the head .
if the gift is inappropriate , it can be declined .
" if a student or pupil was to give their teacher a bottle of wine that would not be considered appropriate . "
but not all head teachers agree .
' bribe gifts ' gabrielle weber , head teacher of independent woodside park international in north finchley , north london , is happy for her teachers to accept bottles of wine or champagne .
" i do not have a problem with it - it is up to the parents , " she said .
" i do understand that gifts could be seen as a bribe or as a way of getting preferential treatment .
" if i found that one teacher was using it in that way then the rules would change .
every time i opened another victoriana cat in a basket , i had to say ' oh , that 's lovely ' teacher jayne gilbert she said the trend now was for parents to club together to buy teachers more expensive gifts such as a day at a health spa or theatre vouchers .
but what if that expensive gift comes from just one parent ?
tim harrison , london east regional secretary for the national union of teachers -lrb- nut -rrb- , said : " if it was a high value gift we would advise them to explain that they have been advised not to accept it . "
but he disagrees with westminster council .
" teachers should be able to exercise their own discretion and should not be required to automatically inform the teacher , " he said .
many teachers anticipate 30 boxes of chocolates at the end of term gaelle graham , a modern languages teacher for 25 years and who now works for the nut , said there can sometimes be a case for accepting even the most expensive of presents .
she said : " three or four years ago a young teacher from ireland was working in greenwich .
a mum , in passing , said ' are you going home for christmas ?
he said ' i ca n't afford it ' .
" the next day , she came in to school with a plane ticket .
" the teacher felt very uncomfortable so he phoned the local authority , who then phoned the union .
" because he had reported it immediately and we discussed it , in the end it was all above board and the family could afford it , so he went home for christmas .
for most though , a plane ticket is the last thing they will be expecting .
pink presents jayne gilbert , a shoe addict who loves pink , guesses she will be taking home bagfuls of pink things and shoe-related items at the end of term .
" i have been given bottles of wine or champagne in the past , " said ms gilbert , who teaches at meridian school in greenwich , south-east london .
" the parents will bring it in and give it to you .
to be honest , we probably do n't get enough alcohol .
" sometimes the children go to the nearest cheap shop and one year i ended up with six individual victoriana cats in a basket .
" every time i opened another victoriana cat in a basket , i had to say ' oh , that 's lovely ' . "
ms gilbert is not alone .
children 's choices of porcelain puppies and rash-inducing glitter spray has given rise to an entire website .
anti-wrinkle cream cheesy gifts , the brainchild of a primary school teacher from birmingham , celebrates the more unusual choice of gifts from youngsters - from a gyrating stunt pig to a sphinx encapsulated in a golden sandstorm pyramid .
the site has been visited by almost 50,000 people and seems to generate as much criticism for its mocking , tongue in cheek tone as it has fans who see it as a bit of fun and a suitable home for their seasonal collection of the kitsch and the downright tat .
so teachers , well known for their resourcefulness , seem able to get the most out of children and parents ' generosity in whatever form whether plane tickets , a bottle of bubbly or a nodding dog .
but if you are a parent or pupil stuck for ideas this christmas , heed ms gilbert 's advice and leave the anti-wrinkle cream on the chemist 's shelf .
