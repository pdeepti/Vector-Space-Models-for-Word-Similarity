never before have so many multi-media gadgets and applications been on show at the cebit computer fair as this year .
aimed at professional and home users , they can be used in the office , at home or when moving about . according to georg schnurer of the computer magazine c 't , it 's a trend that ca n't be overlooked : the consumer , the private person , the user is central again . " the companies have realized that it ’ s not enough to present technical innovations , " schnurer said .
" they have to learn to interest customers in them .
they need to offer functions people want , and in a way customers can use them . " it 's a view shared by patrik afschar , spokesman for lg electronics from south korea . " end users are absolutely the focus , for example with cell phones , entertainment electronics , dvd recorders , " he said . lg electronics claims fifth place in the world with mobiles and is stepping up its efforts to win german customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tri-band motorola a820 has an integrated web-cam , top , a tft color display , is equipped with a mp3-player and capable to receive and display audio- and videostreams .
" we 're presenting two new models precisely targeted at consumers , " afschar said .
" one contains a 1.2 mega-pixel camera , which is very high resolution , and another one can work like a video camera . " the resolution is four times as high as mobiles now selling .
the quality is as great as the first generation of purely digital cameras .
but mobiles can do a lot of other things as well now , according to afschar . " it ’ s called a camcorder phone , whose display can be turned at a right angle to the rest of it so that it looks like a video camera , " he said .
" it can shoot video footage for up to 10 minutes . " phones to write with at the siemens stand , lothar marmier demonstrated what he called a “ pen-phone ” to a curious crowd around him .
it ’ s a ballpoint pen that also works as a phone . " it ’ s a triple band gsm phone in the form of a pen , " marmier explained , adding that it also recognizes handwriting .
" you don ’ t have to key phone numbers in any more , they ’ re written . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the siemens " penphone " is still just a prototype .
pressing a button connects you with the number written .
and those too lazy to write the numbers can tell them to the phone to record .
but the miracle thing is not for sale yet - siemens just wanted to show what future mobiles might be able to do . the mobile david williams was touting a few meters on will be in the shops in the next quarter .
poor williams is not to be envied – he spends the whole fair day treading the peddles of a bicycle . " this is the new outdoor phone by siemens , connected to a bikometer , " he said .
" that ’ s a very practical clamp for the bike .
usually i ’ ve got the mobile in my trouser pocket or back pack and i don ’ t get to it fast enough to answer it .
this is a good place for it because i can attach a headset the moment it rings . " the bikometer ’ s color display on the handle bars also acts as a speedometer that can show the usual kinds of information like speed , average speed , distance ridden and so on .
the entire route can be recorded and sent off to friends by e-mail , who can then also ride it without getting lost .
is it going to be a sales hit ?
time will tell . going flat screen flat screens on the other hand are already sales hits , on both computers or tv sets fixed to the living room wall .
the number of suppliers seems limitless , the screen diagonals range from a few centimeters or inches to just under two meters -lrb- 6.5 feet -rrb- .
it all depends on how much consumers can afford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman adjusts flatscreens at the stand of korean company lg electronics .
" there are two trends in flat displays , " said georg schnurer .
" in computers the flat screen is displacing valves , which are practically gone , and given the way prices are moving you wouldn ’ t recommend valves in new purchases .
you should get in early with this even as a private user .
the other trend in home electronics is the digital living room , including the viewing equipment .

a hamburg charity tries to prevent this . it 's a clear blue sky and the sun is shining on a beautiful winter day in northern germany .
surrounded by rolling hills near the city of flensburg , an old farm called satrupholm offers space for 40 women and their children .
a hamburg charity called sternipark uses the place to help women who want to give birth anonymously . the farm 's main building includes a kitchen and a communal room for meals .
toys lie on the floor of the living room .
an old red-brick barn next door has been converted into a dormitory . jenny is one of the women living here .
she says the farm is a place for her to be herself , a place where she does n't have to hide her belly , where she can find some peace .
" i can think about what i want to do once the baby is here , " she says and mentions adoption and a foster family as two options . hiding the growing belly before coming to the farm , jenny had been hiding her belly .
she rarely went outside and covered her pregnancy underneath large sweaters whenever she went shopping .
the 26-year-old woman did n't know how to go on since she was already a single mother .
she could n't expect any help from her parents nor the father of her unborn child - it had just been a brief affair .
but jenny did n't want to get an abortion . many of the women who come to satrupholm have similar experiences .
at some point , however , it 's too difficult to hide the growing belly .
the people at sternipark hope that these women come to them for help on time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a baby slot at a german hospital that lets women drop of their unwanted newborns anonymously .
" in many cases , they 've not seen a doctor , " says leila moysich , who helps run satrupholm .
" we invite them here and if they have children they can bring them along as well . "
moysich and her colleagues then take the women to the doctor and make sure they have adequate medical care when they give birth . at satrupholm , this can even happen anonymously - something that 's important for jenny and many of the other women and allows them to see their pregnancy as something positive . " it 's a liberating experience , " jenny says .
" it was summer and i wore a skirt and a shirt and felt beautiful with my big belly .
that was great . " time to decide some women still choose not to give their name when the baby comes .
sternipark helps them , since not every hospital admits pregnant women anonymously .
some hospitals across germany now cooperate with the organization and the women can return to the farm , with or without their children , after they give birth .
until the women have decided what they want to do , the babies are placed in foster families . at first , jenny did n't want to keep her newborn daughter and left her with foster parents for the first eight weeks .
she visited regularly and the foster mother came to the farm as well .
when she decided to take back the girl , satrupholm helped her by offering her child care during the day and sometimes overnight .
" now everything is great , " she says and looks at her second child that 's now six months old .
soon jenny will leave the farm - with both her children . janine albrecht -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany still divided over the idea of baby hatches a plan to help mothers who can ’ t provide for their babies remains controversial 3 years after it was started .
advocates of “ baby hatches ” say they save unwanted children , critics say they encourage infant “ disposal ” .

never before have so many multi-media gadgets and applications been on show at the cebit computer fair as this year .
aimed at professional and home users , they can be used in the office , at home or when moving about . according to georg schnurer of the computer magazine c 't , it 's a trend that ca n't be overlooked : the consumer , the private person , the user is central again . " the companies have realized that it ’ s not enough to present technical innovations , " schnurer said .
" they have to learn to interest customers in them .
they need to offer functions people want , and in a way customers can use them . " it 's a view shared by patrik afschar , spokesman for lg electronics from south korea . " end users are absolutely the focus , for example with cell phones , entertainment electronics , dvd recorders , " he said . lg electronics claims fifth place in the world with mobiles and is stepping up its efforts to win german customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tri-band motorola a820 has an integrated web-cam , top , a tft color display , is equipped with a mp3-player and capable to receive and display audio- and videostreams .
" we 're presenting two new models precisely targeted at consumers , " afschar said .
" one contains a 1.2 mega-pixel camera , which is very high resolution , and another one can work like a video camera . " the resolution is four times as high as mobiles now selling .
the quality is as great as the first generation of purely digital cameras .
but mobiles can do a lot of other things as well now , according to afschar . " it ’ s called a camcorder phone , whose display can be turned at a right angle to the rest of it so that it looks like a video camera , " he said .
" it can shoot video footage for up to 10 minutes . " phones to write with at the siemens stand , lothar marmier demonstrated what he called a “ pen-phone ” to a curious crowd around him .
it ’ s a ballpoint pen that also works as a phone . " it ’ s a triple band gsm phone in the form of a pen , " marmier explained , adding that it also recognizes handwriting .
" you don ’ t have to key phone numbers in any more , they ’ re written . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the siemens " penphone " is still just a prototype .
pressing a button connects you with the number written .
and those too lazy to write the numbers can tell them to the phone to record .
but the miracle thing is not for sale yet - siemens just wanted to show what future mobiles might be able to do . the mobile david williams was touting a few meters on will be in the shops in the next quarter .
poor williams is not to be envied – he spends the whole fair day treading the peddles of a bicycle . " this is the new outdoor phone by siemens , connected to a bikometer , " he said .
" that ’ s a very practical clamp for the bike .
usually i ’ ve got the mobile in my trouser pocket or back pack and i don ’ t get to it fast enough to answer it .
this is a good place for it because i can attach a headset the moment it rings . " the bikometer ’ s color display on the handle bars also acts as a speedometer that can show the usual kinds of information like speed , average speed , distance ridden and so on .
the entire route can be recorded and sent off to friends by e-mail , who can then also ride it without getting lost .
is it going to be a sales hit ?
time will tell . going flat screen flat screens on the other hand are already sales hits , on both computers or tv sets fixed to the living room wall .
the number of suppliers seems limitless , the screen diagonals range from a few centimeters or inches to just under two meters -lrb- 6.5 feet -rrb- .
it all depends on how much consumers can afford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman adjusts flatscreens at the stand of korean company lg electronics .
" there are two trends in flat displays , " said georg schnurer .
" in computers the flat screen is displacing valves , which are practically gone , and given the way prices are moving you wouldn ’ t recommend valves in new purchases .
you should get in early with this even as a private user .
the other trend in home electronics is the digital living room , including the viewing equipment .
resolutions are getting higher .
i expect flickering images to be gone soon .
you get that a lot better with a flat display than a valve . " " but the price collapses of recent months will probably end soon because producers can no longer keep up with demand , he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high-tech heaven comes to hanover cebit , the world 's biggest technology trade fair , will be a leaner affair this year , but that is n't stopping industry experts from predicting growth and an end to the downturn of the past three years .

the people at sternipark hope that these women come to them for help on time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a baby slot at a german hospital that lets women drop of their unwanted newborns anonymously .
" in many cases , they 've not seen a doctor , " says leila moysich , who helps run satrupholm .
" we invite them here and if they have children they can bring them along as well . "
moysich and her colleagues then take the women to the doctor and make sure they have adequate medical care when they give birth . at satrupholm , this can even happen anonymously - something that 's important for jenny and many of the other women and allows them to see their pregnancy as something positive . " it 's a liberating experience , " jenny says .
" it was summer and i wore a skirt and a shirt and felt beautiful with my big belly .
that was great . " time to decide some women still choose not to give their name when the baby comes .
sternipark helps them , since not every hospital admits pregnant women anonymously .
some hospitals across germany now cooperate with the organization and the women can return to the farm , with or without their children , after they give birth .
until the women have decided what they want to do , the babies are placed in foster families . at first , jenny did n't want to keep her newborn daughter and left her with foster parents for the first eight weeks .
she visited regularly and the foster mother came to the farm as well .
when she decided to take back the girl , satrupholm helped her by offering her child care during the day and sometimes overnight .
" now everything is great , " she says and looks at her second child that 's now six months old .
soon jenny will leave the farm - with both her children . janine albrecht -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany still divided over the idea of baby hatches a plan to help mothers who can ’ t provide for their babies remains controversial 3 years after it was started .

a hamburg charity tries to prevent this . it 's a clear blue sky and the sun is shining on a beautiful winter day in northern germany .
surrounded by rolling hills near the city of flensburg , an old farm called satrupholm offers space for 40 women and their children .
a hamburg charity called sternipark uses the place to help women who want to give birth anonymously . the farm 's main building includes a kitchen and a communal room for meals .
toys lie on the floor of the living room .
an old red-brick barn next door has been converted into a dormitory . jenny is one of the women living here .
she says the farm is a place for her to be herself , a place where she does n't have to hide her belly , where she can find some peace .
" i can think about what i want to do once the baby is here , " she says and mentions adoption and a foster family as two options . hiding the growing belly before coming to the farm , jenny had been hiding her belly .
she rarely went outside and covered her pregnancy underneath large sweaters whenever she went shopping .
the 26-year-old woman did n't know how to go on since she was already a single mother .
she could n't expect any help from her parents nor the father of her unborn child - it had just been a brief affair .
but jenny did n't want to get an abortion . many of the women who come to satrupholm have similar experiences .
at some point , however , it 's too difficult to hide the growing belly .
the people at sternipark hope that these women come to them for help on time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a baby slot at a german hospital that lets women drop of their unwanted newborns anonymously .
" in many cases , they 've not seen a doctor , " says leila moysich , who helps run satrupholm .
" we invite them here and if they have children they can bring them along as well . "
moysich and her colleagues then take the women to the doctor and make sure they have adequate medical care when they give birth . at satrupholm , this can even happen anonymously - something that 's important for jenny and many of the other women and allows them to see their pregnancy as something positive . " it 's a liberating experience , " jenny says .
" it was summer and i wore a skirt and a shirt and felt beautiful with my big belly .
that was great . " time to decide some women still choose not to give their name when the baby comes .
sternipark helps them , since not every hospital admits pregnant women anonymously .
some hospitals across germany now cooperate with the organization and the women can return to the farm , with or without their children , after they give birth .
until the women have decided what they want to do , the babies are placed in foster families . at first , jenny did n't want to keep her newborn daughter and left her with foster parents for the first eight weeks .
she visited regularly and the foster mother came to the farm as well .
when she decided to take back the girl , satrupholm helped her by offering her child care during the day and sometimes overnight .
" now everything is great , " she says and looks at her second child that 's now six months old .

never before have so many multi-media gadgets and applications been on show at the cebit computer fair as this year .
aimed at professional and home users , they can be used in the office , at home or when moving about . according to georg schnurer of the computer magazine c 't , it 's a trend that ca n't be overlooked : the consumer , the private person , the user is central again . " the companies have realized that it ’ s not enough to present technical innovations , " schnurer said .
" they have to learn to interest customers in them .
they need to offer functions people want , and in a way customers can use them . " it 's a view shared by patrik afschar , spokesman for lg electronics from south korea . " end users are absolutely the focus , for example with cell phones , entertainment electronics , dvd recorders , " he said . lg electronics claims fifth place in the world with mobiles and is stepping up its efforts to win german customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tri-band motorola a820 has an integrated web-cam , top , a tft color display , is equipped with a mp3-player and capable to receive and display audio- and videostreams .
" we 're presenting two new models precisely targeted at consumers , " afschar said .
" one contains a 1.2 mega-pixel camera , which is very high resolution , and another one can work like a video camera . " the resolution is four times as high as mobiles now selling .
the quality is as great as the first generation of purely digital cameras .
but mobiles can do a lot of other things as well now , according to afschar . " it ’ s called a camcorder phone , whose display can be turned at a right angle to the rest of it so that it looks like a video camera , " he said .

a hamburg charity tries to prevent this . it 's a clear blue sky and the sun is shining on a beautiful winter day in northern germany .
surrounded by rolling hills near the city of flensburg , an old farm called satrupholm offers space for 40 women and their children .
a hamburg charity called sternipark uses the place to help women who want to give birth anonymously . the farm 's main building includes a kitchen and a communal room for meals .
toys lie on the floor of the living room .
an old red-brick barn next door has been converted into a dormitory . jenny is one of the women living here .
she says the farm is a place for her to be herself , a place where she does n't have to hide her belly , where she can find some peace .
" i can think about what i want to do once the baby is here , " she says and mentions adoption and a foster family as two options . hiding the growing belly before coming to the farm , jenny had been hiding her belly .
she rarely went outside and covered her pregnancy underneath large sweaters whenever she went shopping .
the 26-year-old woman did n't know how to go on since she was already a single mother .
she could n't expect any help from her parents nor the father of her unborn child - it had just been a brief affair .
but jenny did n't want to get an abortion . many of the women who come to satrupholm have similar experiences .
at some point , however , it 's too difficult to hide the growing belly .
the people at sternipark hope that these women come to them for help on time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a baby slot at a german hospital that lets women drop of their unwanted newborns anonymously .
" in many cases , they 've not seen a doctor , " says leila moysich , who helps run satrupholm .
" we invite them here and if they have children they can bring them along as well . "
moysich and her colleagues then take the women to the doctor and make sure they have adequate medical care when they give birth . at satrupholm , this can even happen anonymously - something that 's important for jenny and many of the other women and allows them to see their pregnancy as something positive . " it 's a liberating experience , " jenny says .
" it was summer and i wore a skirt and a shirt and felt beautiful with my big belly .
that was great . " time to decide some women still choose not to give their name when the baby comes .
sternipark helps them , since not every hospital admits pregnant women anonymously .
some hospitals across germany now cooperate with the organization and the women can return to the farm , with or without their children , after they give birth .
until the women have decided what they want to do , the babies are placed in foster families . at first , jenny did n't want to keep her newborn daughter and left her with foster parents for the first eight weeks .
she visited regularly and the foster mother came to the farm as well .
when she decided to take back the girl , satrupholm helped her by offering her child care during the day and sometimes overnight .
" now everything is great , " she says and looks at her second child that 's now six months old .
soon jenny will leave the farm - with both her children . janine albrecht -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany still divided over the idea of baby hatches a plan to help mothers who can ’ t provide for their babies remains controversial 3 years after it was started .

a hamburg charity tries to prevent this . it 's a clear blue sky and the sun is shining on a beautiful winter day in northern germany .
surrounded by rolling hills near the city of flensburg , an old farm called satrupholm offers space for 40 women and their children .
a hamburg charity called sternipark uses the place to help women who want to give birth anonymously . the farm 's main building includes a kitchen and a communal room for meals .
toys lie on the floor of the living room .
an old red-brick barn next door has been converted into a dormitory . jenny is one of the women living here .
she says the farm is a place for her to be herself , a place where she does n't have to hide her belly , where she can find some peace .
" i can think about what i want to do once the baby is here , " she says and mentions adoption and a foster family as two options . hiding the growing belly before coming to the farm , jenny had been hiding her belly .
she rarely went outside and covered her pregnancy underneath large sweaters whenever she went shopping .
the 26-year-old woman did n't know how to go on since she was already a single mother .
she could n't expect any help from her parents nor the father of her unborn child - it had just been a brief affair .
but jenny did n't want to get an abortion . many of the women who come to satrupholm have similar experiences .
at some point , however , it 's too difficult to hide the growing belly .
the people at sternipark hope that these women come to them for help on time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a baby slot at a german hospital that lets women drop of their unwanted newborns anonymously .
" in many cases , they 've not seen a doctor , " says leila moysich , who helps run satrupholm .
" we invite them here and if they have children they can bring them along as well . "
moysich and her colleagues then take the women to the doctor and make sure they have adequate medical care when they give birth . at satrupholm , this can even happen anonymously - something that 's important for jenny and many of the other women and allows them to see their pregnancy as something positive . " it 's a liberating experience , " jenny says .
" it was summer and i wore a skirt and a shirt and felt beautiful with my big belly .
that was great . " time to decide some women still choose not to give their name when the baby comes .
sternipark helps them , since not every hospital admits pregnant women anonymously .
some hospitals across germany now cooperate with the organization and the women can return to the farm , with or without their children , after they give birth .
until the women have decided what they want to do , the babies are placed in foster families . at first , jenny did n't want to keep her newborn daughter and left her with foster parents for the first eight weeks .
she visited regularly and the foster mother came to the farm as well .
when she decided to take back the girl , satrupholm helped her by offering her child care during the day and sometimes overnight .
" now everything is great , " she says and looks at her second child that 's now six months old .
soon jenny will leave the farm - with both her children . janine albrecht -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany still divided over the idea of baby hatches a plan to help mothers who can ’ t provide for their babies remains controversial 3 years after it was started .
advocates of “ baby hatches ” say they save unwanted children , critics say they encourage infant “ disposal ” .

never before have so many multi-media gadgets and applications been on show at the cebit computer fair as this year .
aimed at professional and home users , they can be used in the office , at home or when moving about . according to georg schnurer of the computer magazine c 't , it 's a trend that ca n't be overlooked : the consumer , the private person , the user is central again . " the companies have realized that it ’ s not enough to present technical innovations , " schnurer said .
" they have to learn to interest customers in them .
they need to offer functions people want , and in a way customers can use them . " it 's a view shared by patrik afschar , spokesman for lg electronics from south korea . " end users are absolutely the focus , for example with cell phones , entertainment electronics , dvd recorders , " he said . lg electronics claims fifth place in the world with mobiles and is stepping up its efforts to win german customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tri-band motorola a820 has an integrated web-cam , top , a tft color display , is equipped with a mp3-player and capable to receive and display audio- and videostreams .
" we 're presenting two new models precisely targeted at consumers , " afschar said .
" one contains a 1.2 mega-pixel camera , which is very high resolution , and another one can work like a video camera . " the resolution is four times as high as mobiles now selling .
the quality is as great as the first generation of purely digital cameras .
but mobiles can do a lot of other things as well now , according to afschar . " it ’ s called a camcorder phone , whose display can be turned at a right angle to the rest of it so that it looks like a video camera , " he said .
" it can shoot video footage for up to 10 minutes . " phones to write with at the siemens stand , lothar marmier demonstrated what he called a “ pen-phone ” to a curious crowd around him .
it ’ s a ballpoint pen that also works as a phone . " it ’ s a triple band gsm phone in the form of a pen , " marmier explained , adding that it also recognizes handwriting .
" you don ’ t have to key phone numbers in any more , they ’ re written . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the siemens " penphone " is still just a prototype .
pressing a button connects you with the number written .
and those too lazy to write the numbers can tell them to the phone to record .
but the miracle thing is not for sale yet - siemens just wanted to show what future mobiles might be able to do . the mobile david williams was touting a few meters on will be in the shops in the next quarter .
poor williams is not to be envied – he spends the whole fair day treading the peddles of a bicycle . " this is the new outdoor phone by siemens , connected to a bikometer , " he said .
" that ’ s a very practical clamp for the bike .
usually i ’ ve got the mobile in my trouser pocket or back pack and i don ’ t get to it fast enough to answer it .
this is a good place for it because i can attach a headset the moment it rings . " the bikometer ’ s color display on the handle bars also acts as a speedometer that can show the usual kinds of information like speed , average speed , distance ridden and so on .
the entire route can be recorded and sent off to friends by e-mail , who can then also ride it without getting lost .
is it going to be a sales hit ?
time will tell . going flat screen flat screens on the other hand are already sales hits , on both computers or tv sets fixed to the living room wall .
the number of suppliers seems limitless , the screen diagonals range from a few centimeters or inches to just under two meters -lrb- 6.5 feet -rrb- .
it all depends on how much consumers can afford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman adjusts flatscreens at the stand of korean company lg electronics .
" there are two trends in flat displays , " said georg schnurer .
" in computers the flat screen is displacing valves , which are practically gone , and given the way prices are moving you wouldn ’ t recommend valves in new purchases .
you should get in early with this even as a private user .
the other trend in home electronics is the digital living room , including the viewing equipment .
resolutions are getting higher .
i expect flickering images to be gone soon .
you get that a lot better with a flat display than a valve . " " but the price collapses of recent months will probably end soon because producers can no longer keep up with demand , he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high-tech heaven comes to hanover cebit , the world 's biggest technology trade fair , will be a leaner affair this year , but that is n't stopping industry experts from predicting growth and an end to the downturn of the past three years .

never before have so many multi-media gadgets and applications been on show at the cebit computer fair as this year .
aimed at professional and home users , they can be used in the office , at home or when moving about . according to georg schnurer of the computer magazine c 't , it 's a trend that ca n't be overlooked : the consumer , the private person , the user is central again . " the companies have realized that it ’ s not enough to present technical innovations , " schnurer said .
" they have to learn to interest customers in them .
they need to offer functions people want , and in a way customers can use them . " it 's a view shared by patrik afschar , spokesman for lg electronics from south korea . " end users are absolutely the focus , for example with cell phones , entertainment electronics , dvd recorders , " he said . lg electronics claims fifth place in the world with mobiles and is stepping up its efforts to win german customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tri-band motorola a820 has an integrated web-cam , top , a tft color display , is equipped with a mp3-player and capable to receive and display audio- and videostreams .
" we 're presenting two new models precisely targeted at consumers , " afschar said .
" one contains a 1.2 mega-pixel camera , which is very high resolution , and another one can work like a video camera . " the resolution is four times as high as mobiles now selling .
the quality is as great as the first generation of purely digital cameras .
but mobiles can do a lot of other things as well now , according to afschar . " it ’ s called a camcorder phone , whose display can be turned at a right angle to the rest of it so that it looks like a video camera , " he said .
" it can shoot video footage for up to 10 minutes . " phones to write with at the siemens stand , lothar marmier demonstrated what he called a “ pen-phone ” to a curious crowd around him .
it ’ s a ballpoint pen that also works as a phone . " it ’ s a triple band gsm phone in the form of a pen , " marmier explained , adding that it also recognizes handwriting .
" you don ’ t have to key phone numbers in any more , they ’ re written . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the siemens " penphone " is still just a prototype .
pressing a button connects you with the number written .
and those too lazy to write the numbers can tell them to the phone to record .
but the miracle thing is not for sale yet - siemens just wanted to show what future mobiles might be able to do . the mobile david williams was touting a few meters on will be in the shops in the next quarter .

never before have so many multi-media gadgets and applications been on show at the cebit computer fair as this year .
aimed at professional and home users , they can be used in the office , at home or when moving about . according to georg schnurer of the computer magazine c 't , it 's a trend that ca n't be overlooked : the consumer , the private person , the user is central again . " the companies have realized that it ’ s not enough to present technical innovations , " schnurer said .
" they have to learn to interest customers in them .
they need to offer functions people want , and in a way customers can use them . " it 's a view shared by patrik afschar , spokesman for lg electronics from south korea . " end users are absolutely the focus , for example with cell phones , entertainment electronics , dvd recorders , " he said . lg electronics claims fifth place in the world with mobiles and is stepping up its efforts to win german customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tri-band motorola a820 has an integrated web-cam , top , a tft color display , is equipped with a mp3-player and capable to receive and display audio- and videostreams .
" we 're presenting two new models precisely targeted at consumers , " afschar said .
" one contains a 1.2 mega-pixel camera , which is very high resolution , and another one can work like a video camera . " the resolution is four times as high as mobiles now selling .
the quality is as great as the first generation of purely digital cameras .
but mobiles can do a lot of other things as well now , according to afschar . " it ’ s called a camcorder phone , whose display can be turned at a right angle to the rest of it so that it looks like a video camera , " he said .
" it can shoot video footage for up to 10 minutes . " phones to write with at the siemens stand , lothar marmier demonstrated what he called a “ pen-phone ” to a curious crowd around him .
it ’ s a ballpoint pen that also works as a phone . " it ’ s a triple band gsm phone in the form of a pen , " marmier explained , adding that it also recognizes handwriting .
" you don ’ t have to key phone numbers in any more , they ’ re written . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the siemens " penphone " is still just a prototype .
pressing a button connects you with the number written .
and those too lazy to write the numbers can tell them to the phone to record .
but the miracle thing is not for sale yet - siemens just wanted to show what future mobiles might be able to do . the mobile david williams was touting a few meters on will be in the shops in the next quarter .
poor williams is not to be envied – he spends the whole fair day treading the peddles of a bicycle . " this is the new outdoor phone by siemens , connected to a bikometer , " he said .
" that ’ s a very practical clamp for the bike .
usually i ’ ve got the mobile in my trouser pocket or back pack and i don ’ t get to it fast enough to answer it .
this is a good place for it because i can attach a headset the moment it rings . " the bikometer ’ s color display on the handle bars also acts as a speedometer that can show the usual kinds of information like speed , average speed , distance ridden and so on .
the entire route can be recorded and sent off to friends by e-mail , who can then also ride it without getting lost .
is it going to be a sales hit ?
time will tell . going flat screen flat screens on the other hand are already sales hits , on both computers or tv sets fixed to the living room wall .
the number of suppliers seems limitless , the screen diagonals range from a few centimeters or inches to just under two meters -lrb- 6.5 feet -rrb- .
it all depends on how much consumers can afford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman adjusts flatscreens at the stand of korean company lg electronics .
" there are two trends in flat displays , " said georg schnurer .
" in computers the flat screen is displacing valves , which are practically gone , and given the way prices are moving you wouldn ’ t recommend valves in new purchases .
you should get in early with this even as a private user .
the other trend in home electronics is the digital living room , including the viewing equipment .
resolutions are getting higher .
i expect flickering images to be gone soon .
you get that a lot better with a flat display than a valve . " " but the price collapses of recent months will probably end soon because producers can no longer keep up with demand , he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high-tech heaven comes to hanover cebit , the world 's biggest technology trade fair , will be a leaner affair this year , but that is n't stopping industry experts from predicting growth and an end to the downturn of the past three years .

never before have so many multi-media gadgets and applications been on show at the cebit computer fair as this year .
aimed at professional and home users , they can be used in the office , at home or when moving about . according to georg schnurer of the computer magazine c 't , it 's a trend that ca n't be overlooked : the consumer , the private person , the user is central again . " the companies have realized that it ’ s not enough to present technical innovations , " schnurer said .
" they have to learn to interest customers in them .
they need to offer functions people want , and in a way customers can use them . " it 's a view shared by patrik afschar , spokesman for lg electronics from south korea .

a hamburg charity tries to prevent this . it 's a clear blue sky and the sun is shining on a beautiful winter day in northern germany .
surrounded by rolling hills near the city of flensburg , an old farm called satrupholm offers space for 40 women and their children .
a hamburg charity called sternipark uses the place to help women who want to give birth anonymously . the farm 's main building includes a kitchen and a communal room for meals .
toys lie on the floor of the living room .
an old red-brick barn next door has been converted into a dormitory . jenny is one of the women living here .
she says the farm is a place for her to be herself , a place where she does n't have to hide her belly , where she can find some peace .
" i can think about what i want to do once the baby is here , " she says and mentions adoption and a foster family as two options . hiding the growing belly before coming to the farm , jenny had been hiding her belly .
she rarely went outside and covered her pregnancy underneath large sweaters whenever she went shopping .
the 26-year-old woman did n't know how to go on since she was already a single mother .
she could n't expect any help from her parents nor the father of her unborn child - it had just been a brief affair .
but jenny did n't want to get an abortion . many of the women who come to satrupholm have similar experiences .
at some point , however , it 's too difficult to hide the growing belly .
the people at sternipark hope that these women come to them for help on time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a baby slot at a german hospital that lets women drop of their unwanted newborns anonymously .
" in many cases , they 've not seen a doctor , " says leila moysich , who helps run satrupholm .
" we invite them here and if they have children they can bring them along as well . "
moysich and her colleagues then take the women to the doctor and make sure they have adequate medical care when they give birth . at satrupholm , this can even happen anonymously - something that 's important for jenny and many of the other women and allows them to see their pregnancy as something positive . " it 's a liberating experience , " jenny says .
" it was summer and i wore a skirt and a shirt and felt beautiful with my big belly .
that was great . " time to decide some women still choose not to give their name when the baby comes .
sternipark helps them , since not every hospital admits pregnant women anonymously .
some hospitals across germany now cooperate with the organization and the women can return to the farm , with or without their children , after they give birth .
until the women have decided what they want to do , the babies are placed in foster families . at first , jenny did n't want to keep her newborn daughter and left her with foster parents for the first eight weeks .
she visited regularly and the foster mother came to the farm as well .
when she decided to take back the girl , satrupholm helped her by offering her child care during the day and sometimes overnight .
" now everything is great , " she says and looks at her second child that 's now six months old .
soon jenny will leave the farm - with both her children . janine albrecht -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany still divided over the idea of baby hatches a plan to help mothers who can ’ t provide for their babies remains controversial 3 years after it was started .

" the companies have realized that it ’ s not enough to present technical innovations , " schnurer said .
" they have to learn to interest customers in them .
they need to offer functions people want , and in a way customers can use them . " it 's a view shared by patrik afschar , spokesman for lg electronics from south korea . " end users are absolutely the focus , for example with cell phones , entertainment electronics , dvd recorders , " he said . lg electronics claims fifth place in the world with mobiles and is stepping up its efforts to win german customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tri-band motorola a820 has an integrated web-cam , top , a tft color display , is equipped with a mp3-player and capable to receive and display audio- and videostreams .
" we 're presenting two new models precisely targeted at consumers , " afschar said .
" one contains a 1.2 mega-pixel camera , which is very high resolution , and another one can work like a video camera . " the resolution is four times as high as mobiles now selling .
the quality is as great as the first generation of purely digital cameras .
but mobiles can do a lot of other things as well now , according to afschar . " it ’ s called a camcorder phone , whose display can be turned at a right angle to the rest of it so that it looks like a video camera , " he said .
" it can shoot video footage for up to 10 minutes . " phones to write with at the siemens stand , lothar marmier demonstrated what he called a “ pen-phone ” to a curious crowd around him .
it ’ s a ballpoint pen that also works as a phone . " it ’ s a triple band gsm phone in the form of a pen , " marmier explained , adding that it also recognizes handwriting .
" you don ’ t have to key phone numbers in any more , they ’ re written . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the siemens " penphone " is still just a prototype .
pressing a button connects you with the number written .
and those too lazy to write the numbers can tell them to the phone to record .
but the miracle thing is not for sale yet - siemens just wanted to show what future mobiles might be able to do . the mobile david williams was touting a few meters on will be in the shops in the next quarter .
poor williams is not to be envied – he spends the whole fair day treading the peddles of a bicycle . " this is the new outdoor phone by siemens , connected to a bikometer , " he said .
" that ’ s a very practical clamp for the bike .
usually i ’ ve got the mobile in my trouser pocket or back pack and i don ’ t get to it fast enough to answer it .
this is a good place for it because i can attach a headset the moment it rings . " the bikometer ’ s color display on the handle bars also acts as a speedometer that can show the usual kinds of information like speed , average speed , distance ridden and so on .
the entire route can be recorded and sent off to friends by e-mail , who can then also ride it without getting lost .
is it going to be a sales hit ?
time will tell . going flat screen flat screens on the other hand are already sales hits , on both computers or tv sets fixed to the living room wall .
the number of suppliers seems limitless , the screen diagonals range from a few centimeters or inches to just under two meters -lrb- 6.5 feet -rrb- .
it all depends on how much consumers can afford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman adjusts flatscreens at the stand of korean company lg electronics .
" there are two trends in flat displays , " said georg schnurer .
" in computers the flat screen is displacing valves , which are practically gone , and given the way prices are moving you wouldn ’ t recommend valves in new purchases .
you should get in early with this even as a private user .
the other trend in home electronics is the digital living room , including the viewing equipment .
resolutions are getting higher .
i expect flickering images to be gone soon .
you get that a lot better with a flat display than a valve .

but mobiles can do a lot of other things as well now , according to afschar . " it ’ s called a camcorder phone , whose display can be turned at a right angle to the rest of it so that it looks like a video camera , " he said .
" it can shoot video footage for up to 10 minutes . " phones to write with at the siemens stand , lothar marmier demonstrated what he called a “ pen-phone ” to a curious crowd around him .
it ’ s a ballpoint pen that also works as a phone . " it ’ s a triple band gsm phone in the form of a pen , " marmier explained , adding that it also recognizes handwriting .
" you don ’ t have to key phone numbers in any more , they ’ re written . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the siemens " penphone " is still just a prototype .
pressing a button connects you with the number written .
and those too lazy to write the numbers can tell them to the phone to record .
but the miracle thing is not for sale yet - siemens just wanted to show what future mobiles might be able to do . the mobile david williams was touting a few meters on will be in the shops in the next quarter .
poor williams is not to be envied – he spends the whole fair day treading the peddles of a bicycle . " this is the new outdoor phone by siemens , connected to a bikometer , " he said .
" that ’ s a very practical clamp for the bike .
usually i ’ ve got the mobile in my trouser pocket or back pack and i don ’ t get to it fast enough to answer it .
this is a good place for it because i can attach a headset the moment it rings . " the bikometer ’ s color display on the handle bars also acts as a speedometer that can show the usual kinds of information like speed , average speed , distance ridden and so on .
the entire route can be recorded and sent off to friends by e-mail , who can then also ride it without getting lost .
is it going to be a sales hit ?
time will tell . going flat screen flat screens on the other hand are already sales hits , on both computers or tv sets fixed to the living room wall .
the number of suppliers seems limitless , the screen diagonals range from a few centimeters or inches to just under two meters -lrb- 6.5 feet -rrb- .
it all depends on how much consumers can afford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman adjusts flatscreens at the stand of korean company lg electronics .
" there are two trends in flat displays , " said georg schnurer .
" in computers the flat screen is displacing valves , which are practically gone , and given the way prices are moving you wouldn ’ t recommend valves in new purchases .
you should get in early with this even as a private user .
the other trend in home electronics is the digital living room , including the viewing equipment .
resolutions are getting higher .
i expect flickering images to be gone soon .
you get that a lot better with a flat display than a valve . " " but the price collapses of recent months will probably end soon because producers can no longer keep up with demand , he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high-tech heaven comes to hanover cebit , the world 's biggest technology trade fair , will be a leaner affair this year , but that is n't stopping industry experts from predicting growth and an end to the downturn of the past three years .

a report for wwf said moray council 's plans for elgin were based on out-dated ideas which could have serious consequences for the local economy .
it also predicted that it could take 10 years to fund the project .
the council dismissed the report as " a bungled effort based on inaccurate figures and selective quotes " .
more than 1,200 people were evacuated when the last major flood struck elgin , causing damage which cost £ 3.5m to repair .
serious flooding some 650 homes and 180 commercial properties were flooded in november 2002 .
the town was also hit by serious flooding in july 1997 and april 2000 .
however , moray council faced accusations of " environmental vandalism " when it unveiled its £ 95m scheme to tackle the problem .
wwf has now added its voice to the criticism .
moray council has chosen to follow an outdated approach to flood alleviation that really is out of step with the scottish executive 's current thinking mike donaghy wwf it has published a report written by professor david crichton , an insurance expert and adviser on climate change .
he said planners had continued to allow properties to be built in flood hazard areas despite " irrefutable evidence " of the dangers .
the plans to address the problem involve the widening of the river lossie and the construction of a series of embankments .
prof crichton said this would leave homes and businesses at the mercy of the weather - and the insurance companies who are already refusing to cover them .
wwf said the plans were based on " old-fashioned thinking " which would simply push the water further down the river , threatening other towns and farmland .
damage from flooding has cost millions of pounds the organisation 's freshwater policy officer , mike donaghy , estimated that it could take up to a decade to fund the project .
" in the meantime the local economy , in terms of businesses and indeed social cost , could suffer irreversibly , " he said .
mr donaghy said other local authorities were dealing with greater flooding problems using " inexpensive , sustainable and effective " ideas which addressed the causes of flooding .
" moray council has chosen instead to follow an outdated approach to flood alleviation that really is out of step with the scottish executive 's current thinking , " he said .
" they risk being the first council in scotland to have their flood defence funding bid rejected unless they change their plans and work with the river system , instead of against it . "

in a joint statement to mark international day against racism , the presidents of the human rights commissions on both sides of the irish border , said the governments must show their commitment to fighting the scourge of racism .
the comments come after separate racist attacks on a man and a chinese woman in belfast in the past few days .
the woman was stoned by teenagers and the man badly beaten by a gang of five men .
on sunday , both governments were urged to ratify the international convention on the protection of the rights of all migrant workers and their families .
the convention , which came into force in july 2003 , enshrines a range of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .
professor brice dickson , chief commissioner of the northern ireland human rights commission , said most migrant workers holding work permits were in a vulnerable position .
attacks on ethnic minority groups have increased " they may have made long-term plans in the uk and ireland by having spouses and dependants join them here on the understanding that their permits will be renewed .
" governments must ensure that employers will honour their contracts and guarantee fair and safe working conditions for all . "
dr maurice manning , president of the irish human rights commission said the development of immigrant policy throughout ireland , the uk and the rest of the european union must be underpinned by a commitment to human rights .
" safeguarding the rights of migrant workers and their families is an essential component of the development of humane immigration policy and law , " he added .
earlier this month , the policing board urged the chief constable to crack down on rising levels of racial and homophobic attacks in northern ireland .
such incidents were to be tackled as part of a £ 774m strategy for running the police service of northern ireland over the next 12 months .

the national library of wales , based at aberystwyth will put more than 200,000 wills of welsh people stretching back more than 700 years onto the internet .
among those available will be welsh bandit of the road twm sion cati and welsh methodist revivalist leaders , william williams , pantycelyn and howell harris .
a uk-wide scheme by the national archive to put up millions of wills , including those of williams shakespeare , jane austen and horatio nelson is already up and running .

the national library of wales has yet to decide on the details of how it will run its own scheme , according to sion jobbins of the national library of wales . "
once it is up and running the wills placed on-line will be of enormous interest to the public " sion jobbins , national library of wales " we need to discuss if people have to pay for downloaded wills but we expect to use the same sort of system as the national archive , " he said .

joe steele , 42 , said he can see no point in holding a probe and he just wants to get on with his life .
tc campbell , the other man wrongly jailed for the killing of six doyle family members in 1984 , has demanded an inquiry and a police apology .
however , mr steele said he only ever wanted to clear his name .
in an interview with the sunday mail newspaper , mr steele also said that despite their 18-year campaign , he had no love for his co-accused .
revenge is a poison that sours the rest of your life and i want to go on and enjoy the rest of mine in peace and quiet with my family joe steele the men were jailed for life in 1984 for the murder of six members of the doyle family , including an 18-month-old baby , in a fire at their home in ruchazie , glasgow .
during a 27-day trial at the high court in glasgow later that year , the jury had heard how the doyle deaths happened amid a struggle for control of ice cream van businesses in the city 's east end .
some were being used as a front for illegal activity .
but the men were freed on wednesday when three appeal judges in edinburgh ruled that some police evidence during their trial was unsafe .
mr campbell , 51 , has demanded a meeting with the chief constable of strathclyde police to make his call for an independent inquiry .
jail breaks however , mr steele said : " all i ever wanted was to clear my name , so my family could hold their heads up and live their lives in peace .
" i 'm not interested in revenge , compensation deals or taking the police to court for fitting me up .
" all i wanted was for people to stop calling me the ice cream killer . "
mr steele added : " revenge is a poison that sours the rest of your life and i want to go on and enjoy the rest of mine in peace and quiet with my family .
it 's over . "
he recalled several jail breaks which he used to highlight his case , including one occasion when he glued himself to the gates of buckingham palace .
following the refusal of a meeting with strathclyde chief constable willie rae on friday , mr campbell said : " there can be no closure , i 'm looking for peace .

however , mr steele said he only ever wanted to clear his name .
in an interview with the sunday mail newspaper , mr steele also said that despite their 18-year campaign , he had no love for his co-accused .
revenge is a poison that sours the rest of your life and i want to go on and enjoy the rest of mine in peace and quiet with my family joe steele the men were jailed for life in 1984 for the murder of six members of the doyle family , including an 18-month-old baby , in a fire at their home in ruchazie , glasgow .
during a 27-day trial at the high court in glasgow later that year , the jury had heard how the doyle deaths happened amid a struggle for control of ice cream van businesses in the city 's east end .
some were being used as a front for illegal activity .
but the men were freed on wednesday when three appeal judges in edinburgh ruled that some police evidence during their trial was unsafe .
mr campbell , 51 , has demanded a meeting with the chief constable of strathclyde police to make his call for an independent inquiry .
jail breaks however , mr steele said : " all i ever wanted was to clear my name , so my family could hold their heads up and live their lives in peace .
" i 'm not interested in revenge , compensation deals or taking the police to court for fitting me up .
" all i wanted was for people to stop calling me the ice cream killer . "
mr steele added : " revenge is a poison that sours the rest of your life and i want to go on and enjoy the rest of mine in peace and quiet with my family .
it 's over . "
he recalled several jail breaks which he used to highlight his case , including one occasion when he glued himself to the gates of buckingham palace .
following the refusal of a meeting with strathclyde chief constable willie rae on friday , mr campbell said : " there can be no closure , i 'm looking for peace .
where there is no justice there is no peace and i feel compelled that this matter must be pursued . "
