chancellor gerhard schröder concludes his six-day , four-country tour of africa with a stop in ghana on friday .
dw-tv met up with the german leader and asked him about his country ’ s growing interest in the continent . his first official visit to africa is already being hailed a success back in berlin .
after spending six days jetting across the continent with high-profile stops in ethiopia , kenya , south africa and ghana , schröder hopes to have driven home his point that africa is not only about war , famine and disease , and that germany is not only interested in the continent as a recipient of development aid , but rather that there are political and economic initiatives worthy of promoting .
speaking to dw-tv while in south africa , schröder says he is satisfied with the results of his visit , his first official one to the continent : " i think we made clear that germany wants to take an active involvement in those places where what ’ s called " good governance " is practiced . "
" these countries are making a genuine effort to stand on their own two feet , which is something we support , " he explains .
" they are trying to enforce the rule of law and principles of democracy .
and they ’ re trying to establish regional alliances that can promote trade and give us the opportunity to get involved in even bigger markets . "
the forgotten continent ?
africa has often been referred to as the " forgotten continent . "
europe , which once had an active interest in its development , has pretty much neglected the region except for the occasional peacekeeping missions to former colonies and the regular flow of humanitarian and economic aid .
but germany seems to be experiencing a growing interest in the continent .
after schröder ’ s visit , president johannes rau will go to africa .
foreign minister joschka fischer and the state secretary in the foreign office , kerstin müller , have frequently visited the region in an effort to drum up support for peace initiatives in countries like sudan and the congo .
schröder sees his country ’ s interest in africa as a continuation of germany ’ s foreign policy .
" we ’ re trying to make it clear that it ’ s worth countries ’ while to help themselves .
the reason is quite simple , " he says .
" a stable africa is in our own interest .
the fight against international terrorism will only be successful if africa manages to offer people a future , one in which they can live or at least survive . "
new dimension in africa policy the focus on security represents a shift in germany ’ s relations with africa , which was previously confined to development aid .
schröder says the joint emphasis on security and economic development is the key to future dealings with africa .
although still not as developed as north america , asia or europe , the chancellor is convinced that economic cooperation with africa could lead to a " potentially huge market . "
" we should not be talking down the potential , " he says referring to critics , who quickly dismiss investment as a waste of effort .
" it ’ s not just about raw materials , it ’ s also about people ’ s willingness to roll up their sleeves and get down to work on their own behalf . "
" i think it ’ s in our own interest to help them . "
guilt over colonial past ?
schröder denies that germany ’ s colonial history has any bearing on his country ’ s current and future interest in africa .
" there have been some very dark chapters in our history .
one must only think of the hereros in namibia .
but that ’ s a long time ago , and many of the emotional wounds have healed , " he says .
" o course , we can not allow ourselves to forget the past , but it ’ s not the driving force behind a sensible africa policy .
it 's more about the here and now .
there can be no question that this continent must have a future , and it will .

german investment fund increases aid to developing world german development finance institute deg gave its annual report this week , announcing that it had increased its aid to developing countries by 9 percent in 2003 and contributed some € 506 million to projects around the world .

the german-born photographer died in a car accident in los angeles friday .
the self-proclaimed " king of kink , " who rose to fame with controversial images of women and fashion , will be honored with a new museum in berlin . celebrated , respected and controversial are just some of the words used to describe helmut newton .
best known for his provocative portraits of nude women , the berlin-born avant-garde fashion photographer spent some six decades transforming his craft and testing the limits of social acceptability .
" he was a giant , " said playboy founder hugh hefner .
" he was a major talent that pushed the boundaries in terms of photography and influenced many in following generations . "
for newton , his camera was a lens to explore power , gender roles and sexuality .
" i ’ m interested in power - i always was , whether it ’ s sexual power , financial power or political power , " he wrote in his 2002 autobiography .
bildunterschrift : retrospective exhibit in berlin 's new national gallery .
newton ’ s brazen and controversial style was exemplified in the 1980 and 1993 series " big nudes , " which featured larger-than-life images of women who were portrayed as dominating the camera rather than as subjects .
the stark black-and-white portraits were a shocking departure from conventional nude photos in their coldly erotic sensuality .
among one of the most famous images was a nude model with her neck in a surgical collar and one leg in a cast .
" he loves to be outrageous , " said anna wintour , who published much of newton ’ s work in vogue magazine .
" he has a perverse view of women that recurs again and again , " she said recently .
childhood in germany born in october 1920 , the son of a wealthy jewish button-manufacturer , newton enjoyed a privileged upbringing in berlin .
he attended the city ’ s american school , but because the photo-bug bit him early , he spent more time with his camera than his studies .
at the age of 15 , newton ’ s father told him , " my boy , you ’ ll end up in the gutter .
all you think of is girls and photos , " he wrote in his autobiography .
after leaving school in 1936 , the young newton worked as an apprentice to top photographer elsie simon , a job he held until forced to flee nazi-germany in 1938 .
after a brief stay in singapore , newton settled in australia , became a citizen and opened a small photography studio .
he also changed his name from neustädter to newton .
throughout his career he turned again and again to the subject of nazi germany , but not in a way typical for someone who lost loved ones in the concentration camps .
in a series of portraits , newton photographed hitler ’ s official filmmaker leni riefenstahl , former u.n. secretary general kurt waldheim , who was involved in nazi atrocities , and right-wing french political leader jean-marie le pen .
his own wife , june , posed in a 1973 series as hitler with model jerry hall posing as eva bruan .
but newton never dwelled on the past for long .
" i find this kind of living in the past useless and unproductive , " he wrote in his book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newton leaves 1,000 photographs to the city of berlin newton ’ s homecoming in october 2003 , newton recognized the importance his early life in berlin had on his career and donated more than 1,000 pictures to a new gallery in berlin .
at the opening , the photographer said he was " proud " his works would be displayed in his hometown .
" not just the nudes , but all the others " will be available for everyone to see , he said .
german chancellor gerhard schröder called newton ’ s decision a " sign of reconciliation . "
" you can chase a man out of his home but you can ’ t rip his home out of his soul , " the german leader said in a letter read at the news conference .
starting in june , newton 's works will be on permanent display in berlin ’ s former art library across the street from the central train station .

the german-born photographer died in a car accident in los angeles friday .
the self-proclaimed " king of kink , " who rose to fame with controversial images of women and fashion , will be honored with a new museum in berlin . celebrated , respected and controversial are just some of the words used to describe helmut newton .
best known for his provocative portraits of nude women , the berlin-born avant-garde fashion photographer spent some six decades transforming his craft and testing the limits of social acceptability .
" he was a giant , " said playboy founder hugh hefner .
" he was a major talent that pushed the boundaries in terms of photography and influenced many in following generations . "
for newton , his camera was a lens to explore power , gender roles and sexuality .
" i ’ m interested in power - i always was , whether it ’ s sexual power , financial power or political power , " he wrote in his 2002 autobiography .
bildunterschrift : retrospective exhibit in berlin 's new national gallery .
newton ’ s brazen and controversial style was exemplified in the 1980 and 1993 series " big nudes , " which featured larger-than-life images of women who were portrayed as dominating the camera rather than as subjects .
the stark black-and-white portraits were a shocking departure from conventional nude photos in their coldly erotic sensuality .
among one of the most famous images was a nude model with her neck in a surgical collar and one leg in a cast .
" he loves to be outrageous , " said anna wintour , who published much of newton ’ s work in vogue magazine .
" he has a perverse view of women that recurs again and again , " she said recently .
childhood in germany born in october 1920 , the son of a wealthy jewish button-manufacturer , newton enjoyed a privileged upbringing in berlin .
he attended the city ’ s american school , but because the photo-bug bit him early , he spent more time with his camera than his studies .
at the age of 15 , newton ’ s father told him , " my boy , you ’ ll end up in the gutter .
all you think of is girls and photos , " he wrote in his autobiography .
after leaving school in 1936 , the young newton worked as an apprentice to top photographer elsie simon , a job he held until forced to flee nazi-germany in 1938 .
after a brief stay in singapore , newton settled in australia , became a citizen and opened a small photography studio .
he also changed his name from neustädter to newton .
throughout his career he turned again and again to the subject of nazi germany , but not in a way typical for someone who lost loved ones in the concentration camps .
in a series of portraits , newton photographed hitler ’ s official filmmaker leni riefenstahl , former u.n. secretary general kurt waldheim , who was involved in nazi atrocities , and right-wing french political leader jean-marie le pen .
his own wife , june , posed in a 1973 series as hitler with model jerry hall posing as eva bruan .
but newton never dwelled on the past for long .
" i find this kind of living in the past useless and unproductive , " he wrote in his book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newton leaves 1,000 photographs to the city of berlin newton ’ s homecoming in october 2003 , newton recognized the importance his early life in berlin had on his career and donated more than 1,000 pictures to a new gallery in berlin .

chancellor gerhard schröder concludes his six-day , four-country tour of africa with a stop in ghana on friday .
dw-tv met up with the german leader and asked him about his country ’ s growing interest in the continent . his first official visit to africa is already being hailed a success back in berlin .
after spending six days jetting across the continent with high-profile stops in ethiopia , kenya , south africa and ghana , schröder hopes to have driven home his point that africa is not only about war , famine and disease , and that germany is not only interested in the continent as a recipient of development aid , but rather that there are political and economic initiatives worthy of promoting .
speaking to dw-tv while in south africa , schröder says he is satisfied with the results of his visit , his first official one to the continent : " i think we made clear that germany wants to take an active involvement in those places where what ’ s called " good governance " is practiced . "
" these countries are making a genuine effort to stand on their own two feet , which is something we support , " he explains .
" they are trying to enforce the rule of law and principles of democracy .
and they ’ re trying to establish regional alliances that can promote trade and give us the opportunity to get involved in even bigger markets . "
the forgotten continent ?
africa has often been referred to as the " forgotten continent . "
europe , which once had an active interest in its development , has pretty much neglected the region except for the occasional peacekeeping missions to former colonies and the regular flow of humanitarian and economic aid .
but germany seems to be experiencing a growing interest in the continent .
after schröder ’ s visit , president johannes rau will go to africa .
foreign minister joschka fischer and the state secretary in the foreign office , kerstin müller , have frequently visited the region in an effort to drum up support for peace initiatives in countries like sudan and the congo .
schröder sees his country ’ s interest in africa as a continuation of germany ’ s foreign policy .
" we ’ re trying to make it clear that it ’ s worth countries ’ while to help themselves .
the reason is quite simple , " he says .
" a stable africa is in our own interest .
the fight against international terrorism will only be successful if africa manages to offer people a future , one in which they can live or at least survive . "
new dimension in africa policy the focus on security represents a shift in germany ’ s relations with africa , which was previously confined to development aid .
schröder says the joint emphasis on security and economic development is the key to future dealings with africa .
although still not as developed as north america , asia or europe , the chancellor is convinced that economic cooperation with africa could lead to a " potentially huge market . "
" we should not be talking down the potential , " he says referring to critics , who quickly dismiss investment as a waste of effort .
" it ’ s not just about raw materials , it ’ s also about people ’ s willingness to roll up their sleeves and get down to work on their own behalf . "
" i think it ’ s in our own interest to help them . "
guilt over colonial past ?
schröder denies that germany ’ s colonial history has any bearing on his country ’ s current and future interest in africa .
" there have been some very dark chapters in our history .
one must only think of the hereros in namibia .
but that ’ s a long time ago , and many of the emotional wounds have healed , " he says .
" o course , we can not allow ourselves to forget the past , but it ’ s not the driving force behind a sensible africa policy .
it 's more about the here and now .
there can be no question that this continent must have a future , and it will .

german investment fund increases aid to developing world german development finance institute deg gave its annual report this week , announcing that it had increased its aid to developing countries by 9 percent in 2003 and contributed some € 506 million to projects around the world .
berlin pledges fresh aid for africa on the first stop of his six-day trip to africa , germany 's chancellor pledged development aid , security aid and debt forgiveness to ethiopia and other sub-saharan nations .

such an opportunity wo n't come up again anytime soon . germany is preparing to host the 2006 soccer world championship , and despite the fact that its coffers are empty , it will conjure up more than € 6 billion -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- to beef up its infrastructure in time for the tournament . economics minister wolfgang clement announced that the government would invest € 2 billion in building stadiums , € 3.9 billion in roadworks and € 500 million in traffic management systems in time for sports fans to descend on this soccer-crazed nation .
clement announced his intentions at an investors conference in leipzig aimed at making the financial most of the sporting event . image polishing " this world championship is for the time being a singular chance to show the world our economy 's power of innovation and to polish clean the ' made in germany ' brand , " clement told the politicians , businesspeople and sportsmen and women rallying in leipzig . indeed , germany wo n't have a similar opportunity anytime soon .
since fifa , the world soccer organization , chooses the sites for the tournament according to a system of rotation , europe wo n't get the games again until 2030 , at the earliest . by the time the tournament starts , on june 9 , 2006 , in munich 's olympic stadium , autobahn stretches , such as the route to prague and train lines , such as the segment between hamburg and berlin , should have been re-hauled .
stadiums should be linked with modern traffic-routing systems .
clement reckoned that investments related to the world cup would total from € 8-10 billion by 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement , left , michael rogowski , and franz beckenbauer at the wm investment conference in leipzig jan .

in 1974 , recalled clement , television finally caught on throughout the country thanks to the soccer world championship , then held in germany .
he suggested that 2006 could result in a breakthrough for high resolution television . backing up clement , franz beckenbauer , head of the organizing committee and former soccer champ , said up to 30 billion people would watch the competition on tv .
germany should make a good showing with so many people looking , he said .
aside from the tv viewers , 3.2 million guests - two-thirds from abroad - were expected to make their way to the world cup . big players , like adidas , one of the official sponsors of the world championship , have already staked out their shares .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 25.01.2004 schröder renews german interest in ' forgotten continent ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder addresses the african union at the start of his africa tour .
chancellor gerhard schröder concludes his six-day , four-country tour of africa with a stop in ghana on friday .
dw-tv met up with the german leader and asked him about his country ’ s growing interest in the continent . his first official visit to africa is already being hailed a success back in berlin .
after spending six days jetting across the continent with high-profile stops in ethiopia , kenya , south africa and ghana , schröder hopes to have driven home his point that africa is not only about war , famine and disease , and that germany is not only interested in the continent as a recipient of development aid , but rather that there are political and economic initiatives worthy of promoting .
speaking to dw-tv while in south africa , schröder says he is satisfied with the results of his visit , his first official one to the continent : " i think we made clear that germany wants to take an active involvement in those places where what ’ s called " good governance " is practiced . "
" these countries are making a genuine effort to stand on their own two feet , which is something we support , " he explains .
" they are trying to enforce the rule of law and principles of democracy .
and they ’ re trying to establish regional alliances that can promote trade and give us the opportunity to get involved in even bigger markets . "
the forgotten continent ?
africa has often been referred to as the " forgotten continent . "
europe , which once had an active interest in its development , has pretty much neglected the region except for the occasional peacekeeping missions to former colonies and the regular flow of humanitarian and economic aid .
but germany seems to be experiencing a growing interest in the continent .
after schröder ’ s visit , president johannes rau will go to africa .
foreign minister joschka fischer and the state secretary in the foreign office , kerstin müller , have frequently visited the region in an effort to drum up support for peace initiatives in countries like sudan and the congo .
schröder sees his country ’ s interest in africa as a continuation of germany ’ s foreign policy .
" we ’ re trying to make it clear that it ’ s worth countries ’ while to help themselves .
the reason is quite simple , " he says .
" a stable africa is in our own interest .
the fight against international terrorism will only be successful if africa manages to offer people a future , one in which they can live or at least survive . "
new dimension in africa policy the focus on security represents a shift in germany ’ s relations with africa , which was previously confined to development aid .
schröder says the joint emphasis on security and economic development is the key to future dealings with africa .
although still not as developed as north america , asia or europe , the chancellor is convinced that economic cooperation with africa could lead to a " potentially huge market . "
" we should not be talking down the potential , " he says referring to critics , who quickly dismiss investment as a waste of effort .
" it ’ s not just about raw materials , it ’ s also about people ’ s willingness to roll up their sleeves and get down to work on their own behalf . "
" i think it ’ s in our own interest to help them . "
guilt over colonial past ?
schröder denies that germany ’ s colonial history has any bearing on his country ’ s current and future interest in africa .
" there have been some very dark chapters in our history .
one must only think of the hereros in namibia .
but that ’ s a long time ago , and many of the emotional wounds have healed , " he says .
" o course , we can not allow ourselves to forget the past , but it ’ s not the driving force behind a sensible africa policy .
it 's more about the here and now .
there can be no question that this continent must have a future , and it will .

german investment fund increases aid to developing world german development finance institute deg gave its annual report this week , announcing that it had increased its aid to developing countries by 9 percent in 2003 and contributed some € 506 million to projects around the world .
berlin pledges fresh aid for africa on the first stop of his six-day trip to africa , germany 's chancellor pledged development aid , security aid and debt forgiveness to ethiopia and other sub-saharan nations .

chancellor gerhard schröder concludes his six-day , four-country tour of africa with a stop in ghana on friday .
dw-tv met up with the german leader and asked him about his country ’ s growing interest in the continent . his first official visit to africa is already being hailed a success back in berlin .
after spending six days jetting across the continent with high-profile stops in ethiopia , kenya , south africa and ghana , schröder hopes to have driven home his point that africa is not only about war , famine and disease , and that germany is not only interested in the continent as a recipient of development aid , but rather that there are political and economic initiatives worthy of promoting .
speaking to dw-tv while in south africa , schröder says he is satisfied with the results of his visit , his first official one to the continent : " i think we made clear that germany wants to take an active involvement in those places where what ’ s called " good governance " is practiced . "
" these countries are making a genuine effort to stand on their own two feet , which is something we support , " he explains .
" they are trying to enforce the rule of law and principles of democracy .
and they ’ re trying to establish regional alliances that can promote trade and give us the opportunity to get involved in even bigger markets . "
the forgotten continent ?
africa has often been referred to as the " forgotten continent . "
europe , which once had an active interest in its development , has pretty much neglected the region except for the occasional peacekeeping missions to former colonies and the regular flow of humanitarian and economic aid .
but germany seems to be experiencing a growing interest in the continent .
after schröder ’ s visit , president johannes rau will go to africa .
foreign minister joschka fischer and the state secretary in the foreign office , kerstin müller , have frequently visited the region in an effort to drum up support for peace initiatives in countries like sudan and the congo .
schröder sees his country ’ s interest in africa as a continuation of germany ’ s foreign policy .
" we ’ re trying to make it clear that it ’ s worth countries ’ while to help themselves .
the reason is quite simple , " he says .
" a stable africa is in our own interest .
the fight against international terrorism will only be successful if africa manages to offer people a future , one in which they can live or at least survive . "
new dimension in africa policy the focus on security represents a shift in germany ’ s relations with africa , which was previously confined to development aid .
schröder says the joint emphasis on security and economic development is the key to future dealings with africa .
although still not as developed as north america , asia or europe , the chancellor is convinced that economic cooperation with africa could lead to a " potentially huge market . "
" we should not be talking down the potential , " he says referring to critics , who quickly dismiss investment as a waste of effort .
" it ’ s not just about raw materials , it ’ s also about people ’ s willingness to roll up their sleeves and get down to work on their own behalf . "
" i think it ’ s in our own interest to help them . "
guilt over colonial past ?
schröder denies that germany ’ s colonial history has any bearing on his country ’ s current and future interest in africa .
" there have been some very dark chapters in our history .
one must only think of the hereros in namibia .
but that ’ s a long time ago , and many of the emotional wounds have healed , " he says .
" o course , we can not allow ourselves to forget the past , but it ’ s not the driving force behind a sensible africa policy .
it 's more about the here and now .
there can be no question that this continent must have a future , and it will .

german investment fund increases aid to developing world german development finance institute deg gave its annual report this week , announcing that it had increased its aid to developing countries by 9 percent in 2003 and contributed some € 506 million to projects around the world .

german development finance institute deg gave its annual report this week , announcing it had increased its aid to developing countries by 9 percent in 2003 and contributed some € 506 million to projects around the world . with chancellor gerhard schröder touring africa , germany has been taking stock of its economic ties to the continent and reviewing its development aid schemes .
development financier deg -lrb- german investment and development foundation -rrb- has been making investments in africa for some four decades , in 2003 committing a total of € 80 million to businesses in south africa , mozambique , kenya and nigeria alone .
its projects aim to encourage sustainable growth and improve living conditions .
among other things , funding went to a leasing company in egypt , the cement industry in algeria , and mobile phone networks in algeria and nigeria .
the deg also has close to € 4 million invested with the industrial promotion services kenya , which furnishes east african companies with capital and management expertise .
a high volume of new business despite the global economic slump , the war in iraq , sars in asia and political and economic unrest in latin america , the deg has had a good year .
the bank , which lends money to german medium-sized companies investing in developing countries and emerging markets , saw its highest ever volume of new business since its founding 41 years ago .
with a portfolio of € 2,400 million , the deg is one of the biggest specialist banks concentrating on private sector promotion in europe .
its spokesman winfried polte points out that " without such institutions , many investment projects in asia , africa and eastern europe simply could n't be financed . "
deg invests in private companies that create jobs and income , thereby boosting the market economy and helping the individual .
in polte 's words , the " long-term investment financings render a major contribution to a sustainable development in the target countries . "
regional awareness " our perception of africa is marked by wars , famine and suffering , " says polte , but he 's quick to point out that " there are countries and industries with promising developments offering interesting business opportunities for foreign investors . "
polte is proud of one deg-backed scheme in particular . " one of our projects in egpyt won the alternative nobel prize , " he explains , adding that " the sekem holding makes organic pharmaceutical products and is exemplary in its benefits program for employees - the farmers - as it makes available broad social services such as schools and health centers . "
deg focuses on long term investments under market conditions .
but it is aware that africa has its unique problems and writes clauses into its contracts designed to help stop the spread of aids , for instance .
polte explains that the " contracts include a paragraph in which companies agree to offer staff a free test , regular information events and then practical things such as condom vending machines . "
end of an era here in europe , the entry of 10 new member states into the european union will be a new departure for many in the business world .
but for the deg , it means the end of an era.they will be leaving the new eu states in eastern europe and moving even further to the east .
these days , the focus of deg 's activities is on asia .
the bank has committed some € 18 million to a total of six projects in china alone .
polte points out that " in china we concentrate mainly on the agricultural sector .
we have three excellent companies there , two of which have now gone international " .
he also observes that the deg sees promoting networks as part of its task .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany still lighting up much of europe bans smoking ; germany keeps puffing away germany : european smoker 's paradise germany gets eu slap on the wrist over tobacco laws germany 's close ties to big tobacco germany -pipe- 25.01.2004 where there 's smoke , there 's germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite health warnings on cigarettes , germans are unlikely to kick the habit .
" smoking can cause a slow and painful death " reads one of the new warnings on cigarette packets in germany .
but there is doubt as to just how seriously such in-the-face warnings are being taken . it takes a visit to germany to believe just how smoky a society it is .
ranking third after spain and greece when it comes to the number of smokers on its books , germany celebrates smoking as a way of life .
it is so ingrained that the printed threats which dominate 21st century cigarette packets seem unlikely to scare too many smokers into stubbing out for good . although official statistics show that cigarette sales in 2003 dropped by nine percent over the previous year , and big brand producers have reported trailing sales in germany , there is no doubt that the german population is still puffing away .
in reality , more smokers have been turning to rolling tobacco and cigars , which have been spared the higher taxation rates dumped on cigarettes over the past couple of years . there is also evidence that more and more smokers are turning to unofficial sources to feed their habit .
a spokesman for british american tobacco , which puts its name to the likes of lucky strike and gauloises blondes , told the reuters news agency that increased tobacco taxes might blow smokers out of their clutch and onto the black market .
" our concern is that the new taxes will not stop people smoking , but that they will turn to the black market and cheaper forms of tobacco , " he said . some fear that the trend in buying cheaper cigarettes will grow once the eu opens its eastern borders to accession members in may .
head of the association of german cigarette producers , ernst brückner , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that once the borders are open , smokers who live near poland , for example , will systematically shop in the neighboring country in order to circumnavigate further tax hikes planned by the german government over the next two years .
the first of these increases will push the price of a packet of smokes up from its currently modest european rate of € 3 -lrb- $ 3.80 -rrb- by a further euro . keeping the smoke out of bars earlier this month , the eu commission announced it was considering a move to outlaw smoking in bars and restaurants across the 15 member states .
european health commissioner david byrne told die welt newspaper that if the eu were thinking of introducing smoke-free work places , they would have to extend the ban to include bars and restaurants . the suggestion met with rigid resistance in germany , where relaxing in a bar with a stick of nicotine and preferred tipple is quite simply part of the fabric of society .
german cities are splitting at the seams with bars and restaurants and at best only one in two of them have a designated smoking section with the rest of the hostelry deemed smoke free . marc schnerr , press officer at the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- told dw-world that he believed david byrne was on the warpath against smokers , and added that any move to ban smokers from lighting up in gastronomic venues would have disastrous consequences for jobs in the industry . " take small bars for example , they do n't have the space to section off a no-smoking area , and a ban would mean massive reductions in turnover for them , " schnerr said .
the knock-on effect of that , he added , was the threat to thousands of jobs and trainee positions in the industry . too many laws schnerr believes that germans feel they are surrounded by more than enough legislation as it is , and that the implementation of smoking laws in places traditionally reserved for fun would rob the nation of the last place where smokers and non-smokers can relax under the same public roof . he believes the issue has to be dealt with on an individual basis .
it should be left up to the businesses themselves .
people go to these places voluntarily and they are not inconsiderate of one another once there , the dhg spokesman told dw-world . he also stressed that his organisation was always at pains to encourage hoteliers and restaurant owners to take the wishes of non-smokers into consideration .
as long as they continue to provide enough places for both smokers and non-smokers to go , he believes the thousands of jobs which would be blown away with a ban , will be kept from going up in smoke . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clouds of smoke over europe not only germany is having to deal with the foggy issue of what to do with determined smokers , many european countries have been looking for ways to encourage their citizens quit .

head of the association of german cigarette producers , ernst brückner , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that once the borders are open , smokers who live near poland , for example , will systematically shop in the neighboring country in order to circumnavigate further tax hikes planned by the german government over the next two years .
the first of these increases will push the price of a packet of smokes up from its currently modest european rate of € 3 -lrb- $ 3.80 -rrb- by a further euro . keeping the smoke out of bars earlier this month , the eu commission announced it was considering a move to outlaw smoking in bars and restaurants across the 15 member states .
european health commissioner david byrne told die welt newspaper that if the eu were thinking of introducing smoke-free work places , they would have to extend the ban to include bars and restaurants . the suggestion met with rigid resistance in germany , where relaxing in a bar with a stick of nicotine and preferred tipple is quite simply part of the fabric of society .
german cities are splitting at the seams with bars and restaurants and at best only one in two of them have a designated smoking section with the rest of the hostelry deemed smoke free . marc schnerr , press officer at the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- told dw-world that he believed david byrne was on the warpath against smokers , and added that any move to ban smokers from lighting up in gastronomic venues would have disastrous consequences for jobs in the industry . " take small bars for example , they do n't have the space to section off a no-smoking area , and a ban would mean massive reductions in turnover for them , " schnerr said .
the knock-on effect of that , he added , was the threat to thousands of jobs and trainee positions in the industry . too many laws schnerr believes that germans feel they are surrounded by more than enough legislation as it is , and that the implementation of smoking laws in places traditionally reserved for fun would rob the nation of the last place where smokers and non-smokers can relax under the same public roof . he believes the issue has to be dealt with on an individual basis .
it should be left up to the businesses themselves .
people go to these places voluntarily and they are not inconsiderate of one another once there , the dhg spokesman told dw-world . he also stressed that his organisation was always at pains to encourage hoteliers and restaurant owners to take the wishes of non-smokers into consideration .
as long as they continue to provide enough places for both smokers and non-smokers to go , he believes the thousands of jobs which would be blown away with a ban , will be kept from going up in smoke . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clouds of smoke over europe not only germany is having to deal with the foggy issue of what to do with determined smokers , many european countries have been looking for ways to encourage their citizens quit .

" smoking can cause a slow and painful death " reads one of the new warnings on cigarette packets in germany .
but there is doubt as to just how seriously such in-the-face warnings are being taken . it takes a visit to germany to believe just how smoky a society it is .
ranking third after spain and greece when it comes to the number of smokers on its books , germany celebrates smoking as a way of life .
it is so ingrained that the printed threats which dominate 21st century cigarette packets seem unlikely to scare too many smokers into stubbing out for good . although official statistics show that cigarette sales in 2003 dropped by nine percent over the previous year , and big brand producers have reported trailing sales in germany , there is no doubt that the german population is still puffing away .
in reality , more smokers have been turning to rolling tobacco and cigars , which have been spared the higher taxation rates dumped on cigarettes over the past couple of years . there is also evidence that more and more smokers are turning to unofficial sources to feed their habit .
a spokesman for british american tobacco , which puts its name to the likes of lucky strike and gauloises blondes , told the reuters news agency that increased tobacco taxes might blow smokers out of their clutch and onto the black market .
" our concern is that the new taxes will not stop people smoking , but that they will turn to the black market and cheaper forms of tobacco , " he said . some fear that the trend in buying cheaper cigarettes will grow once the eu opens its eastern borders to accession members in may .
head of the association of german cigarette producers , ernst brückner , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that once the borders are open , smokers who live near poland , for example , will systematically shop in the neighboring country in order to circumnavigate further tax hikes planned by the german government over the next two years .
the first of these increases will push the price of a packet of smokes up from its currently modest european rate of € 3 -lrb- $ 3.80 -rrb- by a further euro . keeping the smoke out of bars earlier this month , the eu commission announced it was considering a move to outlaw smoking in bars and restaurants across the 15 member states .
european health commissioner david byrne told die welt newspaper that if the eu were thinking of introducing smoke-free work places , they would have to extend the ban to include bars and restaurants . the suggestion met with rigid resistance in germany , where relaxing in a bar with a stick of nicotine and preferred tipple is quite simply part of the fabric of society .
german cities are splitting at the seams with bars and restaurants and at best only one in two of them have a designated smoking section with the rest of the hostelry deemed smoke free . marc schnerr , press officer at the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- told dw-world that he believed david byrne was on the warpath against smokers , and added that any move to ban smokers from lighting up in gastronomic venues would have disastrous consequences for jobs in the industry . " take small bars for example , they do n't have the space to section off a no-smoking area , and a ban would mean massive reductions in turnover for them , " schnerr said .
the knock-on effect of that , he added , was the threat to thousands of jobs and trainee positions in the industry . too many laws schnerr believes that germans feel they are surrounded by more than enough legislation as it is , and that the implementation of smoking laws in places traditionally reserved for fun would rob the nation of the last place where smokers and non-smokers can relax under the same public roof . he believes the issue has to be dealt with on an individual basis .
it should be left up to the businesses themselves .
people go to these places voluntarily and they are not inconsiderate of one another once there , the dhg spokesman told dw-world . he also stressed that his organisation was always at pains to encourage hoteliers and restaurant owners to take the wishes of non-smokers into consideration .
as long as they continue to provide enough places for both smokers and non-smokers to go , he believes the thousands of jobs which would be blown away with a ban , will be kept from going up in smoke . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clouds of smoke over europe not only germany is having to deal with the foggy issue of what to do with determined smokers , many european countries have been looking for ways to encourage their citizens quit .

from raising the price of cigarettes to installing bans in the workplace , many european countries have been looking for ways to get their citizens to quit smoking without infringing on their personal rights . although european health commissioner , david byrne has been publicly mulling over the possibility of seeking an all-out eu ban on smoking in the workplace , so far there are no europe-wide regulations on smoking or the price of tobacco - which currently ranges from € 2 -lrb- $ 2.50 -rrb- to € 7.20 for a packet of 20 cigarettes .
earlier this month , france called on the european commission to up the minimum eu excise duty on a packet of cigarettes , thus putting a stop to stobacco tourism .

from raising the price of cigarettes to installing bans in the workplace , many european countries have been looking for ways to get their citizens to quit smoking without infringing on their personal rights . although european health commissioner , david byrne has been publicly mulling over the possibility of seeking an all-out eu ban on smoking in the workplace , so far there are no europe-wide regulations on smoking or the price of tobacco - which currently ranges from € 2 -lrb- $ 2.50 -rrb- to € 7.20 for a packet of 20 cigarettes .
earlier this month , france called on the european commission to up the minimum eu excise duty on a packet of cigarettes , thus putting a stop to stobacco tourism .
but eu tax commissioner fritz bolkenstein said the proposals would be unlikely to succeed as it was a fundamental eu freedom to carry legally purchased goods from one country to another without incurring additional taxation .

cigarette prices have risen by 70 cents in the past two years , putting the cost of a pack at € 3.90 .
there are also plans to take the eu regulatory health warnings a step further by adding shocking photos to the packaging .
smoking on trains has been outlawed and belgian workplaces are to be made completely smoke-free by 2006 .
france : tobacco prices have risen three times in the past 12 months and currently cost € 5 .
france says that the increase has proved its effectiveness in the fight against nicotine addiction , but since the rise french tobacconists have bemoaned the loss of business , with smokers preferring to cross the border to luxembourg , belgium and spain to buy cigarettes at a cheaper rate .
greece : with some 44 percent of the greeks over the age of 15 confirmed smokers , greece is the smokiest country in the eu .
laws passed in 2002 outlawed smoking in many public areas and introduced designated areas in restaurants across the country .

bars and restaurants won a temporary reprieve on condition that they find a solution by 2005 .
one third of holland 's 16 million-strong population currently smokes , and the move is aimed at slashing that number back by five percent over the next five years .
ireland : the emerald isle has been in the headlines over a planned smoking ban , originally due to come into effect at the start of the year .
however , the ban , which is to be imposed in all work places including bars and restaurants , was postponed at least until february due to dubliners concerns that it might not be watertight .
the pending law has met with fierce opposition from the gastronomy industry , which fears a drop in takings if smokers are no longer allowed to feed their habits on the premises .
spain : although the number of smokers in spain has fallen from 34.4 million to 31 million , it still has one of the highest smoker rates in europe .
it is something of a national sport , a fact which critics gladly blame on the low cost of cigarettes .
at € 2.65 a packet , the price is below the european average , but the government recently rejected calls to significantly up the price because of the inflationary affect this would have .

german development finance institute deg gave its annual report this week , announcing it had increased its aid to developing countries by 9 percent in 2003 and contributed some € 506 million to projects around the world . with chancellor gerhard schröder touring africa , germany has been taking stock of its economic ties to the continent and reviewing its development aid schemes .
development financier deg -lrb- german investment and development foundation -rrb- has been making investments in africa for some four decades , in 2003 committing a total of € 80 million to businesses in south africa , mozambique , kenya and nigeria alone .
its projects aim to encourage sustainable growth and improve living conditions .
among other things , funding went to a leasing company in egypt , the cement industry in algeria , and mobile phone networks in algeria and nigeria .
the deg also has close to € 4 million invested with the industrial promotion services kenya , which furnishes east african companies with capital and management expertise .
a high volume of new business despite the global economic slump , the war in iraq , sars in asia and political and economic unrest in latin america , the deg has had a good year .
the bank , which lends money to german medium-sized companies investing in developing countries and emerging markets , saw its highest ever volume of new business since its founding 41 years ago .
with a portfolio of € 2,400 million , the deg is one of the biggest specialist banks concentrating on private sector promotion in europe .
its spokesman winfried polte points out that " without such institutions , many investment projects in asia , africa and eastern europe simply could n't be financed . "
deg invests in private companies that create jobs and income , thereby boosting the market economy and helping the individual .
in polte 's words , the " long-term investment financings render a major contribution to a sustainable development in the target countries . "
regional awareness " our perception of africa is marked by wars , famine and suffering , " says polte , but he 's quick to point out that " there are countries and industries with promising developments offering interesting business opportunities for foreign investors . "
polte is proud of one deg-backed scheme in particular . " one of our projects in egpyt won the alternative nobel prize , " he explains , adding that " the sekem holding makes organic pharmaceutical products and is exemplary in its benefits program for employees - the farmers - as it makes available broad social services such as schools and health centers . "
deg focuses on long term investments under market conditions .
but it is aware that africa has its unique problems and writes clauses into its contracts designed to help stop the spread of aids , for instance .
polte explains that the " contracts include a paragraph in which companies agree to offer staff a free test , regular information events and then practical things such as condom vending machines . "
end of an era here in europe , the entry of 10 new member states into the european union will be a new departure for many in the business world .
but for the deg , it means the end of an era.they will be leaving the new eu states in eastern europe and moving even further to the east .
these days , the focus of deg 's activities is on asia .
the bank has committed some € 18 million to a total of six projects in china alone .
polte points out that " in china we concentrate mainly on the agricultural sector .
we have three excellent companies there , two of which have now gone international " .
he also observes that the deg sees promoting networks as part of its task .

gunther von hagens , who preserves human bodies to exhibit them , has denied using corpses of executed chinese in his shows .
hagens ' critics meanwhile reiterated claims that the exhibitions violate german law . wearing his signature fedora , the controversial german doctor defended his business practices after german news magazine der spiegel raised questions about his work in a cover story this week .
" i have not turned corpses of the executed into exhibits , " hagens said , but added that he could n't guarantee that bodies of executed people had never been dropped off at his production facility in dalian in northeastern china .
a common chinese practice ?
accepting unidentified bodies from the police was common practice at dalian university 's institute for plastination , hagens said , adding that his company worked closely with the institute .
plastination is the technique developed by hagens to turn corpses into odorless and durable exhibits by draining out bodily fluids and fat and replacing them with plastic .
taking these so-called " ownerless bodies " is " a completely normal thing to do and was customary in germany until the 1980s , " hagens told reporters in frankfurt , where " body worlds " is currently on show .
he added that he had instructed his employees not to accept bodies of the executed any more .
der spiegel had reported that at least two bodies included in an inventory list of hagens ' dalian facility had bullet holes in their heads .
" but not every corpse with a bullet hole has been executed , " he said , implying that some might have been victims of a crime .
documents made available to the german news magazine , however , show that hagens knew for at least two years that executed bodies were used in his work .
according to der spiegel , a former employee of the dalian institute threatened to go to the chinese media with the " true story " of the fresh corpses , but was then silenced with a large sum of money .

gunther von hagens , who preserves human bodies to exhibit them , has denied using corpses of executed chinese in his shows .
hagens ' critics meanwhile reiterated claims that the exhibitions violate german law . wearing his signature fedora , the controversial german doctor defended his business practices after german news magazine der spiegel raised questions about his work in a cover story this week .
" i have not turned corpses of the executed into exhibits , " hagens said , but added that he could n't guarantee that bodies of executed people had never been dropped off at his production facility in dalian in northeastern china .
a common chinese practice ?
accepting unidentified bodies from the police was common practice at dalian university 's institute for plastination , hagens said , adding that his company worked closely with the institute .
plastination is the technique developed by hagens to turn corpses into odorless and durable exhibits by draining out bodily fluids and fat and replacing them with plastic .
taking these so-called " ownerless bodies " is " a completely normal thing to do and was customary in germany until the 1980s , " hagens told reporters in frankfurt , where " body worlds " is currently on show .
he added that he had instructed his employees not to accept bodies of the executed any more .
der spiegel had reported that at least two bodies included in an inventory list of hagens ' dalian facility had bullet holes in their heads .
" but not every corpse with a bullet hole has been executed , " he said , implying that some might have been victims of a crime .
documents made available to the german news magazine , however , show that hagens knew for at least two years that executed bodies were used in his work .
according to der spiegel , a former employee of the dalian institute threatened to go to the chinese media with the " true story " of the fresh corpses , but was then silenced with a large sum of money .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.01.2004 mars express finds ice and water großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an image of the southern polar cap of mars european scientists confirmed that instruments on the mars express probe have detected ice and water on the red planet , providing further evidence that h2o may have flowed across the planet ’ s surface in the past . images of mars ’ reull vallis show a dramatic canyon that resembles the grand canyon .
scientists now believe it was once carved out by a mighty river or a massive glacier .
thanks to new data from the instruments aboard the mars express probe released by the european space agency on friday , they have their best evidence yet .
taken together , the images and data provide compelling evidence that there are ice sheets beneath the martian crust and that water once flowed across the red planet ’ s surface . ” you look at the picture , look at the fingerprint and say this is water ice , ” mars express project manager allen moorehouse said at mission control in darmstadt , germany .
“ this is the first time it ’ s been detected on the ground .
this is the first direct confirmation . ”
using a combined camera and infrared spectrometer , mars express ’ omega instrument began mapping the planet ’ s south polar cap on jan .
18 .
omega has indirectly detected the presence of both water ice and carbon dioxide ice , esa said .
the discovery clearly pleased scientists at esa , who suffered a setback in december with the likely destruction of its beagle 2 lander , which was intended to probe the surface of mars for organic matter and other signs of life . ” i did not expect to be able to gather together , just one month after the mars orbit insertion of dec .
25 , so many happy scientists eager to present their first results , ” said esa director of science david southwood .
european scientists hope to find large reserves of ice beneath the surface of mars that can be used to supply water and fuel for future manned space missions .
water molecules detected ” it ’ s been looked at for such a long time and it ’ s been inferred there was water at the south pole , ” said jean-pierre bibring an esa scientist from the institute of space astrophysics in orsay , france .
bibring said an infrared camera on board mars express had detected vapors of water molecules .
“ this is the first time we can really see vapors of the molecules themselves , ” he said .
evidence of water has been found by multiple instruments on mars express and the satellite has also found evidence that water is being pulled from mars into space , a theory scientists have long suspected .
in march 2002 , nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter indirectly detected water ice on the planet ’ s southern pole using a gamma ray spectrometer that found hydrogen which , when combined with air , creates water .
the european mission provides independent confirmation of nasa ’ s earlier finding .
but taken together with other experiments , including high-resolution maps showing what was likely the effects of erosion on the landscape caused by water , esa has provided the strongest proof yet . ” previous measurements have been indirect and this is the first time we have direct indications of molecules that are present in water , ” southwood said .
“ of course , finding anything that has to do with water on mars is sort of a holy grail .
this is certainly better than anything we ’ ve had so far . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this picture was taken by the high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- onboard esa 's mars express orbiter , in colour and 3d , in orbit 18 on 15 january 2004 from a height of 273 km .
the location is east of the hellas basin at 41 ° south and 101 ° east .
the area is 100 km across , with a resolution of 12 m per pixel , and shows a channel -lrb- reull vallis -rrb- once formed by flowing water .

neukum and his crew have already gathered more than 100 gigabytes of data from the camera .
he said he hoped the camera would be able to detect if some of the rocks on mars are actually blocks of ice .
mars express first entered into martian orbit at christmas .
it will continue delivering data from its scientific instruments for the next two years . ” europe can be proud of this mission , ” said edelgard bulmahn , germany ’ s minister for research and education .

german development finance institute deg gave its annual report this week , announcing it had increased its aid to developing countries by 9 percent in 2003 and contributed some € 506 million to projects around the world . with chancellor gerhard schröder touring africa , germany has been taking stock of its economic ties to the continent and reviewing its development aid schemes .
development financier deg -lrb- german investment and development foundation -rrb- has been making investments in africa for some four decades , in 2003 committing a total of € 80 million to businesses in south africa , mozambique , kenya and nigeria alone .
its projects aim to encourage sustainable growth and improve living conditions .
among other things , funding went to a leasing company in egypt , the cement industry in algeria , and mobile phone networks in algeria and nigeria .
the deg also has close to € 4 million invested with the industrial promotion services kenya , which furnishes east african companies with capital and management expertise .
a high volume of new business despite the global economic slump , the war in iraq , sars in asia and political and economic unrest in latin america , the deg has had a good year .
the bank , which lends money to german medium-sized companies investing in developing countries and emerging markets , saw its highest ever volume of new business since its founding 41 years ago .
with a portfolio of € 2,400 million , the deg is one of the biggest specialist banks concentrating on private sector promotion in europe .
its spokesman winfried polte points out that " without such institutions , many investment projects in asia , africa and eastern europe simply could n't be financed . "
deg invests in private companies that create jobs and income , thereby boosting the market economy and helping the individual .
in polte 's words , the " long-term investment financings render a major contribution to a sustainable development in the target countries . "
regional awareness " our perception of africa is marked by wars , famine and suffering , " says polte , but he 's quick to point out that " there are countries and industries with promising developments offering interesting business opportunities for foreign investors . "
polte is proud of one deg-backed scheme in particular . " one of our projects in egpyt won the alternative nobel prize , " he explains , adding that " the sekem holding makes organic pharmaceutical products and is exemplary in its benefits program for employees - the farmers - as it makes available broad social services such as schools and health centers . "
deg focuses on long term investments under market conditions .
but it is aware that africa has its unique problems and writes clauses into its contracts designed to help stop the spread of aids , for instance .
polte explains that the " contracts include a paragraph in which companies agree to offer staff a free test , regular information events and then practical things such as condom vending machines . "
end of an era here in europe , the entry of 10 new member states into the european union will be a new departure for many in the business world .
but for the deg , it means the end of an era.they will be leaving the new eu states in eastern europe and moving even further to the east .
these days , the focus of deg 's activities is on asia .
the bank has committed some € 18 million to a total of six projects in china alone .
polte points out that " in china we concentrate mainly on the agricultural sector .
we have three excellent companies there , two of which have now gone international " .

development financier deg -lrb- german investment and development foundation -rrb- has been making investments in africa for some four decades , in 2003 committing a total of € 80 million to businesses in south africa , mozambique , kenya and nigeria alone .
its projects aim to encourage sustainable growth and improve living conditions .
among other things , funding went to a leasing company in egypt , the cement industry in algeria , and mobile phone networks in algeria and nigeria .
the deg also has close to € 4 million invested with the industrial promotion services kenya , which furnishes east african companies with capital and management expertise .
a high volume of new business despite the global economic slump , the war in iraq , sars in asia and political and economic unrest in latin america , the deg has had a good year .
the bank , which lends money to german medium-sized companies investing in developing countries and emerging markets , saw its highest ever volume of new business since its founding 41 years ago .
with a portfolio of € 2,400 million , the deg is one of the biggest specialist banks concentrating on private sector promotion in europe .
its spokesman winfried polte points out that " without such institutions , many investment projects in asia , africa and eastern europe simply could n't be financed . "
deg invests in private companies that create jobs and income , thereby boosting the market economy and helping the individual .
in polte 's words , the " long-term investment financings render a major contribution to a sustainable development in the target countries . "
regional awareness " our perception of africa is marked by wars , famine and suffering , " says polte , but he 's quick to point out that " there are countries and industries with promising developments offering interesting business opportunities for foreign investors . "
polte is proud of one deg-backed scheme in particular . " one of our projects in egpyt won the alternative nobel prize , " he explains , adding that " the sekem holding makes organic pharmaceutical products and is exemplary in its benefits program for employees - the farmers - as it makes available broad social services such as schools and health centers . "
deg focuses on long term investments under market conditions .
but it is aware that africa has its unique problems and writes clauses into its contracts designed to help stop the spread of aids , for instance .
polte explains that the " contracts include a paragraph in which companies agree to offer staff a free test , regular information events and then practical things such as condom vending machines . "
end of an era here in europe , the entry of 10 new member states into the european union will be a new departure for many in the business world .
but for the deg , it means the end of an era.they will be leaving the new eu states in eastern europe and moving even further to the east .
these days , the focus of deg 's activities is on asia .
the bank has committed some € 18 million to a total of six projects in china alone .
polte points out that " in china we concentrate mainly on the agricultural sector .
we have three excellent companies there , two of which have now gone international " .
he also observes that the deg sees promoting networks as part of its task .

gunther von hagens , who preserves human bodies to exhibit them , has denied using corpses of executed chinese in his shows .
hagens ' critics meanwhile reiterated claims that the exhibitions violate german law . wearing his signature fedora , the controversial german doctor defended his business practices after german news magazine der spiegel raised questions about his work in a cover story this week .
" i have not turned corpses of the executed into exhibits , " hagens said , but added that he could n't guarantee that bodies of executed people had never been dropped off at his production facility in dalian in northeastern china .
a common chinese practice ?
accepting unidentified bodies from the police was common practice at dalian university 's institute for plastination , hagens said , adding that his company worked closely with the institute .
plastination is the technique developed by hagens to turn corpses into odorless and durable exhibits by draining out bodily fluids and fat and replacing them with plastic .
taking these so-called " ownerless bodies " is " a completely normal thing to do and was customary in germany until the 1980s , " hagens told reporters in frankfurt , where " body worlds " is currently on show .
he added that he had instructed his employees not to accept bodies of the executed any more .
der spiegel had reported that at least two bodies included in an inventory list of hagens ' dalian facility had bullet holes in their heads .
" but not every corpse with a bullet hole has been executed , " he said , implying that some might have been victims of a crime .
documents made available to the german news magazine , however , show that hagens knew for at least two years that executed bodies were used in his work .
according to der spiegel , a former employee of the dalian institute threatened to go to the chinese media with the " true story " of the fresh corpses , but was then silenced with a large sum of money .

critics question exhibition 's legality while members of the german hospice foundation gathered outside the frankfurt exhibition to express their protest with coffins and candles , others were equally critical of hagens ' work .
uwe volkmann , a law professor in mainz in central germany , said the show violated german cemetery and burial laws , dpa news agency reported .
the german society for pathology added that hagens violates the rules of ethics in medicine .
a munich city official told reporters that germany needed to introduce a new law regulating plastination .
" there are many people who want to be plastinated , " said wilfried blume-beyerle .
the courts need to decide whether this is a new form of undertaking and what the ethical boundaries are , he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german accused of using bodies of executed in exhibits a professor who preserves human bodies for display in exhibitions allegedly used remains of people executed in china .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.01.2004 berlin honors photographer helmut newton großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agent provocateur - more than six decades pushing the limits of photography .
the german-born photographer died in a car accident in los angeles friday .
the self-proclaimed " king of kink , " who rose to fame with controversial images of women and fashion , will be honored with a new museum in berlin . celebrated , respected and controversial are just some of the words used to describe helmut newton .
best known for his provocative portraits of nude women , the berlin-born avant-garde fashion photographer spent some six decades transforming his craft and testing the limits of social acceptability .
" he was a giant , " said playboy founder hugh hefner .
" he was a major talent that pushed the boundaries in terms of photography and influenced many in following generations . "
for newton , his camera was a lens to explore power , gender roles and sexuality .
" i ’ m interested in power - i always was , whether it ’ s sexual power , financial power or political power , " he wrote in his 2002 autobiography .
bildunterschrift : retrospective exhibit in berlin 's new national gallery .
newton ’ s brazen and controversial style was exemplified in the 1980 and 1993 series " big nudes , " which featured larger-than-life images of women who were portrayed as dominating the camera rather than as subjects .
the stark black-and-white portraits were a shocking departure from conventional nude photos in their coldly erotic sensuality .
among one of the most famous images was a nude model with her neck in a surgical collar and one leg in a cast .
" he loves to be outrageous , " said anna wintour , who published much of newton ’ s work in vogue magazine .
" he has a perverse view of women that recurs again and again , " she said recently .
childhood in germany born in october 1920 , the son of a wealthy jewish button-manufacturer , newton enjoyed a privileged upbringing in berlin .
he attended the city ’ s american school , but because the photo-bug bit him early , he spent more time with his camera than his studies .
at the age of 15 , newton ’ s father told him , " my boy , you ’ ll end up in the gutter .
all you think of is girls and photos , " he wrote in his autobiography .
after leaving school in 1936 , the young newton worked as an apprentice to top photographer elsie simon , a job he held until forced to flee nazi-germany in 1938 .
after a brief stay in singapore , newton settled in australia , became a citizen and opened a small photography studio .
he also changed his name from neustädter to newton .
throughout his career he turned again and again to the subject of nazi germany , but not in a way typical for someone who lost loved ones in the concentration camps .
in a series of portraits , newton photographed hitler ’ s official filmmaker leni riefenstahl , former u.n. secretary general kurt waldheim , who was involved in nazi atrocities , and right-wing french political leader jean-marie le pen .
his own wife , june , posed in a 1973 series as hitler with model jerry hall posing as eva bruan .
but newton never dwelled on the past for long .
" i find this kind of living in the past useless and unproductive , " he wrote in his book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newton leaves 1,000 photographs to the city of berlin newton ’ s homecoming in october 2003 , newton recognized the importance his early life in berlin had on his career and donated more than 1,000 pictures to a new gallery in berlin .
at the opening , the photographer said he was " proud " his works would be displayed in his hometown .
" not just the nudes , but all the others " will be available for everyone to see , he said .
german chancellor gerhard schröder called newton ’ s decision a " sign of reconciliation . "
" you can chase a man out of his home but you can ’ t rip his home out of his soul , " the german leader said in a letter read at the news conference .
starting in june , newton 's works will be on permanent display in berlin ’ s former art library across the street from the central train station .
at the time of the donation , newton who has no children , suggested the city would eventually receive his entire archive .

from raising the price of cigarettes to installing bans in the workplace , many european countries have been looking for ways to get their citizens to quit smoking without infringing on their personal rights . although european health commissioner , david byrne has been publicly mulling over the possibility of seeking an all-out eu ban on smoking in the workplace , so far there are no europe-wide regulations on smoking or the price of tobacco - which currently ranges from € 2 -lrb- $ 2.50 -rrb- to € 7.20 for a packet of 20 cigarettes .
earlier this month , france called on the european commission to up the minimum eu excise duty on a packet of cigarettes , thus putting a stop to stobacco tourism .
but eu tax commissioner fritz bolkenstein said the proposals would be unlikely to succeed as it was a fundamental eu freedom to carry legally purchased goods from one country to another without incurring additional taxation .
but just how cheap or easy is it for smokers to light up around the continent ?
and is there still such a thing as a smokerrs paradise ?
belgium : with the highest rate of lung cancer fatalities in europe , brussels has gradually been toughening up the nation 's anti-smoking laws .
cigarette prices have risen by 70 cents in the past two years , putting the cost of a pack at € 3.90 .
there are also plans to take the eu regulatory health warnings a step further by adding shocking photos to the packaging .
smoking on trains has been outlawed and belgian workplaces are to be made completely smoke-free by 2006 .
france : tobacco prices have risen three times in the past 12 months and currently cost € 5 .
france says that the increase has proved its effectiveness in the fight against nicotine addiction , but since the rise french tobacconists have bemoaned the loss of business , with smokers preferring to cross the border to luxembourg , belgium and spain to buy cigarettes at a cheaper rate .
greece : with some 44 percent of the greeks over the age of 15 confirmed smokers , greece is the smokiest country in the eu .
laws passed in 2002 outlawed smoking in many public areas and introduced designated areas in restaurants across the country .
billboard tobacco advertising will be banned for five months this year to coincide with the olympics .
holland : the notoriously liberal netherlands became a bit more uptight , when a new law came into effect jan .
1 , 2004 , banning smokers from puffing in railway stations , trains , toilets and offices .
bars and restaurants won a temporary reprieve on condition that they find a solution by 2005 .
one third of holland 's 16 million-strong population currently smokes , and the move is aimed at slashing that number back by five percent over the next five years .
ireland : the emerald isle has been in the headlines over a planned smoking ban , originally due to come into effect at the start of the year .
however , the ban , which is to be imposed in all work places including bars and restaurants , was postponed at least until february due to dubliners concerns that it might not be watertight .
the pending law has met with fierce opposition from the gastronomy industry , which fears a drop in takings if smokers are no longer allowed to feed their habits on the premises .
spain : although the number of smokers in spain has fallen from 34.4 million to 31 million , it still has one of the highest smoker rates in europe .
it is something of a national sport , a fact which critics gladly blame on the low cost of cigarettes .
at € 2.65 a packet , the price is below the european average , but the government recently rejected calls to significantly up the price because of the inflationary affect this would have .
sweden : taking the lead from new york , which banned smoking in restaurants and bars earlier this year , sweden has pledged to do the same by 2005 .
the current laws entitle all employees to a smoke-free working environment , except for restaurant workers .
the government does n't believe there will be a negative economic effect .
united kingdom : while there is no law in britain which forces publicans to section of a non-smoking area , restaurants often provide one anyway .
smokers in the uk will more likely be put off by the extortionate cost of their habit .
at some € 6.5 , brits pay well over the european average for their little pack of 20 . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where there 's smoke , there 's germany " smoking can cause a slow and painful death " reads one of the new warnings on cigarette packets in germany .
but there is doubt as to just how seriously such in-the-face warnings are being taken .

scientists now believe it was once carved out by a mighty river or a massive glacier .
thanks to new data from the instruments aboard the mars express probe released by the european space agency on friday , they have their best evidence yet .
taken together , the images and data provide compelling evidence that there are ice sheets beneath the martian crust and that water once flowed across the red planet ’ s surface . ” you look at the picture , look at the fingerprint and say this is water ice , ” mars express project manager allen moorehouse said at mission control in darmstadt , germany .
“ this is the first time it ’ s been detected on the ground .
this is the first direct confirmation . ”
using a combined camera and infrared spectrometer , mars express ’ omega instrument began mapping the planet ’ s south polar cap on jan .
18 .
omega has indirectly detected the presence of both water ice and carbon dioxide ice , esa said .
the discovery clearly pleased scientists at esa , who suffered a setback in december with the likely destruction of its beagle 2 lander , which was intended to probe the surface of mars for organic matter and other signs of life . ” i did not expect to be able to gather together , just one month after the mars orbit insertion of dec .
25 , so many happy scientists eager to present their first results , ” said esa director of science david southwood .
european scientists hope to find large reserves of ice beneath the surface of mars that can be used to supply water and fuel for future manned space missions .
water molecules detected ” it ’ s been looked at for such a long time and it ’ s been inferred there was water at the south pole , ” said jean-pierre bibring an esa scientist from the institute of space astrophysics in orsay , france .
bibring said an infrared camera on board mars express had detected vapors of water molecules .
“ this is the first time we can really see vapors of the molecules themselves , ” he said .
evidence of water has been found by multiple instruments on mars express and the satellite has also found evidence that water is being pulled from mars into space , a theory scientists have long suspected .
in march 2002 , nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter indirectly detected water ice on the planet ’ s southern pole using a gamma ray spectrometer that found hydrogen which , when combined with air , creates water .
the european mission provides independent confirmation of nasa ’ s earlier finding .
but taken together with other experiments , including high-resolution maps showing what was likely the effects of erosion on the landscape caused by water , esa has provided the strongest proof yet . ” previous measurements have been indirect and this is the first time we have direct indications of molecules that are present in water , ” southwood said .
“ of course , finding anything that has to do with water on mars is sort of a holy grail .
this is certainly better than anything we ’ ve had so far . ”

such an opportunity wo n't come up again anytime soon . germany is preparing to host the 2006 soccer world championship , and despite the fact that its coffers are empty , it will conjure up more than € 6 billion -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- to beef up its infrastructure in time for the tournament . economics minister wolfgang clement announced that the government would invest € 2 billion in building stadiums , € 3.9 billion in roadworks and € 500 million in traffic management systems in time for sports fans to descend on this soccer-crazed nation .
clement announced his intentions at an investors conference in leipzig aimed at making the financial most of the sporting event . image polishing " this world championship is for the time being a singular chance to show the world our economy 's power of innovation and to polish clean the ' made in germany ' brand , " clement told the politicians , businesspeople and sportsmen and women rallying in leipzig . indeed , germany wo n't have a similar opportunity anytime soon .
since fifa , the world soccer organization , chooses the sites for the tournament according to a system of rotation , europe wo n't get the games again until 2030 , at the earliest . by the time the tournament starts , on june 9 , 2006 , in munich 's olympic stadium , autobahn stretches , such as the route to prague and train lines , such as the segment between hamburg and berlin , should have been re-hauled .
stadiums should be linked with modern traffic-routing systems .
clement reckoned that investments related to the world cup would total from € 8-10 billion by 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement , left , michael rogowski , and franz beckenbauer at the wm investment conference in leipzig jan .
22 , 2004 spurring innovation he also expected that the event would spur innovation in it and communications .
in 1974 , recalled clement , television finally caught on throughout the country thanks to the soccer world championship , then held in germany .
he suggested that 2006 could result in a breakthrough for high resolution television . backing up clement , franz beckenbauer , head of the organizing committee and former soccer champ , said up to 30 billion people would watch the competition on tv .
germany should make a good showing with so many people looking , he said .
aside from the tv viewers , 3.2 million guests - two-thirds from abroad - were expected to make their way to the world cup . big players , like adidas , one of the official sponsors of the world championship , have already staked out their shares .
adidas ceo herbert heiner has predicted the next few years will be good ones for the sporting goods manufacturer , thanks to the world cup . while federation of german industries head michael rogowski echoed the positive sentiments in leipzig , he cautioned not to be swept away by soccer passion .
germany must continue pursuing reform to get the german economic ball rolling , he urged . and , with contracts worth half a billion euros as yet to be awarded for the world cup , fifa could open the gates for other , smaller german firms to supply the tournament in addition to the select group of official partners clamouring on the pitch . dw staff -lrb- ni -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany aims to make 2006 world cup “ green ” germany 's world cup organizing committee has launched a " green goal " campaign that promises to make the 2006 soccer championships the most environmentally friendly sporting event ever .

gunther von hagens , who preserves human bodies to exhibit them , has denied using corpses of executed chinese in his shows .
hagens ' critics meanwhile reiterated claims that the exhibitions violate german law . wearing his signature fedora , the controversial german doctor defended his business practices after german news magazine der spiegel raised questions about his work in a cover story this week .
" i have not turned corpses of the executed into exhibits , " hagens said , but added that he could n't guarantee that bodies of executed people had never been dropped off at his production facility in dalian in northeastern china .
a common chinese practice ?
accepting unidentified bodies from the police was common practice at dalian university 's institute for plastination , hagens said , adding that his company worked closely with the institute .
plastination is the technique developed by hagens to turn corpses into odorless and durable exhibits by draining out bodily fluids and fat and replacing them with plastic .
taking these so-called " ownerless bodies " is " a completely normal thing to do and was customary in germany until the 1980s , " hagens told reporters in frankfurt , where " body worlds " is currently on show .
he added that he had instructed his employees not to accept bodies of the executed any more .
der spiegel had reported that at least two bodies included in an inventory list of hagens ' dalian facility had bullet holes in their heads .
" but not every corpse with a bullet hole has been executed , " he said , implying that some might have been victims of a crime .
documents made available to the german news magazine , however , show that hagens knew for at least two years that executed bodies were used in his work .
according to der spiegel , a former employee of the dalian institute threatened to go to the chinese media with the " true story " of the fresh corpses , but was then silenced with a large sum of money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a plastinated figure plays chess in the basel exhibit of body worlds .
critics question exhibition 's legality while members of the german hospice foundation gathered outside the frankfurt exhibition to express their protest with coffins and candles , others were equally critical of hagens ' work .
uwe volkmann , a law professor in mainz in central germany , said the show violated german cemetery and burial laws , dpa news agency reported .
the german society for pathology added that hagens violates the rules of ethics in medicine .
a munich city official told reporters that germany needed to introduce a new law regulating plastination .
" there are many people who want to be plastinated , " said wilfried blume-beyerle .
the courts need to decide whether this is a new form of undertaking and what the ethical boundaries are , he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german accused of using bodies of executed in exhibits a professor who preserves human bodies for display in exhibitions allegedly used remains of people executed in china .

evidence of water has been found by multiple instruments on mars express and the satellite has also found evidence that water is being pulled from mars into space , a theory scientists have long suspected .
in march 2002 , nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter indirectly detected water ice on the planet ’ s southern pole using a gamma ray spectrometer that found hydrogen which , when combined with air , creates water .
the european mission provides independent confirmation of nasa ’ s earlier finding .
but taken together with other experiments , including high-resolution maps showing what was likely the effects of erosion on the landscape caused by water , esa has provided the strongest proof yet . ” previous measurements have been indirect and this is the first time we have direct indications of molecules that are present in water , ” southwood said .
“ of course , finding anything that has to do with water on mars is sort of a holy grail .
this is certainly better than anything we ’ ve had so far . ”

scientists now believe it was once carved out by a mighty river or a massive glacier .
thanks to new data from the instruments aboard the mars express probe released by the european space agency on friday , they have their best evidence yet .
taken together , the images and data provide compelling evidence that there are ice sheets beneath the martian crust and that water once flowed across the red planet ’ s surface . ” you look at the picture , look at the fingerprint and say this is water ice , ” mars express project manager allen moorehouse said at mission control in darmstadt , germany .

using a combined camera and infrared spectrometer , mars express ’ omega instrument began mapping the planet ’ s south polar cap on jan .

the discovery clearly pleased scientists at esa , who suffered a setback in december with the likely destruction of its beagle 2 lander , which was intended to probe the surface of mars for organic matter and other signs of life . ” i did not expect to be able to gather together , just one month after the mars orbit insertion of dec .

wrapping up his six-day tour of africa on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder inaugurated a peacekeeping training center in ghana , saying it will serve as a model for other countries . schöder ’ s message was the same at the end of his four-nation african trip as at the beginning .
africa needs to improve its efforts for solving conflicts on the continent , and it requires the help from the rest of the world to do so .
" africa needs to develop its own capacity for conflict prevention and management and also build its own capacity in the spheres of military , police and civilian peacekeeping personnel , " the chancellor said during the opening ceremony of the kofi annan international peacekeeping training center in accra .
standing with ghana president john kufuor , schröder praised the west african leader for helping to resolve some of the region ’ s worst entanglements in the last years .
as head of the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- , kufuor sent ghanaian troops to help end fighting in the ivory coast and liberia .
" that is why the g-8 last year agreed with the european union and the united nations to strengthen african continental and regional organizations in conflict management and to help make them more effective , " the german leader said .
a center for peace as its part in that goal , germany donated more than € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.52 million -rrb- towards the construction of the kofi annan center which will focus on military , police and civilian measures for securing peace .
" it is essential for these three areas to be closely linked , " schröder said .
" purely military peace missions can not eliminate insecurity and instability in the long run , " he added .
as part of his country ’ s pledge to help africa and ecowas , schröder said germany would cancel the 16.4 million-euro debt ghana owed it .
" international support is well invested here , " schröder said .
" without peace , the people of africa have no hope of sharing in the fruits of globalization .

the german-born photographer died in a car accident in los angeles friday .
the self-proclaimed " king of kink , " who rose to fame with controversial images of women and fashion , will be honored with a new museum in berlin . celebrated , respected and controversial are just some of the words used to describe helmut newton .
best known for his provocative portraits of nude women , the berlin-born avant-garde fashion photographer spent some six decades transforming his craft and testing the limits of social acceptability .
" he was a giant , " said playboy founder hugh hefner .
" he was a major talent that pushed the boundaries in terms of photography and influenced many in following generations . "
for newton , his camera was a lens to explore power , gender roles and sexuality .
" i ’ m interested in power - i always was , whether it ’ s sexual power , financial power or political power , " he wrote in his 2002 autobiography .
bildunterschrift : retrospective exhibit in berlin 's new national gallery .
newton ’ s brazen and controversial style was exemplified in the 1980 and 1993 series " big nudes , " which featured larger-than-life images of women who were portrayed as dominating the camera rather than as subjects .
the stark black-and-white portraits were a shocking departure from conventional nude photos in their coldly erotic sensuality .
among one of the most famous images was a nude model with her neck in a surgical collar and one leg in a cast .
" he loves to be outrageous , " said anna wintour , who published much of newton ’ s work in vogue magazine .
" he has a perverse view of women that recurs again and again , " she said recently .
childhood in germany born in october 1920 , the son of a wealthy jewish button-manufacturer , newton enjoyed a privileged upbringing in berlin .
he attended the city ’ s american school , but because the photo-bug bit him early , he spent more time with his camera than his studies .
at the age of 15 , newton ’ s father told him , " my boy , you ’ ll end up in the gutter .
all you think of is girls and photos , " he wrote in his autobiography .
after leaving school in 1936 , the young newton worked as an apprentice to top photographer elsie simon , a job he held until forced to flee nazi-germany in 1938 .
after a brief stay in singapore , newton settled in australia , became a citizen and opened a small photography studio .
he also changed his name from neustädter to newton .
throughout his career he turned again and again to the subject of nazi germany , but not in a way typical for someone who lost loved ones in the concentration camps .
in a series of portraits , newton photographed hitler ’ s official filmmaker leni riefenstahl , former u.n. secretary general kurt waldheim , who was involved in nazi atrocities , and right-wing french political leader jean-marie le pen .
his own wife , june , posed in a 1973 series as hitler with model jerry hall posing as eva bruan .
but newton never dwelled on the past for long .
" i find this kind of living in the past useless and unproductive , " he wrote in his book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newton leaves 1,000 photographs to the city of berlin newton ’ s homecoming in october 2003 , newton recognized the importance his early life in berlin had on his career and donated more than 1,000 pictures to a new gallery in berlin .
at the opening , the photographer said he was " proud " his works would be displayed in his hometown .
" not just the nudes , but all the others " will be available for everyone to see , he said .
german chancellor gerhard schröder called newton ’ s decision a " sign of reconciliation . "
" you can chase a man out of his home but you can ’ t rip his home out of his soul , " the german leader said in a letter read at the news conference .
starting in june , newton 's works will be on permanent display in berlin ’ s former art library across the street from the central train station .

the german-born photographer died in a car accident in los angeles friday .
the self-proclaimed " king of kink , " who rose to fame with controversial images of women and fashion , will be honored with a new museum in berlin . celebrated , respected and controversial are just some of the words used to describe helmut newton .
best known for his provocative portraits of nude women , the berlin-born avant-garde fashion photographer spent some six decades transforming his craft and testing the limits of social acceptability .
" he was a giant , " said playboy founder hugh hefner .
" he was a major talent that pushed the boundaries in terms of photography and influenced many in following generations . "
for newton , his camera was a lens to explore power , gender roles and sexuality .
" i ’ m interested in power - i always was , whether it ’ s sexual power , financial power or political power , " he wrote in his 2002 autobiography .
bildunterschrift : retrospective exhibit in berlin 's new national gallery .
newton ’ s brazen and controversial style was exemplified in the 1980 and 1993 series " big nudes , " which featured larger-than-life images of women who were portrayed as dominating the camera rather than as subjects .
the stark black-and-white portraits were a shocking departure from conventional nude photos in their coldly erotic sensuality .
among one of the most famous images was a nude model with her neck in a surgical collar and one leg in a cast .
" he loves to be outrageous , " said anna wintour , who published much of newton ’ s work in vogue magazine .
" he has a perverse view of women that recurs again and again , " she said recently .
childhood in germany born in october 1920 , the son of a wealthy jewish button-manufacturer , newton enjoyed a privileged upbringing in berlin .
he attended the city ’ s american school , but because the photo-bug bit him early , he spent more time with his camera than his studies .
at the age of 15 , newton ’ s father told him , " my boy , you ’ ll end up in the gutter .
all you think of is girls and photos , " he wrote in his autobiography .
after leaving school in 1936 , the young newton worked as an apprentice to top photographer elsie simon , a job he held until forced to flee nazi-germany in 1938 .
after a brief stay in singapore , newton settled in australia , became a citizen and opened a small photography studio .
he also changed his name from neustädter to newton .
throughout his career he turned again and again to the subject of nazi germany , but not in a way typical for someone who lost loved ones in the concentration camps .
in a series of portraits , newton photographed hitler ’ s official filmmaker leni riefenstahl , former u.n. secretary general kurt waldheim , who was involved in nazi atrocities , and right-wing french political leader jean-marie le pen .
his own wife , june , posed in a 1973 series as hitler with model jerry hall posing as eva bruan .
but newton never dwelled on the past for long .
" i find this kind of living in the past useless and unproductive , " he wrote in his book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newton leaves 1,000 photographs to the city of berlin newton ’ s homecoming in october 2003 , newton recognized the importance his early life in berlin had on his career and donated more than 1,000 pictures to a new gallery in berlin .
at the opening , the photographer said he was " proud " his works would be displayed in his hometown .
" not just the nudes , but all the others " will be available for everyone to see , he said .
german chancellor gerhard schröder called newton ’ s decision a " sign of reconciliation . "
" you can chase a man out of his home but you can ’ t rip his home out of his soul , " the german leader said in a letter read at the news conference .
starting in june , newton 's works will be on permanent display in berlin ’ s former art library across the street from the central train station .
at the time of the donation , newton who has no children , suggested the city would eventually receive his entire archive .

chancellor gerhard schröder concludes his six-day , four-country tour of africa with a stop in ghana on friday .
dw-tv met up with the german leader and asked him about his country ’ s growing interest in the continent . his first official visit to africa is already being hailed a success back in berlin .
after spending six days jetting across the continent with high-profile stops in ethiopia , kenya , south africa and ghana , schröder hopes to have driven home his point that africa is not only about war , famine and disease , and that germany is not only interested in the continent as a recipient of development aid , but rather that there are political and economic initiatives worthy of promoting .
speaking to dw-tv while in south africa , schröder says he is satisfied with the results of his visit , his first official one to the continent : " i think we made clear that germany wants to take an active involvement in those places where what ’ s called " good governance " is practiced . "
" these countries are making a genuine effort to stand on their own two feet , which is something we support , " he explains .
" they are trying to enforce the rule of law and principles of democracy .
and they ’ re trying to establish regional alliances that can promote trade and give us the opportunity to get involved in even bigger markets . "
the forgotten continent ?
africa has often been referred to as the " forgotten continent . "
europe , which once had an active interest in its development , has pretty much neglected the region except for the occasional peacekeeping missions to former colonies and the regular flow of humanitarian and economic aid .
but germany seems to be experiencing a growing interest in the continent .
after schröder ’ s visit , president johannes rau will go to africa .
foreign minister joschka fischer and the state secretary in the foreign office , kerstin müller , have frequently visited the region in an effort to drum up support for peace initiatives in countries like sudan and the congo .
schröder sees his country ’ s interest in africa as a continuation of germany ’ s foreign policy .
" we ’ re trying to make it clear that it ’ s worth countries ’ while to help themselves .
the reason is quite simple , " he says .
" a stable africa is in our own interest .
the fight against international terrorism will only be successful if africa manages to offer people a future , one in which they can live or at least survive . "
new dimension in africa policy the focus on security represents a shift in germany ’ s relations with africa , which was previously confined to development aid .
schröder says the joint emphasis on security and economic development is the key to future dealings with africa .
although still not as developed as north america , asia or europe , the chancellor is convinced that economic cooperation with africa could lead to a " potentially huge market . "
" we should not be talking down the potential , " he says referring to critics , who quickly dismiss investment as a waste of effort .
" it ’ s not just about raw materials , it ’ s also about people ’ s willingness to roll up their sleeves and get down to work on their own behalf . "
" i think it ’ s in our own interest to help them . "
guilt over colonial past ?
schröder denies that germany ’ s colonial history has any bearing on his country ’ s current and future interest in africa .
" there have been some very dark chapters in our history .
one must only think of the hereros in namibia .
but that ’ s a long time ago , and many of the emotional wounds have healed , " he says .
" o course , we can not allow ourselves to forget the past , but it ’ s not the driving force behind a sensible africa policy .
it 's more about the here and now .

chancellor gerhard schröder concludes his six-day , four-country tour of africa with a stop in ghana on friday .
dw-tv met up with the german leader and asked him about his country ’ s growing interest in the continent . his first official visit to africa is already being hailed a success back in berlin .
after spending six days jetting across the continent with high-profile stops in ethiopia , kenya , south africa and ghana , schröder hopes to have driven home his point that africa is not only about war , famine and disease , and that germany is not only interested in the continent as a recipient of development aid , but rather that there are political and economic initiatives worthy of promoting .
speaking to dw-tv while in south africa , schröder says he is satisfied with the results of his visit , his first official one to the continent : " i think we made clear that germany wants to take an active involvement in those places where what ’ s called " good governance " is practiced . "
" these countries are making a genuine effort to stand on their own two feet , which is something we support , " he explains .
" they are trying to enforce the rule of law and principles of democracy .
and they ’ re trying to establish regional alliances that can promote trade and give us the opportunity to get involved in even bigger markets . "
the forgotten continent ?
africa has often been referred to as the " forgotten continent . "
europe , which once had an active interest in its development , has pretty much neglected the region except for the occasional peacekeeping missions to former colonies and the regular flow of humanitarian and economic aid .
but germany seems to be experiencing a growing interest in the continent .
after schröder ’ s visit , president johannes rau will go to africa .
foreign minister joschka fischer and the state secretary in the foreign office , kerstin müller , have frequently visited the region in an effort to drum up support for peace initiatives in countries like sudan and the congo .
schröder sees his country ’ s interest in africa as a continuation of germany ’ s foreign policy .
" we ’ re trying to make it clear that it ’ s worth countries ’ while to help themselves .
the reason is quite simple , " he says .
" a stable africa is in our own interest .
the fight against international terrorism will only be successful if africa manages to offer people a future , one in which they can live or at least survive . "
new dimension in africa policy the focus on security represents a shift in germany ’ s relations with africa , which was previously confined to development aid .
schröder says the joint emphasis on security and economic development is the key to future dealings with africa .
although still not as developed as north america , asia or europe , the chancellor is convinced that economic cooperation with africa could lead to a " potentially huge market . "
" we should not be talking down the potential , " he says referring to critics , who quickly dismiss investment as a waste of effort .
" it ’ s not just about raw materials , it ’ s also about people ’ s willingness to roll up their sleeves and get down to work on their own behalf . "
" i think it ’ s in our own interest to help them . "
guilt over colonial past ?
schröder denies that germany ’ s colonial history has any bearing on his country ’ s current and future interest in africa .
" there have been some very dark chapters in our history .
one must only think of the hereros in namibia .
but that ’ s a long time ago , and many of the emotional wounds have healed , " he says .
" o course , we can not allow ourselves to forget the past , but it ’ s not the driving force behind a sensible africa policy .

such an opportunity wo n't come up again anytime soon . germany is preparing to host the 2006 soccer world championship , and despite the fact that its coffers are empty , it will conjure up more than € 6 billion -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- to beef up its infrastructure in time for the tournament . economics minister wolfgang clement announced that the government would invest € 2 billion in building stadiums , € 3.9 billion in roadworks and € 500 million in traffic management systems in time for sports fans to descend on this soccer-crazed nation .
clement announced his intentions at an investors conference in leipzig aimed at making the financial most of the sporting event . image polishing " this world championship is for the time being a singular chance to show the world our economy 's power of innovation and to polish clean the ' made in germany ' brand , " clement told the politicians , businesspeople and sportsmen and women rallying in leipzig . indeed , germany wo n't have a similar opportunity anytime soon .
since fifa , the world soccer organization , chooses the sites for the tournament according to a system of rotation , europe wo n't get the games again until 2030 , at the earliest . by the time the tournament starts , on june 9 , 2006 , in munich 's olympic stadium , autobahn stretches , such as the route to prague and train lines , such as the segment between hamburg and berlin , should have been re-hauled .
stadiums should be linked with modern traffic-routing systems .
clement reckoned that investments related to the world cup would total from € 8-10 billion by 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement , left , michael rogowski , and franz beckenbauer at the wm investment conference in leipzig jan .

in 1974 , recalled clement , television finally caught on throughout the country thanks to the soccer world championship , then held in germany .
he suggested that 2006 could result in a breakthrough for high resolution television . backing up clement , franz beckenbauer , head of the organizing committee and former soccer champ , said up to 30 billion people would watch the competition on tv .
germany should make a good showing with so many people looking , he said .
aside from the tv viewers , 3.2 million guests - two-thirds from abroad - were expected to make their way to the world cup . big players , like adidas , one of the official sponsors of the world championship , have already staked out their shares .
adidas ceo herbert heiner has predicted the next few years will be good ones for the sporting goods manufacturer , thanks to the world cup . while federation of german industries head michael rogowski echoed the positive sentiments in leipzig , he cautioned not to be swept away by soccer passion .
germany must continue pursuing reform to get the german economic ball rolling , he urged . and , with contracts worth half a billion euros as yet to be awarded for the world cup , fifa could open the gates for other , smaller german firms to supply the tournament in addition to the select group of official partners clamouring on the pitch . dw staff -lrb- ni -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany aims to make 2006 world cup “ green ” germany 's world cup organizing committee has launched a " green goal " campaign that promises to make the 2006 soccer championships the most environmentally friendly sporting event ever .

the german-born photographer died in a car accident in los angeles friday .
the self-proclaimed " king of kink , " who rose to fame with controversial images of women and fashion , will be honored with a new museum in berlin . celebrated , respected and controversial are just some of the words used to describe helmut newton .
best known for his provocative portraits of nude women , the berlin-born avant-garde fashion photographer spent some six decades transforming his craft and testing the limits of social acceptability .
" he was a giant , " said playboy founder hugh hefner .
" he was a major talent that pushed the boundaries in terms of photography and influenced many in following generations . "
for newton , his camera was a lens to explore power , gender roles and sexuality .
" i ’ m interested in power - i always was , whether it ’ s sexual power , financial power or political power , " he wrote in his 2002 autobiography .
bildunterschrift : retrospective exhibit in berlin 's new national gallery .
newton ’ s brazen and controversial style was exemplified in the 1980 and 1993 series " big nudes , " which featured larger-than-life images of women who were portrayed as dominating the camera rather than as subjects .
the stark black-and-white portraits were a shocking departure from conventional nude photos in their coldly erotic sensuality .
among one of the most famous images was a nude model with her neck in a surgical collar and one leg in a cast .
" he loves to be outrageous , " said anna wintour , who published much of newton ’ s work in vogue magazine .
" he has a perverse view of women that recurs again and again , " she said recently .
childhood in germany born in october 1920 , the son of a wealthy jewish button-manufacturer , newton enjoyed a privileged upbringing in berlin .
he attended the city ’ s american school , but because the photo-bug bit him early , he spent more time with his camera than his studies .
at the age of 15 , newton ’ s father told him , " my boy , you ’ ll end up in the gutter .
all you think of is girls and photos , " he wrote in his autobiography .
after leaving school in 1936 , the young newton worked as an apprentice to top photographer elsie simon , a job he held until forced to flee nazi-germany in 1938 .
after a brief stay in singapore , newton settled in australia , became a citizen and opened a small photography studio .
he also changed his name from neustädter to newton .
throughout his career he turned again and again to the subject of nazi germany , but not in a way typical for someone who lost loved ones in the concentration camps .
in a series of portraits , newton photographed hitler ’ s official filmmaker leni riefenstahl , former u.n. secretary general kurt waldheim , who was involved in nazi atrocities , and right-wing french political leader jean-marie le pen .
his own wife , june , posed in a 1973 series as hitler with model jerry hall posing as eva bruan .
but newton never dwelled on the past for long .
" i find this kind of living in the past useless and unproductive , " he wrote in his book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newton leaves 1,000 photographs to the city of berlin newton ’ s homecoming in october 2003 , newton recognized the importance his early life in berlin had on his career and donated more than 1,000 pictures to a new gallery in berlin .
at the opening , the photographer said he was " proud " his works would be displayed in his hometown .
" not just the nudes , but all the others " will be available for everyone to see , he said .
german chancellor gerhard schröder called newton ’ s decision a " sign of reconciliation . "
" you can chase a man out of his home but you can ’ t rip his home out of his soul , " the german leader said in a letter read at the news conference .

the german-born photographer died in a car accident in los angeles friday .
the self-proclaimed " king of kink , " who rose to fame with controversial images of women and fashion , will be honored with a new museum in berlin . celebrated , respected and controversial are just some of the words used to describe helmut newton .
best known for his provocative portraits of nude women , the berlin-born avant-garde fashion photographer spent some six decades transforming his craft and testing the limits of social acceptability .
" he was a giant , " said playboy founder hugh hefner .
" he was a major talent that pushed the boundaries in terms of photography and influenced many in following generations . "
for newton , his camera was a lens to explore power , gender roles and sexuality .
" i ’ m interested in power - i always was , whether it ’ s sexual power , financial power or political power , " he wrote in his 2002 autobiography .
bildunterschrift : retrospective exhibit in berlin 's new national gallery .
newton ’ s brazen and controversial style was exemplified in the 1980 and 1993 series " big nudes , " which featured larger-than-life images of women who were portrayed as dominating the camera rather than as subjects .
the stark black-and-white portraits were a shocking departure from conventional nude photos in their coldly erotic sensuality .
among one of the most famous images was a nude model with her neck in a surgical collar and one leg in a cast .
" he loves to be outrageous , " said anna wintour , who published much of newton ’ s work in vogue magazine .
" he has a perverse view of women that recurs again and again , " she said recently .
childhood in germany born in october 1920 , the son of a wealthy jewish button-manufacturer , newton enjoyed a privileged upbringing in berlin .
he attended the city ’ s american school , but because the photo-bug bit him early , he spent more time with his camera than his studies .
at the age of 15 , newton ’ s father told him , " my boy , you ’ ll end up in the gutter .
all you think of is girls and photos , " he wrote in his autobiography .
after leaving school in 1936 , the young newton worked as an apprentice to top photographer elsie simon , a job he held until forced to flee nazi-germany in 1938 .
after a brief stay in singapore , newton settled in australia , became a citizen and opened a small photography studio .
he also changed his name from neustädter to newton .
throughout his career he turned again and again to the subject of nazi germany , but not in a way typical for someone who lost loved ones in the concentration camps .
in a series of portraits , newton photographed hitler ’ s official filmmaker leni riefenstahl , former u.n. secretary general kurt waldheim , who was involved in nazi atrocities , and right-wing french political leader jean-marie le pen .
his own wife , june , posed in a 1973 series as hitler with model jerry hall posing as eva bruan .
but newton never dwelled on the past for long .
" i find this kind of living in the past useless and unproductive , " he wrote in his book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newton leaves 1,000 photographs to the city of berlin newton ’ s homecoming in october 2003 , newton recognized the importance his early life in berlin had on his career and donated more than 1,000 pictures to a new gallery in berlin .
at the opening , the photographer said he was " proud " his works would be displayed in his hometown .
" not just the nudes , but all the others " will be available for everyone to see , he said .
german chancellor gerhard schröder called newton ’ s decision a " sign of reconciliation . "
" you can chase a man out of his home but you can ’ t rip his home out of his soul , " the german leader said in a letter read at the news conference .
starting in june , newton 's works will be on permanent display in berlin ’ s former art library across the street from the central train station .
at the time of the donation , newton who has no children , suggested the city would eventually receive his entire archive .

german development finance institute deg gave its annual report this week , announcing it had increased its aid to developing countries by 9 percent in 2003 and contributed some € 506 million to projects around the world . with chancellor gerhard schröder touring africa , germany has been taking stock of its economic ties to the continent and reviewing its development aid schemes .
development financier deg -lrb- german investment and development foundation -rrb- has been making investments in africa for some four decades , in 2003 committing a total of € 80 million to businesses in south africa , mozambique , kenya and nigeria alone .
its projects aim to encourage sustainable growth and improve living conditions .
among other things , funding went to a leasing company in egypt , the cement industry in algeria , and mobile phone networks in algeria and nigeria .
the deg also has close to € 4 million invested with the industrial promotion services kenya , which furnishes east african companies with capital and management expertise .
a high volume of new business despite the global economic slump , the war in iraq , sars in asia and political and economic unrest in latin america , the deg has had a good year .
the bank , which lends money to german medium-sized companies investing in developing countries and emerging markets , saw its highest ever volume of new business since its founding 41 years ago .
with a portfolio of € 2,400 million , the deg is one of the biggest specialist banks concentrating on private sector promotion in europe .
its spokesman winfried polte points out that " without such institutions , many investment projects in asia , africa and eastern europe simply could n't be financed . "
deg invests in private companies that create jobs and income , thereby boosting the market economy and helping the individual .
in polte 's words , the " long-term investment financings render a major contribution to a sustainable development in the target countries . "
regional awareness " our perception of africa is marked by wars , famine and suffering , " says polte , but he 's quick to point out that " there are countries and industries with promising developments offering interesting business opportunities for foreign investors . "
polte is proud of one deg-backed scheme in particular . " one of our projects in egpyt won the alternative nobel prize , " he explains , adding that " the sekem holding makes organic pharmaceutical products and is exemplary in its benefits program for employees - the farmers - as it makes available broad social services such as schools and health centers . "
deg focuses on long term investments under market conditions .
but it is aware that africa has its unique problems and writes clauses into its contracts designed to help stop the spread of aids , for instance .
polte explains that the " contracts include a paragraph in which companies agree to offer staff a free test , regular information events and then practical things such as condom vending machines . "
end of an era here in europe , the entry of 10 new member states into the european union will be a new departure for many in the business world .
but for the deg , it means the end of an era.they will be leaving the new eu states in eastern europe and moving even further to the east .
these days , the focus of deg 's activities is on asia .
the bank has committed some € 18 million to a total of six projects in china alone .
polte points out that " in china we concentrate mainly on the agricultural sector .
we have three excellent companies there , two of which have now gone international " .
he also observes that the deg sees promoting networks as part of its task .
" we brought these chinese companies together with other companies working in uruguay and argentina , " he says . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

gunther von hagens , who preserves human bodies to exhibit them , has denied using corpses of executed chinese in his shows .
hagens ' critics meanwhile reiterated claims that the exhibitions violate german law . wearing his signature fedora , the controversial german doctor defended his business practices after german news magazine der spiegel raised questions about his work in a cover story this week .
" i have not turned corpses of the executed into exhibits , " hagens said , but added that he could n't guarantee that bodies of executed people had never been dropped off at his production facility in dalian in northeastern china .
a common chinese practice ?
accepting unidentified bodies from the police was common practice at dalian university 's institute for plastination , hagens said , adding that his company worked closely with the institute .
plastination is the technique developed by hagens to turn corpses into odorless and durable exhibits by draining out bodily fluids and fat and replacing them with plastic .
taking these so-called " ownerless bodies " is " a completely normal thing to do and was customary in germany until the 1980s , " hagens told reporters in frankfurt , where " body worlds " is currently on show .
he added that he had instructed his employees not to accept bodies of the executed any more .
der spiegel had reported that at least two bodies included in an inventory list of hagens ' dalian facility had bullet holes in their heads .
" but not every corpse with a bullet hole has been executed , " he said , implying that some might have been victims of a crime .
documents made available to the german news magazine , however , show that hagens knew for at least two years that executed bodies were used in his work .
according to der spiegel , a former employee of the dalian institute threatened to go to the chinese media with the " true story " of the fresh corpses , but was then silenced with a large sum of money .

" i have not turned corpses of the executed into exhibits , " hagens said , but added that he could n't guarantee that bodies of executed people had never been dropped off at his production facility in dalian in northeastern china .
a common chinese practice ?
accepting unidentified bodies from the police was common practice at dalian university 's institute for plastination , hagens said , adding that his company worked closely with the institute .
plastination is the technique developed by hagens to turn corpses into odorless and durable exhibits by draining out bodily fluids and fat and replacing them with plastic .
taking these so-called " ownerless bodies " is " a completely normal thing to do and was customary in germany until the 1980s , " hagens told reporters in frankfurt , where " body worlds " is currently on show .
he added that he had instructed his employees not to accept bodies of the executed any more .
der spiegel had reported that at least two bodies included in an inventory list of hagens ' dalian facility had bullet holes in their heads .
" but not every corpse with a bullet hole has been executed , " he said , implying that some might have been victims of a crime .
documents made available to the german news magazine , however , show that hagens knew for at least two years that executed bodies were used in his work .
according to der spiegel , a former employee of the dalian institute threatened to go to the chinese media with the " true story " of the fresh corpses , but was then silenced with a large sum of money .

critics question exhibition 's legality while members of the german hospice foundation gathered outside the frankfurt exhibition to express their protest with coffins and candles , others were equally critical of hagens ' work .
uwe volkmann , a law professor in mainz in central germany , said the show violated german cemetery and burial laws , dpa news agency reported .
the german society for pathology added that hagens violates the rules of ethics in medicine .
a munich city official told reporters that germany needed to introduce a new law regulating plastination .
" there are many people who want to be plastinated , " said wilfried blume-beyerle .
the courts need to decide whether this is a new form of undertaking and what the ethical boundaries are , he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german accused of using bodies of executed in exhibits a professor who preserves human bodies for display in exhibitions allegedly used remains of people executed in china .

german development finance institute deg gave its annual report this week , announcing it had increased its aid to developing countries by 9 percent in 2003 and contributed some € 506 million to projects around the world . with chancellor gerhard schröder touring africa , germany has been taking stock of its economic ties to the continent and reviewing its development aid schemes .
development financier deg -lrb- german investment and development foundation -rrb- has been making investments in africa for some four decades , in 2003 committing a total of € 80 million to businesses in south africa , mozambique , kenya and nigeria alone .
its projects aim to encourage sustainable growth and improve living conditions .
among other things , funding went to a leasing company in egypt , the cement industry in algeria , and mobile phone networks in algeria and nigeria .
the deg also has close to € 4 million invested with the industrial promotion services kenya , which furnishes east african companies with capital and management expertise .
a high volume of new business despite the global economic slump , the war in iraq , sars in asia and political and economic unrest in latin america , the deg has had a good year .
the bank , which lends money to german medium-sized companies investing in developing countries and emerging markets , saw its highest ever volume of new business since its founding 41 years ago .
with a portfolio of € 2,400 million , the deg is one of the biggest specialist banks concentrating on private sector promotion in europe .
its spokesman winfried polte points out that " without such institutions , many investment projects in asia , africa and eastern europe simply could n't be financed . "
deg invests in private companies that create jobs and income , thereby boosting the market economy and helping the individual .
in polte 's words , the " long-term investment financings render a major contribution to a sustainable development in the target countries . "
regional awareness " our perception of africa is marked by wars , famine and suffering , " says polte , but he 's quick to point out that " there are countries and industries with promising developments offering interesting business opportunities for foreign investors . "
polte is proud of one deg-backed scheme in particular . " one of our projects in egpyt won the alternative nobel prize , " he explains , adding that " the sekem holding makes organic pharmaceutical products and is exemplary in its benefits program for employees - the farmers - as it makes available broad social services such as schools and health centers . "
deg focuses on long term investments under market conditions .
but it is aware that africa has its unique problems and writes clauses into its contracts designed to help stop the spread of aids , for instance .
polte explains that the " contracts include a paragraph in which companies agree to offer staff a free test , regular information events and then practical things such as condom vending machines . "
end of an era here in europe , the entry of 10 new member states into the european union will be a new departure for many in the business world .
but for the deg , it means the end of an era.they will be leaving the new eu states in eastern europe and moving even further to the east .
these days , the focus of deg 's activities is on asia .
the bank has committed some € 18 million to a total of six projects in china alone .
polte points out that " in china we concentrate mainly on the agricultural sector .
we have three excellent companies there , two of which have now gone international " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany still lighting up much of europe bans smoking ; germany keeps puffing away germany : european smoker 's paradise germany gets eu slap on the wrist over tobacco laws germany 's close ties to big tobacco germany -pipe- 25.01.2004 where there 's smoke , there 's germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite health warnings on cigarettes , germans are unlikely to kick the habit .
" smoking can cause a slow and painful death " reads one of the new warnings on cigarette packets in germany .
but there is doubt as to just how seriously such in-the-face warnings are being taken . it takes a visit to germany to believe just how smoky a society it is .
ranking third after spain and greece when it comes to the number of smokers on its books , germany celebrates smoking as a way of life .
it is so ingrained that the printed threats which dominate 21st century cigarette packets seem unlikely to scare too many smokers into stubbing out for good . although official statistics show that cigarette sales in 2003 dropped by nine percent over the previous year , and big brand producers have reported trailing sales in germany , there is no doubt that the german population is still puffing away .
in reality , more smokers have been turning to rolling tobacco and cigars , which have been spared the higher taxation rates dumped on cigarettes over the past couple of years . there is also evidence that more and more smokers are turning to unofficial sources to feed their habit .
a spokesman for british american tobacco , which puts its name to the likes of lucky strike and gauloises blondes , told the reuters news agency that increased tobacco taxes might blow smokers out of their clutch and onto the black market .
" our concern is that the new taxes will not stop people smoking , but that they will turn to the black market and cheaper forms of tobacco , " he said . some fear that the trend in buying cheaper cigarettes will grow once the eu opens its eastern borders to accession members in may .
head of the association of german cigarette producers , ernst brückner , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that once the borders are open , smokers who live near poland , for example , will systematically shop in the neighboring country in order to circumnavigate further tax hikes planned by the german government over the next two years .
the first of these increases will push the price of a packet of smokes up from its currently modest european rate of € 3 -lrb- $ 3.80 -rrb- by a further euro . keeping the smoke out of bars earlier this month , the eu commission announced it was considering a move to outlaw smoking in bars and restaurants across the 15 member states .
european health commissioner david byrne told die welt newspaper that if the eu were thinking of introducing smoke-free work places , they would have to extend the ban to include bars and restaurants . the suggestion met with rigid resistance in germany , where relaxing in a bar with a stick of nicotine and preferred tipple is quite simply part of the fabric of society .
german cities are splitting at the seams with bars and restaurants and at best only one in two of them have a designated smoking section with the rest of the hostelry deemed smoke free . marc schnerr , press officer at the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- told dw-world that he believed david byrne was on the warpath against smokers , and added that any move to ban smokers from lighting up in gastronomic venues would have disastrous consequences for jobs in the industry . " take small bars for example , they do n't have the space to section off a no-smoking area , and a ban would mean massive reductions in turnover for them , " schnerr said .
the knock-on effect of that , he added , was the threat to thousands of jobs and trainee positions in the industry . too many laws schnerr believes that germans feel they are surrounded by more than enough legislation as it is , and that the implementation of smoking laws in places traditionally reserved for fun would rob the nation of the last place where smokers and non-smokers can relax under the same public roof . he believes the issue has to be dealt with on an individual basis .
it should be left up to the businesses themselves .
people go to these places voluntarily and they are not inconsiderate of one another once there , the dhg spokesman told dw-world . he also stressed that his organisation was always at pains to encourage hoteliers and restaurant owners to take the wishes of non-smokers into consideration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany still lighting up much of europe bans smoking ; germany keeps puffing away germany : european smoker 's paradise germany gets eu slap on the wrist over tobacco laws germany 's close ties to big tobacco germany -pipe- 25.01.2004 where there 's smoke , there 's germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite health warnings on cigarettes , germans are unlikely to kick the habit .
" smoking can cause a slow and painful death " reads one of the new warnings on cigarette packets in germany .
but there is doubt as to just how seriously such in-the-face warnings are being taken . it takes a visit to germany to believe just how smoky a society it is .
ranking third after spain and greece when it comes to the number of smokers on its books , germany celebrates smoking as a way of life .
it is so ingrained that the printed threats which dominate 21st century cigarette packets seem unlikely to scare too many smokers into stubbing out for good . although official statistics show that cigarette sales in 2003 dropped by nine percent over the previous year , and big brand producers have reported trailing sales in germany , there is no doubt that the german population is still puffing away .
in reality , more smokers have been turning to rolling tobacco and cigars , which have been spared the higher taxation rates dumped on cigarettes over the past couple of years . there is also evidence that more and more smokers are turning to unofficial sources to feed their habit .
a spokesman for british american tobacco , which puts its name to the likes of lucky strike and gauloises blondes , told the reuters news agency that increased tobacco taxes might blow smokers out of their clutch and onto the black market .
" our concern is that the new taxes will not stop people smoking , but that they will turn to the black market and cheaper forms of tobacco , " he said . some fear that the trend in buying cheaper cigarettes will grow once the eu opens its eastern borders to accession members in may .
head of the association of german cigarette producers , ernst brückner , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that once the borders are open , smokers who live near poland , for example , will systematically shop in the neighboring country in order to circumnavigate further tax hikes planned by the german government over the next two years .
the first of these increases will push the price of a packet of smokes up from its currently modest european rate of € 3 -lrb- $ 3.80 -rrb- by a further euro . keeping the smoke out of bars earlier this month , the eu commission announced it was considering a move to outlaw smoking in bars and restaurants across the 15 member states .
european health commissioner david byrne told die welt newspaper that if the eu were thinking of introducing smoke-free work places , they would have to extend the ban to include bars and restaurants . the suggestion met with rigid resistance in germany , where relaxing in a bar with a stick of nicotine and preferred tipple is quite simply part of the fabric of society .
german cities are splitting at the seams with bars and restaurants and at best only one in two of them have a designated smoking section with the rest of the hostelry deemed smoke free . marc schnerr , press officer at the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- told dw-world that he believed david byrne was on the warpath against smokers , and added that any move to ban smokers from lighting up in gastronomic venues would have disastrous consequences for jobs in the industry . " take small bars for example , they do n't have the space to section off a no-smoking area , and a ban would mean massive reductions in turnover for them , " schnerr said .
the knock-on effect of that , he added , was the threat to thousands of jobs and trainee positions in the industry . too many laws schnerr believes that germans feel they are surrounded by more than enough legislation as it is , and that the implementation of smoking laws in places traditionally reserved for fun would rob the nation of the last place where smokers and non-smokers can relax under the same public roof . he believes the issue has to be dealt with on an individual basis .
it should be left up to the businesses themselves .
people go to these places voluntarily and they are not inconsiderate of one another once there , the dhg spokesman told dw-world . he also stressed that his organisation was always at pains to encourage hoteliers and restaurant owners to take the wishes of non-smokers into consideration .

european health commissioner david byrne told die welt newspaper that if the eu were thinking of introducing smoke-free work places , they would have to extend the ban to include bars and restaurants . the suggestion met with rigid resistance in germany , where relaxing in a bar with a stick of nicotine and preferred tipple is quite simply part of the fabric of society .
german cities are splitting at the seams with bars and restaurants and at best only one in two of them have a designated smoking section with the rest of the hostelry deemed smoke free . marc schnerr , press officer at the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- told dw-world that he believed david byrne was on the warpath against smokers , and added that any move to ban smokers from lighting up in gastronomic venues would have disastrous consequences for jobs in the industry . " take small bars for example , they do n't have the space to section off a no-smoking area , and a ban would mean massive reductions in turnover for them , " schnerr said .
the knock-on effect of that , he added , was the threat to thousands of jobs and trainee positions in the industry . too many laws schnerr believes that germans feel they are surrounded by more than enough legislation as it is , and that the implementation of smoking laws in places traditionally reserved for fun would rob the nation of the last place where smokers and non-smokers can relax under the same public roof . he believes the issue has to be dealt with on an individual basis .
it should be left up to the businesses themselves .
people go to these places voluntarily and they are not inconsiderate of one another once there , the dhg spokesman told dw-world . he also stressed that his organisation was always at pains to encourage hoteliers and restaurant owners to take the wishes of non-smokers into consideration .
as long as they continue to provide enough places for both smokers and non-smokers to go , he believes the thousands of jobs which would be blown away with a ban , will be kept from going up in smoke . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clouds of smoke over europe not only germany is having to deal with the foggy issue of what to do with determined smokers , many european countries have been looking for ways to encourage their citizens quit .

from raising the price of cigarettes to installing bans in the workplace , many european countries have been looking for ways to get their citizens to quit smoking without infringing on their personal rights . although european health commissioner , david byrne has been publicly mulling over the possibility of seeking an all-out eu ban on smoking in the workplace , so far there are no europe-wide regulations on smoking or the price of tobacco - which currently ranges from € 2 -lrb- $ 2.50 -rrb- to € 7.20 for a packet of 20 cigarettes .

from raising the price of cigarettes to installing bans in the workplace , many european countries have been looking for ways to get their citizens to quit smoking without infringing on their personal rights . although european health commissioner , david byrne has been publicly mulling over the possibility of seeking an all-out eu ban on smoking in the workplace , so far there are no europe-wide regulations on smoking or the price of tobacco - which currently ranges from € 2 -lrb- $ 2.50 -rrb- to € 7.20 for a packet of 20 cigarettes .

scientists now believe it was once carved out by a mighty river or a massive glacier .
thanks to new data from the instruments aboard the mars express probe released by the european space agency on friday , they have their best evidence yet .
taken together , the images and data provide compelling evidence that there are ice sheets beneath the martian crust and that water once flowed across the red planet ’ s surface . ” you look at the picture , look at the fingerprint and say this is water ice , ” mars express project manager allen moorehouse said at mission control in darmstadt , germany .
“ this is the first time it ’ s been detected on the ground .
this is the first direct confirmation . ”
using a combined camera and infrared spectrometer , mars express ’ omega instrument began mapping the planet ’ s south polar cap on jan .
18 .
omega has indirectly detected the presence of both water ice and carbon dioxide ice , esa said .
the discovery clearly pleased scientists at esa , who suffered a setback in december with the likely destruction of its beagle 2 lander , which was intended to probe the surface of mars for organic matter and other signs of life . ” i did not expect to be able to gather together , just one month after the mars orbit insertion of dec .
25 , so many happy scientists eager to present their first results , ” said esa director of science david southwood .
european scientists hope to find large reserves of ice beneath the surface of mars that can be used to supply water and fuel for future manned space missions .
water molecules detected ” it ’ s been looked at for such a long time and it ’ s been inferred there was water at the south pole , ” said jean-pierre bibring an esa scientist from the institute of space astrophysics in orsay , france .
bibring said an infrared camera on board mars express had detected vapors of water molecules .
“ this is the first time we can really see vapors of the molecules themselves , ” he said .
evidence of water has been found by multiple instruments on mars express and the satellite has also found evidence that water is being pulled from mars into space , a theory scientists have long suspected .
in march 2002 , nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter indirectly detected water ice on the planet ’ s southern pole using a gamma ray spectrometer that found hydrogen which , when combined with air , creates water .
the european mission provides independent confirmation of nasa ’ s earlier finding .
but taken together with other experiments , including high-resolution maps showing what was likely the effects of erosion on the landscape caused by water , esa has provided the strongest proof yet . ” previous measurements have been indirect and this is the first time we have direct indications of molecules that are present in water , ” southwood said .
“ of course , finding anything that has to do with water on mars is sort of a holy grail .
this is certainly better than anything we ’ ve had so far . ”

neukum and his crew have already gathered more than 100 gigabytes of data from the camera .
he said he hoped the camera would be able to detect if some of the rocks on mars are actually blocks of ice .
mars express first entered into martian orbit at christmas .
it will continue delivering data from its scientific instruments for the next two years . ” europe can be proud of this mission , ” said edelgard bulmahn , germany ’ s minister for research and education .

gunther von hagens , who preserves human bodies to exhibit them , has denied using corpses of executed chinese in his shows .
hagens ' critics meanwhile reiterated claims that the exhibitions violate german law . wearing his signature fedora , the controversial german doctor defended his business practices after german news magazine der spiegel raised questions about his work in a cover story this week .
" i have not turned corpses of the executed into exhibits , " hagens said , but added that he could n't guarantee that bodies of executed people had never been dropped off at his production facility in dalian in northeastern china .
a common chinese practice ?
accepting unidentified bodies from the police was common practice at dalian university 's institute for plastination , hagens said , adding that his company worked closely with the institute .
plastination is the technique developed by hagens to turn corpses into odorless and durable exhibits by draining out bodily fluids and fat and replacing them with plastic .
taking these so-called " ownerless bodies " is " a completely normal thing to do and was customary in germany until the 1980s , " hagens told reporters in frankfurt , where " body worlds " is currently on show .
he added that he had instructed his employees not to accept bodies of the executed any more .
der spiegel had reported that at least two bodies included in an inventory list of hagens ' dalian facility had bullet holes in their heads .
" but not every corpse with a bullet hole has been executed , " he said , implying that some might have been victims of a crime .
documents made available to the german news magazine , however , show that hagens knew for at least two years that executed bodies were used in his work .
according to der spiegel , a former employee of the dalian institute threatened to go to the chinese media with the " true story " of the fresh corpses , but was then silenced with a large sum of money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a plastinated figure plays chess in the basel exhibit of body worlds .
critics question exhibition 's legality while members of the german hospice foundation gathered outside the frankfurt exhibition to express their protest with coffins and candles , others were equally critical of hagens ' work .
uwe volkmann , a law professor in mainz in central germany , said the show violated german cemetery and burial laws , dpa news agency reported .
the german society for pathology added that hagens violates the rules of ethics in medicine .
a munich city official told reporters that germany needed to introduce a new law regulating plastination .
" there are many people who want to be plastinated , " said wilfried blume-beyerle .

chancellor gerhard schröder concludes his six-day , four-country tour of africa with a stop in ghana on friday .
dw-tv met up with the german leader and asked him about his country ’ s growing interest in the continent . his first official visit to africa is already being hailed a success back in berlin .
after spending six days jetting across the continent with high-profile stops in ethiopia , kenya , south africa and ghana , schröder hopes to have driven home his point that africa is not only about war , famine and disease , and that germany is not only interested in the continent as a recipient of development aid , but rather that there are political and economic initiatives worthy of promoting .
speaking to dw-tv while in south africa , schröder says he is satisfied with the results of his visit , his first official one to the continent : " i think we made clear that germany wants to take an active involvement in those places where what ’ s called " good governance " is practiced . "
" these countries are making a genuine effort to stand on their own two feet , which is something we support , " he explains .
" they are trying to enforce the rule of law and principles of democracy .
and they ’ re trying to establish regional alliances that can promote trade and give us the opportunity to get involved in even bigger markets . "
the forgotten continent ?
africa has often been referred to as the " forgotten continent . "
europe , which once had an active interest in its development , has pretty much neglected the region except for the occasional peacekeeping missions to former colonies and the regular flow of humanitarian and economic aid .
but germany seems to be experiencing a growing interest in the continent .
after schröder ’ s visit , president johannes rau will go to africa .
foreign minister joschka fischer and the state secretary in the foreign office , kerstin müller , have frequently visited the region in an effort to drum up support for peace initiatives in countries like sudan and the congo .
schröder sees his country ’ s interest in africa as a continuation of germany ’ s foreign policy .
" we ’ re trying to make it clear that it ’ s worth countries ’ while to help themselves .
the reason is quite simple , " he says .
" a stable africa is in our own interest .
the fight against international terrorism will only be successful if africa manages to offer people a future , one in which they can live or at least survive . "
new dimension in africa policy the focus on security represents a shift in germany ’ s relations with africa , which was previously confined to development aid .
schröder says the joint emphasis on security and economic development is the key to future dealings with africa .
although still not as developed as north america , asia or europe , the chancellor is convinced that economic cooperation with africa could lead to a " potentially huge market . "
" we should not be talking down the potential , " he says referring to critics , who quickly dismiss investment as a waste of effort .
" it ’ s not just about raw materials , it ’ s also about people ’ s willingness to roll up their sleeves and get down to work on their own behalf . "
" i think it ’ s in our own interest to help them . "
guilt over colonial past ?
schröder denies that germany ’ s colonial history has any bearing on his country ’ s current and future interest in africa .
" there have been some very dark chapters in our history .
one must only think of the hereros in namibia .
but that ’ s a long time ago , and many of the emotional wounds have healed , " he says .
" o course , we can not allow ourselves to forget the past , but it ’ s not the driving force behind a sensible africa policy .
it 's more about the here and now .
there can be no question that this continent must have a future , and it will . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder encourages more self-help for africa wrapping up his six-day tour of africa on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder inaugurated a peacekeeping training center in ghana , saying it will serve as a model for other countries .
german investment fund increases aid to developing world german development finance institute deg gave its annual report this week , announcing that it had increased its aid to developing countries by 9 percent in 2003 and contributed some € 506 million to projects around the world .

chancellor gerhard schröder concludes his six-day , four-country tour of africa with a stop in ghana on friday .
dw-tv met up with the german leader and asked him about his country ’ s growing interest in the continent . his first official visit to africa is already being hailed a success back in berlin .
after spending six days jetting across the continent with high-profile stops in ethiopia , kenya , south africa and ghana , schröder hopes to have driven home his point that africa is not only about war , famine and disease , and that germany is not only interested in the continent as a recipient of development aid , but rather that there are political and economic initiatives worthy of promoting .
speaking to dw-tv while in south africa , schröder says he is satisfied with the results of his visit , his first official one to the continent : " i think we made clear that germany wants to take an active involvement in those places where what ’ s called " good governance " is practiced . "
" these countries are making a genuine effort to stand on their own two feet , which is something we support , " he explains .
" they are trying to enforce the rule of law and principles of democracy .
and they ’ re trying to establish regional alliances that can promote trade and give us the opportunity to get involved in even bigger markets . "
the forgotten continent ?
africa has often been referred to as the " forgotten continent . "
europe , which once had an active interest in its development , has pretty much neglected the region except for the occasional peacekeeping missions to former colonies and the regular flow of humanitarian and economic aid .
but germany seems to be experiencing a growing interest in the continent .
after schröder ’ s visit , president johannes rau will go to africa .
foreign minister joschka fischer and the state secretary in the foreign office , kerstin müller , have frequently visited the region in an effort to drum up support for peace initiatives in countries like sudan and the congo .
schröder sees his country ’ s interest in africa as a continuation of germany ’ s foreign policy .
" we ’ re trying to make it clear that it ’ s worth countries ’ while to help themselves .
the reason is quite simple , " he says .
" a stable africa is in our own interest .
the fight against international terrorism will only be successful if africa manages to offer people a future , one in which they can live or at least survive . "
new dimension in africa policy the focus on security represents a shift in germany ’ s relations with africa , which was previously confined to development aid .
schröder says the joint emphasis on security and economic development is the key to future dealings with africa .
although still not as developed as north america , asia or europe , the chancellor is convinced that economic cooperation with africa could lead to a " potentially huge market . "
" we should not be talking down the potential , " he says referring to critics , who quickly dismiss investment as a waste of effort .
" it ’ s not just about raw materials , it ’ s also about people ’ s willingness to roll up their sleeves and get down to work on their own behalf . "
" i think it ’ s in our own interest to help them . "
guilt over colonial past ?
schröder denies that germany ’ s colonial history has any bearing on his country ’ s current and future interest in africa .
" there have been some very dark chapters in our history .
one must only think of the hereros in namibia .
but that ’ s a long time ago , and many of the emotional wounds have healed , " he says .
" o course , we can not allow ourselves to forget the past , but it ’ s not the driving force behind a sensible africa policy .

such an opportunity wo n't come up again anytime soon . germany is preparing to host the 2006 soccer world championship , and despite the fact that its coffers are empty , it will conjure up more than € 6 billion -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- to beef up its infrastructure in time for the tournament . economics minister wolfgang clement announced that the government would invest € 2 billion in building stadiums , € 3.9 billion in roadworks and € 500 million in traffic management systems in time for sports fans to descend on this soccer-crazed nation .
clement announced his intentions at an investors conference in leipzig aimed at making the financial most of the sporting event . image polishing " this world championship is for the time being a singular chance to show the world our economy 's power of innovation and to polish clean the ' made in germany ' brand , " clement told the politicians , businesspeople and sportsmen and women rallying in leipzig . indeed , germany wo n't have a similar opportunity anytime soon .
since fifa , the world soccer organization , chooses the sites for the tournament according to a system of rotation , europe wo n't get the games again until 2030 , at the earliest . by the time the tournament starts , on june 9 , 2006 , in munich 's olympic stadium , autobahn stretches , such as the route to prague and train lines , such as the segment between hamburg and berlin , should have been re-hauled .
stadiums should be linked with modern traffic-routing systems .

he suggested that 2006 could result in a breakthrough for high resolution television . backing up clement , franz beckenbauer , head of the organizing committee and former soccer champ , said up to 30 billion people would watch the competition on tv .
germany should make a good showing with so many people looking , he said .
aside from the tv viewers , 3.2 million guests - two-thirds from abroad - were expected to make their way to the world cup . big players , like adidas , one of the official sponsors of the world championship , have already staked out their shares .
adidas ceo herbert heiner has predicted the next few years will be good ones for the sporting goods manufacturer , thanks to the world cup . while federation of german industries head michael rogowski echoed the positive sentiments in leipzig , he cautioned not to be swept away by soccer passion .
germany must continue pursuing reform to get the german economic ball rolling , he urged . and , with contracts worth half a billion euros as yet to be awarded for the world cup , fifa could open the gates for other , smaller german firms to supply the tournament in addition to the select group of official partners clamouring on the pitch . dw staff -lrb- ni -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany aims to make 2006 world cup “ green ” germany 's world cup organizing committee has launched a " green goal " campaign that promises to make the 2006 soccer championships the most environmentally friendly sporting event ever .

german development finance institute deg gave its annual report this week , announcing it had increased its aid to developing countries by 9 percent in 2003 and contributed some € 506 million to projects around the world . with chancellor gerhard schröder touring africa , germany has been taking stock of its economic ties to the continent and reviewing its development aid schemes .
development financier deg -lrb- german investment and development foundation -rrb- has been making investments in africa for some four decades , in 2003 committing a total of € 80 million to businesses in south africa , mozambique , kenya and nigeria alone .
its projects aim to encourage sustainable growth and improve living conditions .
among other things , funding went to a leasing company in egypt , the cement industry in algeria , and mobile phone networks in algeria and nigeria .
the deg also has close to € 4 million invested with the industrial promotion services kenya , which furnishes east african companies with capital and management expertise .
a high volume of new business despite the global economic slump , the war in iraq , sars in asia and political and economic unrest in latin america , the deg has had a good year .
the bank , which lends money to german medium-sized companies investing in developing countries and emerging markets , saw its highest ever volume of new business since its founding 41 years ago .
with a portfolio of € 2,400 million , the deg is one of the biggest specialist banks concentrating on private sector promotion in europe .
its spokesman winfried polte points out that " without such institutions , many investment projects in asia , africa and eastern europe simply could n't be financed . "
deg invests in private companies that create jobs and income , thereby boosting the market economy and helping the individual .
in polte 's words , the " long-term investment financings render a major contribution to a sustainable development in the target countries . "
regional awareness " our perception of africa is marked by wars , famine and suffering , " says polte , but he 's quick to point out that " there are countries and industries with promising developments offering interesting business opportunities for foreign investors . "
polte is proud of one deg-backed scheme in particular . " one of our projects in egpyt won the alternative nobel prize , " he explains , adding that " the sekem holding makes organic pharmaceutical products and is exemplary in its benefits program for employees - the farmers - as it makes available broad social services such as schools and health centers . "
deg focuses on long term investments under market conditions .
but it is aware that africa has its unique problems and writes clauses into its contracts designed to help stop the spread of aids , for instance .
polte explains that the " contracts include a paragraph in which companies agree to offer staff a free test , regular information events and then practical things such as condom vending machines . "
end of an era here in europe , the entry of 10 new member states into the european union will be a new departure for many in the business world .
but for the deg , it means the end of an era.they will be leaving the new eu states in eastern europe and moving even further to the east .
these days , the focus of deg 's activities is on asia .
the bank has committed some € 18 million to a total of six projects in china alone .
polte points out that " in china we concentrate mainly on the agricultural sector .
we have three excellent companies there , two of which have now gone international " .
he also observes that the deg sees promoting networks as part of its task .
" we brought these chinese companies together with other companies working in uruguay and argentina , " he says . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german development finance institute deg gave its annual report this week , announcing it had increased its aid to developing countries by 9 percent in 2003 and contributed some € 506 million to projects around the world . with chancellor gerhard schröder touring africa , germany has been taking stock of its economic ties to the continent and reviewing its development aid schemes .
development financier deg -lrb- german investment and development foundation -rrb- has been making investments in africa for some four decades , in 2003 committing a total of € 80 million to businesses in south africa , mozambique , kenya and nigeria alone .
its projects aim to encourage sustainable growth and improve living conditions .
among other things , funding went to a leasing company in egypt , the cement industry in algeria , and mobile phone networks in algeria and nigeria .
the deg also has close to € 4 million invested with the industrial promotion services kenya , which furnishes east african companies with capital and management expertise .
a high volume of new business despite the global economic slump , the war in iraq , sars in asia and political and economic unrest in latin america , the deg has had a good year .
the bank , which lends money to german medium-sized companies investing in developing countries and emerging markets , saw its highest ever volume of new business since its founding 41 years ago .
with a portfolio of € 2,400 million , the deg is one of the biggest specialist banks concentrating on private sector promotion in europe .
its spokesman winfried polte points out that " without such institutions , many investment projects in asia , africa and eastern europe simply could n't be financed . "
deg invests in private companies that create jobs and income , thereby boosting the market economy and helping the individual .
in polte 's words , the " long-term investment financings render a major contribution to a sustainable development in the target countries . "
regional awareness " our perception of africa is marked by wars , famine and suffering , " says polte , but he 's quick to point out that " there are countries and industries with promising developments offering interesting business opportunities for foreign investors . "
polte is proud of one deg-backed scheme in particular . " one of our projects in egpyt won the alternative nobel prize , " he explains , adding that " the sekem holding makes organic pharmaceutical products and is exemplary in its benefits program for employees - the farmers - as it makes available broad social services such as schools and health centers . "
deg focuses on long term investments under market conditions .
but it is aware that africa has its unique problems and writes clauses into its contracts designed to help stop the spread of aids , for instance .
polte explains that the " contracts include a paragraph in which companies agree to offer staff a free test , regular information events and then practical things such as condom vending machines . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.01.2004 berlin honors photographer helmut newton großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agent provocateur - more than six decades pushing the limits of photography .
the german-born photographer died in a car accident in los angeles friday .
the self-proclaimed " king of kink , " who rose to fame with controversial images of women and fashion , will be honored with a new museum in berlin . celebrated , respected and controversial are just some of the words used to describe helmut newton .
best known for his provocative portraits of nude women , the berlin-born avant-garde fashion photographer spent some six decades transforming his craft and testing the limits of social acceptability .
" he was a giant , " said playboy founder hugh hefner .
" he was a major talent that pushed the boundaries in terms of photography and influenced many in following generations . "
for newton , his camera was a lens to explore power , gender roles and sexuality .
" i ’ m interested in power - i always was , whether it ’ s sexual power , financial power or political power , " he wrote in his 2002 autobiography .
bildunterschrift : retrospective exhibit in berlin 's new national gallery .
newton ’ s brazen and controversial style was exemplified in the 1980 and 1993 series " big nudes , " which featured larger-than-life images of women who were portrayed as dominating the camera rather than as subjects .
the stark black-and-white portraits were a shocking departure from conventional nude photos in their coldly erotic sensuality .
among one of the most famous images was a nude model with her neck in a surgical collar and one leg in a cast .
" he loves to be outrageous , " said anna wintour , who published much of newton ’ s work in vogue magazine .
" he has a perverse view of women that recurs again and again , " she said recently .
childhood in germany born in october 1920 , the son of a wealthy jewish button-manufacturer , newton enjoyed a privileged upbringing in berlin .
he attended the city ’ s american school , but because the photo-bug bit him early , he spent more time with his camera than his studies .

the self-proclaimed " king of kink , " who rose to fame with controversial images of women and fashion , will be honored with a new museum in berlin . celebrated , respected and controversial are just some of the words used to describe helmut newton .
best known for his provocative portraits of nude women , the berlin-born avant-garde fashion photographer spent some six decades transforming his craft and testing the limits of social acceptability .
" he was a giant , " said playboy founder hugh hefner .
" he was a major talent that pushed the boundaries in terms of photography and influenced many in following generations . "
for newton , his camera was a lens to explore power , gender roles and sexuality .
" i ’ m interested in power - i always was , whether it ’ s sexual power , financial power or political power , " he wrote in his 2002 autobiography .
bildunterschrift : retrospective exhibit in berlin 's new national gallery .
newton ’ s brazen and controversial style was exemplified in the 1980 and 1993 series " big nudes , " which featured larger-than-life images of women who were portrayed as dominating the camera rather than as subjects .
the stark black-and-white portraits were a shocking departure from conventional nude photos in their coldly erotic sensuality .
among one of the most famous images was a nude model with her neck in a surgical collar and one leg in a cast .
" he loves to be outrageous , " said anna wintour , who published much of newton ’ s work in vogue magazine .
" he has a perverse view of women that recurs again and again , " she said recently .
childhood in germany born in october 1920 , the son of a wealthy jewish button-manufacturer , newton enjoyed a privileged upbringing in berlin .
he attended the city ’ s american school , but because the photo-bug bit him early , he spent more time with his camera than his studies .

the german-born photographer died in a car accident in los angeles friday .
the self-proclaimed " king of kink , " who rose to fame with controversial images of women and fashion , will be honored with a new museum in berlin . celebrated , respected and controversial are just some of the words used to describe helmut newton .
best known for his provocative portraits of nude women , the berlin-born avant-garde fashion photographer spent some six decades transforming his craft and testing the limits of social acceptability .
" he was a giant , " said playboy founder hugh hefner .
" he was a major talent that pushed the boundaries in terms of photography and influenced many in following generations . "
for newton , his camera was a lens to explore power , gender roles and sexuality .
" i ’ m interested in power - i always was , whether it ’ s sexual power , financial power or political power , " he wrote in his 2002 autobiography .
bildunterschrift : retrospective exhibit in berlin 's new national gallery .
newton ’ s brazen and controversial style was exemplified in the 1980 and 1993 series " big nudes , " which featured larger-than-life images of women who were portrayed as dominating the camera rather than as subjects .
the stark black-and-white portraits were a shocking departure from conventional nude photos in their coldly erotic sensuality .
among one of the most famous images was a nude model with her neck in a surgical collar and one leg in a cast .
" he loves to be outrageous , " said anna wintour , who published much of newton ’ s work in vogue magazine .
" he has a perverse view of women that recurs again and again , " she said recently .
childhood in germany born in october 1920 , the son of a wealthy jewish button-manufacturer , newton enjoyed a privileged upbringing in berlin .
he attended the city ’ s american school , but because the photo-bug bit him early , he spent more time with his camera than his studies .
at the age of 15 , newton ’ s father told him , " my boy , you ’ ll end up in the gutter .
all you think of is girls and photos , " he wrote in his autobiography .
after leaving school in 1936 , the young newton worked as an apprentice to top photographer elsie simon , a job he held until forced to flee nazi-germany in 1938 .
after a brief stay in singapore , newton settled in australia , became a citizen and opened a small photography studio .
he also changed his name from neustädter to newton .
throughout his career he turned again and again to the subject of nazi germany , but not in a way typical for someone who lost loved ones in the concentration camps .
in a series of portraits , newton photographed hitler ’ s official filmmaker leni riefenstahl , former u.n. secretary general kurt waldheim , who was involved in nazi atrocities , and right-wing french political leader jean-marie le pen .
his own wife , june , posed in a 1973 series as hitler with model jerry hall posing as eva bruan .
but newton never dwelled on the past for long .
" i find this kind of living in the past useless and unproductive , " he wrote in his book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newton leaves 1,000 photographs to the city of berlin newton ’ s homecoming in october 2003 , newton recognized the importance his early life in berlin had on his career and donated more than 1,000 pictures to a new gallery in berlin .
at the opening , the photographer said he was " proud " his works would be displayed in his hometown .
" not just the nudes , but all the others " will be available for everyone to see , he said .
german chancellor gerhard schröder called newton ’ s decision a " sign of reconciliation . "
" you can chase a man out of his home but you can ’ t rip his home out of his soul , " the german leader said in a letter read at the news conference .
starting in june , newton 's works will be on permanent display in berlin ’ s former art library across the street from the central train station .
at the time of the donation , newton who has no children , suggested the city would eventually receive his entire archive .

stolpmann added that the 42-year-old man has a “ schizoid personality ” and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " the expert said .
meiwes has admitted that he killed and ate the other man with the latter ’ s permission in march 2001 .

his father left the family when meiwes was nine years old , causing the boy to develop a relationship disorder .
his subsequent desire to slaughter consenting young men was based on the wish to get so close to another person that he could never be left again , stolpmann said .
" he calls himself ‘ a solitary wolf that ’ s all alone , ’ " the psychiatrist said , adding that meiwes ' cannibalistic urges increased after the death of his mother in 1999 .
he “ fulfilled his dream ” by killing the other man , stolpmann testified .
the trial continues on monday with closing statements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany still lighting up much of europe bans smoking ; germany keeps puffing away germany : european smoker 's paradise germany gets eu slap on the wrist over tobacco laws germany 's close ties to big tobacco germany -pipe- 25.01.2004 where there 's smoke , there 's germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite health warnings on cigarettes , germans are unlikely to kick the habit .
" smoking can cause a slow and painful death " reads one of the new warnings on cigarette packets in germany .
but there is doubt as to just how seriously such in-the-face warnings are being taken . it takes a visit to germany to believe just how smoky a society it is .
ranking third after spain and greece when it comes to the number of smokers on its books , germany celebrates smoking as a way of life .
it is so ingrained that the printed threats which dominate 21st century cigarette packets seem unlikely to scare too many smokers into stubbing out for good . although official statistics show that cigarette sales in 2003 dropped by nine percent over the previous year , and big brand producers have reported trailing sales in germany , there is no doubt that the german population is still puffing away .
in reality , more smokers have been turning to rolling tobacco and cigars , which have been spared the higher taxation rates dumped on cigarettes over the past couple of years . there is also evidence that more and more smokers are turning to unofficial sources to feed their habit .
a spokesman for british american tobacco , which puts its name to the likes of lucky strike and gauloises blondes , told the reuters news agency that increased tobacco taxes might blow smokers out of their clutch and onto the black market .
" our concern is that the new taxes will not stop people smoking , but that they will turn to the black market and cheaper forms of tobacco , " he said . some fear that the trend in buying cheaper cigarettes will grow once the eu opens its eastern borders to accession members in may .
head of the association of german cigarette producers , ernst brückner , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that once the borders are open , smokers who live near poland , for example , will systematically shop in the neighboring country in order to circumnavigate further tax hikes planned by the german government over the next two years .
the first of these increases will push the price of a packet of smokes up from its currently modest european rate of € 3 -lrb- $ 3.80 -rrb- by a further euro . keeping the smoke out of bars earlier this month , the eu commission announced it was considering a move to outlaw smoking in bars and restaurants across the 15 member states .
european health commissioner david byrne told die welt newspaper that if the eu were thinking of introducing smoke-free work places , they would have to extend the ban to include bars and restaurants . the suggestion met with rigid resistance in germany , where relaxing in a bar with a stick of nicotine and preferred tipple is quite simply part of the fabric of society .
german cities are splitting at the seams with bars and restaurants and at best only one in two of them have a designated smoking section with the rest of the hostelry deemed smoke free . marc schnerr , press officer at the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- told dw-world that he believed david byrne was on the warpath against smokers , and added that any move to ban smokers from lighting up in gastronomic venues would have disastrous consequences for jobs in the industry . " take small bars for example , they do n't have the space to section off a no-smoking area , and a ban would mean massive reductions in turnover for them , " schnerr said .
the knock-on effect of that , he added , was the threat to thousands of jobs and trainee positions in the industry . too many laws schnerr believes that germans feel they are surrounded by more than enough legislation as it is , and that the implementation of smoking laws in places traditionally reserved for fun would rob the nation of the last place where smokers and non-smokers can relax under the same public roof . he believes the issue has to be dealt with on an individual basis .
it should be left up to the businesses themselves .
people go to these places voluntarily and they are not inconsiderate of one another once there , the dhg spokesman told dw-world . he also stressed that his organisation was always at pains to encourage hoteliers and restaurant owners to take the wishes of non-smokers into consideration .
as long as they continue to provide enough places for both smokers and non-smokers to go , he believes the thousands of jobs which would be blown away with a ban , will be kept from going up in smoke . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clouds of smoke over europe not only germany is having to deal with the foggy issue of what to do with determined smokers , many european countries have been looking for ways to encourage their citizens quit .

head of the association of german cigarette producers , ernst brückner , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that once the borders are open , smokers who live near poland , for example , will systematically shop in the neighboring country in order to circumnavigate further tax hikes planned by the german government over the next two years .
the first of these increases will push the price of a packet of smokes up from its currently modest european rate of € 3 -lrb- $ 3.80 -rrb- by a further euro . keeping the smoke out of bars earlier this month , the eu commission announced it was considering a move to outlaw smoking in bars and restaurants across the 15 member states .
european health commissioner david byrne told die welt newspaper that if the eu were thinking of introducing smoke-free work places , they would have to extend the ban to include bars and restaurants . the suggestion met with rigid resistance in germany , where relaxing in a bar with a stick of nicotine and preferred tipple is quite simply part of the fabric of society .
german cities are splitting at the seams with bars and restaurants and at best only one in two of them have a designated smoking section with the rest of the hostelry deemed smoke free . marc schnerr , press officer at the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- told dw-world that he believed david byrne was on the warpath against smokers , and added that any move to ban smokers from lighting up in gastronomic venues would have disastrous consequences for jobs in the industry . " take small bars for example , they do n't have the space to section off a no-smoking area , and a ban would mean massive reductions in turnover for them , " schnerr said .
the knock-on effect of that , he added , was the threat to thousands of jobs and trainee positions in the industry . too many laws schnerr believes that germans feel they are surrounded by more than enough legislation as it is , and that the implementation of smoking laws in places traditionally reserved for fun would rob the nation of the last place where smokers and non-smokers can relax under the same public roof . he believes the issue has to be dealt with on an individual basis .
it should be left up to the businesses themselves .
people go to these places voluntarily and they are not inconsiderate of one another once there , the dhg spokesman told dw-world . he also stressed that his organisation was always at pains to encourage hoteliers and restaurant owners to take the wishes of non-smokers into consideration .
as long as they continue to provide enough places for both smokers and non-smokers to go , he believes the thousands of jobs which would be blown away with a ban , will be kept from going up in smoke . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clouds of smoke over europe not only germany is having to deal with the foggy issue of what to do with determined smokers , many european countries have been looking for ways to encourage their citizens quit .

from raising the price of cigarettes to installing bans in the workplace , many european countries have been looking for ways to get their citizens to quit smoking without infringing on their personal rights . although european health commissioner , david byrne has been publicly mulling over the possibility of seeking an all-out eu ban on smoking in the workplace , so far there are no europe-wide regulations on smoking or the price of tobacco - which currently ranges from € 2 -lrb- $ 2.50 -rrb- to € 7.20 for a packet of 20 cigarettes .
earlier this month , france called on the european commission to up the minimum eu excise duty on a packet of cigarettes , thus putting a stop to stobacco tourism .
but eu tax commissioner fritz bolkenstein said the proposals would be unlikely to succeed as it was a fundamental eu freedom to carry legally purchased goods from one country to another without incurring additional taxation .

belgium : with the highest rate of lung cancer fatalities in europe , brussels has gradually been toughening up the nation 's anti-smoking laws .

smoking on trains has been outlawed and belgian workplaces are to be made completely smoke-free by 2006 .
france : tobacco prices have risen three times in the past 12 months and currently cost € 5 .
france says that the increase has proved its effectiveness in the fight against nicotine addiction , but since the rise french tobacconists have bemoaned the loss of business , with smokers preferring to cross the border to luxembourg , belgium and spain to buy cigarettes at a cheaper rate .
greece : with some 44 percent of the greeks over the age of 15 confirmed smokers , greece is the smokiest country in the eu .
laws passed in 2002 outlawed smoking in many public areas and introduced designated areas in restaurants across the country .

one third of holland 's 16 million-strong population currently smokes , and the move is aimed at slashing that number back by five percent over the next five years .
ireland : the emerald isle has been in the headlines over a planned smoking ban , originally due to come into effect at the start of the year .
however , the ban , which is to be imposed in all work places including bars and restaurants , was postponed at least until february due to dubliners concerns that it might not be watertight .
the pending law has met with fierce opposition from the gastronomy industry , which fears a drop in takings if smokers are no longer allowed to feed their habits on the premises .
spain : although the number of smokers in spain has fallen from 34.4 million to 31 million , it still has one of the highest smoker rates in europe .
it is something of a national sport , a fact which critics gladly blame on the low cost of cigarettes .
at € 2.65 a packet , the price is below the european average , but the government recently rejected calls to significantly up the price because of the inflationary affect this would have .

from raising the price of cigarettes to installing bans in the workplace , many european countries have been looking for ways to get their citizens to quit smoking without infringing on their personal rights . although european health commissioner , david byrne has been publicly mulling over the possibility of seeking an all-out eu ban on smoking in the workplace , so far there are no europe-wide regulations on smoking or the price of tobacco - which currently ranges from € 2 -lrb- $ 2.50 -rrb- to € 7.20 for a packet of 20 cigarettes .

scientists now believe it was once carved out by a mighty river or a massive glacier .
thanks to new data from the instruments aboard the mars express probe released by the european space agency on friday , they have their best evidence yet .
taken together , the images and data provide compelling evidence that there are ice sheets beneath the martian crust and that water once flowed across the red planet ’ s surface . ” you look at the picture , look at the fingerprint and say this is water ice , ” mars express project manager allen moorehouse said at mission control in darmstadt , germany .
“ this is the first time it ’ s been detected on the ground .
this is the first direct confirmation . ”
using a combined camera and infrared spectrometer , mars express ’ omega instrument began mapping the planet ’ s south polar cap on jan .
18 .
omega has indirectly detected the presence of both water ice and carbon dioxide ice , esa said .
the discovery clearly pleased scientists at esa , who suffered a setback in december with the likely destruction of its beagle 2 lander , which was intended to probe the surface of mars for organic matter and other signs of life . ” i did not expect to be able to gather together , just one month after the mars orbit insertion of dec .
25 , so many happy scientists eager to present their first results , ” said esa director of science david southwood .
european scientists hope to find large reserves of ice beneath the surface of mars that can be used to supply water and fuel for future manned space missions .
water molecules detected ” it ’ s been looked at for such a long time and it ’ s been inferred there was water at the south pole , ” said jean-pierre bibring an esa scientist from the institute of space astrophysics in orsay , france .
bibring said an infrared camera on board mars express had detected vapors of water molecules .
“ this is the first time we can really see vapors of the molecules themselves , ” he said .
evidence of water has been found by multiple instruments on mars express and the satellite has also found evidence that water is being pulled from mars into space , a theory scientists have long suspected .
in march 2002 , nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter indirectly detected water ice on the planet ’ s southern pole using a gamma ray spectrometer that found hydrogen which , when combined with air , creates water .
the european mission provides independent confirmation of nasa ’ s earlier finding .
but taken together with other experiments , including high-resolution maps showing what was likely the effects of erosion on the landscape caused by water , esa has provided the strongest proof yet . ” previous measurements have been indirect and this is the first time we have direct indications of molecules that are present in water , ” southwood said .
“ of course , finding anything that has to do with water on mars is sort of a holy grail .
this is certainly better than anything we ’ ve had so far . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this picture was taken by the high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- onboard esa 's mars express orbiter , in colour and 3d , in orbit 18 on 15 january 2004 from a height of 273 km .
the location is east of the hellas basin at 41 ° south and 101 ° east .
the area is 100 km across , with a resolution of 12 m per pixel , and shows a channel -lrb- reull vallis -rrb- once formed by flowing water .

neukum and his crew have already gathered more than 100 gigabytes of data from the camera .
he said he hoped the camera would be able to detect if some of the rocks on mars are actually blocks of ice .
mars express first entered into martian orbit at christmas .
it will continue delivering data from its scientific instruments for the next two years . ” europe can be proud of this mission , ” said edelgard bulmahn , germany ’ s minister for research and education .

scientists now believe it was once carved out by a mighty river or a massive glacier .
thanks to new data from the instruments aboard the mars express probe released by the european space agency on friday , they have their best evidence yet .
taken together , the images and data provide compelling evidence that there are ice sheets beneath the martian crust and that water once flowed across the red planet ’ s surface . ” you look at the picture , look at the fingerprint and say this is water ice , ” mars express project manager allen moorehouse said at mission control in darmstadt , germany .
“ this is the first time it ’ s been detected on the ground .
this is the first direct confirmation . ”
using a combined camera and infrared spectrometer , mars express ’ omega instrument began mapping the planet ’ s south polar cap on jan .
18 .
omega has indirectly detected the presence of both water ice and carbon dioxide ice , esa said .
the discovery clearly pleased scientists at esa , who suffered a setback in december with the likely destruction of its beagle 2 lander , which was intended to probe the surface of mars for organic matter and other signs of life . ” i did not expect to be able to gather together , just one month after the mars orbit insertion of dec .
25 , so many happy scientists eager to present their first results , ” said esa director of science david southwood .
european scientists hope to find large reserves of ice beneath the surface of mars that can be used to supply water and fuel for future manned space missions .
water molecules detected ” it ’ s been looked at for such a long time and it ’ s been inferred there was water at the south pole , ” said jean-pierre bibring an esa scientist from the institute of space astrophysics in orsay , france .
bibring said an infrared camera on board mars express had detected vapors of water molecules .
“ this is the first time we can really see vapors of the molecules themselves , ” he said .
evidence of water has been found by multiple instruments on mars express and the satellite has also found evidence that water is being pulled from mars into space , a theory scientists have long suspected .
in march 2002 , nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter indirectly detected water ice on the planet ’ s southern pole using a gamma ray spectrometer that found hydrogen which , when combined with air , creates water .
the european mission provides independent confirmation of nasa ’ s earlier finding .
but taken together with other experiments , including high-resolution maps showing what was likely the effects of erosion on the landscape caused by water , esa has provided the strongest proof yet . ” previous measurements have been indirect and this is the first time we have direct indications of molecules that are present in water , ” southwood said .

gunther von hagens , who preserves human bodies to exhibit them , has denied using corpses of executed chinese in his shows .
hagens ' critics meanwhile reiterated claims that the exhibitions violate german law . wearing his signature fedora , the controversial german doctor defended his business practices after german news magazine der spiegel raised questions about his work in a cover story this week .
" i have not turned corpses of the executed into exhibits , " hagens said , but added that he could n't guarantee that bodies of executed people had never been dropped off at his production facility in dalian in northeastern china .
a common chinese practice ?
accepting unidentified bodies from the police was common practice at dalian university 's institute for plastination , hagens said , adding that his company worked closely with the institute .
plastination is the technique developed by hagens to turn corpses into odorless and durable exhibits by draining out bodily fluids and fat and replacing them with plastic .
taking these so-called " ownerless bodies " is " a completely normal thing to do and was customary in germany until the 1980s , " hagens told reporters in frankfurt , where " body worlds " is currently on show .
he added that he had instructed his employees not to accept bodies of the executed any more .
der spiegel had reported that at least two bodies included in an inventory list of hagens ' dalian facility had bullet holes in their heads .
" but not every corpse with a bullet hole has been executed , " he said , implying that some might have been victims of a crime .
documents made available to the german news magazine , however , show that hagens knew for at least two years that executed bodies were used in his work .
according to der spiegel , a former employee of the dalian institute threatened to go to the chinese media with the " true story " of the fresh corpses , but was then silenced with a large sum of money .

scientists now believe it was once carved out by a mighty river or a massive glacier .
thanks to new data from the instruments aboard the mars express probe released by the european space agency on friday , they have their best evidence yet .
taken together , the images and data provide compelling evidence that there are ice sheets beneath the martian crust and that water once flowed across the red planet ’ s surface . ” you look at the picture , look at the fingerprint and say this is water ice , ” mars express project manager allen moorehouse said at mission control in darmstadt , germany .
“ this is the first time it ’ s been detected on the ground .
this is the first direct confirmation . ”
using a combined camera and infrared spectrometer , mars express ’ omega instrument began mapping the planet ’ s south polar cap on jan .
18 .
omega has indirectly detected the presence of both water ice and carbon dioxide ice , esa said .
the discovery clearly pleased scientists at esa , who suffered a setback in december with the likely destruction of its beagle 2 lander , which was intended to probe the surface of mars for organic matter and other signs of life . ” i did not expect to be able to gather together , just one month after the mars orbit insertion of dec .
25 , so many happy scientists eager to present their first results , ” said esa director of science david southwood .
european scientists hope to find large reserves of ice beneath the surface of mars that can be used to supply water and fuel for future manned space missions .
water molecules detected ” it ’ s been looked at for such a long time and it ’ s been inferred there was water at the south pole , ” said jean-pierre bibring an esa scientist from the institute of space astrophysics in orsay , france .
bibring said an infrared camera on board mars express had detected vapors of water molecules .
“ this is the first time we can really see vapors of the molecules themselves , ” he said .
evidence of water has been found by multiple instruments on mars express and the satellite has also found evidence that water is being pulled from mars into space , a theory scientists have long suspected .
in march 2002 , nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter indirectly detected water ice on the planet ’ s southern pole using a gamma ray spectrometer that found hydrogen which , when combined with air , creates water .
the european mission provides independent confirmation of nasa ’ s earlier finding .
but taken together with other experiments , including high-resolution maps showing what was likely the effects of erosion on the landscape caused by water , esa has provided the strongest proof yet . ” previous measurements have been indirect and this is the first time we have direct indications of molecules that are present in water , ” southwood said .
“ of course , finding anything that has to do with water on mars is sort of a holy grail .
this is certainly better than anything we ’ ve had so far . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this picture was taken by the high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- onboard esa 's mars express orbiter , in colour and 3d , in orbit 18 on 15 january 2004 from a height of 273 km .
the location is east of the hellas basin at 41 ° south and 101 ° east .
the area is 100 km across , with a resolution of 12 m per pixel , and shows a channel -lrb- reull vallis -rrb- once formed by flowing water .
the landscape is seen in a vertical view , north is at the top .

neukum and his crew have already gathered more than 100 gigabytes of data from the camera .
he said he hoped the camera would be able to detect if some of the rocks on mars are actually blocks of ice .
mars express first entered into martian orbit at christmas .
it will continue delivering data from its scientific instruments for the next two years . ” europe can be proud of this mission , ” said edelgard bulmahn , germany ’ s minister for research and education .

“ this is the first time we can really see vapors of the molecules themselves , ” he said .
evidence of water has been found by multiple instruments on mars express and the satellite has also found evidence that water is being pulled from mars into space , a theory scientists have long suspected .
in march 2002 , nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter indirectly detected water ice on the planet ’ s southern pole using a gamma ray spectrometer that found hydrogen which , when combined with air , creates water .
the european mission provides independent confirmation of nasa ’ s earlier finding .
but taken together with other experiments , including high-resolution maps showing what was likely the effects of erosion on the landscape caused by water , esa has provided the strongest proof yet . ” previous measurements have been indirect and this is the first time we have direct indications of molecules that are present in water , ” southwood said .
“ of course , finding anything that has to do with water on mars is sort of a holy grail .
this is certainly better than anything we ’ ve had so far . ”

scientists now believe it was once carved out by a mighty river or a massive glacier .
thanks to new data from the instruments aboard the mars express probe released by the european space agency on friday , they have their best evidence yet .
taken together , the images and data provide compelling evidence that there are ice sheets beneath the martian crust and that water once flowed across the red planet ’ s surface . ” you look at the picture , look at the fingerprint and say this is water ice , ” mars express project manager allen moorehouse said at mission control in darmstadt , germany .
“ this is the first time it ’ s been detected on the ground .
this is the first direct confirmation . ”
using a combined camera and infrared spectrometer , mars express ’ omega instrument began mapping the planet ’ s south polar cap on jan .
18 .
omega has indirectly detected the presence of both water ice and carbon dioxide ice , esa said .
the discovery clearly pleased scientists at esa , who suffered a setback in december with the likely destruction of its beagle 2 lander , which was intended to probe the surface of mars for organic matter and other signs of life . ” i did not expect to be able to gather together , just one month after the mars orbit insertion of dec .

from raising the price of cigarettes to installing bans in the workplace , many european countries have been looking for ways to get their citizens to quit smoking without infringing on their personal rights . although european health commissioner , david byrne has been publicly mulling over the possibility of seeking an all-out eu ban on smoking in the workplace , so far there are no europe-wide regulations on smoking or the price of tobacco - which currently ranges from € 2 -lrb- $ 2.50 -rrb- to € 7.20 for a packet of 20 cigarettes .
earlier this month , france called on the european commission to up the minimum eu excise duty on a packet of cigarettes , thus putting a stop to stobacco tourism .

france : tobacco prices have risen three times in the past 12 months and currently cost € 5 .
france says that the increase has proved its effectiveness in the fight against nicotine addiction , but since the rise french tobacconists have bemoaned the loss of business , with smokers preferring to cross the border to luxembourg , belgium and spain to buy cigarettes at a cheaper rate .

however , the ban , which is to be imposed in all work places including bars and restaurants , was postponed at least until february due to dubliners concerns that it might not be watertight .
the pending law has met with fierce opposition from the gastronomy industry , which fears a drop in takings if smokers are no longer allowed to feed their habits on the premises .

from raising the price of cigarettes to installing bans in the workplace , many european countries have been looking for ways to get their citizens to quit smoking without infringing on their personal rights . although european health commissioner , david byrne has been publicly mulling over the possibility of seeking an all-out eu ban on smoking in the workplace , so far there are no europe-wide regulations on smoking or the price of tobacco - which currently ranges from € 2 -lrb- $ 2.50 -rrb- to € 7.20 for a packet of 20 cigarettes .

" smoking can cause a slow and painful death " reads one of the new warnings on cigarette packets in germany .
but there is doubt as to just how seriously such in-the-face warnings are being taken . it takes a visit to germany to believe just how smoky a society it is .
ranking third after spain and greece when it comes to the number of smokers on its books , germany celebrates smoking as a way of life .
it is so ingrained that the printed threats which dominate 21st century cigarette packets seem unlikely to scare too many smokers into stubbing out for good . although official statistics show that cigarette sales in 2003 dropped by nine percent over the previous year , and big brand producers have reported trailing sales in germany , there is no doubt that the german population is still puffing away .
in reality , more smokers have been turning to rolling tobacco and cigars , which have been spared the higher taxation rates dumped on cigarettes over the past couple of years . there is also evidence that more and more smokers are turning to unofficial sources to feed their habit .
a spokesman for british american tobacco , which puts its name to the likes of lucky strike and gauloises blondes , told the reuters news agency that increased tobacco taxes might blow smokers out of their clutch and onto the black market .
" our concern is that the new taxes will not stop people smoking , but that they will turn to the black market and cheaper forms of tobacco , " he said . some fear that the trend in buying cheaper cigarettes will grow once the eu opens its eastern borders to accession members in may .
head of the association of german cigarette producers , ernst brückner , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that once the borders are open , smokers who live near poland , for example , will systematically shop in the neighboring country in order to circumnavigate further tax hikes planned by the german government over the next two years .
the first of these increases will push the price of a packet of smokes up from its currently modest european rate of € 3 -lrb- $ 3.80 -rrb- by a further euro . keeping the smoke out of bars earlier this month , the eu commission announced it was considering a move to outlaw smoking in bars and restaurants across the 15 member states .
european health commissioner david byrne told die welt newspaper that if the eu were thinking of introducing smoke-free work places , they would have to extend the ban to include bars and restaurants . the suggestion met with rigid resistance in germany , where relaxing in a bar with a stick of nicotine and preferred tipple is quite simply part of the fabric of society .
german cities are splitting at the seams with bars and restaurants and at best only one in two of them have a designated smoking section with the rest of the hostelry deemed smoke free . marc schnerr , press officer at the german hotel and restaurant association -lrb- dehoga -rrb- told dw-world that he believed david byrne was on the warpath against smokers , and added that any move to ban smokers from lighting up in gastronomic venues would have disastrous consequences for jobs in the industry . " take small bars for example , they do n't have the space to section off a no-smoking area , and a ban would mean massive reductions in turnover for them , " schnerr said .
the knock-on effect of that , he added , was the threat to thousands of jobs and trainee positions in the industry . too many laws schnerr believes that germans feel they are surrounded by more than enough legislation as it is , and that the implementation of smoking laws in places traditionally reserved for fun would rob the nation of the last place where smokers and non-smokers can relax under the same public roof . he believes the issue has to be dealt with on an individual basis .
it should be left up to the businesses themselves .
people go to these places voluntarily and they are not inconsiderate of one another once there , the dhg spokesman told dw-world . he also stressed that his organisation was always at pains to encourage hoteliers and restaurant owners to take the wishes of non-smokers into consideration .
as long as they continue to provide enough places for both smokers and non-smokers to go , he believes the thousands of jobs which would be blown away with a ban , will be kept from going up in smoke . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clouds of smoke over europe not only germany is having to deal with the foggy issue of what to do with determined smokers , many european countries have been looking for ways to encourage their citizens quit .

" take small bars for example , they do n't have the space to section off a no-smoking area , and a ban would mean massive reductions in turnover for them , " schnerr said .
the knock-on effect of that , he added , was the threat to thousands of jobs and trainee positions in the industry . too many laws schnerr believes that germans feel they are surrounded by more than enough legislation as it is , and that the implementation of smoking laws in places traditionally reserved for fun would rob the nation of the last place where smokers and non-smokers can relax under the same public roof . he believes the issue has to be dealt with on an individual basis .

" smoking can cause a slow and painful death " reads one of the new warnings on cigarette packets in germany .
but there is doubt as to just how seriously such in-the-face warnings are being taken . it takes a visit to germany to believe just how smoky a society it is .
ranking third after spain and greece when it comes to the number of smokers on its books , germany celebrates smoking as a way of life .
it is so ingrained that the printed threats which dominate 21st century cigarette packets seem unlikely to scare too many smokers into stubbing out for good . although official statistics show that cigarette sales in 2003 dropped by nine percent over the previous year , and big brand producers have reported trailing sales in germany , there is no doubt that the german population is still puffing away .
in reality , more smokers have been turning to rolling tobacco and cigars , which have been spared the higher taxation rates dumped on cigarettes over the past couple of years . there is also evidence that more and more smokers are turning to unofficial sources to feed their habit .
a spokesman for british american tobacco , which puts its name to the likes of lucky strike and gauloises blondes , told the reuters news agency that increased tobacco taxes might blow smokers out of their clutch and onto the black market .
" our concern is that the new taxes will not stop people smoking , but that they will turn to the black market and cheaper forms of tobacco , " he said . some fear that the trend in buying cheaper cigarettes will grow once the eu opens its eastern borders to accession members in may .
head of the association of german cigarette producers , ernst brückner , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that once the borders are open , smokers who live near poland , for example , will systematically shop in the neighboring country in order to circumnavigate further tax hikes planned by the german government over the next two years .

german development finance institute deg gave its annual report this week , announcing it had increased its aid to developing countries by 9 percent in 2003 and contributed some € 506 million to projects around the world . with chancellor gerhard schröder touring africa , germany has been taking stock of its economic ties to the continent and reviewing its development aid schemes .
development financier deg -lrb- german investment and development foundation -rrb- has been making investments in africa for some four decades , in 2003 committing a total of € 80 million to businesses in south africa , mozambique , kenya and nigeria alone .
its projects aim to encourage sustainable growth and improve living conditions .
among other things , funding went to a leasing company in egypt , the cement industry in algeria , and mobile phone networks in algeria and nigeria .
the deg also has close to € 4 million invested with the industrial promotion services kenya , which furnishes east african companies with capital and management expertise .
a high volume of new business despite the global economic slump , the war in iraq , sars in asia and political and economic unrest in latin america , the deg has had a good year .
the bank , which lends money to german medium-sized companies investing in developing countries and emerging markets , saw its highest ever volume of new business since its founding 41 years ago .
with a portfolio of € 2,400 million , the deg is one of the biggest specialist banks concentrating on private sector promotion in europe .
its spokesman winfried polte points out that " without such institutions , many investment projects in asia , africa and eastern europe simply could n't be financed . "
deg invests in private companies that create jobs and income , thereby boosting the market economy and helping the individual .
in polte 's words , the " long-term investment financings render a major contribution to a sustainable development in the target countries . "
regional awareness " our perception of africa is marked by wars , famine and suffering , " says polte , but he 's quick to point out that " there are countries and industries with promising developments offering interesting business opportunities for foreign investors . "
polte is proud of one deg-backed scheme in particular . " one of our projects in egpyt won the alternative nobel prize , " he explains , adding that " the sekem holding makes organic pharmaceutical products and is exemplary in its benefits program for employees - the farmers - as it makes available broad social services such as schools and health centers . "
deg focuses on long term investments under market conditions .
but it is aware that africa has its unique problems and writes clauses into its contracts designed to help stop the spread of aids , for instance .
polte explains that the " contracts include a paragraph in which companies agree to offer staff a free test , regular information events and then practical things such as condom vending machines . "
end of an era here in europe , the entry of 10 new member states into the european union will be a new departure for many in the business world .
but for the deg , it means the end of an era.they will be leaving the new eu states in eastern europe and moving even further to the east .
these days , the focus of deg 's activities is on asia .
the bank has committed some € 18 million to a total of six projects in china alone .
polte points out that " in china we concentrate mainly on the agricultural sector .
we have three excellent companies there , two of which have now gone international " .
he also observes that the deg sees promoting networks as part of its task .

chancellor gerhard schröder concludes his six-day , four-country tour of africa with a stop in ghana on friday .
dw-tv met up with the german leader and asked him about his country ’ s growing interest in the continent . his first official visit to africa is already being hailed a success back in berlin .
after spending six days jetting across the continent with high-profile stops in ethiopia , kenya , south africa and ghana , schröder hopes to have driven home his point that africa is not only about war , famine and disease , and that germany is not only interested in the continent as a recipient of development aid , but rather that there are political and economic initiatives worthy of promoting .
speaking to dw-tv while in south africa , schröder says he is satisfied with the results of his visit , his first official one to the continent : " i think we made clear that germany wants to take an active involvement in those places where what ’ s called " good governance " is practiced . "
" these countries are making a genuine effort to stand on their own two feet , which is something we support , " he explains .
" they are trying to enforce the rule of law and principles of democracy .
and they ’ re trying to establish regional alliances that can promote trade and give us the opportunity to get involved in even bigger markets . "
the forgotten continent ?
africa has often been referred to as the " forgotten continent . "
europe , which once had an active interest in its development , has pretty much neglected the region except for the occasional peacekeeping missions to former colonies and the regular flow of humanitarian and economic aid .
but germany seems to be experiencing a growing interest in the continent .
after schröder ’ s visit , president johannes rau will go to africa .
foreign minister joschka fischer and the state secretary in the foreign office , kerstin müller , have frequently visited the region in an effort to drum up support for peace initiatives in countries like sudan and the congo .
schröder sees his country ’ s interest in africa as a continuation of germany ’ s foreign policy .
" we ’ re trying to make it clear that it ’ s worth countries ’ while to help themselves .
the reason is quite simple , " he says .
" a stable africa is in our own interest .
the fight against international terrorism will only be successful if africa manages to offer people a future , one in which they can live or at least survive . "
new dimension in africa policy the focus on security represents a shift in germany ’ s relations with africa , which was previously confined to development aid .
schröder says the joint emphasis on security and economic development is the key to future dealings with africa .
although still not as developed as north america , asia or europe , the chancellor is convinced that economic cooperation with africa could lead to a " potentially huge market . "
" we should not be talking down the potential , " he says referring to critics , who quickly dismiss investment as a waste of effort .
" it ’ s not just about raw materials , it ’ s also about people ’ s willingness to roll up their sleeves and get down to work on their own behalf . "
" i think it ’ s in our own interest to help them . "
guilt over colonial past ?
schröder denies that germany ’ s colonial history has any bearing on his country ’ s current and future interest in africa .
" there have been some very dark chapters in our history .
one must only think of the hereros in namibia .
but that ’ s a long time ago , and many of the emotional wounds have healed , " he says .
" o course , we can not allow ourselves to forget the past , but it ’ s not the driving force behind a sensible africa policy .
it 's more about the here and now .
there can be no question that this continent must have a future , and it will .

chancellor gerhard schröder concludes his six-day , four-country tour of africa with a stop in ghana on friday .
dw-tv met up with the german leader and asked him about his country ’ s growing interest in the continent . his first official visit to africa is already being hailed a success back in berlin .
after spending six days jetting across the continent with high-profile stops in ethiopia , kenya , south africa and ghana , schröder hopes to have driven home his point that africa is not only about war , famine and disease , and that germany is not only interested in the continent as a recipient of development aid , but rather that there are political and economic initiatives worthy of promoting .
speaking to dw-tv while in south africa , schröder says he is satisfied with the results of his visit , his first official one to the continent : " i think we made clear that germany wants to take an active involvement in those places where what ’ s called " good governance " is practiced . "
" these countries are making a genuine effort to stand on their own two feet , which is something we support , " he explains .
" they are trying to enforce the rule of law and principles of democracy .
and they ’ re trying to establish regional alliances that can promote trade and give us the opportunity to get involved in even bigger markets . "
the forgotten continent ?
africa has often been referred to as the " forgotten continent . "
europe , which once had an active interest in its development , has pretty much neglected the region except for the occasional peacekeeping missions to former colonies and the regular flow of humanitarian and economic aid .
but germany seems to be experiencing a growing interest in the continent .
after schröder ’ s visit , president johannes rau will go to africa .
foreign minister joschka fischer and the state secretary in the foreign office , kerstin müller , have frequently visited the region in an effort to drum up support for peace initiatives in countries like sudan and the congo .
schröder sees his country ’ s interest in africa as a continuation of germany ’ s foreign policy .
" we ’ re trying to make it clear that it ’ s worth countries ’ while to help themselves .
the reason is quite simple , " he says .
" a stable africa is in our own interest .

africa needs to improve its efforts for solving conflicts on the continent , and it requires the help from the rest of the world to do so .

africa needs to improve its efforts for solving conflicts on the continent , and it requires the help from the rest of the world to do so .

as head of the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- , kufuor sent ghanaian troops to help end fighting in the ivory coast and liberia .
" that is why the g-8 last year agreed with the european union and the united nations to strengthen african continental and regional organizations in conflict management and to help make them more effective , " the german leader said .
a center for peace as its part in that goal , germany donated more than € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.52 million -rrb- towards the construction of the kofi annan center which will focus on military , police and civilian measures for securing peace .
" it is essential for these three areas to be closely linked , " schröder said .
" purely military peace missions can not eliminate insecurity and instability in the long run , " he added .
as part of his country ’ s pledge to help africa and ecowas , schröder said germany would cancel the 16.4 million-euro debt ghana owed it .

the german-born photographer died in a car accident in los angeles friday .
the self-proclaimed " king of kink , " who rose to fame with controversial images of women and fashion , will be honored with a new museum in berlin . celebrated , respected and controversial are just some of the words used to describe helmut newton .
best known for his provocative portraits of nude women , the berlin-born avant-garde fashion photographer spent some six decades transforming his craft and testing the limits of social acceptability .
" he was a giant , " said playboy founder hugh hefner .
" he was a major talent that pushed the boundaries in terms of photography and influenced many in following generations . "
for newton , his camera was a lens to explore power , gender roles and sexuality .
" i ’ m interested in power - i always was , whether it ’ s sexual power , financial power or political power , " he wrote in his 2002 autobiography .
bildunterschrift : retrospective exhibit in berlin 's new national gallery .
newton ’ s brazen and controversial style was exemplified in the 1980 and 1993 series " big nudes , " which featured larger-than-life images of women who were portrayed as dominating the camera rather than as subjects .
the stark black-and-white portraits were a shocking departure from conventional nude photos in their coldly erotic sensuality .
among one of the most famous images was a nude model with her neck in a surgical collar and one leg in a cast .
" he loves to be outrageous , " said anna wintour , who published much of newton ’ s work in vogue magazine .
" he has a perverse view of women that recurs again and again , " she said recently .
childhood in germany born in october 1920 , the son of a wealthy jewish button-manufacturer , newton enjoyed a privileged upbringing in berlin .
he attended the city ’ s american school , but because the photo-bug bit him early , he spent more time with his camera than his studies .
at the age of 15 , newton ’ s father told him , " my boy , you ’ ll end up in the gutter .
all you think of is girls and photos , " he wrote in his autobiography .
after leaving school in 1936 , the young newton worked as an apprentice to top photographer elsie simon , a job he held until forced to flee nazi-germany in 1938 .
after a brief stay in singapore , newton settled in australia , became a citizen and opened a small photography studio .
he also changed his name from neustädter to newton .
throughout his career he turned again and again to the subject of nazi germany , but not in a way typical for someone who lost loved ones in the concentration camps .
in a series of portraits , newton photographed hitler ’ s official filmmaker leni riefenstahl , former u.n. secretary general kurt waldheim , who was involved in nazi atrocities , and right-wing french political leader jean-marie le pen .
his own wife , june , posed in a 1973 series as hitler with model jerry hall posing as eva bruan .
but newton never dwelled on the past for long .
" i find this kind of living in the past useless and unproductive , " he wrote in his book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newton leaves 1,000 photographs to the city of berlin newton ’ s homecoming in october 2003 , newton recognized the importance his early life in berlin had on his career and donated more than 1,000 pictures to a new gallery in berlin .
at the opening , the photographer said he was " proud " his works would be displayed in his hometown .
" not just the nudes , but all the others " will be available for everyone to see , he said .
german chancellor gerhard schröder called newton ’ s decision a " sign of reconciliation . "
" you can chase a man out of his home but you can ’ t rip his home out of his soul , " the german leader said in a letter read at the news conference .
starting in june , newton 's works will be on permanent display in berlin ’ s former art library across the street from the central train station .
at the time of the donation , newton who has no children , suggested the city would eventually receive his entire archive .

the german-born photographer died in a car accident in los angeles friday .
the self-proclaimed " king of kink , " who rose to fame with controversial images of women and fashion , will be honored with a new museum in berlin . celebrated , respected and controversial are just some of the words used to describe helmut newton .
best known for his provocative portraits of nude women , the berlin-born avant-garde fashion photographer spent some six decades transforming his craft and testing the limits of social acceptability .
" he was a giant , " said playboy founder hugh hefner .
" he was a major talent that pushed the boundaries in terms of photography and influenced many in following generations . "
for newton , his camera was a lens to explore power , gender roles and sexuality .
" i ’ m interested in power - i always was , whether it ’ s sexual power , financial power or political power , " he wrote in his 2002 autobiography .
bildunterschrift : retrospective exhibit in berlin 's new national gallery .
newton ’ s brazen and controversial style was exemplified in the 1980 and 1993 series " big nudes , " which featured larger-than-life images of women who were portrayed as dominating the camera rather than as subjects .
the stark black-and-white portraits were a shocking departure from conventional nude photos in their coldly erotic sensuality .
among one of the most famous images was a nude model with her neck in a surgical collar and one leg in a cast .
" he loves to be outrageous , " said anna wintour , who published much of newton ’ s work in vogue magazine .
" he has a perverse view of women that recurs again and again , " she said recently .
childhood in germany born in october 1920 , the son of a wealthy jewish button-manufacturer , newton enjoyed a privileged upbringing in berlin .

gunther von hagens , who preserves human bodies to exhibit them , has denied using corpses of executed chinese in his shows .
hagens ' critics meanwhile reiterated claims that the exhibitions violate german law . wearing his signature fedora , the controversial german doctor defended his business practices after german news magazine der spiegel raised questions about his work in a cover story this week .
" i have not turned corpses of the executed into exhibits , " hagens said , but added that he could n't guarantee that bodies of executed people had never been dropped off at his production facility in dalian in northeastern china .
a common chinese practice ?
accepting unidentified bodies from the police was common practice at dalian university 's institute for plastination , hagens said , adding that his company worked closely with the institute .
plastination is the technique developed by hagens to turn corpses into odorless and durable exhibits by draining out bodily fluids and fat and replacing them with plastic .
taking these so-called " ownerless bodies " is " a completely normal thing to do and was customary in germany until the 1980s , " hagens told reporters in frankfurt , where " body worlds " is currently on show .
he added that he had instructed his employees not to accept bodies of the executed any more .
der spiegel had reported that at least two bodies included in an inventory list of hagens ' dalian facility had bullet holes in their heads .
" but not every corpse with a bullet hole has been executed , " he said , implying that some might have been victims of a crime .
documents made available to the german news magazine , however , show that hagens knew for at least two years that executed bodies were used in his work .
according to der spiegel , a former employee of the dalian institute threatened to go to the chinese media with the " true story " of the fresh corpses , but was then silenced with a large sum of money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a plastinated figure plays chess in the basel exhibit of body worlds .
critics question exhibition 's legality while members of the german hospice foundation gathered outside the frankfurt exhibition to express their protest with coffins and candles , others were equally critical of hagens ' work .
uwe volkmann , a law professor in mainz in central germany , said the show violated german cemetery and burial laws , dpa news agency reported .
the german society for pathology added that hagens violates the rules of ethics in medicine .
a munich city official told reporters that germany needed to introduce a new law regulating plastination .

gunther von hagens , who preserves human bodies to exhibit them , has denied using corpses of executed chinese in his shows .
hagens ' critics meanwhile reiterated claims that the exhibitions violate german law . wearing his signature fedora , the controversial german doctor defended his business practices after german news magazine der spiegel raised questions about his work in a cover story this week .
" i have not turned corpses of the executed into exhibits , " hagens said , but added that he could n't guarantee that bodies of executed people had never been dropped off at his production facility in dalian in northeastern china .
a common chinese practice ?
accepting unidentified bodies from the police was common practice at dalian university 's institute for plastination , hagens said , adding that his company worked closely with the institute .
plastination is the technique developed by hagens to turn corpses into odorless and durable exhibits by draining out bodily fluids and fat and replacing them with plastic .
taking these so-called " ownerless bodies " is " a completely normal thing to do and was customary in germany until the 1980s , " hagens told reporters in frankfurt , where " body worlds " is currently on show .
he added that he had instructed his employees not to accept bodies of the executed any more .
der spiegel had reported that at least two bodies included in an inventory list of hagens ' dalian facility had bullet holes in their heads .
" but not every corpse with a bullet hole has been executed , " he said , implying that some might have been victims of a crime .
documents made available to the german news magazine , however , show that hagens knew for at least two years that executed bodies were used in his work .
according to der spiegel , a former employee of the dalian institute threatened to go to the chinese media with the " true story " of the fresh corpses , but was then silenced with a large sum of money .

critics question exhibition 's legality while members of the german hospice foundation gathered outside the frankfurt exhibition to express their protest with coffins and candles , others were equally critical of hagens ' work .
uwe volkmann , a law professor in mainz in central germany , said the show violated german cemetery and burial laws , dpa news agency reported .
the german society for pathology added that hagens violates the rules of ethics in medicine .
a munich city official told reporters that germany needed to introduce a new law regulating plastination .
" there are many people who want to be plastinated , " said wilfried blume-beyerle .
the courts need to decide whether this is a new form of undertaking and what the ethical boundaries are , he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german accused of using bodies of executed in exhibits a professor who preserves human bodies for display in exhibitions allegedly used remains of people executed in china .

scientists now believe it was once carved out by a mighty river or a massive glacier .
thanks to new data from the instruments aboard the mars express probe released by the european space agency on friday , they have their best evidence yet .
taken together , the images and data provide compelling evidence that there are ice sheets beneath the martian crust and that water once flowed across the red planet ’ s surface . ” you look at the picture , look at the fingerprint and say this is water ice , ” mars express project manager allen moorehouse said at mission control in darmstadt , germany .
“ this is the first time it ’ s been detected on the ground .
this is the first direct confirmation . ”
using a combined camera and infrared spectrometer , mars express ’ omega instrument began mapping the planet ’ s south polar cap on jan .
18 .
omega has indirectly detected the presence of both water ice and carbon dioxide ice , esa said .
the discovery clearly pleased scientists at esa , who suffered a setback in december with the likely destruction of its beagle 2 lander , which was intended to probe the surface of mars for organic matter and other signs of life . ” i did not expect to be able to gather together , just one month after the mars orbit insertion of dec .
25 , so many happy scientists eager to present their first results , ” said esa director of science david southwood .
european scientists hope to find large reserves of ice beneath the surface of mars that can be used to supply water and fuel for future manned space missions .
water molecules detected ” it ’ s been looked at for such a long time and it ’ s been inferred there was water at the south pole , ” said jean-pierre bibring an esa scientist from the institute of space astrophysics in orsay , france .
bibring said an infrared camera on board mars express had detected vapors of water molecules .
“ this is the first time we can really see vapors of the molecules themselves , ” he said .
evidence of water has been found by multiple instruments on mars express and the satellite has also found evidence that water is being pulled from mars into space , a theory scientists have long suspected .
in march 2002 , nasa ’ s mars odyssey orbiter indirectly detected water ice on the planet ’ s southern pole using a gamma ray spectrometer that found hydrogen which , when combined with air , creates water .
the european mission provides independent confirmation of nasa ’ s earlier finding .
but taken together with other experiments , including high-resolution maps showing what was likely the effects of erosion on the landscape caused by water , esa has provided the strongest proof yet . ” previous measurements have been indirect and this is the first time we have direct indications of molecules that are present in water , ” southwood said .
“ of course , finding anything that has to do with water on mars is sort of a holy grail .
this is certainly better than anything we ’ ve had so far . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this picture was taken by the high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- onboard esa 's mars express orbiter , in colour and 3d , in orbit 18 on 15 january 2004 from a height of 273 km .
the location is east of the hellas basin at 41 ° south and 101 ° east .
the area is 100 km across , with a resolution of 12 m per pixel , and shows a channel -lrb- reull vallis -rrb- once formed by flowing water .

neukum and his crew have already gathered more than 100 gigabytes of data from the camera .
he said he hoped the camera would be able to detect if some of the rocks on mars are actually blocks of ice .
mars express first entered into martian orbit at christmas .
it will continue delivering data from its scientific instruments for the next two years . ” europe can be proud of this mission , ” said edelgard bulmahn , germany ’ s minister for research and education .
“ mars express is an enormous success for the european space program . ”

munich-based shell solar and the berlin company geosol have announced that construction is underway on the world 's largest solar energy plant .
the move is one of many indications germany is taking solar power seriously . the pioneering five-megawatt plant in espenhain south of leipzig is expected to begin operation as early as july , supplying some 1,800 homes and replacing emissions of up to 3,700 tons of carbon dioxide per year .
speaking at the european conference for renewable energy in berlin this week , german environment minister jürgen trittin declared that germany should aim to make its solar industry the world 's no. 1 .
it 's already well on track at no. 3 , trailing the united states and japan .
while germany 's environment ministry commits around € 27 million a year to photovoltaics research , both the u.s. and japan contribute € 75 million each .
trittin stressed that science and industry were now joining forces to make germany greener , observing that " developing renewable energy sources creates jobs with a future , protects the environment and strengthens germany 's industrial clout . "
the minister went on to predict that by 2006 , the number of people working in the solar industry will have increased from 10,000 to 25,000 .
joachim luther of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems pointed out another advantage .
" by 2005 solar energy will account for some 30 percent of global electricity consumption , " he said . luther added that he believed the focus should be on developing solar energy systems in developing countries , where their use could help tackle poverty .

styri-hipp also pointed out that thanks to last november 's new legislation on photovoltaics , the technology used to obtain electricity from solar energy , germany is now one of the most attractive international markets for solar energy plants . the government is funding research aimed at developing smaller and more-efficient solar cells .
the originators of " intersolar 2004 " trade fair , which will take place in freiburg from 24 – 26 june , has also noted evidence of a positive trend .

munich-based shell solar and the berlin company geosol have announced that construction is underway on the world 's largest solar energy plant .
the move is one of many indications germany is taking solar power seriously . the pioneering five-megawatt plant in espenhain south of leipzig is expected to begin operation as early as july , supplying some 1,800 homes and replacing emissions of up to 3,700 tons of carbon dioxide per year .
speaking at the european conference for renewable energy in berlin this week , german environment minister jürgen trittin declared that germany should aim to make its solar industry the world 's no. 1 .
it 's already well on track at no. 3 , trailing the united states and japan .
while germany 's environment ministry commits around € 27 million a year to photovoltaics research , both the u.s. and japan contribute € 75 million each .
trittin stressed that science and industry were now joining forces to make germany greener , observing that " developing renewable energy sources creates jobs with a future , protects the environment and strengthens germany 's industrial clout . "
the minister went on to predict that by 2006 , the number of people working in the solar industry will have increased from 10,000 to 25,000 .

the german-born photographer died in a car accident in los angeles friday .
the self-proclaimed " king of kink , " who rose to fame with controversial images of women and fashion , will be honored with a new museum in berlin . celebrated , respected and controversial are just some of the words used to describe helmut newton .
best known for his provocative portraits of nude women , the berlin-born avant-garde fashion photographer spent some six decades transforming his craft and testing the limits of social acceptability .
" he was a giant , " said playboy founder hugh hefner .
" he was a major talent that pushed the boundaries in terms of photography and influenced many in following generations . "
for newton , his camera was a lens to explore power , gender roles and sexuality .
" i ’ m interested in power - i always was , whether it ’ s sexual power , financial power or political power , " he wrote in his 2002 autobiography .
bildunterschrift : retrospective exhibit in berlin 's new national gallery .
newton ’ s brazen and controversial style was exemplified in the 1980 and 1993 series " big nudes , " which featured larger-than-life images of women who were portrayed as dominating the camera rather than as subjects .
the stark black-and-white portraits were a shocking departure from conventional nude photos in their coldly erotic sensuality .
among one of the most famous images was a nude model with her neck in a surgical collar and one leg in a cast .
" he loves to be outrageous , " said anna wintour , who published much of newton ’ s work in vogue magazine .
" he has a perverse view of women that recurs again and again , " she said recently .
childhood in germany born in october 1920 , the son of a wealthy jewish button-manufacturer , newton enjoyed a privileged upbringing in berlin .
he attended the city ’ s american school , but because the photo-bug bit him early , he spent more time with his camera than his studies .
at the age of 15 , newton ’ s father told him , " my boy , you ’ ll end up in the gutter .
all you think of is girls and photos , " he wrote in his autobiography .
after leaving school in 1936 , the young newton worked as an apprentice to top photographer elsie simon , a job he held until forced to flee nazi-germany in 1938 .
after a brief stay in singapore , newton settled in australia , became a citizen and opened a small photography studio .
he also changed his name from neustädter to newton .
throughout his career he turned again and again to the subject of nazi germany , but not in a way typical for someone who lost loved ones in the concentration camps .
in a series of portraits , newton photographed hitler ’ s official filmmaker leni riefenstahl , former u.n. secretary general kurt waldheim , who was involved in nazi atrocities , and right-wing french political leader jean-marie le pen .
his own wife , june , posed in a 1973 series as hitler with model jerry hall posing as eva bruan .
but newton never dwelled on the past for long .
" i find this kind of living in the past useless and unproductive , " he wrote in his book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newton leaves 1,000 photographs to the city of berlin newton ’ s homecoming in october 2003 , newton recognized the importance his early life in berlin had on his career and donated more than 1,000 pictures to a new gallery in berlin .
at the opening , the photographer said he was " proud " his works would be displayed in his hometown .
" not just the nudes , but all the others " will be available for everyone to see , he said .
german chancellor gerhard schröder called newton ’ s decision a " sign of reconciliation . "
" you can chase a man out of his home but you can ’ t rip his home out of his soul , " the german leader said in a letter read at the news conference .
starting in june , newton 's works will be on permanent display in berlin ’ s former art library across the street from the central train station .
at the time of the donation , newton who has no children , suggested the city would eventually receive his entire archive .

among one of the most famous images was a nude model with her neck in a surgical collar and one leg in a cast .
" he loves to be outrageous , " said anna wintour , who published much of newton ’ s work in vogue magazine .
" he has a perverse view of women that recurs again and again , " she said recently .
childhood in germany born in october 1920 , the son of a wealthy jewish button-manufacturer , newton enjoyed a privileged upbringing in berlin .
he attended the city ’ s american school , but because the photo-bug bit him early , he spent more time with his camera than his studies .
at the age of 15 , newton ’ s father told him , " my boy , you ’ ll end up in the gutter .
all you think of is girls and photos , " he wrote in his autobiography .
after leaving school in 1936 , the young newton worked as an apprentice to top photographer elsie simon , a job he held until forced to flee nazi-germany in 1938 .
after a brief stay in singapore , newton settled in australia , became a citizen and opened a small photography studio .
he also changed his name from neustädter to newton .
throughout his career he turned again and again to the subject of nazi germany , but not in a way typical for someone who lost loved ones in the concentration camps .
in a series of portraits , newton photographed hitler ’ s official filmmaker leni riefenstahl , former u.n. secretary general kurt waldheim , who was involved in nazi atrocities , and right-wing french political leader jean-marie le pen .
his own wife , june , posed in a 1973 series as hitler with model jerry hall posing as eva bruan .
but newton never dwelled on the past for long .
" i find this kind of living in the past useless and unproductive , " he wrote in his book .

at the opening , the photographer said he was " proud " his works would be displayed in his hometown .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.01.2004 germany blazes trail for solar industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the espenhain solar plant will be the world 's biggest .
munich-based shell solar and the berlin company geosol have announced that construction is underway on the world 's largest solar energy plant .
the move is one of many indications germany is taking solar power seriously . the pioneering five-megawatt plant in espenhain south of leipzig is expected to begin operation as early as july , supplying some 1,800 homes and replacing emissions of up to 3,700 tons of carbon dioxide per year .
speaking at the european conference for renewable energy in berlin this week , german environment minister jürgen trittin declared that germany should aim to make its solar industry the world 's no. 1 .
it 's already well on track at no. 3 , trailing the united states and japan .
while germany 's environment ministry commits around € 27 million a year to photovoltaics research , both the u.s. and japan contribute € 75 million each .
trittin stressed that science and industry were now joining forces to make germany greener , observing that " developing renewable energy sources creates jobs with a future , protects the environment and strengthens germany 's industrial clout . "
the minister went on to predict that by 2006 , the number of people working in the solar industry will have increased from 10,000 to 25,000 .
joachim luther of the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems pointed out another advantage .
" by 2005 solar energy will account for some 30 percent of global electricity consumption , " he said . luther added that he believed the focus should be on developing solar energy systems in developing countries , where their use could help tackle poverty .
a growth industry gerhard styri-hipp , ceo of the german association for solar industry , recently revealed that the german solar sector predicts double-digit growth rates in 2004 , with current legislation giving businesses enough investment security to prompt even further growth .
styri-hipp also pointed out that thanks to last november 's new legislation on photovoltaics , the technology used to obtain electricity from solar energy , germany is now one of the most attractive international markets for solar energy plants . the government is funding research aimed at developing smaller and more-efficient solar cells .
the originators of " intersolar 2004 " trade fair , which will take place in freiburg from 24 – 26 june , has also noted evidence of a positive trend .
organizers are expecting 280 stalls from over 20 countries , with 85 percent of the 15,000 meter square exhibition space booked out months in advance .
germany in the dock but it 's not all good news .
the european commission has announced it will be taking germany to the european court of justice because berlin has failed to keep to its obligations on improving air quality .
the commission will also be taking legal action against another eight member states , including belgium , italy , greece , portugal , the netherlands , luxembourg , austria and spain .
the proceedings relate to the failure of these countries to meet the agreed deadline of november 2002 for adopting national measures implementing eu laws on air quality limit values for benzene and carbon monoxide and national emission ceilings for sulphur dioxide , nitrogen oxides , volatile organic compounds and ammonia and large combustion plants .

chancellor gerhard schröder concludes his six-day , four-country tour of africa with a stop in ghana on friday .
dw-tv met up with the german leader and asked him about his country ’ s growing interest in the continent . his first official visit to africa is already being hailed a success back in berlin .
after spending six days jetting across the continent with high-profile stops in ethiopia , kenya , south africa and ghana , schröder hopes to have driven home his point that africa is not only about war , famine and disease , and that germany is not only interested in the continent as a recipient of development aid , but rather that there are political and economic initiatives worthy of promoting .
speaking to dw-tv while in south africa , schröder says he is satisfied with the results of his visit , his first official one to the continent : " i think we made clear that germany wants to take an active involvement in those places where what ’ s called " good governance " is practiced . "
" these countries are making a genuine effort to stand on their own two feet , which is something we support , " he explains .
" they are trying to enforce the rule of law and principles of democracy .
and they ’ re trying to establish regional alliances that can promote trade and give us the opportunity to get involved in even bigger markets . "
the forgotten continent ?
africa has often been referred to as the " forgotten continent . "
europe , which once had an active interest in its development , has pretty much neglected the region except for the occasional peacekeeping missions to former colonies and the regular flow of humanitarian and economic aid .
but germany seems to be experiencing a growing interest in the continent .
after schröder ’ s visit , president johannes rau will go to africa .
foreign minister joschka fischer and the state secretary in the foreign office , kerstin müller , have frequently visited the region in an effort to drum up support for peace initiatives in countries like sudan and the congo .
schröder sees his country ’ s interest in africa as a continuation of germany ’ s foreign policy .
" we ’ re trying to make it clear that it ’ s worth countries ’ while to help themselves .
the reason is quite simple , " he says .
" a stable africa is in our own interest .
the fight against international terrorism will only be successful if africa manages to offer people a future , one in which they can live or at least survive . "
new dimension in africa policy the focus on security represents a shift in germany ’ s relations with africa , which was previously confined to development aid .
schröder says the joint emphasis on security and economic development is the key to future dealings with africa .
although still not as developed as north america , asia or europe , the chancellor is convinced that economic cooperation with africa could lead to a " potentially huge market . "
" we should not be talking down the potential , " he says referring to critics , who quickly dismiss investment as a waste of effort .
" it ’ s not just about raw materials , it ’ s also about people ’ s willingness to roll up their sleeves and get down to work on their own behalf . "
" i think it ’ s in our own interest to help them . "
guilt over colonial past ?
schröder denies that germany ’ s colonial history has any bearing on his country ’ s current and future interest in africa .
" there have been some very dark chapters in our history .
one must only think of the hereros in namibia .
but that ’ s a long time ago , and many of the emotional wounds have healed , " he says .
" o course , we can not allow ourselves to forget the past , but it ’ s not the driving force behind a sensible africa policy .

wrapping up his six-day tour of africa on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder inaugurated a peacekeeping training center in ghana , saying it will serve as a model for other countries . schöder ’ s message was the same at the end of his four-nation african trip as at the beginning .
africa needs to improve its efforts for solving conflicts on the continent , and it requires the help from the rest of the world to do so .
" africa needs to develop its own capacity for conflict prevention and management and also build its own capacity in the spheres of military , police and civilian peacekeeping personnel , " the chancellor said during the opening ceremony of the kofi annan international peacekeeping training center in accra .
standing with ghana president john kufuor , schröder praised the west african leader for helping to resolve some of the region ’ s worst entanglements in the last years .
as head of the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- , kufuor sent ghanaian troops to help end fighting in the ivory coast and liberia .
" that is why the g-8 last year agreed with the european union and the united nations to strengthen african continental and regional organizations in conflict management and to help make them more effective , " the german leader said .
a center for peace as its part in that goal , germany donated more than € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.52 million -rrb- towards the construction of the kofi annan center which will focus on military , police and civilian measures for securing peace .
" it is essential for these three areas to be closely linked , " schröder said .
" purely military peace missions can not eliminate insecurity and instability in the long run , " he added .
as part of his country ’ s pledge to help africa and ecowas , schröder said germany would cancel the 16.4 million-euro debt ghana owed it .
" international support is well invested here , " schröder said .
" without peace , the people of africa have no hope of sharing in the fruits of globalization .

the german-born photographer died in a car accident in los angeles friday .
the self-proclaimed " king of kink , " who rose to fame with controversial images of women and fashion , will be honored with a new museum in berlin . celebrated , respected and controversial are just some of the words used to describe helmut newton .
best known for his provocative portraits of nude women , the berlin-born avant-garde fashion photographer spent some six decades transforming his craft and testing the limits of social acceptability .
" he was a giant , " said playboy founder hugh hefner .
" he was a major talent that pushed the boundaries in terms of photography and influenced many in following generations . "
for newton , his camera was a lens to explore power , gender roles and sexuality .
" i ’ m interested in power - i always was , whether it ’ s sexual power , financial power or political power , " he wrote in his 2002 autobiography .
bildunterschrift : retrospective exhibit in berlin 's new national gallery .
newton ’ s brazen and controversial style was exemplified in the 1980 and 1993 series " big nudes , " which featured larger-than-life images of women who were portrayed as dominating the camera rather than as subjects .
the stark black-and-white portraits were a shocking departure from conventional nude photos in their coldly erotic sensuality .
among one of the most famous images was a nude model with her neck in a surgical collar and one leg in a cast .
" he loves to be outrageous , " said anna wintour , who published much of newton ’ s work in vogue magazine .
" he has a perverse view of women that recurs again and again , " she said recently .
childhood in germany born in october 1920 , the son of a wealthy jewish button-manufacturer , newton enjoyed a privileged upbringing in berlin .
he attended the city ’ s american school , but because the photo-bug bit him early , he spent more time with his camera than his studies .
at the age of 15 , newton ’ s father told him , " my boy , you ’ ll end up in the gutter .
all you think of is girls and photos , " he wrote in his autobiography .
after leaving school in 1936 , the young newton worked as an apprentice to top photographer elsie simon , a job he held until forced to flee nazi-germany in 1938 .
after a brief stay in singapore , newton settled in australia , became a citizen and opened a small photography studio .
he also changed his name from neustädter to newton .
throughout his career he turned again and again to the subject of nazi germany , but not in a way typical for someone who lost loved ones in the concentration camps .
in a series of portraits , newton photographed hitler ’ s official filmmaker leni riefenstahl , former u.n. secretary general kurt waldheim , who was involved in nazi atrocities , and right-wing french political leader jean-marie le pen .
his own wife , june , posed in a 1973 series as hitler with model jerry hall posing as eva bruan .
but newton never dwelled on the past for long .
" i find this kind of living in the past useless and unproductive , " he wrote in his book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newton leaves 1,000 photographs to the city of berlin newton ’ s homecoming in october 2003 , newton recognized the importance his early life in berlin had on his career and donated more than 1,000 pictures to a new gallery in berlin .
at the opening , the photographer said he was " proud " his works would be displayed in his hometown .
" not just the nudes , but all the others " will be available for everyone to see , he said .
german chancellor gerhard schröder called newton ’ s decision a " sign of reconciliation . "
" you can chase a man out of his home but you can ’ t rip his home out of his soul , " the german leader said in a letter read at the news conference .
starting in june , newton 's works will be on permanent display in berlin ’ s former art library across the street from the central train station .
at the time of the donation , newton who has no children , suggested the city would eventually receive his entire archive .

the german-born photographer died in a car accident in los angeles friday .
the self-proclaimed " king of kink , " who rose to fame with controversial images of women and fashion , will be honored with a new museum in berlin . celebrated , respected and controversial are just some of the words used to describe helmut newton .
best known for his provocative portraits of nude women , the berlin-born avant-garde fashion photographer spent some six decades transforming his craft and testing the limits of social acceptability .
" he was a giant , " said playboy founder hugh hefner .
" he was a major talent that pushed the boundaries in terms of photography and influenced many in following generations . "
for newton , his camera was a lens to explore power , gender roles and sexuality .
" i ’ m interested in power - i always was , whether it ’ s sexual power , financial power or political power , " he wrote in his 2002 autobiography .
bildunterschrift : retrospective exhibit in berlin 's new national gallery .
newton ’ s brazen and controversial style was exemplified in the 1980 and 1993 series " big nudes , " which featured larger-than-life images of women who were portrayed as dominating the camera rather than as subjects .
the stark black-and-white portraits were a shocking departure from conventional nude photos in their coldly erotic sensuality .
among one of the most famous images was a nude model with her neck in a surgical collar and one leg in a cast .
" he loves to be outrageous , " said anna wintour , who published much of newton ’ s work in vogue magazine .
" he has a perverse view of women that recurs again and again , " she said recently .
childhood in germany born in october 1920 , the son of a wealthy jewish button-manufacturer , newton enjoyed a privileged upbringing in berlin .
he attended the city ’ s american school , but because the photo-bug bit him early , he spent more time with his camera than his studies .
at the age of 15 , newton ’ s father told him , " my boy , you ’ ll end up in the gutter .
all you think of is girls and photos , " he wrote in his autobiography .
after leaving school in 1936 , the young newton worked as an apprentice to top photographer elsie simon , a job he held until forced to flee nazi-germany in 1938 .
after a brief stay in singapore , newton settled in australia , became a citizen and opened a small photography studio .
he also changed his name from neustädter to newton .
throughout his career he turned again and again to the subject of nazi germany , but not in a way typical for someone who lost loved ones in the concentration camps .
in a series of portraits , newton photographed hitler ’ s official filmmaker leni riefenstahl , former u.n. secretary general kurt waldheim , who was involved in nazi atrocities , and right-wing french political leader jean-marie le pen .
his own wife , june , posed in a 1973 series as hitler with model jerry hall posing as eva bruan .
but newton never dwelled on the past for long .
" i find this kind of living in the past useless and unproductive , " he wrote in his book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newton leaves 1,000 photographs to the city of berlin newton ’ s homecoming in october 2003 , newton recognized the importance his early life in berlin had on his career and donated more than 1,000 pictures to a new gallery in berlin .
at the opening , the photographer said he was " proud " his works would be displayed in his hometown .
" not just the nudes , but all the others " will be available for everyone to see , he said .
german chancellor gerhard schröder called newton ’ s decision a " sign of reconciliation . "
" you can chase a man out of his home but you can ’ t rip his home out of his soul , " the german leader said in a letter read at the news conference .
starting in june , newton 's works will be on permanent display in berlin ’ s former art library across the street from the central train station .
at the time of the donation , newton who has no children , suggested the city would eventually receive his entire archive .

chancellor gerhard schröder concludes his six-day , four-country tour of africa with a stop in ghana on friday .
dw-tv met up with the german leader and asked him about his country ’ s growing interest in the continent . his first official visit to africa is already being hailed a success back in berlin .
after spending six days jetting across the continent with high-profile stops in ethiopia , kenya , south africa and ghana , schröder hopes to have driven home his point that africa is not only about war , famine and disease , and that germany is not only interested in the continent as a recipient of development aid , but rather that there are political and economic initiatives worthy of promoting .
speaking to dw-tv while in south africa , schröder says he is satisfied with the results of his visit , his first official one to the continent : " i think we made clear that germany wants to take an active involvement in those places where what ’ s called " good governance " is practiced . "
" these countries are making a genuine effort to stand on their own two feet , which is something we support , " he explains .
" they are trying to enforce the rule of law and principles of democracy .
and they ’ re trying to establish regional alliances that can promote trade and give us the opportunity to get involved in even bigger markets . "
the forgotten continent ?
africa has often been referred to as the " forgotten continent . "
europe , which once had an active interest in its development , has pretty much neglected the region except for the occasional peacekeeping missions to former colonies and the regular flow of humanitarian and economic aid .
but germany seems to be experiencing a growing interest in the continent .
after schröder ’ s visit , president johannes rau will go to africa .
foreign minister joschka fischer and the state secretary in the foreign office , kerstin müller , have frequently visited the region in an effort to drum up support for peace initiatives in countries like sudan and the congo .
schröder sees his country ’ s interest in africa as a continuation of germany ’ s foreign policy .
" we ’ re trying to make it clear that it ’ s worth countries ’ while to help themselves .
the reason is quite simple , " he says .
" a stable africa is in our own interest .
the fight against international terrorism will only be successful if africa manages to offer people a future , one in which they can live or at least survive . "
new dimension in africa policy the focus on security represents a shift in germany ’ s relations with africa , which was previously confined to development aid .
schröder says the joint emphasis on security and economic development is the key to future dealings with africa .
although still not as developed as north america , asia or europe , the chancellor is convinced that economic cooperation with africa could lead to a " potentially huge market . "
" we should not be talking down the potential , " he says referring to critics , who quickly dismiss investment as a waste of effort .
" it ’ s not just about raw materials , it ’ s also about people ’ s willingness to roll up their sleeves and get down to work on their own behalf . "
" i think it ’ s in our own interest to help them . "
guilt over colonial past ?
schröder denies that germany ’ s colonial history has any bearing on his country ’ s current and future interest in africa .
" there have been some very dark chapters in our history .
one must only think of the hereros in namibia .
but that ’ s a long time ago , and many of the emotional wounds have healed , " he says .
" o course , we can not allow ourselves to forget the past , but it ’ s not the driving force behind a sensible africa policy .
it 's more about the here and now .

such an opportunity wo n't come up again anytime soon . germany is preparing to host the 2006 soccer world championship , and despite the fact that its coffers are empty , it will conjure up more than € 6 billion -lrb- $ 8 billion -rrb- to beef up its infrastructure in time for the tournament . economics minister wolfgang clement announced that the government would invest € 2 billion in building stadiums , € 3.9 billion in roadworks and € 500 million in traffic management systems in time for sports fans to descend on this soccer-crazed nation .
clement announced his intentions at an investors conference in leipzig aimed at making the financial most of the sporting event . image polishing " this world championship is for the time being a singular chance to show the world our economy 's power of innovation and to polish clean the ' made in germany ' brand , " clement told the politicians , businesspeople and sportsmen and women rallying in leipzig . indeed , germany wo n't have a similar opportunity anytime soon .
since fifa , the world soccer organization , chooses the sites for the tournament according to a system of rotation , europe wo n't get the games again until 2030 , at the earliest . by the time the tournament starts , on june 9 , 2006 , in munich 's olympic stadium , autobahn stretches , such as the route to prague and train lines , such as the segment between hamburg and berlin , should have been re-hauled .
stadiums should be linked with modern traffic-routing systems .
clement reckoned that investments related to the world cup would total from € 8-10 billion by 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement , left , michael rogowski , and franz beckenbauer at the wm investment conference in leipzig jan .

he suggested that 2006 could result in a breakthrough for high resolution television . backing up clement , franz beckenbauer , head of the organizing committee and former soccer champ , said up to 30 billion people would watch the competition on tv .
germany should make a good showing with so many people looking , he said .
aside from the tv viewers , 3.2 million guests - two-thirds from abroad - were expected to make their way to the world cup . big players , like adidas , one of the official sponsors of the world championship , have already staked out their shares .
adidas ceo herbert heiner has predicted the next few years will be good ones for the sporting goods manufacturer , thanks to the world cup . while federation of german industries head michael rogowski echoed the positive sentiments in leipzig , he cautioned not to be swept away by soccer passion .
germany must continue pursuing reform to get the german economic ball rolling , he urged . and , with contracts worth half a billion euros as yet to be awarded for the world cup , fifa could open the gates for other , smaller german firms to supply the tournament in addition to the select group of official partners clamouring on the pitch . dw staff -lrb- ni -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany aims to make 2006 world cup “ green ” germany 's world cup organizing committee has launched a " green goal " campaign that promises to make the 2006 soccer championships the most environmentally friendly sporting event ever .

no laughing matter black comedian curtis walker , who is supporting the campaign , said : " when i heard the facts i knew this was a very serious issue for the black community .

it is thought that the one-centimetre millipede which was prised out of a siltstone bed is 428 million years old .
experts at the national museums of scotland and yale university , us , have studied the fossil for months .
they say the specimen is the earliest evidence of a creature living on dry land , rather than in the sea .
the discovery on the foreshore of cowie harbour was made by an amateur fossil hunter , mike newman .
to recognise his role in the significant find , the new species - pneumodesmus newmani - has been named after him . "
scotland has the best palaeozoic , pre-triassic , pre-dinosaur sites in the world " mike newman fossil hunter the aberdeen bus driver , who lives in kemnay , told the sunday herald newspaper : " i knew that the site had been re-aged , that it was older than originally thought , so i went down there .
" i knew that any terrestrial-type things with legs found there could be early and important .
" i had found millipedes there before , but this one had evidence of the holes that showed it actually breathed .
" i 'm interested in particular in fossil fish ; i describe the fish in scientific journals , but things like this creature i pass on . "
he added : " scotland has the best palaeozoic - pre-triassic , pre-dinosaur - sites in the world .
" there are more sites in the small country of scotland than the whole of the us and russia put together .
" it 's a fantastic place for these very old invertebrates .
just think , the first air-breathing creature crawled out of the swamp at stonehaven . "
the fossil is believed to be some 20 million years older than what had previously been thought of as the oldest breathing animal - a peculiar spider-like creature in aberdeenshire .
the millipede had spiracles , or primitive breathing structures on the outside of its body , making it the oldest air-breathing creature to have been discovered .
the site near stonehaven is well known in fossil collecting circles for its arthropods - animals with segmented bodies and jointed limbs - such as sea scorpions .

scientists have decided that a fossil found near stonehaven is the remains of the oldest creature known to have lived on land .
it is thought that the one-centimetre millipede which was prised out of a siltstone bed is 428 million years old .
experts at the national museums of scotland and yale university , us , have studied the fossil for months .
they say the specimen is the earliest evidence of a creature living on dry land , rather than in the sea .
the discovery on the foreshore of cowie harbour was made by an amateur fossil hunter , mike newman .
to recognise his role in the significant find , the new species - pneumodesmus newmani - has been named after him .
scotland has the best palaeozoic , pre-triassic , pre-dinosaur sites in the world mike newman fossil hunter the aberdeen bus driver , who lives in kemnay , told the sunday herald newspaper : " i knew that the site had been re-aged , that it was older than originally thought , so i went down there .
" i knew that any terrestrial-type things with legs found there could be early and important .
" i had found millipedes there before , but this one had evidence of the holes that showed it actually breathed .
" i 'm interested in particular in fossil fish ; i describe the fish in scientific journals , but things like this creature i pass on . "
he added : " scotland has the best palaeozoic - pre-triassic , pre-dinosaur - sites in the world .
the fossil is thought to be 428 million years old " there are more sites in the small country of scotland than the whole of the us and russia put together .
" it 's a fantastic place for these very old invertebrates .
just think , the first air-breathing creature crawled out of the swamp at stonehaven . "
the fossil is believed to be some 20 million years older than what had previously been thought of as the oldest breathing animal - a peculiar spider-like creature in aberdeenshire .
the millipede had spiracles , or primitive breathing structures on the outside of its body , making it the oldest air-breathing creature to have been discovered .

georgia 's new president - who led protests that swept eduard shevardnadze from office - has vowed to turn his poverty-stricken country into a prosperous western-leaning state .
mikheil saakashvili , 36 , has built himself the reputation of a crusader against corruption and an enemy of poverty .
opinion polls suggest he has been the country 's most popular politician for the last two years , and he appeared to have achieved a landslide victory in the 4 january election .
but critics describe him as a demagogue and a populist with a strong lust for power .
mr saakashvili is proud of his own achievements , which he believes qualify him to deal with his country 's problems .
" we need to deal with that mess as soon as possible , " he told french news agency afp .
" i am ready to deal with that mess . "
groomed for power he studied in ukraine and france , before attending columbia university law school in the united states .
he was later hired by a new york-based law firm .
this explains why - in addition to his native georgian - the new president speaks fluent english , french , ukrainian and russian .
mr saakashvili - whose supporters affectionately call him misha - has a young son and a dutch wife , sandra .
saakashvili has ridden a wave of popular discontent he always intended to return to georgia , and in october 2000 was appointed justice minister by the then president eduard shevardnadze .
mr shevardnadze began grooming the young lawyer for power , but mr saakashvili found it hard to stomach what he saw as corruption and cronyism in georgia 's leadership .
he caused uproar at a cabinet meeting by producing documents which he said showed fellow ministers had acquired expensive villas from the proceeds of crooked deals .
by 2002 he had resigned , saying he considered it immoral to remain a member of the government .
he formed an opposition party , the national movement , and was elected head of the city council of the capital tbilisi - home to one-third of georgia 's residents .
from this power base , he attempted to establish himself as a man of action , impressing many by fixing leaky roofs and broken lifts .
affection he harnessed popular discontent and saw in november 's parliamentary elections an opportunity to make his mark nationally .
when the elections became tainted by allegations of fraud , he organised daily protests against the government , building up a head of steam which led eventually to the storming of parliament and mr shevardnadze 's resignation .
but while mr saakashvili has vigorously pursued his goal of radical change and a " velvet revolution " , he appears to retain an affection for his former mentor .
speaking of a recent meeting with mr shevardnadze , he said : " i told him , with great pain ...
look mr president , you had a great chance to become the founding father of a new georgian nation , and you missed it . "
and when the end finally came , he described mr shevardnadze 's resignation as a " courageous act " .
" history will judge him kindly , " he said as the jubilant crowds celebrated .
