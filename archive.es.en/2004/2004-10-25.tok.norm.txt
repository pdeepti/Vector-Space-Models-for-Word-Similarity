according to the paper , president george w. bush 's flaw is his stubborn reluctance to admit mistakes and to adjust personnel and policy .
blind faith in military power as a tool for change has too often influenced his decision-making .
the paper conceded that kerry often fails to inspire , owing his rise more to opposition to bush than loyalty to his own cause .
but on balance , he is the better choice , the daily argued . " bush or kerry ? " wondered the french daily le journal de la haute-marne .
the paper said the ideological differences between the two candidates touch on an issue that affects the whole world , namely the role of the us on the global stage in an age where not the soviet union but international terrorism is the key challenge .
the paper said if the rest of the world could vote , kerry would win , but it 's the american public that is going to the polls .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because it 's our world and our future that are at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
while in the us the race between kerry and bush is almost a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation .
vienna 's kurier commented : " this time election observers will be present to make sure the voting punch cards have been properly perforated , that the reading equipment is working and that the newest electronic voting machines have not been tampered with . "
the election observers will be there to prevent the normal kinds of voting manipulation seen in developing democracies , the paper wrote , and then affirmed that yes , it was writing about the self-proclaimed home of democracy , the united states . " nevertheless the osce is sending 100 observers for the presidential elections to the immense displeasure of american bureacrats , " the paper wrote .
commenting on the weekend 's elections in the un administered province of kosovo , the abc paper from madrid said the poll showed that the multi-ethnic society in kosovo remains an illusion .
it warned that if neither the ethnic-albanians nor the serbian minority are prepared to make concessions the only solution for the province is to divide it up .
and the paper warned leaders from both sides that negotiations are better than losing everything with an outbreak of new violence .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung wrote that despite the fact that the elecitons were peaceful , kosovo has not come closer to an independent future .
there 's still too much division over who will rule the province , it said , and under these conditions it seems unrealsitic that discussions about kosovo 's independence can begin in earnest in nine months time .
belgrade 's daily paper danas wrote that serbian boycott of the elections in kosovo will presumably hurt the serbs themselves and create resentment among the international community .

according to the paper , president george w. bush 's flaw is his stubborn reluctance to admit mistakes and to adjust personnel and policy .
blind faith in military power as a tool for change has too often influenced his decision-making .
the paper conceded that kerry often fails to inspire , owing his rise more to opposition to bush than loyalty to his own cause .
but on balance , he is the better choice , the daily argued . " bush or kerry ? " wondered the french daily le journal de la haute-marne .
the paper said the ideological differences between the two candidates touch on an issue that affects the whole world , namely the role of the us on the global stage in an age where not the soviet union but international terrorism is the key challenge .
the paper said if the rest of the world could vote , kerry would win , but it 's the american public that is going to the polls .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because it 's our world and our future that are at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
while in the us the race between kerry and bush is almost a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation .
vienna 's kurier commented : " this time election observers will be present to make sure the voting punch cards have been properly perforated , that the reading equipment is working and that the newest electronic voting machines have not been tampered with . "
the election observers will be there to prevent the normal kinds of voting manipulation seen in developing democracies , the paper wrote , and then affirmed that yes , it was writing about the self-proclaimed home of democracy , the united states . " nevertheless the osce is sending 100 observers for the presidential elections to the immense displeasure of american bureacrats , " the paper wrote .
commenting on the weekend 's elections in the un administered province of kosovo , the abc paper from madrid said the poll showed that the multi-ethnic society in kosovo remains an illusion .
it warned that if neither the ethnic-albanians nor the serbian minority are prepared to make concessions the only solution for the province is to divide it up .
and the paper warned leaders from both sides that negotiations are better than losing everything with an outbreak of new violence .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung wrote that despite the fact that the elecitons were peaceful , kosovo has not come closer to an independent future .
there 's still too much division over who will rule the province , it said , and under these conditions it seems unrealsitic that discussions about kosovo 's independence can begin in earnest in nine months time .
belgrade 's daily paper danas wrote that serbian boycott of the elections in kosovo will presumably hurt the serbs themselves and create resentment among the international community .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.10.2004 iran to consider eu nuclear demands großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hassan rowhani in a major strategy shift in the standoff over its nuclear program , iran said on monday it was ready to consider a european request to maintain a suspension on enriching uranium . the surprise comments by iran 's top nuclear negotiator marked a notable softening of tehran 's line towards a deal proposed last week by european countries , coming only a day after officials described the offer as " unbalanced . " " the european proposal for an unlimited suspension of uranium enrichment can be implemented , provided it does not contradict the islamic republic 's criteria , " iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani said on state television . three european states offered iran a deal on thursday under which tehran would receive valuable nuclear technology if it indefinitely suspended all uranium enrichment activities , a key stage in the nuclear fuel cycle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main part of the iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant the three countries - britain , france and germany - hope that if iran agrees to the deal it will be possible to stave off us demands for the nuclear issue to be sent before the un security council . the un 's nuclear watchdog - the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- - has given iran a nov .
25 deadline to allay concerns about its nuclear activities . suspension , not permanent halt ? rowhani made clear that in tehran 's eyes suspending uranium enrichment indefinitely was not the same as imposing a permanent halt on the practice . the term " unlimited does not mean permanent .
the europeans are talking about an unlimited -lrb- suspension -rrb- during the negotiations as it is forseen that long-term negotiations are starting with the europeans , " he said . " they say for example that if the negotiations last seven months , iran must respect the suspension .
we have always said that if the islamic republic accepts the suspension at whatever level , this will be a voluntary decision . " depending on the level of purification , enriched uranium can be used either as fuel for a civilian reactor or as the explosive core of a nuclear bomb .
iran strongly rejects us accusations it is seeking to manufacture atomic weapons . eu must recognize iranian sovereignty rowhani said tehran would continue cooperating with the international community but insisted that european nations must also recognise its right to civilian nuclear technology , according to the official irna news agency . " the europeans must accept that our red lines and national rights can not be violated , " he said . but his remarks appeared to strike a remarkably conciliatory tone and are likely to be welcomed by the three european heavyweights ahead of a meeting this week to hear the islamic republic 's response to the offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the bushehr nuclear power plant " iran 's patience to establish confidence with the world is great , " rowhani said . " it will not be exhausted at this early stage .
we will calmly continue to work at winning confidence .
we are going to carry out any necessary action to create confidence as we want to work with the world in the areas of politics , economy , society and culture and we do not want to worry the world unnecessarily .

" following the american president 's decision , i am going to propose to the -lrb- european union 's -rrb- council of ministers to put an end to sanctions , " outgoing trade commissioner pascal lamy told a press conference in brussels on monday . on friday , us president bush signed legislation repealing the " foreign sales corporation -lrb- fsc -rrb- " and " extraterritorial income " provisions of the us tax code - a $ 5billion -lrb- € 4 billion -rrb- a year tax break for exporters . in january 2003 , the world trade organization ruled the old law flouted global trade rules by allowing us firms , operating through subsidiaries in offshore tax havens , to benefit from reduced export taxes . lamy credited with good ties to us " i am very pleased that -lrb- the united states -rrb- respected the wto decision before the end of this commission 's term , " lamy said six days before he is to leave his post after serving for five years . the new us law is aimed at painlessly resolving a six-year dispute over tax breaks for us companies with foreign operations such as microsoft , ibm , boeing and caterpillar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union trade commissioner pascal lamy , right , with us trade representative robert b. zoellick " this signature is good news .
it 's good news for the rule of law , and it 's good news for the world trade organization , " lamy said , while thanking us counterpart robert zoellick . lamy , who took up the post as eu trade commissioner in 1999 is credited with having cultivated good relations with his us counterpart .
though the goodwill has n't prevented zoellick and lamy from being at loggerheads in recent years over tax breaks for exporters , airplanes , genetically-modified meat , bananas , steel and a host of other things , it has ensured that the trade rows have n't spiraled out of control . washington 's willingness to lend a ear to eu complaints is also attributed to to lamy 's efforts to ensure that the eu consistently speaks with one voice when it came to transatlantic trade .
lamy is also seen as an untiring proponent of globalization , always stressing that the eu should open up its markets , particularly towards developing countries . concern over " grandfathering " clause the eu commission nonetheless voiced concern over a so-called " grandfathering " clause in the us reforms that maintain fsc provisions until the end of 2006 and " in certain cases for an unlimited period after that date . " as a result , the eu 's executive arm will ask for a new wto ruling on washington 's revised position . " we said we were willing to accept a transition period as long as everything ended at the end of that period , " lamy said .
" but we have some doubts .

though the goodwill has n't prevented zoellick and lamy from being at loggerheads in recent years over tax breaks for exporters , airplanes , genetically-modified meat , bananas , steel and a host of other things , it has ensured that the trade rows have n't spiraled out of control . washington 's willingness to lend a ear to eu complaints is also attributed to to lamy 's efforts to ensure that the eu consistently speaks with one voice when it came to transatlantic trade .
lamy is also seen as an untiring proponent of globalization , always stressing that the eu should open up its markets , particularly towards developing countries . concern over " grandfathering " clause the eu commission nonetheless voiced concern over a so-called " grandfathering " clause in the us reforms that maintain fsc provisions until the end of 2006 and " in certain cases for an unlimited period after that date . " as a result , the eu 's executive arm will ask for a new wto ruling on washington 's revised position . " we said we were willing to accept a transition period as long as everything ended at the end of that period , " lamy said .
" but we have some doubts . " the law that bush signed friday extends massive new assistance for us companies valued at nearly $ 140 billion over the next decade . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus strikes back at boeing the us has filed a complaint with the wto over eu subsidies paid to airbus , a rival of us plane manufacturer boeing .

ethicists warn of dangerous terrain . in a future where a person 's chance at getting sick can be read from their genes , german politicians are discussing how much of that information a potential employer has a right to know .
advocates say the bill , which is still in discussion , clearly regulates how far employers are allowed to go in determining how genetically fit someone is for a job .
in jobs such as construction or public transportation , the law would allow for genetic testing for symptoms of color blindness among other things , according to a report in the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" it sets the conditions for the type of tests that can be conducted , " heinz putzhammer , a representative of the federation of german trade unions who worked on an early draft of the bill , told dw-world .
" i think we 're on the right track because the limiting of genetic tests is in any case necessary in order to protect the person or the private sphere . "
discrimination just a few steps away but some fear that track could nevertheless lead to genetic discrimination .
testing for symptoms of a disease is just a few short steps away from tests that would help employers determine whether to hire someone based on their chance of developing a genetic disease , says sue mayer , director of the uk organization genewatch .
" i think you have to put it together , " mayer told dw-world .
" i ca n't understand why you would want to do a genetic test for something symptomatic .
it would raise the question ' is this leading the way to something ? " '
in addition , scientists say the tests currently on the market to determine common genetic diseases , such as diabetes or hypertension , are bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dna lab : how accurate are genetic tests ? unreliable and probably never will be completely accurate .
the chance of developing a sickness , such as heart disease , has a little to do with the genes a person has inherited and a lot to do with outside factors , such as whether the person smokes or is overweight .
tests nowhere near ready " the main point with genetic tests is their interpretation .
for most of the genetic tests it 's hard to interpret results , " christian kubisch , a geneticist at the university of bonn , told dw-world .
" it 's nearly ridiculous for a company to say we will test you for these diseases ... these kinds of tests are not good at the moment and probably never will be . "
many countries have taken the step of outlawing access to genetic tests for employers and insurers outright .
beginning with france and norway in 1994 , australia , denmark , the netherlands and austria have passed laws that either severely limit or outright forbid the use of a person 's genetic information for anything other than medical or scientific purposes .
german opposition politicians said they want a similar law .
parliamentarian hubert hüppe , the deputy chair of the ethics and law in modern medicine commission in the german bundestag , said that the results of genetic tests , no matter what type , belong in no one 's hands but the person tested .
parliamentarian favors ban " i 'm in favor of a strict ban , " hüppe , a member of the conservative christian democratic union party , said in a dw-world interview .
" i 'm against any other party being able to use that information . "
the european union weighed in on the discussion in the summer of 2003 .

ethicists warn of dangerous terrain . in a future where a person 's chance at getting sick can be read from their genes , german politicians are discussing how much of that information a potential employer has a right to know .
advocates say the bill , which is still in discussion , clearly regulates how far employers are allowed to go in determining how genetically fit someone is for a job .
in jobs such as construction or public transportation , the law would allow for genetic testing for symptoms of color blindness among other things , according to a report in the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" it sets the conditions for the type of tests that can be conducted , " heinz putzhammer , a representative of the federation of german trade unions who worked on an early draft of the bill , told dw-world .
" i think we 're on the right track because the limiting of genetic tests is in any case necessary in order to protect the person or the private sphere . "
discrimination just a few steps away but some fear that track could nevertheless lead to genetic discrimination .
testing for symptoms of a disease is just a few short steps away from tests that would help employers determine whether to hire someone based on their chance of developing a genetic disease , says sue mayer , director of the uk organization genewatch .
" i think you have to put it together , " mayer told dw-world .
" i ca n't understand why you would want to do a genetic test for something symptomatic .
it would raise the question ' is this leading the way to something ? " '
in addition , scientists say the tests currently on the market to determine common genetic diseases , such as diabetes or hypertension , are bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dna lab : how accurate are genetic tests ? unreliable and probably never will be completely accurate .
the chance of developing a sickness , such as heart disease , has a little to do with the genes a person has inherited and a lot to do with outside factors , such as whether the person smokes or is overweight .
tests nowhere near ready " the main point with genetic tests is their interpretation .
for most of the genetic tests it 's hard to interpret results , " christian kubisch , a geneticist at the university of bonn , told dw-world .
" it 's nearly ridiculous for a company to say we will test you for these diseases ... these kinds of tests are not good at the moment and probably never will be . "
many countries have taken the step of outlawing access to genetic tests for employers and insurers outright .
beginning with france and norway in 1994 , australia , denmark , the netherlands and austria have passed laws that either severely limit or outright forbid the use of a person 's genetic information for anything other than medical or scientific purposes .
german opposition politicians said they want a similar law .
parliamentarian hubert hüppe , the deputy chair of the ethics and law in modern medicine commission in the german bundestag , said that the results of genetic tests , no matter what type , belong in no one 's hands but the person tested .
parliamentarian favors ban " i 'm in favor of a strict ban , " hüppe , a member of the conservative christian democratic union party , said in a dw-world interview .
" i 'm against any other party being able to use that information . "
the european union weighed in on the discussion in the summer of 2003 .
in a 17-page opinion , the policy-initiating european commission said a medical examination should only be conducted after an employer has decided on a job candidate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.10.2004 is the end nigh for opel ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailing german car maker opel might cut a third of its workforce as restructuring talks continue , opel 's works council and us parent company general motors are considering a possible merger of gm 's european subsidiaries . since 5:45 am local time monday , it 's once again business as usual at the opel plant in rüsselsheim .
but on the executive floor , plans are afoot to radically restructure the company .
the head of the general works council at opel , klaus franz , told the weekly welt am sonntag that the council was in direct talks with management in detroit and zürich focused on developing an entirely new company structure .
the ultimate objective is to establish a " european corporation , " or " société européene , " based in brussels , out of gm 's 100 european subsidiaries .
cheaper , simpler ?
franz stressed that he hoped this would be beneficial to both management and employees .
" the company 's new legal form would make gm 's complicated existing structures obsolete , " he told the newspaper .
" and the company would save money . "
he also pointed out that restructuring the company as a corporation would simplify business by making individual negotiations with the boards of gm 's subsidiaries , such as opel and saab , unnecessary .
" we could talk to our european management directly about decisions and problems , " he pointed out .
moving from zürich to brussels according to welt am sonntag , the proposal is fast taking shape .
the head of gm europe , fritz henderson , would take the reins of the new corporation , with gm europe 's president carl-peter forster acting as deputy .
the headquarters of a european corporation legally require a location in a eu member state .
for now , brussels is being tipped as the most likely site , replacing the current headquarters of gm 's 100 european subsidiaries in zürich .
opel would remain a brand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel logo if the plan goes ahead , opel would be subsumed into general motors europe and its existing legal form would be dissolved .
" the opel logo will remain on the cars and factories , " observed one high-ranking gm manager , who stressed this was crucial to retaining opel as a german brand .
employee status it still remains to be seen what status employees would have in the new corporation .
their participation in the board of control is based on the ratio of employee numbers in the individual companies joining together in the european holding .
over half of gm 's 63,000 employees in europe are contracted to opel , which means the opel works council can expect considerable influence within the new corporation .
the restructuring talks come weeks after gm unveiled plans to slash 12,000 jobs in europe - including 10 , 000 in germany alone - as part of a € 500 million -lrb- $ 625 million -rrb- cost-cutting drive . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de restructuring talks underway at opel and volkswagen crucial restructuring talks at german carmakers volkswagen and opel resumed thursday as management and unions of both companies attempted to hammer out the details of painful but necessary cost-cutting measures .

vfl wolfsburg returned to the summit with a 3-0 triumph over a befuddled vfl bochum . goals from georgian international alexander iaschvili -lrb- 35 -rrb- and mali star soumaila coulibaly -lrb- 90 -rrb- helped freiburg become the first team to defeat matthias sammer 's side in the 2004/05 campaign . martin stranzl was dismissed for stuttgart in the 69th minute to cap a miserable afternoon for the visitors who must get themselves fired up for werder bremen on wednesday . elsewhere on saturday , wolfsburg started out with a furious yet sloppy attack that bochum 's defense could never really manage to answer .
after firing erratically at first , wolfsburg eventually got on target in the 27th minute after pablo thiam headed in a free kick . wolfsburg striker thomas brdaric came alive under the watchful eye of german national coach jürgen klinsmann , who came to see what the national payer could do at the club level .
although brdaric did n't score any of his team 's three goals , he proved instrumental in setting up chances and pushing his side forward . bildunterschrift : the two other wolfsburg goals came in rapid succession in the 39th and 42nd minutes by diego klimowicz and andres d 'alessandro respectively .
in the second half things slowed down considerably , but bochum never put together an effective attack and the team 's defense remained wobbly to the end .
the referee had some questionable calls during the match and he disallowed a goal for either side . bayern pulls it out an injury-ravaged bayern munich needed a brace of late goals to down hansa rostock 2-0 on saturday in a heated match that saw both sides reduced to ten men .
with 82 minutes played bayern were locked 0-0 with relegation candidates rostock but french international willy sagnol , who wanted to leave the club in the last season , broke the resistance with a header and substitute mehmet scholl added a second three minutes later . the victory comes on the back of two straight defeats for bayern who move up to third with the three points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after failing to score in their previous two matches against schalke 04 and juventus , bayern hoped for a comfortable win against hansa but their lack of firepower was underlined once again .
deprived of injured trio michael ballack , ze roberto and lucio the bavarian titans lacked the killer instinct in front of goal with torsten frings and roy makaay both spurning good opportunities . bayern should have had a penalty in the 20th minute when david rasmussen brought down frings in the penalty area but their claims were turned down .
rasmussen must have thought the gods were smiling down on him but that hope vanished when referee lutz wagner dismissed him in the 37th minute for a fierce tackle . bayern could not breach the ten-men of rostock and in fact hansa drew strength from playing with one man fewer testing bayern custodian oliver kahn several times .
munich 's ghana defender sammy kuffour was then dismissed in the 75th minute for an ugly foul to even the numbers up and bizarrely it appeared to help bayern who scored seven minutes later through sagnol . the french defender latched onto a scholl cross to head home before the veteran midfielder capped a fine substitute appearance with a goal himself . hamburg beats dortmund at the bottom end of the bundesliga ladder thomas doll enjoyed his first game in charge of sv hamburg with his team recording a 2-0 triumph over borussia dortmund at the westfalen stadium .
hamburg move off bottom spot and out of the relegation zone leapfrogging 2002 champions dortmund who are now fifth from bottom . # b # dortmund 's westfalen stadium was a fortress last season but the gate looks to have been left open for this campaign with hamburg taking the spoils with a victory .

" after the success that the french and germans have had in building planes together , why should n't we succeed in building boats together , " sarkozy told the newspaper . asked whether he would be ready to see a new shipbuilder headquartered in germany , sarkozy pointed out that the european central bank is based in frankfurt , germany . " have i ever said that 's unacceptable , " he asked . germans : time is not right but german government officials said on monday that the requirements to set up a binational shipbuilding giant will not be met for a long time . the french finance minister had recently called for tighter economic coordination with germany . " we do n't have the choice , " he said , adding that france and germany should synchronize their national budgets and share economic data and forecasts .
" the price of oil is the same in germany as it is in france . " sarkozy , who steps down as finance minister next month to run for leader of france 's ruling party - a step seen by many as a move toward candidacy for the presidency in 2007 , also signaled his determination to put franco-german economic ties back on track before he goes . sanofi-aventis deal angers berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aventis and sanofi merged at the expense of shareholders .
sarkozy plans to discuss his controversial april intervention in the takeover battle for franco-german drug company aventis when he exerted his power to broker a sanofi-aventis merger , depriving aventis shareholders of a potentially higher bid from switzerland 's novartis .
the merger created the world 's third largest drugs company . berlin was angered by the intervention with chancellor schröder expressing his disapproval . " politics has no role to play in companies ' decision-making processes , " schröder said at the time . siemens plans thwarted by sarkozy shortly afterwards , the german government was again riled by sarkozy 's move to thwart the designs of german engineering group siemens on its troubled french rival alstom which prompted criticism of what schröder called sarkozy 's " nationalistic " policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens was barred from bidding for alstom subsidiaries .
schröder has voiced concern in the last few months that france 's current industrial policy is undermining the franco-german relationship . the german chancellor told the business daily financial times deutschland in may that he found it " annoying " that sarkozy refused to allow german engineering giant siemens to participate in the takeover of alstom subsidiaries . franco-german relations strained " regarding almstom , i discover sometimes - not by the -lrb- french -rrb- president - but among members of the government , certain statements that merit reconsideration , " schröder told french daily le figaro in an interview published soon after . " everyone can understand that a finance minister is thinking about the next election , but it is a good idea to think about the day after the vote too , " the german chancellor added in a thinly veiled dig at sarkozy . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de all or nothing for alstom ?
troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .

" after the success that the french and germans have had in building planes together , why should n't we succeed in building boats together , " sarkozy told the newspaper . asked whether he would be ready to see a new shipbuilder headquartered in germany , sarkozy pointed out that the european central bank is based in frankfurt , germany . " have i ever said that 's unacceptable , " he asked . germans : time is not right but german government officials said on monday that the requirements to set up a binational shipbuilding giant will not be met for a long time . the french finance minister had recently called for tighter economic coordination with germany . " we do n't have the choice , " he said , adding that france and germany should synchronize their national budgets and share economic data and forecasts .
" the price of oil is the same in germany as it is in france . " sarkozy , who steps down as finance minister next month to run for leader of france 's ruling party - a step seen by many as a move toward candidacy for the presidency in 2007 , also signaled his determination to put franco-german economic ties back on track before he goes . sanofi-aventis deal angers berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aventis and sanofi merged at the expense of shareholders .
sarkozy plans to discuss his controversial april intervention in the takeover battle for franco-german drug company aventis when he exerted his power to broker a sanofi-aventis merger , depriving aventis shareholders of a potentially higher bid from switzerland 's novartis .
the merger created the world 's third largest drugs company . berlin was angered by the intervention with chancellor schröder expressing his disapproval . " politics has no role to play in companies ' decision-making processes , " schröder said at the time . siemens plans thwarted by sarkozy shortly afterwards , the german government was again riled by sarkozy 's move to thwart the designs of german engineering group siemens on its troubled french rival alstom which prompted criticism of what schröder called sarkozy 's " nationalistic " policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens was barred from bidding for alstom subsidiaries .
schröder has voiced concern in the last few months that france 's current industrial policy is undermining the franco-german relationship . the german chancellor told the business daily financial times deutschland in may that he found it " annoying " that sarkozy refused to allow german engineering giant siemens to participate in the takeover of alstom subsidiaries . franco-german relations strained " regarding almstom , i discover sometimes - not by the -lrb- french -rrb- president - but among members of the government , certain statements that merit reconsideration , " schröder told french daily le figaro in an interview published soon after . " everyone can understand that a finance minister is thinking about the next election , but it is a good idea to think about the day after the vote too , " the german chancellor added in a thinly veiled dig at sarkozy . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de all or nothing for alstom ?
troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .
german rival siemens has shown interest in bits and pieces , but french finance minister sarkozy says it 's all or nothing .
-lrb- may 17 , 2004 -rrb- france , germany plan tighter industrial ties in a regular summit meeting in paris , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder discussed industrial ties , the euro stability pact and condemned this week 's grisly in iraq .

the head of the general works council at opel , klaus franz , told the weekly welt am sonntag that the council was in direct talks with management in detroit and zürich focused on developing an entirely new company structure .
the ultimate objective is to establish a " european corporation , " or " société européene , " based in brussels , out of gm 's 100 european subsidiaries .

franz stressed that he hoped this would be beneficial to both management and employees .
" the company 's new legal form would make gm 's complicated existing structures obsolete , " he told the newspaper .
" and the company would save money . "
he also pointed out that restructuring the company as a corporation would simplify business by making individual negotiations with the boards of gm 's subsidiaries , such as opel and saab , unnecessary .

over half of gm 's 63,000 employees in europe are contracted to opel , which means the opel works council can expect considerable influence within the new corporation .

" " the european proposal for an unlimited suspension of uranium enrichment can be implemented , provided it does not contradict the islamic republic 's criteria , " iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani said on state television . three european states offered iran a deal on thursday under which tehran would receive valuable nuclear technology if it indefinitely suspended all uranium enrichment activities , a key stage in the nuclear fuel cycle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main part of the iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant the three countries - britain , france and germany - hope that if iran agrees to the deal it will be possible to stave off us demands for the nuclear issue to be sent before the un security council . the un 's nuclear watchdog - the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- - has given iran a nov .
25 deadline to allay concerns about its nuclear activities . suspension , not permanent halt ? rowhani made clear that in tehran 's eyes suspending uranium enrichment indefinitely was not the same as imposing a permanent halt on the practice . the term " unlimited does not mean permanent .
the europeans are talking about an unlimited -lrb- suspension -rrb- during the negotiations as it is forseen that long-term negotiations are starting with the europeans , " he said . " they say for example that if the negotiations last seven months , iran must respect the suspension .
we have always said that if the islamic republic accepts the suspension at whatever level , this will be a voluntary decision . " depending on the level of purification , enriched uranium can be used either as fuel for a civilian reactor or as the explosive core of a nuclear bomb .
iran strongly rejects us accusations it is seeking to manufacture atomic weapons . eu must recognize iranian sovereignty rowhani said tehran would continue cooperating with the international community but insisted that european nations must also recognise its right to civilian nuclear technology , according to the official irna news agency . " the europeans must accept that our red lines and national rights can not be violated , " he said . but his remarks appeared to strike a remarkably conciliatory tone and are likely to be welcomed by the three european heavyweights ahead of a meeting this week to hear the islamic republic 's response to the offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the bushehr nuclear power plant " iran 's patience to establish confidence with the world is great , " rowhani said . " it will not be exhausted at this early stage .
we will calmly continue to work at winning confidence .
we are going to carry out any necessary action to create confidence as we want to work with the world in the areas of politics , economy , society and culture and we do not want to worry the world unnecessarily . " rowhani said the european proposal recognized the rights of iran under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , notably " the right of iran to possess nuclear power stations . " " iran has as many rights as a european country under the npt , " he added . rowhani vowed that iran would continue cooperation with the iaea , " not to make the europeans happy but to prove the united states is lying when it says iran is trying to manufacture a nuclear weapon .

the new straits times quoted sources as saying that proton chief executive tengku mahaleel ariff has flown to germany after an emergency board meeting over the weekend to ink the pact .
although the deal did not involve volkswagen taking an equity stake in proton , it is expected to drive sales for the malaysian carmaker and increase production at its 1.52-billion-ringgit -lrb- 400 million dollar -rrb- plant in tanjung malim in central perak , sources said .
a proton official said that mahaleel was now in germany to finalize negotiations but declined to give details .
volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker , earlier this month confirmed it was in talks with proton about the possibility of cooperation for it to penetrate markets in the 10-member association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- .
although volkswagen is the biggest foreign auto maker in china with nearly 30 percent of the market , it has a negligible presence in asean .
-lrb- afp -rrb- dw-world.de eu takes germany to court over vw law the european commission decided wednesday to take germany to the european court of justice for not having modified its so-called volkswagen law , which shields the carmaker from hostile takeovers , an eu source said .

" adjusted for variations in the number of working days , the current year will show growth of just under 1.5 percent .
and according to very preliminary estimates for 2005 , likewise adjusted for working-day variations , we expect a growth rate slightly above the 2004 outcome , " remsperger said .
headline growth this year was actually likely to come out at just under 2 percent , but much of that was due to the fact that there were a greater number of working days in 2004 since many public holidays fell on the weekend .
the 1.5 percent figure was adjusted for that effect .
nevertheless , the forecast was " a very conditional one , " the bundesbank 's chief economist added .
" above all , it depends on the assumption that the oil price will come down from its current level . " -lrb- afp -rrb- dw-world.de gloom deepens over german economy the german economy is recovering , but the modest upturn will lose momentum as early as next year as a result of surging oil prices and a slowdown in exports , leading economic research institutes said tuesday .

1966 .
isherwood 's portrayal of berlin as a sinful , hedonistic metropolis in the berlin stories was turned into the hit film musical " cabaret " in 1972 starring liza minelli as the sad and flighty cabaret singer sally bowles .
the original broadway version of " cabaret " premiered in 1966 and became an instant success . turbulent time sets the scene decades on , the famous musical has returned to the city that inspired it .
on saturday , the show directed by renowned american choreographer vincent paterson , premiered at bar jeder vernunft , a small cabaret in western berlin , just a few streets away from the boarding house where isherwood once lived in the district of schöneberg . berlin in the 1920s was all about economic uncertainty and inflation , sexual liberation and excessive nightlife .
drugs , drink and prostitution were rife , as people did their best to drown out the horrors of world war i and stave off the next one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna loos-liefers as sally bowles during the premiere of cabaret in berlin this chaotic atmosphere forms the background for the love story between a young american writer , clifford bradshaw , and the chanteuse of the louche kitkat nightclub , sally bowles . starring anna loos-liefers as sally bowles , angela winkler as landlady fräulein schneider and guido kleineidam as clifford bradshaw , the show recreates the sleazy glamour of the notorious 1920s venue . " amazing , interesting city " peterson , who has choreographed stage shows for madonna and michael jackson and worked with directors like steven spielberg and lars von trier , said he was fascinated by weimar-era berlin . " from all the research i have done it was an amazing interesting city , " peterson told dw-tv .
" it was like the sodom and gomorra of the world , in between one period and another .
sometimes when life is very difficult , morality is released and people have to express themselves in different ways . " peterson said the political message of the play was still relevant today .
" i want to make this message more important than a historical revisiting , " he said .
" the politics of prejudice and the politics of racism exist today - as powerfully as they existed in 1930s and 1940s here in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cabaret premiere in berlin the $ 743,000 -lrb- € 582,000 -rrb- production is financed by celebrities and cabaret enthusiasts who have campaigned for years for the show to be staged in berlin . british newspaper the daily telegraph reported that the musical 's organizers are keen to attract some of the 130,000 british tourists who visit the german capital every year , many of whom come in search of isherwood 's berlin . not enough oomph ? critics and media in germany have largely welcomed the staging of the production , hailing the venue as the ideal location to set off the gaudy glamour of the time . at the same time , many have lamented the lack of oomph and passion in the show .
" the production does n't crackle , it does n't have any wicked ambiguity about it , " the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote .
" it 's so nice and clean , just like its main star anna loos-liefers - she and her partner guido kleineidam fast descend into woodenly delivered dialogue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.10.2004 wolfsburg tops the table , stuttgart tastes defeat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's diego klimowicz celebrates his goal stuttgart fell to a 2-0 defeat at sc freiburg on sunday , missing the chance to take the top spot in the bundesliga .
vfl wolfsburg returned to the summit with a 3-0 triumph over a befuddled vfl bochum . goals from georgian international alexander iaschvili -lrb- 35 -rrb- and mali star soumaila coulibaly -lrb- 90 -rrb- helped freiburg become the first team to defeat matthias sammer 's side in the 2004/05 campaign . martin stranzl was dismissed for stuttgart in the 69th minute to cap a miserable afternoon for the visitors who must get themselves fired up for werder bremen on wednesday . elsewhere on saturday , wolfsburg started out with a furious yet sloppy attack that bochum 's defense could never really manage to answer .
after firing erratically at first , wolfsburg eventually got on target in the 27th minute after pablo thiam headed in a free kick . wolfsburg striker thomas brdaric came alive under the watchful eye of german national coach jürgen klinsmann , who came to see what the national payer could do at the club level .
although brdaric did n't score any of his team 's three goals , he proved instrumental in setting up chances and pushing his side forward . bildunterschrift : the two other wolfsburg goals came in rapid succession in the 39th and 42nd minutes by diego klimowicz and andres d 'alessandro respectively .
in the second half things slowed down considerably , but bochum never put together an effective attack and the team 's defense remained wobbly to the end .
the referee had some questionable calls during the match and he disallowed a goal for either side . bayern pulls it out an injury-ravaged bayern munich needed a brace of late goals to down hansa rostock 2-0 on saturday in a heated match that saw both sides reduced to ten men .
with 82 minutes played bayern were locked 0-0 with relegation candidates rostock but french international willy sagnol , who wanted to leave the club in the last season , broke the resistance with a header and substitute mehmet scholl added a second three minutes later . the victory comes on the back of two straight defeats for bayern who move up to third with the three points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after failing to score in their previous two matches against schalke 04 and juventus , bayern hoped for a comfortable win against hansa but their lack of firepower was underlined once again .
deprived of injured trio michael ballack , ze roberto and lucio the bavarian titans lacked the killer instinct in front of goal with torsten frings and roy makaay both spurning good opportunities . bayern should have had a penalty in the 20th minute when david rasmussen brought down frings in the penalty area but their claims were turned down .
rasmussen must have thought the gods were smiling down on him but that hope vanished when referee lutz wagner dismissed him in the 37th minute for a fierce tackle . bayern could not breach the ten-men of rostock and in fact hansa drew strength from playing with one man fewer testing bayern custodian oliver kahn several times .
munich 's ghana defender sammy kuffour was then dismissed in the 75th minute for an ugly foul to even the numbers up and bizarrely it appeared to help bayern who scored seven minutes later through sagnol . the french defender latched onto a scholl cross to head home before the veteran midfielder capped a fine substitute appearance with a goal himself . hamburg beats dortmund at the bottom end of the bundesliga ladder thomas doll enjoyed his first game in charge of sv hamburg with his team recording a 2-0 triumph over borussia dortmund at the westfalen stadium .
hamburg move off bottom spot and out of the relegation zone leapfrogging 2002 champions dortmund who are now fifth from bottom . # b # dortmund 's westfalen stadium was a fortress last season but the gate looks to have been left open for this campaign with hamburg taking the spoils with a victory .
belgian international emile mpenza scored a ninth minute opener to the delight of new coach doll and david jarolim wrapped up the points in the 70th minute .
dortmund have won just one league match in nine outings and their dutch coach bert van marwijk is feeling the heat . elsewhere german champions werder bremen bounced back from successive league defeats to crush fc nuremberg 4-1 at the weserstadion .
werder followed up their midweek champions league victory over anderlecht with another three points thanks to goals from ivan klasnic -lrb- 13 -rrb- , frenchman johan micoud -lrb- 18 -rrb- , christian schulz -lrb- 75 -rrb- and fabian ernst -lrb- 88 -rrb- . last season 's double winners now lie fourth six points adrift of wolfsburg . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans open uefa cup in style it may be seen by some as the poorer relation to the champions league but for those german teams in the uefa cup , it is an opportunity to go for european glory .

although brdaric did n't score any of his team 's three goals , he proved instrumental in setting up chances and pushing his side forward . bildunterschrift : the two other wolfsburg goals came in rapid succession in the 39th and 42nd minutes by diego klimowicz and andres d 'alessandro respectively .
in the second half things slowed down considerably , but bochum never put together an effective attack and the team 's defense remained wobbly to the end .
the referee had some questionable calls during the match and he disallowed a goal for either side . bayern pulls it out an injury-ravaged bayern munich needed a brace of late goals to down hansa rostock 2-0 on saturday in a heated match that saw both sides reduced to ten men .
with 82 minutes played bayern were locked 0-0 with relegation candidates rostock but french international willy sagnol , who wanted to leave the club in the last season , broke the resistance with a header and substitute mehmet scholl added a second three minutes later . the victory comes on the back of two straight defeats for bayern who move up to third with the three points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after failing to score in their previous two matches against schalke 04 and juventus , bayern hoped for a comfortable win against hansa but their lack of firepower was underlined once again .
deprived of injured trio michael ballack , ze roberto and lucio the bavarian titans lacked the killer instinct in front of goal with torsten frings and roy makaay both spurning good opportunities . bayern should have had a penalty in the 20th minute when david rasmussen brought down frings in the penalty area but their claims were turned down .
rasmussen must have thought the gods were smiling down on him but that hope vanished when referee lutz wagner dismissed him in the 37th minute for a fierce tackle . bayern could not breach the ten-men of rostock and in fact hansa drew strength from playing with one man fewer testing bayern custodian oliver kahn several times .
munich 's ghana defender sammy kuffour was then dismissed in the 75th minute for an ugly foul to even the numbers up and bizarrely it appeared to help bayern who scored seven minutes later through sagnol . the french defender latched onto a scholl cross to head home before the veteran midfielder capped a fine substitute appearance with a goal himself . hamburg beats dortmund at the bottom end of the bundesliga ladder thomas doll enjoyed his first game in charge of sv hamburg with his team recording a 2-0 triumph over borussia dortmund at the westfalen stadium .
hamburg move off bottom spot and out of the relegation zone leapfrogging 2002 champions dortmund who are now fifth from bottom . # b # dortmund 's westfalen stadium was a fortress last season but the gate looks to have been left open for this campaign with hamburg taking the spoils with a victory .
belgian international emile mpenza scored a ninth minute opener to the delight of new coach doll and david jarolim wrapped up the points in the 70th minute .
dortmund have won just one league match in nine outings and their dutch coach bert van marwijk is feeling the heat . elsewhere german champions werder bremen bounced back from successive league defeats to crush fc nuremberg 4-1 at the weserstadion .
werder followed up their midweek champions league victory over anderlecht with another three points thanks to goals from ivan klasnic -lrb- 13 -rrb- , frenchman johan micoud -lrb- 18 -rrb- , christian schulz -lrb- 75 -rrb- and fabian ernst -lrb- 88 -rrb- . last season 's double winners now lie fourth six points adrift of wolfsburg . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans open uefa cup in style it may be seen by some as the poorer relation to the champions league but for those german teams in the uefa cup , it is an opportunity to go for european glory .
germany 's clubs did just that on thursday night .

there is little doubt that some of the issues are controversial and are further complicated by widely differing positions held by member states . sweden wants wide-ranging european cooperation when it comes to asylum , but not in the field of border security .
germany , on the other hand , is in favor of the eu setting up teams of national border experts who could help member states monitor and protect their borders with non-eu neighbors .
these teams are envisaged turning into a european border guard at a later stage . with similar arguments expected on a host of other delicate issues , the meeting is likely to trigger some lively debates .
the border guard idea has been rejected before because some states believe protection of external borders is a national and not an eu matter . controversial proposal at the heart of the talks are the goals in interior and justice affairs that the european union has set in the so-called " hague program " and would like to see implemented by 2010 .

there is little doubt that some of the issues are controversial and are further complicated by widely differing positions held by member states . sweden wants wide-ranging european cooperation when it comes to asylum , but not in the field of border security .
germany , on the other hand , is in favor of the eu setting up teams of national border experts who could help member states monitor and protect their borders with non-eu neighbors .
these teams are envisaged turning into a european border guard at a later stage . with similar arguments expected on a host of other delicate issues , the meeting is likely to trigger some lively debates .
the border guard idea has been rejected before because some states believe protection of external borders is a national and not an eu matter . controversial proposal at the heart of the talks are the goals in interior and justice affairs that the european union has set in the so-called " hague program " and would like to see implemented by 2010 .
the hague plan is a follow-up of the program adopted at the tampere european council in 1999 .

vfl wolfsburg returned to the summit with a 3-0 triumph over a befuddled vfl bochum . goals from georgian international alexander iaschvili -lrb- 35 -rrb- and mali star soumaila coulibaly -lrb- 90 -rrb- helped freiburg become the first team to defeat matthias sammer 's side in the 2004/05 campaign . martin stranzl was dismissed for stuttgart in the 69th minute to cap a miserable afternoon for the visitors who must get themselves fired up for werder bremen on wednesday . elsewhere on saturday , wolfsburg started out with a furious yet sloppy attack that bochum 's defense could never really manage to answer .
after firing erratically at first , wolfsburg eventually got on target in the 27th minute after pablo thiam headed in a free kick . wolfsburg striker thomas brdaric came alive under the watchful eye of german national coach jürgen klinsmann , who came to see what the national payer could do at the club level .
although brdaric did n't score any of his team 's three goals , he proved instrumental in setting up chances and pushing his side forward . bildunterschrift : the two other wolfsburg goals came in rapid succession in the 39th and 42nd minutes by diego klimowicz and andres d 'alessandro respectively .
in the second half things slowed down considerably , but bochum never put together an effective attack and the team 's defense remained wobbly to the end .
the referee had some questionable calls during the match and he disallowed a goal for either side . bayern pulls it out an injury-ravaged bayern munich needed a brace of late goals to down hansa rostock 2-0 on saturday in a heated match that saw both sides reduced to ten men .
with 82 minutes played bayern were locked 0-0 with relegation candidates rostock but french international willy sagnol , who wanted to leave the club in the last season , broke the resistance with a header and substitute mehmet scholl added a second three minutes later . the victory comes on the back of two straight defeats for bayern who move up to third with the three points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after failing to score in their previous two matches against schalke 04 and juventus , bayern hoped for a comfortable win against hansa but their lack of firepower was underlined once again .
deprived of injured trio michael ballack , ze roberto and lucio the bavarian titans lacked the killer instinct in front of goal with torsten frings and roy makaay both spurning good opportunities . bayern should have had a penalty in the 20th minute when david rasmussen brought down frings in the penalty area but their claims were turned down .
rasmussen must have thought the gods were smiling down on him but that hope vanished when referee lutz wagner dismissed him in the 37th minute for a fierce tackle . bayern could not breach the ten-men of rostock and in fact hansa drew strength from playing with one man fewer testing bayern custodian oliver kahn several times .
munich 's ghana defender sammy kuffour was then dismissed in the 75th minute for an ugly foul to even the numbers up and bizarrely it appeared to help bayern who scored seven minutes later through sagnol . the french defender latched onto a scholl cross to head home before the veteran midfielder capped a fine substitute appearance with a goal himself . hamburg beats dortmund at the bottom end of the bundesliga ladder thomas doll enjoyed his first game in charge of sv hamburg with his team recording a 2-0 triumph over borussia dortmund at the westfalen stadium .
hamburg move off bottom spot and out of the relegation zone leapfrogging 2002 champions dortmund who are now fifth from bottom . # b # dortmund 's westfalen stadium was a fortress last season but the gate looks to have been left open for this campaign with hamburg taking the spoils with a victory .
belgian international emile mpenza scored a ninth minute opener to the delight of new coach doll and david jarolim wrapped up the points in the 70th minute .
dortmund have won just one league match in nine outings and their dutch coach bert van marwijk is feeling the heat . elsewhere german champions werder bremen bounced back from successive league defeats to crush fc nuremberg 4-1 at the weserstadion .
werder followed up their midweek champions league victory over anderlecht with another three points thanks to goals from ivan klasnic -lrb- 13 -rrb- , frenchman johan micoud -lrb- 18 -rrb- , christian schulz -lrb- 75 -rrb- and fabian ernst -lrb- 88 -rrb- . last season 's double winners now lie fourth six points adrift of wolfsburg . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans open uefa cup in style it may be seen by some as the poorer relation to the champions league but for those german teams in the uefa cup , it is an opportunity to go for european glory .

with 82 minutes played bayern were locked 0-0 with relegation candidates rostock but french international willy sagnol , who wanted to leave the club in the last season , broke the resistance with a header and substitute mehmet scholl added a second three minutes later . the victory comes on the back of two straight defeats for bayern who move up to third with the three points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after failing to score in their previous two matches against schalke 04 and juventus , bayern hoped for a comfortable win against hansa but their lack of firepower was underlined once again .
deprived of injured trio michael ballack , ze roberto and lucio the bavarian titans lacked the killer instinct in front of goal with torsten frings and roy makaay both spurning good opportunities . bayern should have had a penalty in the 20th minute when david rasmussen brought down frings in the penalty area but their claims were turned down .
rasmussen must have thought the gods were smiling down on him but that hope vanished when referee lutz wagner dismissed him in the 37th minute for a fierce tackle . bayern could not breach the ten-men of rostock and in fact hansa drew strength from playing with one man fewer testing bayern custodian oliver kahn several times .
munich 's ghana defender sammy kuffour was then dismissed in the 75th minute for an ugly foul to even the numbers up and bizarrely it appeared to help bayern who scored seven minutes later through sagnol . the french defender latched onto a scholl cross to head home before the veteran midfielder capped a fine substitute appearance with a goal himself . hamburg beats dortmund at the bottom end of the bundesliga ladder thomas doll enjoyed his first game in charge of sv hamburg with his team recording a 2-0 triumph over borussia dortmund at the westfalen stadium .
hamburg move off bottom spot and out of the relegation zone leapfrogging 2002 champions dortmund who are now fifth from bottom . # b # dortmund 's westfalen stadium was a fortress last season but the gate looks to have been left open for this campaign with hamburg taking the spoils with a victory .
belgian international emile mpenza scored a ninth minute opener to the delight of new coach doll and david jarolim wrapped up the points in the 70th minute .
dortmund have won just one league match in nine outings and their dutch coach bert van marwijk is feeling the heat . elsewhere german champions werder bremen bounced back from successive league defeats to crush fc nuremberg 4-1 at the weserstadion .
werder followed up their midweek champions league victory over anderlecht with another three points thanks to goals from ivan klasnic -lrb- 13 -rrb- , frenchman johan micoud -lrb- 18 -rrb- , christian schulz -lrb- 75 -rrb- and fabian ernst -lrb- 88 -rrb- . last season 's double winners now lie fourth six points adrift of wolfsburg . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans open uefa cup in style it may be seen by some as the poorer relation to the champions league but for those german teams in the uefa cup , it is an opportunity to go for european glory .

according to the paper , president george w. bush 's flaw is his stubborn reluctance to admit mistakes and to adjust personnel and policy .
blind faith in military power as a tool for change has too often influenced his decision-making .
the paper conceded that kerry often fails to inspire , owing his rise more to opposition to bush than loyalty to his own cause .
but on balance , he is the better choice , the daily argued . " bush or kerry ? " wondered the french daily le journal de la haute-marne .
the paper said the ideological differences between the two candidates touch on an issue that affects the whole world , namely the role of the us on the global stage in an age where not the soviet union but international terrorism is the key challenge .
the paper said if the rest of the world could vote , kerry would win , but it 's the american public that is going to the polls .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because it 's our world and our future that are at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
while in the us the race between kerry and bush is almost a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation .
vienna 's kurier commented : " this time election observers will be present to make sure the voting punch cards have been properly perforated , that the reading equipment is working and that the newest electronic voting machines have not been tampered with . "
the election observers will be there to prevent the normal kinds of voting manipulation seen in developing democracies , the paper wrote , and then affirmed that yes , it was writing about the self-proclaimed home of democracy , the united states . " nevertheless the osce is sending 100 observers for the presidential elections to the immense displeasure of american bureacrats , " the paper wrote .
commenting on the weekend 's elections in the un administered province of kosovo , the abc paper from madrid said the poll showed that the multi-ethnic society in kosovo remains an illusion .
it warned that if neither the ethnic-albanians nor the serbian minority are prepared to make concessions the only solution for the province is to divide it up .
and the paper warned leaders from both sides that negotiations are better than losing everything with an outbreak of new violence .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung wrote that despite the fact that the elecitons were peaceful , kosovo has not come closer to an independent future .
there 's still too much division over who will rule the province , it said , and under these conditions it seems unrealsitic that discussions about kosovo 's independence can begin in earnest in nine months time .
belgrade 's daily paper danas wrote that serbian boycott of the elections in kosovo will presumably hurt the serbs themselves and create resentment among the international community .

vfl wolfsburg returned to the summit with a 3-0 triumph over a befuddled vfl bochum . goals from georgian international alexander iaschvili -lrb- 35 -rrb- and mali star soumaila coulibaly -lrb- 90 -rrb- helped freiburg become the first team to defeat matthias sammer 's side in the 2004/05 campaign . martin stranzl was dismissed for stuttgart in the 69th minute to cap a miserable afternoon for the visitors who must get themselves fired up for werder bremen on wednesday . elsewhere on saturday , wolfsburg started out with a furious yet sloppy attack that bochum 's defense could never really manage to answer .
after firing erratically at first , wolfsburg eventually got on target in the 27th minute after pablo thiam headed in a free kick . wolfsburg striker thomas brdaric came alive under the watchful eye of german national coach jürgen klinsmann , who came to see what the national payer could do at the club level .
although brdaric did n't score any of his team 's three goals , he proved instrumental in setting up chances and pushing his side forward . bildunterschrift : the two other wolfsburg goals came in rapid succession in the 39th and 42nd minutes by diego klimowicz and andres d 'alessandro respectively .
in the second half things slowed down considerably , but bochum never put together an effective attack and the team 's defense remained wobbly to the end .
the referee had some questionable calls during the match and he disallowed a goal for either side . bayern pulls it out an injury-ravaged bayern munich needed a brace of late goals to down hansa rostock 2-0 on saturday in a heated match that saw both sides reduced to ten men .
with 82 minutes played bayern were locked 0-0 with relegation candidates rostock but french international willy sagnol , who wanted to leave the club in the last season , broke the resistance with a header and substitute mehmet scholl added a second three minutes later . the victory comes on the back of two straight defeats for bayern who move up to third with the three points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after failing to score in their previous two matches against schalke 04 and juventus , bayern hoped for a comfortable win against hansa but their lack of firepower was underlined once again .
deprived of injured trio michael ballack , ze roberto and lucio the bavarian titans lacked the killer instinct in front of goal with torsten frings and roy makaay both spurning good opportunities . bayern should have had a penalty in the 20th minute when david rasmussen brought down frings in the penalty area but their claims were turned down .
rasmussen must have thought the gods were smiling down on him but that hope vanished when referee lutz wagner dismissed him in the 37th minute for a fierce tackle . bayern could not breach the ten-men of rostock and in fact hansa drew strength from playing with one man fewer testing bayern custodian oliver kahn several times .
munich 's ghana defender sammy kuffour was then dismissed in the 75th minute for an ugly foul to even the numbers up and bizarrely it appeared to help bayern who scored seven minutes later through sagnol . the french defender latched onto a scholl cross to head home before the veteran midfielder capped a fine substitute appearance with a goal himself . hamburg beats dortmund at the bottom end of the bundesliga ladder thomas doll enjoyed his first game in charge of sv hamburg with his team recording a 2-0 triumph over borussia dortmund at the westfalen stadium .
hamburg move off bottom spot and out of the relegation zone leapfrogging 2002 champions dortmund who are now fifth from bottom . # b # dortmund 's westfalen stadium was a fortress last season but the gate looks to have been left open for this campaign with hamburg taking the spoils with a victory .
belgian international emile mpenza scored a ninth minute opener to the delight of new coach doll and david jarolim wrapped up the points in the 70th minute .
dortmund have won just one league match in nine outings and their dutch coach bert van marwijk is feeling the heat . elsewhere german champions werder bremen bounced back from successive league defeats to crush fc nuremberg 4-1 at the weserstadion .
werder followed up their midweek champions league victory over anderlecht with another three points thanks to goals from ivan klasnic -lrb- 13 -rrb- , frenchman johan micoud -lrb- 18 -rrb- , christian schulz -lrb- 75 -rrb- and fabian ernst -lrb- 88 -rrb- . last season 's double winners now lie fourth six points adrift of wolfsburg . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans open uefa cup in style it may be seen by some as the poorer relation to the champions league but for those german teams in the uefa cup , it is an opportunity to go for european glory .

the 120-seat theater called bamah , hebrew for stage , is housed in a former cinema in the german capital 's upscale charlottenburg district and specializes in traditional eastern european productions as well as contemporary israeli drama .
" this is not intended to be a theater by jews for jews with jews , " said the israeli-born director of bamah , dan lahav , at the opening late saturday .
" bamah is intended for everyone interested in jewish culture . "
the opening featured the play " vienna at sea " by edna mazya , which tells the story of a group of jews vacationing in 1938 as they learn hitler has annexed austria .
bamah began as a german-language theater troupe in berlin in 2001 but only acquired its own playhouse this autumn , following the lead of similar groups in the northern german cities of hamburg and rostock .
before the holocaust , berlin was host to a thriving jewish theater scene in the district near the alexanderplatz square in the eastern part of the capital .
the city boasted 20 yiddish-language theaters until the outbreak of world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.10.2004 is the end nigh for opel ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailing german car maker opel might cut a third of its workforce as restructuring talks continue , opel 's works council and us parent company general motors are considering a possible merger of gm 's european subsidiaries . since 5:45 am local time monday , it 's once again business as usual at the opel plant in rüsselsheim .
but on the executive floor , plans are afoot to radically restructure the company .
the head of the general works council at opel , klaus franz , told the weekly welt am sonntag that the council was in direct talks with management in detroit and zürich focused on developing an entirely new company structure .
the ultimate objective is to establish a " european corporation , " or " société européene , " based in brussels , out of gm 's 100 european subsidiaries .
cheaper , simpler ?
franz stressed that he hoped this would be beneficial to both management and employees .
" the company 's new legal form would make gm 's complicated existing structures obsolete , " he told the newspaper .
" and the company would save money . "
he also pointed out that restructuring the company as a corporation would simplify business by making individual negotiations with the boards of gm 's subsidiaries , such as opel and saab , unnecessary .
" we could talk to our european management directly about decisions and problems , " he pointed out .
moving from zürich to brussels according to welt am sonntag , the proposal is fast taking shape .
the head of gm europe , fritz henderson , would take the reins of the new corporation , with gm europe 's president carl-peter forster acting as deputy .
the headquarters of a european corporation legally require a location in a eu member state .
for now , brussels is being tipped as the most likely site , replacing the current headquarters of gm 's 100 european subsidiaries in zürich .
opel would remain a brand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel logo if the plan goes ahead , opel would be subsumed into general motors europe and its existing legal form would be dissolved .
" the opel logo will remain on the cars and factories , " observed one high-ranking gm manager , who stressed this was crucial to retaining opel as a german brand .
employee status it still remains to be seen what status employees would have in the new corporation .
their participation in the board of control is based on the ratio of employee numbers in the individual companies joining together in the european holding .
over half of gm 's 63,000 employees in europe are contracted to opel , which means the opel works council can expect considerable influence within the new corporation .
the restructuring talks come weeks after gm unveiled plans to slash 12,000 jobs in europe - including 10 , 000 in germany alone - as part of a € 500 million -lrb- $ 625 million -rrb- cost-cutting drive . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de restructuring talks underway at opel and volkswagen crucial restructuring talks at german carmakers volkswagen and opel resumed thursday as management and unions of both companies attempted to hammer out the details of painful but necessary cost-cutting measures .

ethicists warn of dangerous terrain . in a future where a person 's chance at getting sick can be read from their genes , german politicians are discussing how much of that information a potential employer has a right to know .
advocates say the bill , which is still in discussion , clearly regulates how far employers are allowed to go in determining how genetically fit someone is for a job .
in jobs such as construction or public transportation , the law would allow for genetic testing for symptoms of color blindness among other things , according to a report in the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" it sets the conditions for the type of tests that can be conducted , " heinz putzhammer , a representative of the federation of german trade unions who worked on an early draft of the bill , told dw-world .
" i think we 're on the right track because the limiting of genetic tests is in any case necessary in order to protect the person or the private sphere . "
discrimination just a few steps away but some fear that track could nevertheless lead to genetic discrimination .
testing for symptoms of a disease is just a few short steps away from tests that would help employers determine whether to hire someone based on their chance of developing a genetic disease , says sue mayer , director of the uk organization genewatch .
" i think you have to put it together , " mayer told dw-world .
" i ca n't understand why you would want to do a genetic test for something symptomatic .
it would raise the question ' is this leading the way to something ? " '
in addition , scientists say the tests currently on the market to determine common genetic diseases , such as diabetes or hypertension , are bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dna lab : how accurate are genetic tests ? unreliable and probably never will be completely accurate .
the chance of developing a sickness , such as heart disease , has a little to do with the genes a person has inherited and a lot to do with outside factors , such as whether the person smokes or is overweight .
tests nowhere near ready " the main point with genetic tests is their interpretation .
for most of the genetic tests it 's hard to interpret results , " christian kubisch , a geneticist at the university of bonn , told dw-world .
" it 's nearly ridiculous for a company to say we will test you for these diseases ... these kinds of tests are not good at the moment and probably never will be . "
many countries have taken the step of outlawing access to genetic tests for employers and insurers outright .
beginning with france and norway in 1994 , australia , denmark , the netherlands and austria have passed laws that either severely limit or outright forbid the use of a person 's genetic information for anything other than medical or scientific purposes .
german opposition politicians said they want a similar law .
parliamentarian hubert hüppe , the deputy chair of the ethics and law in modern medicine commission in the german bundestag , said that the results of genetic tests , no matter what type , belong in no one 's hands but the person tested .
parliamentarian favors ban " i 'm in favor of a strict ban , " hüppe , a member of the conservative christian democratic union party , said in a dw-world interview .
" i 'm against any other party being able to use that information . "
the european union weighed in on the discussion in the summer of 2003 .
in a 17-page opinion , the policy-initiating european commission said a medical examination should only be conducted after an employer has decided on a job candidate .
whether a person is fit for the job " can be fulfilled through medical examination but without performing genetic screening , " wrote the 12-member european group on ethics in science and new technologies .

ethicists warn of dangerous terrain . in a future where a person 's chance at getting sick can be read from their genes , german politicians are discussing how much of that information a potential employer has a right to know .
advocates say the bill , which is still in discussion , clearly regulates how far employers are allowed to go in determining how genetically fit someone is for a job .
in jobs such as construction or public transportation , the law would allow for genetic testing for symptoms of color blindness among other things , according to a report in the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" it sets the conditions for the type of tests that can be conducted , " heinz putzhammer , a representative of the federation of german trade unions who worked on an early draft of the bill , told dw-world .
" i think we 're on the right track because the limiting of genetic tests is in any case necessary in order to protect the person or the private sphere . "
discrimination just a few steps away but some fear that track could nevertheless lead to genetic discrimination .
testing for symptoms of a disease is just a few short steps away from tests that would help employers determine whether to hire someone based on their chance of developing a genetic disease , says sue mayer , director of the uk organization genewatch .
" i think you have to put it together , " mayer told dw-world .
" i ca n't understand why you would want to do a genetic test for something symptomatic .
it would raise the question ' is this leading the way to something ? " '
in addition , scientists say the tests currently on the market to determine common genetic diseases , such as diabetes or hypertension , are bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dna lab : how accurate are genetic tests ? unreliable and probably never will be completely accurate .
the chance of developing a sickness , such as heart disease , has a little to do with the genes a person has inherited and a lot to do with outside factors , such as whether the person smokes or is overweight .
tests nowhere near ready " the main point with genetic tests is their interpretation .
for most of the genetic tests it 's hard to interpret results , " christian kubisch , a geneticist at the university of bonn , told dw-world .
" it 's nearly ridiculous for a company to say we will test you for these diseases ... these kinds of tests are not good at the moment and probably never will be . "
many countries have taken the step of outlawing access to genetic tests for employers and insurers outright .
beginning with france and norway in 1994 , australia , denmark , the netherlands and austria have passed laws that either severely limit or outright forbid the use of a person 's genetic information for anything other than medical or scientific purposes .
german opposition politicians said they want a similar law .
parliamentarian hubert hüppe , the deputy chair of the ethics and law in modern medicine commission in the german bundestag , said that the results of genetic tests , no matter what type , belong in no one 's hands but the person tested .
parliamentarian favors ban " i 'm in favor of a strict ban , " hüppe , a member of the conservative christian democratic union party , said in a dw-world interview .
" i 'm against any other party being able to use that information . "
the european union weighed in on the discussion in the summer of 2003 .
in a 17-page opinion , the policy-initiating european commission said a medical examination should only be conducted after an employer has decided on a job candidate .
whether a person is fit for the job " can be fulfilled through medical examination but without performing genetic screening , " wrote the 12-member european group on ethics in science and new technologies .
" thus , employers should not in general perform genetic screening nor ask employees to undergo tests .

ethicists warn of dangerous terrain . in a future where a person 's chance at getting sick can be read from their genes , german politicians are discussing how much of that information a potential employer has a right to know .
advocates say the bill , which is still in discussion , clearly regulates how far employers are allowed to go in determining how genetically fit someone is for a job .
in jobs such as construction or public transportation , the law would allow for genetic testing for symptoms of color blindness among other things , according to a report in the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" it sets the conditions for the type of tests that can be conducted , " heinz putzhammer , a representative of the federation of german trade unions who worked on an early draft of the bill , told dw-world .
" i think we 're on the right track because the limiting of genetic tests is in any case necessary in order to protect the person or the private sphere . "
discrimination just a few steps away but some fear that track could nevertheless lead to genetic discrimination .
testing for symptoms of a disease is just a few short steps away from tests that would help employers determine whether to hire someone based on their chance of developing a genetic disease , says sue mayer , director of the uk organization genewatch .
" i think you have to put it together , " mayer told dw-world .
" i ca n't understand why you would want to do a genetic test for something symptomatic .
it would raise the question ' is this leading the way to something ? " '
in addition , scientists say the tests currently on the market to determine common genetic diseases , such as diabetes or hypertension , are bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dna lab : how accurate are genetic tests ? unreliable and probably never will be completely accurate .
the chance of developing a sickness , such as heart disease , has a little to do with the genes a person has inherited and a lot to do with outside factors , such as whether the person smokes or is overweight .
tests nowhere near ready " the main point with genetic tests is their interpretation .
for most of the genetic tests it 's hard to interpret results , " christian kubisch , a geneticist at the university of bonn , told dw-world .
" it 's nearly ridiculous for a company to say we will test you for these diseases ... these kinds of tests are not good at the moment and probably never will be . "

the 120-seat theater called bamah , hebrew for stage , is housed in a former cinema in the german capital 's upscale charlottenburg district and specializes in traditional eastern european productions as well as contemporary israeli drama .
" this is not intended to be a theater by jews for jews with jews , " said the israeli-born director of bamah , dan lahav , at the opening late saturday .
" bamah is intended for everyone interested in jewish culture . "
the opening featured the play " vienna at sea " by edna mazya , which tells the story of a group of jews vacationing in 1938 as they learn hitler has annexed austria .
bamah began as a german-language theater troupe in berlin in 2001 but only acquired its own playhouse this autumn , following the lead of similar groups in the northern german cities of hamburg and rostock .
before the holocaust , berlin was host to a thriving jewish theater scene in the district near the alexanderplatz square in the eastern part of the capital .
the city boasted 20 yiddish-language theaters until the outbreak of world war ii .

the 120-seat theater called bamah , hebrew for stage , is housed in a former cinema in the german capital 's upscale charlottenburg district and specializes in traditional eastern european productions as well as contemporary israeli drama .
" this is not intended to be a theater by jews for jews with jews , " said the israeli-born director of bamah , dan lahav , at the opening late saturday .
" bamah is intended for everyone interested in jewish culture . "
the opening featured the play " vienna at sea " by edna mazya , which tells the story of a group of jews vacationing in 1938 as they learn hitler has annexed austria .
bamah began as a german-language theater troupe in berlin in 2001 but only acquired its own playhouse this autumn , following the lead of similar groups in the northern german cities of hamburg and rostock .
before the holocaust , berlin was host to a thriving jewish theater scene in the district near the alexanderplatz square in the eastern part of the capital .
the city boasted 20 yiddish-language theaters until the outbreak of world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.10.2004 european press review : europe 's favorite with only 11 days until the us presidential elections , european papers are putting their bets on their favorite candidates , while others comment on elections that have just been held in kosovo . the financial times of london backed john kerry as the better choice for president of the united states .
according to the paper , president george w. bush 's flaw is his stubborn reluctance to admit mistakes and to adjust personnel and policy .
blind faith in military power as a tool for change has too often influenced his decision-making .
the paper conceded that kerry often fails to inspire , owing his rise more to opposition to bush than loyalty to his own cause .
but on balance , he is the better choice , the daily argued . " bush or kerry ? " wondered the french daily le journal de la haute-marne .
the paper said the ideological differences between the two candidates touch on an issue that affects the whole world , namely the role of the us on the global stage in an age where not the soviet union but international terrorism is the key challenge .
the paper said if the rest of the world could vote , kerry would win , but it 's the american public that is going to the polls .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because it 's our world and our future that are at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
while in the us the race between kerry and bush is almost a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation .
vienna 's kurier commented : " this time election observers will be present to make sure the voting punch cards have been properly perforated , that the reading equipment is working and that the newest electronic voting machines have not been tampered with . "
the election observers will be there to prevent the normal kinds of voting manipulation seen in developing democracies , the paper wrote , and then affirmed that yes , it was writing about the self-proclaimed home of democracy , the united states . " nevertheless the osce is sending 100 observers for the presidential elections to the immense displeasure of american bureacrats , " the paper wrote .
commenting on the weekend 's elections in the un administered province of kosovo , the abc paper from madrid said the poll showed that the multi-ethnic society in kosovo remains an illusion .
it warned that if neither the ethnic-albanians nor the serbian minority are prepared to make concessions the only solution for the province is to divide it up .
and the paper warned leaders from both sides that negotiations are better than losing everything with an outbreak of new violence .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung wrote that despite the fact that the elecitons were peaceful , kosovo has not come closer to an independent future .
there 's still too much division over who will rule the province , it said , and under these conditions it seems unrealsitic that discussions about kosovo 's independence can begin in earnest in nine months time .
belgrade 's daily paper danas wrote that serbian boycott of the elections in kosovo will presumably hurt the serbs themselves and create resentment among the international community .
the paper noted that " while the serbian dissatisfaction with the un adminsitration in the province is understandable - one has to remember the un is only in kosovo because beforehand the ethnic albanians were subjected to terror .

according to the paper , president george w. bush 's flaw is his stubborn reluctance to admit mistakes and to adjust personnel and policy .
blind faith in military power as a tool for change has too often influenced his decision-making .
the paper conceded that kerry often fails to inspire , owing his rise more to opposition to bush than loyalty to his own cause .
but on balance , he is the better choice , the daily argued . " bush or kerry ? " wondered the french daily le journal de la haute-marne .
the paper said the ideological differences between the two candidates touch on an issue that affects the whole world , namely the role of the us on the global stage in an age where not the soviet union but international terrorism is the key challenge .
the paper said if the rest of the world could vote , kerry would win , but it 's the american public that is going to the polls .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because it 's our world and our future that are at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
while in the us the race between kerry and bush is almost a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation .

commenting on the weekend 's elections in the un administered province of kosovo , the abc paper from madrid said the poll showed that the multi-ethnic society in kosovo remains an illusion .
it warned that if neither the ethnic-albanians nor the serbian minority are prepared to make concessions the only solution for the province is to divide it up .

according to the paper , president george w. bush 's flaw is his stubborn reluctance to admit mistakes and to adjust personnel and policy .
blind faith in military power as a tool for change has too often influenced his decision-making .
the paper conceded that kerry often fails to inspire , owing his rise more to opposition to bush than loyalty to his own cause .
but on balance , he is the better choice , the daily argued . " bush or kerry ? " wondered the french daily le journal de la haute-marne .
the paper said the ideological differences between the two candidates touch on an issue that affects the whole world , namely the role of the us on the global stage in an age where not the soviet union but international terrorism is the key challenge .
the paper said if the rest of the world could vote , kerry would win , but it 's the american public that is going to the polls .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because it 's our world and our future that are at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
while in the us the race between kerry and bush is almost a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation .
vienna 's kurier commented : " this time election observers will be present to make sure the voting punch cards have been properly perforated , that the reading equipment is working and that the newest electronic voting machines have not been tampered with . "
the election observers will be there to prevent the normal kinds of voting manipulation seen in developing democracies , the paper wrote , and then affirmed that yes , it was writing about the self-proclaimed home of democracy , the united states . " nevertheless the osce is sending 100 observers for the presidential elections to the immense displeasure of american bureacrats , " the paper wrote .
commenting on the weekend 's elections in the un administered province of kosovo , the abc paper from madrid said the poll showed that the multi-ethnic society in kosovo remains an illusion .
it warned that if neither the ethnic-albanians nor the serbian minority are prepared to make concessions the only solution for the province is to divide it up .
and the paper warned leaders from both sides that negotiations are better than losing everything with an outbreak of new violence .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung wrote that despite the fact that the elecitons were peaceful , kosovo has not come closer to an independent future .
there 's still too much division over who will rule the province , it said , and under these conditions it seems unrealsitic that discussions about kosovo 's independence can begin in earnest in nine months time .

" after the success that the french and germans have had in building planes together , why should n't we succeed in building boats together , " sarkozy told the newspaper . asked whether he would be ready to see a new shipbuilder headquartered in germany , sarkozy pointed out that the european central bank is based in frankfurt , germany . " have i ever said that 's unacceptable , " he asked . germans : time is not right but german government officials said on monday that the requirements to set up a binational shipbuilding giant will not be met for a long time . the french finance minister had recently called for tighter economic coordination with germany . " we do n't have the choice , " he said , adding that france and germany should synchronize their national budgets and share economic data and forecasts .
" the price of oil is the same in germany as it is in france . " sarkozy , who steps down as finance minister next month to run for leader of france 's ruling party - a step seen by many as a move toward candidacy for the presidency in 2007 , also signaled his determination to put franco-german economic ties back on track before he goes . sanofi-aventis deal angers berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aventis and sanofi merged at the expense of shareholders .
sarkozy plans to discuss his controversial april intervention in the takeover battle for franco-german drug company aventis when he exerted his power to broker a sanofi-aventis merger , depriving aventis shareholders of a potentially higher bid from switzerland 's novartis .
the merger created the world 's third largest drugs company . berlin was angered by the intervention with chancellor schröder expressing his disapproval . " politics has no role to play in companies ' decision-making processes , " schröder said at the time . siemens plans thwarted by sarkozy shortly afterwards , the german government was again riled by sarkozy 's move to thwart the designs of german engineering group siemens on its troubled french rival alstom which prompted criticism of what schröder called sarkozy 's " nationalistic " policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens was barred from bidding for alstom subsidiaries .
schröder has voiced concern in the last few months that france 's current industrial policy is undermining the franco-german relationship . the german chancellor told the business daily financial times deutschland in may that he found it " annoying " that sarkozy refused to allow german engineering giant siemens to participate in the takeover of alstom subsidiaries . franco-german relations strained " regarding almstom , i discover sometimes - not by the -lrb- french -rrb- president - but among members of the government , certain statements that merit reconsideration , " schröder told french daily le figaro in an interview published soon after . " everyone can understand that a finance minister is thinking about the next election , but it is a good idea to think about the day after the vote too , " the german chancellor added in a thinly veiled dig at sarkozy . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de all or nothing for alstom ?

ethicists warn of dangerous terrain . in a future where a person 's chance at getting sick can be read from their genes , german politicians are discussing how much of that information a potential employer has a right to know .
advocates say the bill , which is still in discussion , clearly regulates how far employers are allowed to go in determining how genetically fit someone is for a job .
in jobs such as construction or public transportation , the law would allow for genetic testing for symptoms of color blindness among other things , according to a report in the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" it sets the conditions for the type of tests that can be conducted , " heinz putzhammer , a representative of the federation of german trade unions who worked on an early draft of the bill , told dw-world .
" i think we 're on the right track because the limiting of genetic tests is in any case necessary in order to protect the person or the private sphere . "
discrimination just a few steps away but some fear that track could nevertheless lead to genetic discrimination .
testing for symptoms of a disease is just a few short steps away from tests that would help employers determine whether to hire someone based on their chance of developing a genetic disease , says sue mayer , director of the uk organization genewatch .
" i think you have to put it together , " mayer told dw-world .
" i ca n't understand why you would want to do a genetic test for something symptomatic .
it would raise the question ' is this leading the way to something ? " '
in addition , scientists say the tests currently on the market to determine common genetic diseases , such as diabetes or hypertension , are bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dna lab : how accurate are genetic tests ? unreliable and probably never will be completely accurate .
the chance of developing a sickness , such as heart disease , has a little to do with the genes a person has inherited and a lot to do with outside factors , such as whether the person smokes or is overweight .
tests nowhere near ready " the main point with genetic tests is their interpretation .
for most of the genetic tests it 's hard to interpret results , " christian kubisch , a geneticist at the university of bonn , told dw-world .
" it 's nearly ridiculous for a company to say we will test you for these diseases ... these kinds of tests are not good at the moment and probably never will be . "
many countries have taken the step of outlawing access to genetic tests for employers and insurers outright .
beginning with france and norway in 1994 , australia , denmark , the netherlands and austria have passed laws that either severely limit or outright forbid the use of a person 's genetic information for anything other than medical or scientific purposes .
german opposition politicians said they want a similar law .
parliamentarian hubert hüppe , the deputy chair of the ethics and law in modern medicine commission in the german bundestag , said that the results of genetic tests , no matter what type , belong in no one 's hands but the person tested .
parliamentarian favors ban " i 'm in favor of a strict ban , " hüppe , a member of the conservative christian democratic union party , said in a dw-world interview .
" i 'm against any other party being able to use that information . "
the european union weighed in on the discussion in the summer of 2003 .
in a 17-page opinion , the policy-initiating european commission said a medical examination should only be conducted after an employer has decided on a job candidate .
whether a person is fit for the job " can be fulfilled through medical examination but without performing genetic screening , " wrote the 12-member european group on ethics in science and new technologies .
" thus , employers should not in general perform genetic screening nor ask employees to undergo tests .

after firing erratically at first , wolfsburg eventually got on target in the 27th minute after pablo thiam headed in a free kick . wolfsburg striker thomas brdaric came alive under the watchful eye of german national coach jürgen klinsmann , who came to see what the national payer could do at the club level .
although brdaric did n't score any of his team 's three goals , he proved instrumental in setting up chances and pushing his side forward . bildunterschrift : the two other wolfsburg goals came in rapid succession in the 39th and 42nd minutes by diego klimowicz and andres d 'alessandro respectively .

vfl wolfsburg returned to the summit with a 3-0 triumph over a befuddled vfl bochum . goals from georgian international alexander iaschvili -lrb- 35 -rrb- and mali star soumaila coulibaly -lrb- 90 -rrb- helped freiburg become the first team to defeat matthias sammer 's side in the 2004/05 campaign . martin stranzl was dismissed for stuttgart in the 69th minute to cap a miserable afternoon for the visitors who must get themselves fired up for werder bremen on wednesday . elsewhere on saturday , wolfsburg started out with a furious yet sloppy attack that bochum 's defense could never really manage to answer .
after firing erratically at first , wolfsburg eventually got on target in the 27th minute after pablo thiam headed in a free kick . wolfsburg striker thomas brdaric came alive under the watchful eye of german national coach jürgen klinsmann , who came to see what the national payer could do at the club level .
although brdaric did n't score any of his team 's three goals , he proved instrumental in setting up chances and pushing his side forward . bildunterschrift : the two other wolfsburg goals came in rapid succession in the 39th and 42nd minutes by diego klimowicz and andres d 'alessandro respectively .
in the second half things slowed down considerably , but bochum never put together an effective attack and the team 's defense remained wobbly to the end .
the referee had some questionable calls during the match and he disallowed a goal for either side . bayern pulls it out an injury-ravaged bayern munich needed a brace of late goals to down hansa rostock 2-0 on saturday in a heated match that saw both sides reduced to ten men .
with 82 minutes played bayern were locked 0-0 with relegation candidates rostock but french international willy sagnol , who wanted to leave the club in the last season , broke the resistance with a header and substitute mehmet scholl added a second three minutes later . the victory comes on the back of two straight defeats for bayern who move up to third with the three points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after failing to score in their previous two matches against schalke 04 and juventus , bayern hoped for a comfortable win against hansa but their lack of firepower was underlined once again .
deprived of injured trio michael ballack , ze roberto and lucio the bavarian titans lacked the killer instinct in front of goal with torsten frings and roy makaay both spurning good opportunities . bayern should have had a penalty in the 20th minute when david rasmussen brought down frings in the penalty area but their claims were turned down .
rasmussen must have thought the gods were smiling down on him but that hope vanished when referee lutz wagner dismissed him in the 37th minute for a fierce tackle . bayern could not breach the ten-men of rostock and in fact hansa drew strength from playing with one man fewer testing bayern custodian oliver kahn several times .
munich 's ghana defender sammy kuffour was then dismissed in the 75th minute for an ugly foul to even the numbers up and bizarrely it appeared to help bayern who scored seven minutes later through sagnol . the french defender latched onto a scholl cross to head home before the veteran midfielder capped a fine substitute appearance with a goal himself . hamburg beats dortmund at the bottom end of the bundesliga ladder thomas doll enjoyed his first game in charge of sv hamburg with his team recording a 2-0 triumph over borussia dortmund at the westfalen stadium .
hamburg move off bottom spot and out of the relegation zone leapfrogging 2002 champions dortmund who are now fifth from bottom . # b # dortmund 's westfalen stadium was a fortress last season but the gate looks to have been left open for this campaign with hamburg taking the spoils with a victory .
belgian international emile mpenza scored a ninth minute opener to the delight of new coach doll and david jarolim wrapped up the points in the 70th minute .
dortmund have won just one league match in nine outings and their dutch coach bert van marwijk is feeling the heat . elsewhere german champions werder bremen bounced back from successive league defeats to crush fc nuremberg 4-1 at the weserstadion .
werder followed up their midweek champions league victory over anderlecht with another three points thanks to goals from ivan klasnic -lrb- 13 -rrb- , frenchman johan micoud -lrb- 18 -rrb- , christian schulz -lrb- 75 -rrb- and fabian ernst -lrb- 88 -rrb- . last season 's double winners now lie fourth six points adrift of wolfsburg . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans open uefa cup in style it may be seen by some as the poorer relation to the champions league but for those german teams in the uefa cup , it is an opportunity to go for european glory .

according to the paper , president george w. bush 's flaw is his stubborn reluctance to admit mistakes and to adjust personnel and policy .
blind faith in military power as a tool for change has too often influenced his decision-making .
the paper conceded that kerry often fails to inspire , owing his rise more to opposition to bush than loyalty to his own cause .
but on balance , he is the better choice , the daily argued . " bush or kerry ? " wondered the french daily le journal de la haute-marne .
the paper said the ideological differences between the two candidates touch on an issue that affects the whole world , namely the role of the us on the global stage in an age where not the soviet union but international terrorism is the key challenge .
the paper said if the rest of the world could vote , kerry would win , but it 's the american public that is going to the polls .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because it 's our world and our future that are at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
while in the us the race between kerry and bush is almost a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation .
vienna 's kurier commented : " this time election observers will be present to make sure the voting punch cards have been properly perforated , that the reading equipment is working and that the newest electronic voting machines have not been tampered with . "
the election observers will be there to prevent the normal kinds of voting manipulation seen in developing democracies , the paper wrote , and then affirmed that yes , it was writing about the self-proclaimed home of democracy , the united states . " nevertheless the osce is sending 100 observers for the presidential elections to the immense displeasure of american bureacrats , " the paper wrote .
commenting on the weekend 's elections in the un administered province of kosovo , the abc paper from madrid said the poll showed that the multi-ethnic society in kosovo remains an illusion .
it warned that if neither the ethnic-albanians nor the serbian minority are prepared to make concessions the only solution for the province is to divide it up .
and the paper warned leaders from both sides that negotiations are better than losing everything with an outbreak of new violence .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung wrote that despite the fact that the elecitons were peaceful , kosovo has not come closer to an independent future .
there 's still too much division over who will rule the province , it said , and under these conditions it seems unrealsitic that discussions about kosovo 's independence can begin in earnest in nine months time .
belgrade 's daily paper danas wrote that serbian boycott of the elections in kosovo will presumably hurt the serbs themselves and create resentment among the international community .
the paper noted that " while the serbian dissatisfaction with the un adminsitration in the province is understandable - one has to remember the un is only in kosovo because beforehand the ethnic albanians were subjected to terror .

according to the paper , president george w. bush 's flaw is his stubborn reluctance to admit mistakes and to adjust personnel and policy .
blind faith in military power as a tool for change has too often influenced his decision-making .
the paper conceded that kerry often fails to inspire , owing his rise more to opposition to bush than loyalty to his own cause .
but on balance , he is the better choice , the daily argued . " bush or kerry ? " wondered the french daily le journal de la haute-marne .
the paper said the ideological differences between the two candidates touch on an issue that affects the whole world , namely the role of the us on the global stage in an age where not the soviet union but international terrorism is the key challenge .
the paper said if the rest of the world could vote , kerry would win , but it 's the american public that is going to the polls .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because it 's our world and our future that are at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
while in the us the race between kerry and bush is almost a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation .
vienna 's kurier commented : " this time election observers will be present to make sure the voting punch cards have been properly perforated , that the reading equipment is working and that the newest electronic voting machines have not been tampered with . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.10.2004 wolfsburg tops the table , stuttgart tastes defeat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's diego klimowicz celebrates his goal stuttgart fell to a 2-0 defeat at sc freiburg on sunday , missing the chance to take the top spot in the bundesliga .
vfl wolfsburg returned to the summit with a 3-0 triumph over a befuddled vfl bochum . goals from georgian international alexander iaschvili -lrb- 35 -rrb- and mali star soumaila coulibaly -lrb- 90 -rrb- helped freiburg become the first team to defeat matthias sammer 's side in the 2004/05 campaign . martin stranzl was dismissed for stuttgart in the 69th minute to cap a miserable afternoon for the visitors who must get themselves fired up for werder bremen on wednesday . elsewhere on saturday , wolfsburg started out with a furious yet sloppy attack that bochum 's defense could never really manage to answer .
after firing erratically at first , wolfsburg eventually got on target in the 27th minute after pablo thiam headed in a free kick . wolfsburg striker thomas brdaric came alive under the watchful eye of german national coach jürgen klinsmann , who came to see what the national payer could do at the club level .
although brdaric did n't score any of his team 's three goals , he proved instrumental in setting up chances and pushing his side forward . bildunterschrift : the two other wolfsburg goals came in rapid succession in the 39th and 42nd minutes by diego klimowicz and andres d 'alessandro respectively .
in the second half things slowed down considerably , but bochum never put together an effective attack and the team 's defense remained wobbly to the end .
the referee had some questionable calls during the match and he disallowed a goal for either side . bayern pulls it out an injury-ravaged bayern munich needed a brace of late goals to down hansa rostock 2-0 on saturday in a heated match that saw both sides reduced to ten men .
with 82 minutes played bayern were locked 0-0 with relegation candidates rostock but french international willy sagnol , who wanted to leave the club in the last season , broke the resistance with a header and substitute mehmet scholl added a second three minutes later . the victory comes on the back of two straight defeats for bayern who move up to third with the three points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after failing to score in their previous two matches against schalke 04 and juventus , bayern hoped for a comfortable win against hansa but their lack of firepower was underlined once again .
deprived of injured trio michael ballack , ze roberto and lucio the bavarian titans lacked the killer instinct in front of goal with torsten frings and roy makaay both spurning good opportunities . bayern should have had a penalty in the 20th minute when david rasmussen brought down frings in the penalty area but their claims were turned down .
rasmussen must have thought the gods were smiling down on him but that hope vanished when referee lutz wagner dismissed him in the 37th minute for a fierce tackle . bayern could not breach the ten-men of rostock and in fact hansa drew strength from playing with one man fewer testing bayern custodian oliver kahn several times .
munich 's ghana defender sammy kuffour was then dismissed in the 75th minute for an ugly foul to even the numbers up and bizarrely it appeared to help bayern who scored seven minutes later through sagnol . the french defender latched onto a scholl cross to head home before the veteran midfielder capped a fine substitute appearance with a goal himself . hamburg beats dortmund at the bottom end of the bundesliga ladder thomas doll enjoyed his first game in charge of sv hamburg with his team recording a 2-0 triumph over borussia dortmund at the westfalen stadium .
hamburg move off bottom spot and out of the relegation zone leapfrogging 2002 champions dortmund who are now fifth from bottom . # b # dortmund 's westfalen stadium was a fortress last season but the gate looks to have been left open for this campaign with hamburg taking the spoils with a victory .
belgian international emile mpenza scored a ninth minute opener to the delight of new coach doll and david jarolim wrapped up the points in the 70th minute .
dortmund have won just one league match in nine outings and their dutch coach bert van marwijk is feeling the heat . elsewhere german champions werder bremen bounced back from successive league defeats to crush fc nuremberg 4-1 at the weserstadion .
werder followed up their midweek champions league victory over anderlecht with another three points thanks to goals from ivan klasnic -lrb- 13 -rrb- , frenchman johan micoud -lrb- 18 -rrb- , christian schulz -lrb- 75 -rrb- and fabian ernst -lrb- 88 -rrb- . last season 's double winners now lie fourth six points adrift of wolfsburg . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans open uefa cup in style it may be seen by some as the poorer relation to the champions league but for those german teams in the uefa cup , it is an opportunity to go for european glory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.10.2004 iran to consider eu nuclear demands großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's top nuclear negotiator , hassan rowhani in a major strategy shift in the standoff over its nuclear program , iran said on monday it was ready to consider a european request to maintain a suspension on enriching uranium . the surprise comments by iran 's top nuclear negotiator marked a notable softening of tehran 's line towards a deal proposed last week by european countries , coming only a day after officials described the offer as " unbalanced . " " the european proposal for an unlimited suspension of uranium enrichment can be implemented , provided it does not contradict the islamic republic 's criteria , " iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani said on state television . three european states offered iran a deal on thursday under which tehran would receive valuable nuclear technology if it indefinitely suspended all uranium enrichment activities , a key stage in the nuclear fuel cycle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main part of the iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant the three countries - britain , france and germany - hope that if iran agrees to the deal it will be possible to stave off us demands for the nuclear issue to be sent before the un security council . the un 's nuclear watchdog - the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- - has given iran a nov .
25 deadline to allay concerns about its nuclear activities . suspension , not permanent halt ? rowhani made clear that in tehran 's eyes suspending uranium enrichment indefinitely was not the same as imposing a permanent halt on the practice . the term " unlimited does not mean permanent .
the europeans are talking about an unlimited -lrb- suspension -rrb- during the negotiations as it is forseen that long-term negotiations are starting with the europeans , " he said . " they say for example that if the negotiations last seven months , iran must respect the suspension .

25 deadline to allay concerns about its nuclear activities . suspension , not permanent halt ? rowhani made clear that in tehran 's eyes suspending uranium enrichment indefinitely was not the same as imposing a permanent halt on the practice . the term " unlimited does not mean permanent .
the europeans are talking about an unlimited -lrb- suspension -rrb- during the negotiations as it is forseen that long-term negotiations are starting with the europeans , " he said . " they say for example that if the negotiations last seven months , iran must respect the suspension .
we have always said that if the islamic republic accepts the suspension at whatever level , this will be a voluntary decision . " depending on the level of purification , enriched uranium can be used either as fuel for a civilian reactor or as the explosive core of a nuclear bomb .
iran strongly rejects us accusations it is seeking to manufacture atomic weapons . eu must recognize iranian sovereignty rowhani said tehran would continue cooperating with the international community but insisted that european nations must also recognise its right to civilian nuclear technology , according to the official irna news agency . " the europeans must accept that our red lines and national rights can not be violated , " he said . but his remarks appeared to strike a remarkably conciliatory tone and are likely to be welcomed by the three european heavyweights ahead of a meeting this week to hear the islamic republic 's response to the offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the bushehr nuclear power plant " iran 's patience to establish confidence with the world is great , " rowhani said . " it will not be exhausted at this early stage .
we will calmly continue to work at winning confidence .
we are going to carry out any necessary action to create confidence as we want to work with the world in the areas of politics , economy , society and culture and we do not want to worry the world unnecessarily . " rowhani said the european proposal recognized the rights of iran under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , notably " the right of iran to possess nuclear power stations . " " iran has as many rights as a european country under the npt , " he added . rowhani vowed that iran would continue cooperation with the iaea , " not to make the europeans happy but to prove the united states is lying when it says iran is trying to manufacture a nuclear weapon .

ethicists warn of dangerous terrain . in a future where a person 's chance at getting sick can be read from their genes , german politicians are discussing how much of that information a potential employer has a right to know .
advocates say the bill , which is still in discussion , clearly regulates how far employers are allowed to go in determining how genetically fit someone is for a job .
in jobs such as construction or public transportation , the law would allow for genetic testing for symptoms of color blindness among other things , according to a report in the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" it sets the conditions for the type of tests that can be conducted , " heinz putzhammer , a representative of the federation of german trade unions who worked on an early draft of the bill , told dw-world .
" i think we 're on the right track because the limiting of genetic tests is in any case necessary in order to protect the person or the private sphere . "
discrimination just a few steps away but some fear that track could nevertheless lead to genetic discrimination .
testing for symptoms of a disease is just a few short steps away from tests that would help employers determine whether to hire someone based on their chance of developing a genetic disease , says sue mayer , director of the uk organization genewatch .
" i think you have to put it together , " mayer told dw-world .
" i ca n't understand why you would want to do a genetic test for something symptomatic .
it would raise the question ' is this leading the way to something ? " '
in addition , scientists say the tests currently on the market to determine common genetic diseases , such as diabetes or hypertension , are bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dna lab : how accurate are genetic tests ? unreliable and probably never will be completely accurate .
the chance of developing a sickness , such as heart disease , has a little to do with the genes a person has inherited and a lot to do with outside factors , such as whether the person smokes or is overweight .
tests nowhere near ready " the main point with genetic tests is their interpretation .
for most of the genetic tests it 's hard to interpret results , " christian kubisch , a geneticist at the university of bonn , told dw-world .
" it 's nearly ridiculous for a company to say we will test you for these diseases ... these kinds of tests are not good at the moment and probably never will be . "
many countries have taken the step of outlawing access to genetic tests for employers and insurers outright .
beginning with france and norway in 1994 , australia , denmark , the netherlands and austria have passed laws that either severely limit or outright forbid the use of a person 's genetic information for anything other than medical or scientific purposes .
german opposition politicians said they want a similar law .
parliamentarian hubert hüppe , the deputy chair of the ethics and law in modern medicine commission in the german bundestag , said that the results of genetic tests , no matter what type , belong in no one 's hands but the person tested .
parliamentarian favors ban " i 'm in favor of a strict ban , " hüppe , a member of the conservative christian democratic union party , said in a dw-world interview .
" i 'm against any other party being able to use that information . "
the european union weighed in on the discussion in the summer of 2003 .
in a 17-page opinion , the policy-initiating european commission said a medical examination should only be conducted after an employer has decided on a job candidate .

but on the executive floor , plans are afoot to radically restructure the company .
the head of the general works council at opel , klaus franz , told the weekly welt am sonntag that the council was in direct talks with management in detroit and zürich focused on developing an entirely new company structure .
the ultimate objective is to establish a " european corporation , " or " société européene , " based in brussels , out of gm 's 100 european subsidiaries .
cheaper , simpler ?
franz stressed that he hoped this would be beneficial to both management and employees .
" the company 's new legal form would make gm 's complicated existing structures obsolete , " he told the newspaper .
" and the company would save money . "
he also pointed out that restructuring the company as a corporation would simplify business by making individual negotiations with the boards of gm 's subsidiaries , such as opel and saab , unnecessary .
" we could talk to our european management directly about decisions and problems , " he pointed out .
moving from zürich to brussels according to welt am sonntag , the proposal is fast taking shape .
the head of gm europe , fritz henderson , would take the reins of the new corporation , with gm europe 's president carl-peter forster acting as deputy .
the headquarters of a european corporation legally require a location in a eu member state .
for now , brussels is being tipped as the most likely site , replacing the current headquarters of gm 's 100 european subsidiaries in zürich .
opel would remain a brand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel logo if the plan goes ahead , opel would be subsumed into general motors europe and its existing legal form would be dissolved .
" the opel logo will remain on the cars and factories , " observed one high-ranking gm manager , who stressed this was crucial to retaining opel as a german brand .
employee status it still remains to be seen what status employees would have in the new corporation .
their participation in the board of control is based on the ratio of employee numbers in the individual companies joining together in the european holding .
over half of gm 's 63,000 employees in europe are contracted to opel , which means the opel works council can expect considerable influence within the new corporation .
the restructuring talks come weeks after gm unveiled plans to slash 12,000 jobs in europe - including 10 , 000 in germany alone - as part of a € 500 million -lrb- $ 625 million -rrb- cost-cutting drive . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de restructuring talks underway at opel and volkswagen crucial restructuring talks at german carmakers volkswagen and opel resumed thursday as management and unions of both companies attempted to hammer out the details of painful but necessary cost-cutting measures .

there is little doubt that some of the issues are controversial and are further complicated by widely differing positions held by member states . sweden wants wide-ranging european cooperation when it comes to asylum , but not in the field of border security .
germany , on the other hand , is in favor of the eu setting up teams of national border experts who could help member states monitor and protect their borders with non-eu neighbors .
these teams are envisaged turning into a european border guard at a later stage . with similar arguments expected on a host of other delicate issues , the meeting is likely to trigger some lively debates .
the border guard idea has been rejected before because some states believe protection of external borders is a national and not an eu matter . controversial proposal at the heart of the talks are the goals in interior and justice affairs that the european union has set in the so-called " hague program " and would like to see implemented by 2010 .
the hague plan is a follow-up of the program adopted at the tampere european council in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily in addition to the fight against terrorism and the coordination of police and legal forces to that purpose , the eu ministers are also expected to discuss german interior minister otto schily 's controversial proposal to set up detention camps in africa where asylum applications can be checked and processed outside the eu . though france and spain rejected the proposal during a meeting in florence recently , schily has indicated that he is determined to pursue the issue at the meeting in luxembourg . " if you stop illegal immigrants from setting sail on the mediterranean and bring them back to their point of origin , then you have to take care of their accommodation , " schily said recently .
" what else can you do ? they 're not just going to simply disappear . we have to think of something . " asylum , immigration to be tricky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese immigrants in the scilian harbor the talks on asylum and immigration are expected to be to be the toughest at this week 's meeting . uk home secretary david blunkett has insisted london will not accept a common european union asylum and immigration system , the times newspaper reported .
a uk home office spokesman was quoted by the daily telegraph as saying : " we wo n't sign up to an eu processing centre , any common border guard that would involve taking away our own border controls or any new eu consular service . "
the uk and denmark both have legal " opt-outs " from the eu justice policies written into the existing treaties . agreement on biometric passports talks on the issue of introducing biometric data in eu passports , also one of schily 's pet projects , are expected to be much smoother . the eu , together with non-member states norway , iceland and switzerland , wants to make european passports foolproof by the introduction of a digital photograph and later also allow for digital fingerprints .
experts within the eu are still working on the technology and are expected to conclude their work soon . " when it comes to selecting technology , we have to make sure that the chosen technology makes identification reliable , " schily said recently .
" on the other hand , we have to ensure that the control procedures wo n't unduly slow down or hinder border crossings . " ministers will also need to agree in luxembourg on a timeframe for the introduction of the biometric data .

ethicists warn of dangerous terrain . in a future where a person 's chance at getting sick can be read from their genes , german politicians are discussing how much of that information a potential employer has a right to know .
advocates say the bill , which is still in discussion , clearly regulates how far employers are allowed to go in determining how genetically fit someone is for a job .
in jobs such as construction or public transportation , the law would allow for genetic testing for symptoms of color blindness among other things , according to a report in the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" it sets the conditions for the type of tests that can be conducted , " heinz putzhammer , a representative of the federation of german trade unions who worked on an early draft of the bill , told dw-world .
" i think we 're on the right track because the limiting of genetic tests is in any case necessary in order to protect the person or the private sphere . "
discrimination just a few steps away but some fear that track could nevertheless lead to genetic discrimination .
testing for symptoms of a disease is just a few short steps away from tests that would help employers determine whether to hire someone based on their chance of developing a genetic disease , says sue mayer , director of the uk organization genewatch .
" i think you have to put it together , " mayer told dw-world .
" i ca n't understand why you would want to do a genetic test for something symptomatic .
it would raise the question ' is this leading the way to something ? " '
in addition , scientists say the tests currently on the market to determine common genetic diseases , such as diabetes or hypertension , are bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dna lab : how accurate are genetic tests ? unreliable and probably never will be completely accurate .
the chance of developing a sickness , such as heart disease , has a little to do with the genes a person has inherited and a lot to do with outside factors , such as whether the person smokes or is overweight .
tests nowhere near ready " the main point with genetic tests is their interpretation .
for most of the genetic tests it 's hard to interpret results , " christian kubisch , a geneticist at the university of bonn , told dw-world .
" it 's nearly ridiculous for a company to say we will test you for these diseases ... these kinds of tests are not good at the moment and probably never will be . "
many countries have taken the step of outlawing access to genetic tests for employers and insurers outright .
beginning with france and norway in 1994 , australia , denmark , the netherlands and austria have passed laws that either severely limit or outright forbid the use of a person 's genetic information for anything other than medical or scientific purposes .
german opposition politicians said they want a similar law .
parliamentarian hubert hüppe , the deputy chair of the ethics and law in modern medicine commission in the german bundestag , said that the results of genetic tests , no matter what type , belong in no one 's hands but the person tested .
parliamentarian favors ban " i 'm in favor of a strict ban , " hüppe , a member of the conservative christian democratic union party , said in a dw-world interview .
" i 'm against any other party being able to use that information . "
the european union weighed in on the discussion in the summer of 2003 .
in a 17-page opinion , the policy-initiating european commission said a medical examination should only be conducted after an employer has decided on a job candidate .

" following the american president 's decision , i am going to propose to the -lrb- european union 's -rrb- council of ministers to put an end to sanctions , " outgoing trade commissioner pascal lamy told a press conference in brussels on monday . on friday , us president bush signed legislation repealing the " foreign sales corporation -lrb- fsc -rrb- " and " extraterritorial income " provisions of the us tax code - a $ 5billion -lrb- € 4 billion -rrb- a year tax break for exporters . in january 2003 , the world trade organization ruled the old law flouted global trade rules by allowing us firms , operating through subsidiaries in offshore tax havens , to benefit from reduced export taxes . lamy credited with good ties to us " i am very pleased that -lrb- the united states -rrb- respected the wto decision before the end of this commission 's term , " lamy said six days before he is to leave his post after serving for five years . the new us law is aimed at painlessly resolving a six-year dispute over tax breaks for us companies with foreign operations such as microsoft , ibm , boeing and caterpillar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union trade commissioner pascal lamy , right , with us trade representative robert b. zoellick " this signature is good news .
it 's good news for the rule of law , and it 's good news for the world trade organization , " lamy said , while thanking us counterpart robert zoellick . lamy , who took up the post as eu trade commissioner in 1999 is credited with having cultivated good relations with his us counterpart .
though the goodwill has n't prevented zoellick and lamy from being at loggerheads in recent years over tax breaks for exporters , airplanes , genetically-modified meat , bananas , steel and a host of other things , it has ensured that the trade rows have n't spiraled out of control . washington 's willingness to lend a ear to eu complaints is also attributed to to lamy 's efforts to ensure that the eu consistently speaks with one voice when it came to transatlantic trade .
lamy is also seen as an untiring proponent of globalization , always stressing that the eu should open up its markets , particularly towards developing countries . concern over " grandfathering " clause the eu commission nonetheless voiced concern over a so-called " grandfathering " clause in the us reforms that maintain fsc provisions until the end of 2006 and " in certain cases for an unlimited period after that date . " as a result , the eu 's executive arm will ask for a new wto ruling on washington 's revised position . " we said we were willing to accept a transition period as long as everything ended at the end of that period , " lamy said .
" but we have some doubts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.10.2004 european press review : europe 's favorite with only 11 days until the us presidential elections , european papers are putting their bets on their favorite candidates , while others comment on elections that have just been held in kosovo . the financial times of london backed john kerry as the better choice for president of the united states .
according to the paper , president george w. bush 's flaw is his stubborn reluctance to admit mistakes and to adjust personnel and policy .
blind faith in military power as a tool for change has too often influenced his decision-making .
the paper conceded that kerry often fails to inspire , owing his rise more to opposition to bush than loyalty to his own cause .
but on balance , he is the better choice , the daily argued . " bush or kerry ? " wondered the french daily le journal de la haute-marne .
the paper said the ideological differences between the two candidates touch on an issue that affects the whole world , namely the role of the us on the global stage in an age where not the soviet union but international terrorism is the key challenge .
the paper said if the rest of the world could vote , kerry would win , but it 's the american public that is going to the polls .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because it 's our world and our future that are at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
while in the us the race between kerry and bush is almost a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation .
vienna 's kurier commented : " this time election observers will be present to make sure the voting punch cards have been properly perforated , that the reading equipment is working and that the newest electronic voting machines have not been tampered with . "
the election observers will be there to prevent the normal kinds of voting manipulation seen in developing democracies , the paper wrote , and then affirmed that yes , it was writing about the self-proclaimed home of democracy , the united states . " nevertheless the osce is sending 100 observers for the presidential elections to the immense displeasure of american bureacrats , " the paper wrote .
commenting on the weekend 's elections in the un administered province of kosovo , the abc paper from madrid said the poll showed that the multi-ethnic society in kosovo remains an illusion .
it warned that if neither the ethnic-albanians nor the serbian minority are prepared to make concessions the only solution for the province is to divide it up .
and the paper warned leaders from both sides that negotiations are better than losing everything with an outbreak of new violence .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung wrote that despite the fact that the elecitons were peaceful , kosovo has not come closer to an independent future .
there 's still too much division over who will rule the province , it said , and under these conditions it seems unrealsitic that discussions about kosovo 's independence can begin in earnest in nine months time .
belgrade 's daily paper danas wrote that serbian boycott of the elections in kosovo will presumably hurt the serbs themselves and create resentment among the international community .
the paper noted that " while the serbian dissatisfaction with the un adminsitration in the province is understandable - one has to remember the un is only in kosovo because beforehand the ethnic albanians were subjected to terror .

but on the executive floor , plans are afoot to radically restructure the company .
the head of the general works council at opel , klaus franz , told the weekly welt am sonntag that the council was in direct talks with management in detroit and zürich focused on developing an entirely new company structure .
the ultimate objective is to establish a " european corporation , " or " société européene , " based in brussels , out of gm 's 100 european subsidiaries .
cheaper , simpler ?
franz stressed that he hoped this would be beneficial to both management and employees .
" the company 's new legal form would make gm 's complicated existing structures obsolete , " he told the newspaper .
" and the company would save money . "
he also pointed out that restructuring the company as a corporation would simplify business by making individual negotiations with the boards of gm 's subsidiaries , such as opel and saab , unnecessary .
" we could talk to our european management directly about decisions and problems , " he pointed out .
moving from zürich to brussels according to welt am sonntag , the proposal is fast taking shape .
the head of gm europe , fritz henderson , would take the reins of the new corporation , with gm europe 's president carl-peter forster acting as deputy .
the headquarters of a european corporation legally require a location in a eu member state .
for now , brussels is being tipped as the most likely site , replacing the current headquarters of gm 's 100 european subsidiaries in zürich .
opel would remain a brand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel logo if the plan goes ahead , opel would be subsumed into general motors europe and its existing legal form would be dissolved .
" the opel logo will remain on the cars and factories , " observed one high-ranking gm manager , who stressed this was crucial to retaining opel as a german brand .
employee status it still remains to be seen what status employees would have in the new corporation .
their participation in the board of control is based on the ratio of employee numbers in the individual companies joining together in the european holding .
over half of gm 's 63,000 employees in europe are contracted to opel , which means the opel works council can expect considerable influence within the new corporation .
the restructuring talks come weeks after gm unveiled plans to slash 12,000 jobs in europe - including 10 , 000 in germany alone - as part of a € 500 million -lrb- $ 625 million -rrb- cost-cutting drive . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de restructuring talks underway at opel and volkswagen crucial restructuring talks at german carmakers volkswagen and opel resumed thursday as management and unions of both companies attempted to hammer out the details of painful but necessary cost-cutting measures .

there is little doubt that some of the issues are controversial and are further complicated by widely differing positions held by member states . sweden wants wide-ranging european cooperation when it comes to asylum , but not in the field of border security .
germany , on the other hand , is in favor of the eu setting up teams of national border experts who could help member states monitor and protect their borders with non-eu neighbors .
these teams are envisaged turning into a european border guard at a later stage . with similar arguments expected on a host of other delicate issues , the meeting is likely to trigger some lively debates .
the border guard idea has been rejected before because some states believe protection of external borders is a national and not an eu matter . controversial proposal at the heart of the talks are the goals in interior and justice affairs that the european union has set in the so-called " hague program " and would like to see implemented by 2010 .
the hague plan is a follow-up of the program adopted at the tampere european council in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily in addition to the fight against terrorism and the coordination of police and legal forces to that purpose , the eu ministers are also expected to discuss german interior minister otto schily 's controversial proposal to set up detention camps in africa where asylum applications can be checked and processed outside the eu . though france and spain rejected the proposal during a meeting in florence recently , schily has indicated that he is determined to pursue the issue at the meeting in luxembourg . " if you stop illegal immigrants from setting sail on the mediterranean and bring them back to their point of origin , then you have to take care of their accommodation , " schily said recently .
" what else can you do ? they 're not just going to simply disappear . we have to think of something . " asylum , immigration to be tricky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese immigrants in the scilian harbor the talks on asylum and immigration are expected to be to be the toughest at this week 's meeting . uk home secretary david blunkett has insisted london will not accept a common european union asylum and immigration system , the times newspaper reported .
a uk home office spokesman was quoted by the daily telegraph as saying : " we wo n't sign up to an eu processing centre , any common border guard that would involve taking away our own border controls or any new eu consular service . "
the uk and denmark both have legal " opt-outs " from the eu justice policies written into the existing treaties . agreement on biometric passports talks on the issue of introducing biometric data in eu passports , also one of schily 's pet projects , are expected to be much smoother . the eu , together with non-member states norway , iceland and switzerland , wants to make european passports foolproof by the introduction of a digital photograph and later also allow for digital fingerprints .
experts within the eu are still working on the technology and are expected to conclude their work soon . " when it comes to selecting technology , we have to make sure that the chosen technology makes identification reliable , " schily said recently .
" on the other hand , we have to ensure that the control procedures wo n't unduly slow down or hinder border crossings . " ministers will also need to agree in luxembourg on a timeframe for the introduction of the biometric data .
germany wants to start with a digital photograph by autumn next year . swiss to sign schengen treaty monday 's meeting of eu ministers will also see switzerland sign the schengen agreement and possibly agreement over a proposal to strengthen criminal law against ship pollution .
three countries , greece , cyprus and malta have been holding up the proposal , which would introduce a ceiling for the maximum fines and set jurisdiction for offences committed outside the territory of a member state . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , italy push ahead on asylum centers despite a lukewarm reception in the eu , berlin and rome intend to press ahead with a controversial plan to create holding asylum camps for european-bound migrants in north africa as a means to combat illegal immigration .

there is little doubt that some of the issues are controversial and are further complicated by widely differing positions held by member states . sweden wants wide-ranging european cooperation when it comes to asylum , but not in the field of border security .
germany , on the other hand , is in favor of the eu setting up teams of national border experts who could help member states monitor and protect their borders with non-eu neighbors .
these teams are envisaged turning into a european border guard at a later stage . with similar arguments expected on a host of other delicate issues , the meeting is likely to trigger some lively debates .
the border guard idea has been rejected before because some states believe protection of external borders is a national and not an eu matter . controversial proposal at the heart of the talks are the goals in interior and justice affairs that the european union has set in the so-called " hague program " and would like to see implemented by 2010 .
the hague plan is a follow-up of the program adopted at the tampere european council in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily in addition to the fight against terrorism and the coordination of police and legal forces to that purpose , the eu ministers are also expected to discuss german interior minister otto schily 's controversial proposal to set up detention camps in africa where asylum applications can be checked and processed outside the eu . though france and spain rejected the proposal during a meeting in florence recently , schily has indicated that he is determined to pursue the issue at the meeting in luxembourg . " if you stop illegal immigrants from setting sail on the mediterranean and bring them back to their point of origin , then you have to take care of their accommodation , " schily said recently .
" what else can you do ? they 're not just going to simply disappear . we have to think of something . " asylum , immigration to be tricky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese immigrants in the scilian harbor the talks on asylum and immigration are expected to be to be the toughest at this week 's meeting . uk home secretary david blunkett has insisted london will not accept a common european union asylum and immigration system , the times newspaper reported .
a uk home office spokesman was quoted by the daily telegraph as saying : " we wo n't sign up to an eu processing centre , any common border guard that would involve taking away our own border controls or any new eu consular service . "
the uk and denmark both have legal " opt-outs " from the eu justice policies written into the existing treaties . agreement on biometric passports talks on the issue of introducing biometric data in eu passports , also one of schily 's pet projects , are expected to be much smoother . the eu , together with non-member states norway , iceland and switzerland , wants to make european passports foolproof by the introduction of a digital photograph and later also allow for digital fingerprints .
experts within the eu are still working on the technology and are expected to conclude their work soon . " when it comes to selecting technology , we have to make sure that the chosen technology makes identification reliable , " schily said recently .
" on the other hand , we have to ensure that the control procedures wo n't unduly slow down or hinder border crossings . " ministers will also need to agree in luxembourg on a timeframe for the introduction of the biometric data .
germany wants to start with a digital photograph by autumn next year . swiss to sign schengen treaty monday 's meeting of eu ministers will also see switzerland sign the schengen agreement and possibly agreement over a proposal to strengthen criminal law against ship pollution .
three countries , greece , cyprus and malta have been holding up the proposal , which would introduce a ceiling for the maximum fines and set jurisdiction for offences committed outside the territory of a member state . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , italy push ahead on asylum centers despite a lukewarm reception in the eu , berlin and rome intend to press ahead with a controversial plan to create holding asylum camps for european-bound migrants in north africa as a means to combat illegal immigration .

" following the american president 's decision , i am going to propose to the -lrb- european union 's -rrb- council of ministers to put an end to sanctions , " outgoing trade commissioner pascal lamy told a press conference in brussels on monday . on friday , us president bush signed legislation repealing the " foreign sales corporation -lrb- fsc -rrb- " and " extraterritorial income " provisions of the us tax code - a $ 5billion -lrb- € 4 billion -rrb- a year tax break for exporters . in january 2003 , the world trade organization ruled the old law flouted global trade rules by allowing us firms , operating through subsidiaries in offshore tax havens , to benefit from reduced export taxes . lamy credited with good ties to us " i am very pleased that -lrb- the united states -rrb- respected the wto decision before the end of this commission 's term , " lamy said six days before he is to leave his post after serving for five years . the new us law is aimed at painlessly resolving a six-year dispute over tax breaks for us companies with foreign operations such as microsoft , ibm , boeing and caterpillar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union trade commissioner pascal lamy , right , with us trade representative robert b. zoellick " this signature is good news .
it 's good news for the rule of law , and it 's good news for the world trade organization , " lamy said , while thanking us counterpart robert zoellick . lamy , who took up the post as eu trade commissioner in 1999 is credited with having cultivated good relations with his us counterpart .
though the goodwill has n't prevented zoellick and lamy from being at loggerheads in recent years over tax breaks for exporters , airplanes , genetically-modified meat , bananas , steel and a host of other things , it has ensured that the trade rows have n't spiraled out of control . washington 's willingness to lend a ear to eu complaints is also attributed to to lamy 's efforts to ensure that the eu consistently speaks with one voice when it came to transatlantic trade .
lamy is also seen as an untiring proponent of globalization , always stressing that the eu should open up its markets , particularly towards developing countries . concern over " grandfathering " clause the eu commission nonetheless voiced concern over a so-called " grandfathering " clause in the us reforms that maintain fsc provisions until the end of 2006 and " in certain cases for an unlimited period after that date . " as a result , the eu 's executive arm will ask for a new wto ruling on washington 's revised position .

there is little doubt that some of the issues are controversial and are further complicated by widely differing positions held by member states . sweden wants wide-ranging european cooperation when it comes to asylum , but not in the field of border security .
germany , on the other hand , is in favor of the eu setting up teams of national border experts who could help member states monitor and protect their borders with non-eu neighbors .
these teams are envisaged turning into a european border guard at a later stage . with similar arguments expected on a host of other delicate issues , the meeting is likely to trigger some lively debates .
the border guard idea has been rejected before because some states believe protection of external borders is a national and not an eu matter . controversial proposal at the heart of the talks are the goals in interior and justice affairs that the european union has set in the so-called " hague program " and would like to see implemented by 2010 .
the hague plan is a follow-up of the program adopted at the tampere european council in 1999 .

experts within the eu are still working on the technology and are expected to conclude their work soon . " when it comes to selecting technology , we have to make sure that the chosen technology makes identification reliable , " schily said recently .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.10.2004 wolfsburg tops the table , stuttgart tastes defeat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's diego klimowicz celebrates his goal stuttgart fell to a 2-0 defeat at sc freiburg on sunday , missing the chance to take the top spot in the bundesliga .
vfl wolfsburg returned to the summit with a 3-0 triumph over a befuddled vfl bochum . goals from georgian international alexander iaschvili -lrb- 35 -rrb- and mali star soumaila coulibaly -lrb- 90 -rrb- helped freiburg become the first team to defeat matthias sammer 's side in the 2004/05 campaign . martin stranzl was dismissed for stuttgart in the 69th minute to cap a miserable afternoon for the visitors who must get themselves fired up for werder bremen on wednesday . elsewhere on saturday , wolfsburg started out with a furious yet sloppy attack that bochum 's defense could never really manage to answer .
after firing erratically at first , wolfsburg eventually got on target in the 27th minute after pablo thiam headed in a free kick . wolfsburg striker thomas brdaric came alive under the watchful eye of german national coach jürgen klinsmann , who came to see what the national payer could do at the club level .
although brdaric did n't score any of his team 's three goals , he proved instrumental in setting up chances and pushing his side forward . bildunterschrift : the two other wolfsburg goals came in rapid succession in the 39th and 42nd minutes by diego klimowicz and andres d 'alessandro respectively .
in the second half things slowed down considerably , but bochum never put together an effective attack and the team 's defense remained wobbly to the end .
the referee had some questionable calls during the match and he disallowed a goal for either side . bayern pulls it out an injury-ravaged bayern munich needed a brace of late goals to down hansa rostock 2-0 on saturday in a heated match that saw both sides reduced to ten men .

vfl wolfsburg returned to the summit with a 3-0 triumph over a befuddled vfl bochum . goals from georgian international alexander iaschvili -lrb- 35 -rrb- and mali star soumaila coulibaly -lrb- 90 -rrb- helped freiburg become the first team to defeat matthias sammer 's side in the 2004/05 campaign . martin stranzl was dismissed for stuttgart in the 69th minute to cap a miserable afternoon for the visitors who must get themselves fired up for werder bremen on wednesday . elsewhere on saturday , wolfsburg started out with a furious yet sloppy attack that bochum 's defense could never really manage to answer .
after firing erratically at first , wolfsburg eventually got on target in the 27th minute after pablo thiam headed in a free kick . wolfsburg striker thomas brdaric came alive under the watchful eye of german national coach jürgen klinsmann , who came to see what the national payer could do at the club level .

" after the success that the french and germans have had in building planes together , why should n't we succeed in building boats together , " sarkozy told the newspaper . asked whether he would be ready to see a new shipbuilder headquartered in germany , sarkozy pointed out that the european central bank is based in frankfurt , germany .

although brdaric did n't score any of his team 's three goals , he proved instrumental in setting up chances and pushing his side forward . bildunterschrift : the two other wolfsburg goals came in rapid succession in the 39th and 42nd minutes by diego klimowicz and andres d 'alessandro respectively .

rasmussen must have thought the gods were smiling down on him but that hope vanished when referee lutz wagner dismissed him in the 37th minute for a fierce tackle . bayern could not breach the ten-men of rostock and in fact hansa drew strength from playing with one man fewer testing bayern custodian oliver kahn several times .
munich 's ghana defender sammy kuffour was then dismissed in the 75th minute for an ugly foul to even the numbers up and bizarrely it appeared to help bayern who scored seven minutes later through sagnol . the french defender latched onto a scholl cross to head home before the veteran midfielder capped a fine substitute appearance with a goal himself . hamburg beats dortmund at the bottom end of the bundesliga ladder thomas doll enjoyed his first game in charge of sv hamburg with his team recording a 2-0 triumph over borussia dortmund at the westfalen stadium .

but on the executive floor , plans are afoot to radically restructure the company .
the head of the general works council at opel , klaus franz , told the weekly welt am sonntag that the council was in direct talks with management in detroit and zürich focused on developing an entirely new company structure .
the ultimate objective is to establish a " european corporation , " or " société européene , " based in brussels , out of gm 's 100 european subsidiaries .

franz stressed that he hoped this would be beneficial to both management and employees .
" the company 's new legal form would make gm 's complicated existing structures obsolete , " he told the newspaper .
" and the company would save money . "
he also pointed out that restructuring the company as a corporation would simplify business by making individual negotiations with the boards of gm 's subsidiaries , such as opel and saab , unnecessary .

" after the success that the french and germans have had in building planes together , why should n't we succeed in building boats together , " sarkozy told the newspaper . asked whether he would be ready to see a new shipbuilder headquartered in germany , sarkozy pointed out that the european central bank is based in frankfurt , germany . " have i ever said that 's unacceptable , " he asked . germans : time is not right but german government officials said on monday that the requirements to set up a binational shipbuilding giant will not be met for a long time . the french finance minister had recently called for tighter economic coordination with germany . " we do n't have the choice , " he said , adding that france and germany should synchronize their national budgets and share economic data and forecasts .
" the price of oil is the same in germany as it is in france . " sarkozy , who steps down as finance minister next month to run for leader of france 's ruling party - a step seen by many as a move toward candidacy for the presidency in 2007 , also signaled his determination to put franco-german economic ties back on track before he goes . sanofi-aventis deal angers berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aventis and sanofi merged at the expense of shareholders .
sarkozy plans to discuss his controversial april intervention in the takeover battle for franco-german drug company aventis when he exerted his power to broker a sanofi-aventis merger , depriving aventis shareholders of a potentially higher bid from switzerland 's novartis .
the merger created the world 's third largest drugs company . berlin was angered by the intervention with chancellor schröder expressing his disapproval . " politics has no role to play in companies ' decision-making processes , " schröder said at the time . siemens plans thwarted by sarkozy shortly afterwards , the german government was again riled by sarkozy 's move to thwart the designs of german engineering group siemens on its troubled french rival alstom which prompted criticism of what schröder called sarkozy 's " nationalistic " policies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens was barred from bidding for alstom subsidiaries .
schröder has voiced concern in the last few months that france 's current industrial policy is undermining the franco-german relationship . the german chancellor told the business daily financial times deutschland in may that he found it " annoying " that sarkozy refused to allow german engineering giant siemens to participate in the takeover of alstom subsidiaries . franco-german relations strained " regarding almstom , i discover sometimes - not by the -lrb- french -rrb- president - but among members of the government , certain statements that merit reconsideration , " schröder told french daily le figaro in an interview published soon after . " everyone can understand that a finance minister is thinking about the next election , but it is a good idea to think about the day after the vote too , " the german chancellor added in a thinly veiled dig at sarkozy . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de all or nothing for alstom ?
troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .

according to the paper , president george w. bush 's flaw is his stubborn reluctance to admit mistakes and to adjust personnel and policy .
blind faith in military power as a tool for change has too often influenced his decision-making .
the paper conceded that kerry often fails to inspire , owing his rise more to opposition to bush than loyalty to his own cause .
but on balance , he is the better choice , the daily argued . " bush or kerry ? " wondered the french daily le journal de la haute-marne .
the paper said the ideological differences between the two candidates touch on an issue that affects the whole world , namely the role of the us on the global stage in an age where not the soviet union but international terrorism is the key challenge .
the paper said if the rest of the world could vote , kerry would win , but it 's the american public that is going to the polls .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because it 's our world and our future that are at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
while in the us the race between kerry and bush is almost a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation .
vienna 's kurier commented : " this time election observers will be present to make sure the voting punch cards have been properly perforated , that the reading equipment is working and that the newest electronic voting machines have not been tampered with . "
the election observers will be there to prevent the normal kinds of voting manipulation seen in developing democracies , the paper wrote , and then affirmed that yes , it was writing about the self-proclaimed home of democracy , the united states . " nevertheless the osce is sending 100 observers for the presidential elections to the immense displeasure of american bureacrats , " the paper wrote .
commenting on the weekend 's elections in the un administered province of kosovo , the abc paper from madrid said the poll showed that the multi-ethnic society in kosovo remains an illusion .
it warned that if neither the ethnic-albanians nor the serbian minority are prepared to make concessions the only solution for the province is to divide it up .
and the paper warned leaders from both sides that negotiations are better than losing everything with an outbreak of new violence .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung wrote that despite the fact that the elecitons were peaceful , kosovo has not come closer to an independent future .
there 's still too much division over who will rule the province , it said , and under these conditions it seems unrealsitic that discussions about kosovo 's independence can begin in earnest in nine months time .
belgrade 's daily paper danas wrote that serbian boycott of the elections in kosovo will presumably hurt the serbs themselves and create resentment among the international community .
the paper noted that " while the serbian dissatisfaction with the un adminsitration in the province is understandable - one has to remember the un is only in kosovo because beforehand the ethnic albanians were subjected to terror .

the paper said if the rest of the world could vote , kerry would win , but it 's the american public that is going to the polls .

" " the european proposal for an unlimited suspension of uranium enrichment can be implemented , provided it does not contradict the islamic republic 's criteria , " iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rowhani said on state television . three european states offered iran a deal on thursday under which tehran would receive valuable nuclear technology if it indefinitely suspended all uranium enrichment activities , a key stage in the nuclear fuel cycle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : main part of the iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant the three countries - britain , france and germany - hope that if iran agrees to the deal it will be possible to stave off us demands for the nuclear issue to be sent before the un security council . the un 's nuclear watchdog - the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- - has given iran a nov .
25 deadline to allay concerns about its nuclear activities . suspension , not permanent halt ? rowhani made clear that in tehran 's eyes suspending uranium enrichment indefinitely was not the same as imposing a permanent halt on the practice . the term " unlimited does not mean permanent .
the europeans are talking about an unlimited -lrb- suspension -rrb- during the negotiations as it is forseen that long-term negotiations are starting with the europeans , " he said . " they say for example that if the negotiations last seven months , iran must respect the suspension .
we have always said that if the islamic republic accepts the suspension at whatever level , this will be a voluntary decision . " depending on the level of purification , enriched uranium can be used either as fuel for a civilian reactor or as the explosive core of a nuclear bomb .
iran strongly rejects us accusations it is seeking to manufacture atomic weapons . eu must recognize iranian sovereignty rowhani said tehran would continue cooperating with the international community but insisted that european nations must also recognise its right to civilian nuclear technology , according to the official irna news agency . " the europeans must accept that our red lines and national rights can not be violated , " he said . but his remarks appeared to strike a remarkably conciliatory tone and are likely to be welcomed by the three european heavyweights ahead of a meeting this week to hear the islamic republic 's response to the offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the bushehr nuclear power plant " iran 's patience to establish confidence with the world is great , " rowhani said . " it will not be exhausted at this early stage .
we will calmly continue to work at winning confidence .
we are going to carry out any necessary action to create confidence as we want to work with the world in the areas of politics , economy , society and culture and we do not want to worry the world unnecessarily .

ethicists warn of dangerous terrain . in a future where a person 's chance at getting sick can be read from their genes , german politicians are discussing how much of that information a potential employer has a right to know .
advocates say the bill , which is still in discussion , clearly regulates how far employers are allowed to go in determining how genetically fit someone is for a job .
in jobs such as construction or public transportation , the law would allow for genetic testing for symptoms of color blindness among other things , according to a report in the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" it sets the conditions for the type of tests that can be conducted , " heinz putzhammer , a representative of the federation of german trade unions who worked on an early draft of the bill , told dw-world .
" i think we 're on the right track because the limiting of genetic tests is in any case necessary in order to protect the person or the private sphere . "
discrimination just a few steps away but some fear that track could nevertheless lead to genetic discrimination .
testing for symptoms of a disease is just a few short steps away from tests that would help employers determine whether to hire someone based on their chance of developing a genetic disease , says sue mayer , director of the uk organization genewatch .
" i think you have to put it together , " mayer told dw-world .
" i ca n't understand why you would want to do a genetic test for something symptomatic .
it would raise the question ' is this leading the way to something ? " '
in addition , scientists say the tests currently on the market to determine common genetic diseases , such as diabetes or hypertension , are bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dna lab : how accurate are genetic tests ? unreliable and probably never will be completely accurate .
the chance of developing a sickness , such as heart disease , has a little to do with the genes a person has inherited and a lot to do with outside factors , such as whether the person smokes or is overweight .
tests nowhere near ready " the main point with genetic tests is their interpretation .
for most of the genetic tests it 's hard to interpret results , " christian kubisch , a geneticist at the university of bonn , told dw-world .
" it 's nearly ridiculous for a company to say we will test you for these diseases ... these kinds of tests are not good at the moment and probably never will be . "
many countries have taken the step of outlawing access to genetic tests for employers and insurers outright .
beginning with france and norway in 1994 , australia , denmark , the netherlands and austria have passed laws that either severely limit or outright forbid the use of a person 's genetic information for anything other than medical or scientific purposes .
german opposition politicians said they want a similar law .
parliamentarian hubert hüppe , the deputy chair of the ethics and law in modern medicine commission in the german bundestag , said that the results of genetic tests , no matter what type , belong in no one 's hands but the person tested .
parliamentarian favors ban " i 'm in favor of a strict ban , " hüppe , a member of the conservative christian democratic union party , said in a dw-world interview .
" i 'm against any other party being able to use that information . "

ethicists warn of dangerous terrain . in a future where a person 's chance at getting sick can be read from their genes , german politicians are discussing how much of that information a potential employer has a right to know .
advocates say the bill , which is still in discussion , clearly regulates how far employers are allowed to go in determining how genetically fit someone is for a job .
in jobs such as construction or public transportation , the law would allow for genetic testing for symptoms of color blindness among other things , according to a report in the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" it sets the conditions for the type of tests that can be conducted , " heinz putzhammer , a representative of the federation of german trade unions who worked on an early draft of the bill , told dw-world .
" i think we 're on the right track because the limiting of genetic tests is in any case necessary in order to protect the person or the private sphere . "
discrimination just a few steps away but some fear that track could nevertheless lead to genetic discrimination .
testing for symptoms of a disease is just a few short steps away from tests that would help employers determine whether to hire someone based on their chance of developing a genetic disease , says sue mayer , director of the uk organization genewatch .
" i think you have to put it together , " mayer told dw-world .
" i ca n't understand why you would want to do a genetic test for something symptomatic .
it would raise the question ' is this leading the way to something ? " '
in addition , scientists say the tests currently on the market to determine common genetic diseases , such as diabetes or hypertension , are bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dna lab : how accurate are genetic tests ? unreliable and probably never will be completely accurate .
the chance of developing a sickness , such as heart disease , has a little to do with the genes a person has inherited and a lot to do with outside factors , such as whether the person smokes or is overweight .
tests nowhere near ready " the main point with genetic tests is their interpretation .
for most of the genetic tests it 's hard to interpret results , " christian kubisch , a geneticist at the university of bonn , told dw-world .
" it 's nearly ridiculous for a company to say we will test you for these diseases ... these kinds of tests are not good at the moment and probably never will be . "
many countries have taken the step of outlawing access to genetic tests for employers and insurers outright .
beginning with france and norway in 1994 , australia , denmark , the netherlands and austria have passed laws that either severely limit or outright forbid the use of a person 's genetic information for anything other than medical or scientific purposes .
german opposition politicians said they want a similar law .
parliamentarian hubert hüppe , the deputy chair of the ethics and law in modern medicine commission in the german bundestag , said that the results of genetic tests , no matter what type , belong in no one 's hands but the person tested .
parliamentarian favors ban " i 'm in favor of a strict ban , " hüppe , a member of the conservative christian democratic union party , said in a dw-world interview .
" i 'm against any other party being able to use that information . "
the european union weighed in on the discussion in the summer of 2003 .
in a 17-page opinion , the policy-initiating european commission said a medical examination should only be conducted after an employer has decided on a job candidate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.10.2004 is the end nigh for opel ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailing german car maker opel might cut a third of its workforce as restructuring talks continue , opel 's works council and us parent company general motors are considering a possible merger of gm 's european subsidiaries . since 5:45 am local time monday , it 's once again business as usual at the opel plant in rüsselsheim .
but on the executive floor , plans are afoot to radically restructure the company .
the head of the general works council at opel , klaus franz , told the weekly welt am sonntag that the council was in direct talks with management in detroit and zürich focused on developing an entirely new company structure .
the ultimate objective is to establish a " european corporation , " or " société européene , " based in brussels , out of gm 's 100 european subsidiaries .
cheaper , simpler ?
franz stressed that he hoped this would be beneficial to both management and employees .
" the company 's new legal form would make gm 's complicated existing structures obsolete , " he told the newspaper .
" and the company would save money . "
he also pointed out that restructuring the company as a corporation would simplify business by making individual negotiations with the boards of gm 's subsidiaries , such as opel and saab , unnecessary .
" we could talk to our european management directly about decisions and problems , " he pointed out .
moving from zürich to brussels according to welt am sonntag , the proposal is fast taking shape .
the head of gm europe , fritz henderson , would take the reins of the new corporation , with gm europe 's president carl-peter forster acting as deputy .

but on the executive floor , plans are afoot to radically restructure the company .
the head of the general works council at opel , klaus franz , told the weekly welt am sonntag that the council was in direct talks with management in detroit and zürich focused on developing an entirely new company structure .
the ultimate objective is to establish a " european corporation , " or " société européene , " based in brussels , out of gm 's 100 european subsidiaries .
cheaper , simpler ?
franz stressed that he hoped this would be beneficial to both management and employees .
" the company 's new legal form would make gm 's complicated existing structures obsolete , " he told the newspaper .
" and the company would save money . "
he also pointed out that restructuring the company as a corporation would simplify business by making individual negotiations with the boards of gm 's subsidiaries , such as opel and saab , unnecessary .
" we could talk to our european management directly about decisions and problems , " he pointed out .
moving from zürich to brussels according to welt am sonntag , the proposal is fast taking shape .
the head of gm europe , fritz henderson , would take the reins of the new corporation , with gm europe 's president carl-peter forster acting as deputy .

" following the american president 's decision , i am going to propose to the -lrb- european union 's -rrb- council of ministers to put an end to sanctions , " outgoing trade commissioner pascal lamy told a press conference in brussels on monday . on friday , us president bush signed legislation repealing the " foreign sales corporation -lrb- fsc -rrb- " and " extraterritorial income " provisions of the us tax code - a $ 5billion -lrb- € 4 billion -rrb- a year tax break for exporters . in january 2003 , the world trade organization ruled the old law flouted global trade rules by allowing us firms , operating through subsidiaries in offshore tax havens , to benefit from reduced export taxes . lamy credited with good ties to us " i am very pleased that -lrb- the united states -rrb- respected the wto decision before the end of this commission 's term , " lamy said six days before he is to leave his post after serving for five years . the new us law is aimed at painlessly resolving a six-year dispute over tax breaks for us companies with foreign operations such as microsoft , ibm , boeing and caterpillar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union trade commissioner pascal lamy , right , with us trade representative robert b. zoellick " this signature is good news .
it 's good news for the rule of law , and it 's good news for the world trade organization , " lamy said , while thanking us counterpart robert zoellick . lamy , who took up the post as eu trade commissioner in 1999 is credited with having cultivated good relations with his us counterpart .
though the goodwill has n't prevented zoellick and lamy from being at loggerheads in recent years over tax breaks for exporters , airplanes , genetically-modified meat , bananas , steel and a host of other things , it has ensured that the trade rows have n't spiraled out of control . washington 's willingness to lend a ear to eu complaints is also attributed to to lamy 's efforts to ensure that the eu consistently speaks with one voice when it came to transatlantic trade .
lamy is also seen as an untiring proponent of globalization , always stressing that the eu should open up its markets , particularly towards developing countries . concern over " grandfathering " clause the eu commission nonetheless voiced concern over a so-called " grandfathering " clause in the us reforms that maintain fsc provisions until the end of 2006 and " in certain cases for an unlimited period after that date . " as a result , the eu 's executive arm will ask for a new wto ruling on washington 's revised position . " we said we were willing to accept a transition period as long as everything ended at the end of that period , " lamy said .
" but we have some doubts .

apparently , a new type of gherkin beer is going down a treat in berlin . in 2003 's bittersweet box office hit goodbye lenin ! , set in east berlin in 1989 , actor daniel brühl sets out to convince his ailing mother , a faithful party member who missed the fall of the berlin wall after she went into a coma , that her beloved east germany is still alive and well .
part of the deception involves keeping her regularly supplied with " spreewald-gurken , " or gherkins .
the trouble is , when the stalinist state collapsed , her preferred brand went with it . ingeniously , brühl buys the standard dutch gherkins stocked in west german supermarkets and repackages them as his mother 's favourite pickle .
international audiences might not have identified with this particular communist-era culinary foible , but it seems that she was n't the only east german with a fondness for spreewald-gurken .
goodbye lenin ! ushered in a wave of " ostalgie , " nostalgia for life in the days of soviet rule , that still shows no signs of letting up .

there is little doubt that some of the issues are controversial and are further complicated by widely differing positions held by member states . sweden wants wide-ranging european cooperation when it comes to asylum , but not in the field of border security .
germany , on the other hand , is in favor of the eu setting up teams of national border experts who could help member states monitor and protect their borders with non-eu neighbors .
these teams are envisaged turning into a european border guard at a later stage . with similar arguments expected on a host of other delicate issues , the meeting is likely to trigger some lively debates .
the border guard idea has been rejected before because some states believe protection of external borders is a national and not an eu matter . controversial proposal at the heart of the talks are the goals in interior and justice affairs that the european union has set in the so-called " hague program " and would like to see implemented by 2010 .
the hague plan is a follow-up of the program adopted at the tampere european council in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily in addition to the fight against terrorism and the coordination of police and legal forces to that purpose , the eu ministers are also expected to discuss german interior minister otto schily 's controversial proposal to set up detention camps in africa where asylum applications can be checked and processed outside the eu . though france and spain rejected the proposal during a meeting in florence recently , schily has indicated that he is determined to pursue the issue at the meeting in luxembourg . " if you stop illegal immigrants from setting sail on the mediterranean and bring them back to their point of origin , then you have to take care of their accommodation , " schily said recently .

a uk home office spokesman was quoted by the daily telegraph as saying : " we wo n't sign up to an eu processing centre , any common border guard that would involve taking away our own border controls or any new eu consular service . "
the uk and denmark both have legal " opt-outs " from the eu justice policies written into the existing treaties . agreement on biometric passports talks on the issue of introducing biometric data in eu passports , also one of schily 's pet projects , are expected to be much smoother . the eu , together with non-member states norway , iceland and switzerland , wants to make european passports foolproof by the introduction of a digital photograph and later also allow for digital fingerprints .
experts within the eu are still working on the technology and are expected to conclude their work soon . " when it comes to selecting technology , we have to make sure that the chosen technology makes identification reliable , " schily said recently .
" on the other hand , we have to ensure that the control procedures wo n't unduly slow down or hinder border crossings . " ministers will also need to agree in luxembourg on a timeframe for the introduction of the biometric data .
germany wants to start with a digital photograph by autumn next year . swiss to sign schengen treaty monday 's meeting of eu ministers will also see switzerland sign the schengen agreement and possibly agreement over a proposal to strengthen criminal law against ship pollution .

but on the executive floor , plans are afoot to radically restructure the company .
the head of the general works council at opel , klaus franz , told the weekly welt am sonntag that the council was in direct talks with management in detroit and zürich focused on developing an entirely new company structure .
the ultimate objective is to establish a " european corporation , " or " société européene , " based in brussels , out of gm 's 100 european subsidiaries .
cheaper , simpler ?
franz stressed that he hoped this would be beneficial to both management and employees .
" the company 's new legal form would make gm 's complicated existing structures obsolete , " he told the newspaper .
" and the company would save money . "
he also pointed out that restructuring the company as a corporation would simplify business by making individual negotiations with the boards of gm 's subsidiaries , such as opel and saab , unnecessary .
" we could talk to our european management directly about decisions and problems , " he pointed out .
moving from zürich to brussels according to welt am sonntag , the proposal is fast taking shape .
the head of gm europe , fritz henderson , would take the reins of the new corporation , with gm europe 's president carl-peter forster acting as deputy .
the headquarters of a european corporation legally require a location in a eu member state .
for now , brussels is being tipped as the most likely site , replacing the current headquarters of gm 's 100 european subsidiaries in zürich .
opel would remain a brand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opel logo if the plan goes ahead , opel would be subsumed into general motors europe and its existing legal form would be dissolved .
" the opel logo will remain on the cars and factories , " observed one high-ranking gm manager , who stressed this was crucial to retaining opel as a german brand .
employee status it still remains to be seen what status employees would have in the new corporation .
their participation in the board of control is based on the ratio of employee numbers in the individual companies joining together in the european holding .
over half of gm 's 63,000 employees in europe are contracted to opel , which means the opel works council can expect considerable influence within the new corporation .
the restructuring talks come weeks after gm unveiled plans to slash 12,000 jobs in europe - including 10 , 000 in germany alone - as part of a € 500 million -lrb- $ 625 million -rrb- cost-cutting drive . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de restructuring talks underway at opel and volkswagen crucial restructuring talks at german carmakers volkswagen and opel resumed thursday as management and unions of both companies attempted to hammer out the details of painful but necessary cost-cutting measures .

according to the paper , president george w. bush 's flaw is his stubborn reluctance to admit mistakes and to adjust personnel and policy .
blind faith in military power as a tool for change has too often influenced his decision-making .
the paper conceded that kerry often fails to inspire , owing his rise more to opposition to bush than loyalty to his own cause .
but on balance , he is the better choice , the daily argued . " bush or kerry ? " wondered the french daily le journal de la haute-marne .
the paper said the ideological differences between the two candidates touch on an issue that affects the whole world , namely the role of the us on the global stage in an age where not the soviet union but international terrorism is the key challenge .
the paper said if the rest of the world could vote , kerry would win , but it 's the american public that is going to the polls .
the danish paper information said the whole world should have the right to cast a vote in the us presidential elections , because it 's our world and our future that are at stake when the world 's most powerful leader is elected .
while in the us the race between kerry and bush is almost a dead heat , three quarters of voters in other countries would choose kerry without hesitation .
vienna 's kurier commented : " this time election observers will be present to make sure the voting punch cards have been properly perforated , that the reading equipment is working and that the newest electronic voting machines have not been tampered with . "
the election observers will be there to prevent the normal kinds of voting manipulation seen in developing democracies , the paper wrote , and then affirmed that yes , it was writing about the self-proclaimed home of democracy , the united states . " nevertheless the osce is sending 100 observers for the presidential elections to the immense displeasure of american bureacrats , " the paper wrote .
commenting on the weekend 's elections in the un administered province of kosovo , the abc paper from madrid said the poll showed that the multi-ethnic society in kosovo remains an illusion .
it warned that if neither the ethnic-albanians nor the serbian minority are prepared to make concessions the only solution for the province is to divide it up .
and the paper warned leaders from both sides that negotiations are better than losing everything with an outbreak of new violence .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung wrote that despite the fact that the elecitons were peaceful , kosovo has not come closer to an independent future .
there 's still too much division over who will rule the province , it said , and under these conditions it seems unrealsitic that discussions about kosovo 's independence can begin in earnest in nine months time .
belgrade 's daily paper danas wrote that serbian boycott of the elections in kosovo will presumably hurt the serbs themselves and create resentment among the international community .
the paper noted that " while the serbian dissatisfaction with the un adminsitration in the province is understandable - one has to remember the un is only in kosovo because beforehand the ethnic albanians were subjected to terror .

but on the executive floor , plans are afoot to radically restructure the company .
the head of the general works council at opel , klaus franz , told the weekly welt am sonntag that the council was in direct talks with management in detroit and zürich focused on developing an entirely new company structure .
the ultimate objective is to establish a " european corporation , " or " société européene , " based in brussels , out of gm 's 100 european subsidiaries .
cheaper , simpler ?
franz stressed that he hoped this would be beneficial to both management and employees .
" the company 's new legal form would make gm 's complicated existing structures obsolete , " he told the newspaper .
" and the company would save money . "
he also pointed out that restructuring the company as a corporation would simplify business by making individual negotiations with the boards of gm 's subsidiaries , such as opel and saab , unnecessary .

the royal victoria hospital has appealed for people to stay away from fireworks over the halloween period .
researchers at the belfast hospital said results of a 12-year study reinforced the need for strict legislation .
the research was carried out by the hospital 's eye department and particularly looked at injuries among people aged under 20 .
the study period covered the six years before and after the lifting of the firework ban in northern ireland in 1996 .
the majority of injuries from fireworks occur when they are mishandled , explode prematurely or are used as missiles dr angela knox rvh dr angela knox , specialist registrar in ophthalmology at the rvh , said there was almost a three-fold increase in serious eye injuries treated at the hospital after the lifting of the ban .
the rvh said it was unlicensed fireworks which continued to cause injury as they were likely to be more dangerous than legal fireworks .
" fireworks obtained without a licence are unlikely to have passed strict safety standards and may contain little or no instructions for use and are more likely to misfire , " said dr knox , who was one of the research team .
" the majority of injuries from fireworks occur when they are mishandled , explode prematurely or are used as missiles . "
the fireworks ban was lifted in northern ireland in 1996 following the paramilitary ceasefires .
however , in 2002 new regulations meant people had to apply for a licence and pay to hold even the smallest fireworks display .
the rvh researchers are carrying out a study to compare whether the tougher rules in northern ireland can reduce the number of firework-related eye injuries .

the fireworks ban was lifted in northern ireland in 1996 following the paramilitary ceasefires .

the original stones line-up came together in public for the last time on 10 and 11 december 1968 to film the rock and roll circus .
accompanied by fellow rock luminaries such as the who , john lennon , eric clapton and jethro tull , they recorded five key tracks from one of the most creative periods of their career .
the show , filmed at a north london tv studio mocked up to look like a big top , was originally conceived as a bbc tv special .
but it never aired .
stones setlist jumping jack flash parachute woman no expectations sympathy for the devil salt of the earth the stones were reputedly dissatisfied with their performance , and the footage remained in the vaults until it finally appeared on video in the mid-1990s .
now cleaned up for dvd , it makes for a fascinating document of the rock aristocracy in late 1960s london , as the wider world was coming to terms with student riots and the vietnam war .
the group called on friends like lennon and clapton to perform alongside them as mick jagger , dressed in ringmaster 's costume , introduced some of the acts .
an excitable audience was asked to don brightly-coloured capes to create a carnival atmosphere , as the musicians played through the night until dawn .
the stones showcased tracks from their new lp beggars banquet , while lennon fronted a mini-supergroup to play yer blues from the beatles ' recently-released white album .
the impression given is that of an informal , relaxed gathering of musical pals , who also just happened to be some of the world 's biggest rock stars .
the almost nonchalant coming together of such major artists in the heady atmosphere of swinging london gives the film a uniquely evocative quality .
stones support jethro tull the who marianne faithfull taj mahal the dirty mac -lrb- john lennon with eric clapton , keith richards and mitch mitchell -rrb- david stark was a 15-year-old beatles fanatic who won two tickets to the show through a prize draw in nme .
mr stark , who now runs a music publishing newsletter , recalled : " i had to go to the loo and i walked past four guys having a chat - it was john lennon , mick jagger , pete townshend and eric clapton !
" everything was much more accessible then .
it was like a little club .
it was an awesome experience , a dream come true . "
in retrospect , watching the stones flow effortlessly through some of their best material , it seems they may have been over-critical of their own performance .
they reputedly felt overshadowed by the who 's incendiary display , while guitarist and founder brian jones ' drug use was causing internal frictions as his health deteriorated .
in the footage , jones ' demeanour and body language clearly point to his decline .
he was sacked a few months later , and on 3 july 1969 he was found dead in his swimming pool , aged 27 .
yet if anything , the concert shows the stones at the peak of their powers , loose yet focused , with jagger at his most youthfully supple and charismatic .
daryl easlea , head of catalogue publicity at universal , said it was time to reappraise the show .
he said : " i do n't think the stones performance is as bad as some people have suggested .
you have to remember they were exhausted with recording and filming projects , and they were working through the night until 5am .
" what you see is a curio and a snapshot of what it was like when you could call the hottest bands of the day at short notice and have all these people in one place - it 's textbook rock ' n ' roll . "
