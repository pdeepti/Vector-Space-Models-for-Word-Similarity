while the latest diet craze makes its way through the us , germans continue chomping down on bread and potatoes .
low-carb products have had difficulty making their way into the mainstream , largely due to german culture . more bread and pommes frites please , we 're german .
while their counterparts across the atlantic may prefer to skip the breakfast rolls , the side order of pasta and the extra helping of potatoes , diners in germany say bring it on .
americans may be busy counting up calories , scanning the aisles in the grocery store for low-carb cereals and exchanging the latest menu suggestions in the atkins diet books , but germans are largely unphased by the phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salami , smoked hams and other cold cuts are plentiful in german diets .
despite their penchant for sausages and heavy meat dishes , the atkins diet , which favors protein over carbohydrates , is having a hard time winning german converts .

carbohydrates are an integral factor in nearly all meals .
" just think about german breakfast , " said pudel , " you can not just have eggs without the bread , and you can not eat butter without spreading it on bread . "
" it just wo n't work in germany , " he added .
a look in the atkins diet bulletin board forum reveals just how difficult it is for followers of low-carb eating to find the products in german grocery stores .
with requests for tips on which foods contain low level carbohydrates and where to obtain special atkins bars and pills to counteract unintentionally consumed carbs , the group of adherents is relatively small - a niche market .
their concerns illustrate the fact that the diet is not nearly as accepted as in the united states .

verdict still out diet experts and nutrition researchers have also criticized the simultaneous emphasis on low-carbs and high protein intake as being insufficiently proven to lead to long-term weight loss .
they have also questioned the health risks involved with consuming too much fat and cholesteral as contained in animal proteins .

11 attacks . german federal prosecutor kay nehm said his office had told us officials that it was necessary to allow terror suspects currently in their custody to testify at the upcoming retrial of mounir el motassadeq , who is accused of aiding the sept .
11 suicide pilots in hamburg .
statements from ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed could affect the balance of the german court 's proceedings , he said in a report released on saturday .
motassadeq , 30 , was originally sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington .
but a federal appeals court quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh .
at the time of motassadeq 's trial , the us refused to allow binalshibh to give evidence , despite requests from germany 's justice ministry .
binalshibh , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location .
hoping to avoid a second court dismissal , germany has pressed the us to allow evidence this time .
" we have made it clear to the us that we depend on being able to hear ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed as witnesses , " nehm told newsmagazine focus .
washington has not said whether it will cooperate with germany on the matter .
in the past , it refused to allow binalshibh to testify in trial in person , citing security reasons .
it has also not allowed excerpts from statements taken during interrogation to be read in court , saying these entail too many sensitive issues .
defense lawyers to call for mistrial even if the two suspected terrorists are allowed to testify or if the united states agrees to provide detailed information secured during interrogation , motassadeq 's attorney grässle-münscher said he would argue for a case dismissal .
" a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 .
under german law , information obtained under duress or torture can not be used in court .
if motassadeq 's defense team can prove that is the case with binalshibh , they could call for a dismissal , and motassadeq would be a free man . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror suspect lawyers to seek case dismissal lawyers for the only man convicted over the sept .

11 attacks . german federal prosecutor kay nehm said his office had told us officials that it was necessary to allow terror suspects currently in their custody to testify at the upcoming retrial of mounir el motassadeq , who is accused of aiding the sept .
11 suicide pilots in hamburg .
statements from ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed could affect the balance of the german court 's proceedings , he said in a report released on saturday .
motassadeq , 30 , was originally sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington .
but a federal appeals court quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh .
at the time of motassadeq 's trial , the us refused to allow binalshibh to give evidence , despite requests from germany 's justice ministry .
binalshibh , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location .
hoping to avoid a second court dismissal , germany has pressed the us to allow evidence this time .
" we have made it clear to the us that we depend on being able to hear ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed as witnesses , " nehm told newsmagazine focus .
washington has not said whether it will cooperate with germany on the matter .
in the past , it refused to allow binalshibh to testify in trial in person , citing security reasons .
it has also not allowed excerpts from statements taken during interrogation to be read in court , saying these entail too many sensitive issues .
defense lawyers to call for mistrial even if the two suspected terrorists are allowed to testify or if the united states agrees to provide detailed information secured during interrogation , motassadeq 's attorney grässle-münscher said he would argue for a case dismissal .
" a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 .
under german law , information obtained under duress or torture can not be used in court .
if motassadeq 's defense team can prove that is the case with binalshibh , they could call for a dismissal , and motassadeq would be a free man . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror suspect lawyers to seek case dismissal lawyers for the only man convicted over the sept .

while the latest diet craze makes its way through the us , germans continue chomping down on bread and potatoes .
low-carb products have had difficulty making their way into the mainstream , largely due to german culture . more bread and pommes frites please , we 're german .
while their counterparts across the atlantic may prefer to skip the breakfast rolls , the side order of pasta and the extra helping of potatoes , diners in germany say bring it on .
americans may be busy counting up calories , scanning the aisles in the grocery store for low-carb cereals and exchanging the latest menu suggestions in the atkins diet books , but germans are largely unphased by the phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salami , smoked hams and other cold cuts are plentiful in german diets .
despite their penchant for sausages and heavy meat dishes , the atkins diet , which favors protein over carbohydrates , is having a hard time winning german converts .
" the atkins diet craze that has gripped america will not result in germans eating more sausage and less potatoes , " dr. volker pudel , director of nutrition psychology at the university of göttingen , told ap newsagency .
does n't work in germany part of the reason for the low interest in the us diet fad lies in germans ' traditional eating habits .
carbohydrates are an integral factor in nearly all meals .
" just think about german breakfast , " said pudel , " you can not just have eggs without the bread , and you can not eat butter without spreading it on bread . "
" it just wo n't work in germany , " he added .
a look in the atkins diet bulletin board forum reveals just how difficult it is for followers of low-carb eating to find the products in german grocery stores .
with requests for tips on which foods contain low level carbohydrates and where to obtain special atkins bars and pills to counteract unintentionally consumed carbs , the group of adherents is relatively small - a niche market .
their concerns illustrate the fact that the diet is not nearly as accepted as in the united states .
many forum entries focus on the fact that food labels in germany do not give the amount of contained carbohydrates or that when dinning out their are no low-carb dishes on the menu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with such a good selection of breads , who would want to go low-carb ?
the association of independent health advisors -lrb- ugb -rrb- has been following the us trend and watching as it comes to germany .
in its august journal , the organization stressed that while the number of atkins dieters remains fairly low in germany and products are not available in the majority of grocery stores , many of the adherents buy their food over the internet .
the ugb refers to the low-carb dieters as a small minority .
low acceptance level another reason the atkins way of life , as it 's often called , has not caught on in germany owes to the low acceptance level .
whereas the diet has several big-name celebrities praising it in the united states , few prominent germans have touted its benefits .
instead , the diet is more often depicted as unhealthy .
stiftung warentest , a consumer testing group which examines , among other things , the effectiveness and safety of diets , said recently of atkins : " this extremely one-sided and health-damaging diet can not be recommended for even short-term weight loss . "
verdict still out diet experts and nutrition researchers have also criticized the simultaneous emphasis on low-carbs and high protein intake as being insufficiently proven to lead to long-term weight loss .
they have also questioned the health risks involved with consuming too much fat and cholesteral as contained in animal proteins .
until more extensive studies can be done , the german health ministry and the consumer affairs ministry caution people not to try the atkins diet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables are key to a healthy diet , say nutrition experts .
talkingfood , an eu initiative to increase nutritional awareness in germany , also says the verdict is still out on the benefits of the atkins diet .
although it generally recommends reducing overall caloric intact by reducing carbohydrates and fats to a moderate level , it encourages increased consumption of fruit and vegetables , two elements not favored by atkins .
germany 's consumer affairs ministry , which has become alarmed by the growing level of obesity in the population , especially among children , is launching the platform for nutrition and exercise in september .
on its web site , the ministry clearly states , the best way to shed unwanted pounds is by eating well-balanced portions and exercising regularly . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mcdonald 's goes slim-line for europe responding to growing concern about obesity in europe , the u.s. fast food chain mcdonald 's prepares to launch a new , healthier menu in 16 european countries , offering customers fewer burgers , and more salads .

statements from ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed could affect the balance of the german court 's proceedings , he said in a report released on saturday .
motassadeq , 30 , was originally sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington .
but a federal appeals court quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh .
at the time of motassadeq 's trial , the us refused to allow binalshibh to give evidence , despite requests from germany 's justice ministry .
binalshibh , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location .
hoping to avoid a second court dismissal , germany has pressed the us to allow evidence this time .
" we have made it clear to the us that we depend on being able to hear ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed as witnesses , " nehm told newsmagazine focus .
washington has not said whether it will cooperate with germany on the matter .

it has also not allowed excerpts from statements taken during interrogation to be read in court , saying these entail too many sensitive issues .

" a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 .
under german law , information obtained under duress or torture can not be used in court .

in its august journal , the organization stressed that while the number of atkins dieters remains fairly low in germany and products are not available in the majority of grocery stores , many of the adherents buy their food over the internet .
the ugb refers to the low-carb dieters as a small minority .
low acceptance level another reason the atkins way of life , as it 's often called , has not caught on in germany owes to the low acceptance level .
whereas the diet has several big-name celebrities praising it in the united states , few prominent germans have touted its benefits .
instead , the diet is more often depicted as unhealthy .
stiftung warentest , a consumer testing group which examines , among other things , the effectiveness and safety of diets , said recently of atkins : " this extremely one-sided and health-damaging diet can not be recommended for even short-term weight loss . "
verdict still out diet experts and nutrition researchers have also criticized the simultaneous emphasis on low-carbs and high protein intake as being insufficiently proven to lead to long-term weight loss .
they have also questioned the health risks involved with consuming too much fat and cholesteral as contained in animal proteins .
until more extensive studies can be done , the german health ministry and the consumer affairs ministry caution people not to try the atkins diet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables are key to a healthy diet , say nutrition experts .
talkingfood , an eu initiative to increase nutritional awareness in germany , also says the verdict is still out on the benefits of the atkins diet .
although it generally recommends reducing overall caloric intact by reducing carbohydrates and fats to a moderate level , it encourages increased consumption of fruit and vegetables , two elements not favored by atkins .
germany 's consumer affairs ministry , which has become alarmed by the growing level of obesity in the population , especially among children , is launching the platform for nutrition and exercise in september .
on its web site , the ministry clearly states , the best way to shed unwanted pounds is by eating well-balanced portions and exercising regularly . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mcdonald 's goes slim-line for europe responding to growing concern about obesity in europe , the u.s. fast food chain mcdonald 's prepares to launch a new , healthier menu in 16 european countries , offering customers fewer burgers , and more salads .

statements from ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed could affect the balance of the german court 's proceedings , he said in a report released on saturday .
motassadeq , 30 , was originally sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington .
but a federal appeals court quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh .
at the time of motassadeq 's trial , the us refused to allow binalshibh to give evidence , despite requests from germany 's justice ministry .
binalshibh , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location .
hoping to avoid a second court dismissal , germany has pressed the us to allow evidence this time .
" we have made it clear to the us that we depend on being able to hear ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed as witnesses , " nehm told newsmagazine focus .
washington has not said whether it will cooperate with germany on the matter .
in the past , it refused to allow binalshibh to testify in trial in person , citing security reasons .
it has also not allowed excerpts from statements taken during interrogation to be read in court , saying these entail too many sensitive issues .
defense lawyers to call for mistrial even if the two suspected terrorists are allowed to testify or if the united states agrees to provide detailed information secured during interrogation , motassadeq 's attorney grässle-münscher said he would argue for a case dismissal .
" a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 .
under german law , information obtained under duress or torture can not be used in court .

11 attacks . german federal prosecutor kay nehm said his office had told us officials that it was necessary to allow terror suspects currently in their custody to testify at the upcoming retrial of mounir el motassadeq , who is accused of aiding the sept .
11 suicide pilots in hamburg .
statements from ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed could affect the balance of the german court 's proceedings , he said in a report released on saturday .
motassadeq , 30 , was originally sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington .
but a federal appeals court quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh .
at the time of motassadeq 's trial , the us refused to allow binalshibh to give evidence , despite requests from germany 's justice ministry .
binalshibh , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location .
hoping to avoid a second court dismissal , germany has pressed the us to allow evidence this time .
" we have made it clear to the us that we depend on being able to hear ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed as witnesses , " nehm told newsmagazine focus .
washington has not said whether it will cooperate with germany on the matter .
in the past , it refused to allow binalshibh to testify in trial in person , citing security reasons .
it has also not allowed excerpts from statements taken during interrogation to be read in court , saying these entail too many sensitive issues .
defense lawyers to call for mistrial even if the two suspected terrorists are allowed to testify or if the united states agrees to provide detailed information secured during interrogation , motassadeq 's attorney grässle-münscher said he would argue for a case dismissal .
" a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 .
under german law , information obtained under duress or torture can not be used in court .
if motassadeq 's defense team can prove that is the case with binalshibh , they could call for a dismissal , and motassadeq would be a free man . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror suspect lawyers to seek case dismissal lawyers for the only man convicted over the sept .

while their counterparts across the atlantic may prefer to skip the breakfast rolls , the side order of pasta and the extra helping of potatoes , diners in germany say bring it on .
americans may be busy counting up calories , scanning the aisles in the grocery store for low-carb cereals and exchanging the latest menu suggestions in the atkins diet books , but germans are largely unphased by the phenomena .

statements from ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed could affect the balance of the german court 's proceedings , he said in a report released on saturday .
motassadeq , 30 , was originally sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington .
but a federal appeals court quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh .
at the time of motassadeq 's trial , the us refused to allow binalshibh to give evidence , despite requests from germany 's justice ministry .
binalshibh , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location .
hoping to avoid a second court dismissal , germany has pressed the us to allow evidence this time .
" we have made it clear to the us that we depend on being able to hear ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed as witnesses , " nehm told newsmagazine focus .
washington has not said whether it will cooperate with germany on the matter .
in the past , it refused to allow binalshibh to testify in trial in person , citing security reasons .
it has also not allowed excerpts from statements taken during interrogation to be read in court , saying these entail too many sensitive issues .
defense lawyers to call for mistrial even if the two suspected terrorists are allowed to testify or if the united states agrees to provide detailed information secured during interrogation , motassadeq 's attorney grässle-münscher said he would argue for a case dismissal .
" a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 .
under german law , information obtained under duress or torture can not be used in court .

11 suicide pilots in hamburg .
statements from ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed could affect the balance of the german court 's proceedings , he said in a report released on saturday .
motassadeq , 30 , was originally sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington .
but a federal appeals court quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh .
at the time of motassadeq 's trial , the us refused to allow binalshibh to give evidence , despite requests from germany 's justice ministry .
binalshibh , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location .
hoping to avoid a second court dismissal , germany has pressed the us to allow evidence this time .
" we have made it clear to the us that we depend on being able to hear ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed as witnesses , " nehm told newsmagazine focus .
washington has not said whether it will cooperate with germany on the matter .
in the past , it refused to allow binalshibh to testify in trial in person , citing security reasons .
it has also not allowed excerpts from statements taken during interrogation to be read in court , saying these entail too many sensitive issues .
defense lawyers to call for mistrial even if the two suspected terrorists are allowed to testify or if the united states agrees to provide detailed information secured during interrogation , motassadeq 's attorney grässle-münscher said he would argue for a case dismissal .
" a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 .
under german law , information obtained under duress or torture can not be used in court .
if motassadeq 's defense team can prove that is the case with binalshibh , they could call for a dismissal , and motassadeq would be a free man . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror suspect lawyers to seek case dismissal lawyers for the only man convicted over the sept .

statements from ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed could affect the balance of the german court 's proceedings , he said in a report released on saturday .
motassadeq , 30 , was originally sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington .
but a federal appeals court quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh .

binalshibh , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location .
hoping to avoid a second court dismissal , germany has pressed the us to allow evidence this time .
" we have made it clear to the us that we depend on being able to hear ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed as witnesses , " nehm told newsmagazine focus .
washington has not said whether it will cooperate with germany on the matter .

it has also not allowed excerpts from statements taken during interrogation to be read in court , saying these entail too many sensitive issues .

11 suicide pilots in hamburg .
statements from ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed could affect the balance of the german court 's proceedings , he said in a report released on saturday .
motassadeq , 30 , was originally sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington .
but a federal appeals court quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh .
at the time of motassadeq 's trial , the us refused to allow binalshibh to give evidence , despite requests from germany 's justice ministry .
binalshibh , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location .
hoping to avoid a second court dismissal , germany has pressed the us to allow evidence this time .
" we have made it clear to the us that we depend on being able to hear ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed as witnesses , " nehm told newsmagazine focus .
washington has not said whether it will cooperate with germany on the matter .
in the past , it refused to allow binalshibh to testify in trial in person , citing security reasons .
it has also not allowed excerpts from statements taken during interrogation to be read in court , saying these entail too many sensitive issues .
defense lawyers to call for mistrial even if the two suspected terrorists are allowed to testify or if the united states agrees to provide detailed information secured during interrogation , motassadeq 's attorney grässle-münscher said he would argue for a case dismissal .
" a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 .
under german law , information obtained under duress or torture can not be used in court .

despite recent negative reports , berlin appears to be improving slightly . following last week 's sober reports from the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- which predicted only a cautious growth rate in germany of 1.1 percent for 2004 and a continuing high unemployment rate into 2005 , eurozone economic indicators due to be published this coming friday could signal a bit of hope on the horizon .
a flash estimate for the region 's second quarter gross domestic product is expected to show the economy maintaining the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of 0.6 percent , economists said .
within this context , germany appears to be one of the driving forces as it experiences a slight pick-up compared to numbers produced for the same time last year .
" the eurozone likely maintained the pace of growth reached in early 2004 .
a modest weakening in france was probably offset by a more robust gain in germany , " holger schmieding of bank of america told afp wire services .
other analysts are predicting eurozone growth could increase to 0.7 percent , which would mark its strongest increase in four years .
however , they caution this depends largely on whether domestic demand remains the same or drops , as many say it could .
first estimates of gdp for the major eurozone countries are to be released in the coming days , just ahead of the eurozone figures .
germany shows signs of turning around germany 's bundesbank has already said it estimates german growth picked up a tenth of a percentage point to 0.5 percent in the second quarter .
if this is the case , it would represent germany 's best performance in 13 quarters .
as with the oecd report from last wednesday , followers of the eurozone indicators believe strong exports and industrial activity over the past few months have contributed primarily to the slight increase in german gdp growth .
domestic consumption , however , continues to tug at the recovery rate .
with retail sales falling 0.4 percent quarter-on-quarter , private consumption has done little to boost german growth during the past few months , said schmieding .
france begins to slow down while germany gains slightly in growth , france is expected to show a slower gdp of about 0.6 percent , down from the exceptionally strong first quarter figure of 0.8 percent .
nonetheless , it is still the fastest growing major eurozone economy .
compared to germany , france is benefiting from more resilient consumer spending , with household consumption of manufactured goods surging 1.8 percent in the second quarter .
the eurozone indicators are likely to be received less positively in italy , which is expected to post the weakest growth rate among the major eurozone economies , maintaining the 0.4 percent growth rate achieved in the beginning of the year . dw staff -lrb- afp / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oecd : german economy to improve in 2005 germany 's high unemployment levels wo n't subside in the near future : an easing of the situation is n't expected until 2005 , according to a new organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- report .

statements from ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed could affect the balance of the german court 's proceedings , he said in a report released on saturday .
motassadeq , 30 , was originally sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington .
but a federal appeals court quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh .
at the time of motassadeq 's trial , the us refused to allow binalshibh to give evidence , despite requests from germany 's justice ministry .
binalshibh , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location .
hoping to avoid a second court dismissal , germany has pressed the us to allow evidence this time .
" we have made it clear to the us that we depend on being able to hear ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed as witnesses , " nehm told newsmagazine focus .
washington has not said whether it will cooperate with germany on the matter .

it has also not allowed excerpts from statements taken during interrogation to be read in court , saying these entail too many sensitive issues .

" a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 .

11 suicide pilots in hamburg .
statements from ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed could affect the balance of the german court 's proceedings , he said in a report released on saturday .
motassadeq , 30 , was originally sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington .
but a federal appeals court quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh .
at the time of motassadeq 's trial , the us refused to allow binalshibh to give evidence , despite requests from germany 's justice ministry .
binalshibh , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location .
hoping to avoid a second court dismissal , germany has pressed the us to allow evidence this time .
" we have made it clear to the us that we depend on being able to hear ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed as witnesses , " nehm told newsmagazine focus .
washington has not said whether it will cooperate with germany on the matter .
in the past , it refused to allow binalshibh to testify in trial in person , citing security reasons .
it has also not allowed excerpts from statements taken during interrogation to be read in court , saying these entail too many sensitive issues .
defense lawyers to call for mistrial even if the two suspected terrorists are allowed to testify or if the united states agrees to provide detailed information secured during interrogation , motassadeq 's attorney grässle-münscher said he would argue for a case dismissal .
" a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 .
under german law , information obtained under duress or torture can not be used in court .
if motassadeq 's defense team can prove that is the case with binalshibh , they could call for a dismissal , and motassadeq would be a free man . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror suspect lawyers to seek case dismissal lawyers for the only man convicted over the sept .

11 attacks . german federal prosecutor kay nehm said his office had told us officials that it was necessary to allow terror suspects currently in their custody to testify at the upcoming retrial of mounir el motassadeq , who is accused of aiding the sept .
11 suicide pilots in hamburg .
statements from ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed could affect the balance of the german court 's proceedings , he said in a report released on saturday .
motassadeq , 30 , was originally sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison for his involvement in the so-called hamburg cell around mohammad atta which produced three of the 19 hijackers who attacked new york and washington .
but a federal appeals court quashed the conviction in march and sent the case back to the hamburg court that originally sentenced him , citing the absence of potentially crucial testimony by the hamburg mastermind behind the plot , ramzi binalshibh .
at the time of motassadeq 's trial , the us refused to allow binalshibh to give evidence , despite requests from germany 's justice ministry .
binalshibh , a yemeni national , is currently being held by us authorities in an undisclosed location .
hoping to avoid a second court dismissal , germany has pressed the us to allow evidence this time .
" we have made it clear to the us that we depend on being able to hear ramzi binalshibh and khalid shaikh mohammed as witnesses , " nehm told newsmagazine focus .
washington has not said whether it will cooperate with germany on the matter .
in the past , it refused to allow binalshibh to testify in trial in person , citing security reasons .
it has also not allowed excerpts from statements taken during interrogation to be read in court , saying these entail too many sensitive issues .
defense lawyers to call for mistrial even if the two suspected terrorists are allowed to testify or if the united states agrees to provide detailed information secured during interrogation , motassadeq 's attorney grässle-münscher said he would argue for a case dismissal .
" a fair trial is no longer possible because the important evidence is either lacking or contaminated , " grässle-münscher said , referring to rumors that binalshibh had been tortured since he was handed over to the us authorities after his arrest in pakistan in september 2002 .
under german law , information obtained under duress or torture can not be used in court .
if motassadeq 's defense team can prove that is the case with binalshibh , they could call for a dismissal , and motassadeq would be a free man . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror suspect lawyers to seek case dismissal lawyers for the only man convicted over the sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salami , smoked hams and other cold cuts are plentiful in german diets .
despite their penchant for sausages and heavy meat dishes , the atkins diet , which favors protein over carbohydrates , is having a hard time winning german converts .

jules stenson , assistant editor of the news of the world , would not confirm speculation that ms alam had been paid £ 500,000 for her story .
he told five live : " i ca n't go into figures but with the news of the world we pay for stories , we make no pretence about that .
" with a story as groundbreaking as this that the whole country wants to read then clearly we 'll pay top dollar for it . "
on thursday mr eriksson was cleared of accusations he had misled the fa over his affair with alam .
