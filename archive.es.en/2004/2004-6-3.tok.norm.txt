as the international conference for the promotion of renewable energies enters its third day in bonn , the german chancellor gerhard schröder is preparing to bang his drum for a cause close to his heart . the chancellor proposed the meeting after the 2002 world summit for sustainable development in the south african city of johannesburg failed to buckle under european pressure to draw up timetables and targets for boosting renewable energy use .
this time around , delegates at the four-day conference in bonn aim to come up with an " international action program , " setting out specific commitments by individual governments and the international community .
environment minister jürgen trittin told the 3,000 conference delegates wednesday that renewable energy sources could be the solution to poverty and climate change across the world .
" we need an accelerated global increase in the use of renewable energies , " he said . " we must get down to business .
we must enable this global increase to become reality , to combat global poverty , to combat global warming .
let 's make it real . "
concrete steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants in the renewables 2004 conference attend a session in germany 's former parliament building in bonn .
on wednesday , 350 parliamentarians from more than 70 countries took a significant step towards pushing renewable energy sources further towards the mainstream when they released a document calling for the establishment of an international renewable energy agency modeled after the international atomic agency in vienna .
german parliamentarian and president of the eurosolar organization for renewables , hermann scheer , believes it is the only logical way forward .
" intergovernemtal agencies exist for the promotion of atomic energy , for the promotion of fossil energy , but not exclusively for renewable energies , " scheer told deutsche welle . " and this bias is one of the reasons why the dissemination of renewable energies does n't come through world-wide and why much misinformation is filling decision-maker 's minds . "
broad agreement remarkably , german politicians across the political spectrum have agreed on the fundamental ideas of the new agency , as have parliamentarians from countries such as pakistan and nigeria .the precise content of the action plan is still unclear , but germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , co-host of the bonn conference , has her sights set ambitiously high .
she wants to see half the world using renewable energy sources by the year 2050 , and not only for geo-political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- spd -rrb- and environment minister jürgen trittin open the conference in bonn .
" i think it could be possible to give one billion energy-poor people access to renewable energy .
it might be ambitious , but it would also prevent other conflicts , make us less dependent on centralised powers , and fight climate change .
so all the advantages are in this field , " wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
with latin american countries pledging to increase their share of renewable energy sources by 10 percent before the year 2020 , there is certainly some promise of commitment in the air in bonn .
but ecologists are worried that behind-the-scenes haggling could dangerously water down any real commitment , ruining the best political opportunity in a generation to help wean the world off oil .
there is a danger too , that the united states , japan , france and brazil , which managed to root out any reference to timetables or market percentages at the 2002 summit in johannesburg , might try to do the same once again in bonn . john hay -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy for the future dw-radio presents a special series on alternative power projects in germany and abroad . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

on may 19 , the european commission gave the go-ahead to corn known as bt-11 , which is made by swiss agrochemicals company syngenta .
the eu executive took the decision after member states failed to agree among themselves about whether or not to lift the ban .
if authorized , the two next products - both marketed by monsanto - would be used in animal feed and industrial processing , reported reuters .
the first product up for approval is rapeseed modified to resist the herbicide glyphosate , a highly toxic herbicide used to kill crop weeds .
monsanto ’ s trade name for this is roundup .
later in june , eu environment ministers will discuss a possible second gmo approval at a meeting scheduled for june 28 in luxembourg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.06.2004 is europe dragging its feet on immigration ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has been slow to meet the challenge of balancing security and the rights of immigrants .
the eu 's justice and home affairs commissioner has called for more to be done to find a common policy on immigration across the bloc . five years after a common european asylum and immigration policy was initiated at a summit in the finnish city of tampere , justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino called on his european union colleagues to work towards a " uniform status " for admitting legal migrants for employment purposes into the union and encourage the immigration of more non-eu nationals . speaking in brussels on wednesday , vitorino told the gathered officials that the approach of different member states in the area of asylum and immigration had delayed the creation of a cohesive common policy and specifically stressed the need for the eu to regulate laws on legal immigration for economic reasons . " it is necessary to make headway in terms of economic immigration policy and the right of every member state to fix the number of immigrants , " vitorino said .
" we need collaboration on a european level and must specifically concentrate on the integration of immigrants . " vitorino added that , since the so-called tampere program was introduced in 1999 , which was intended to form a cooperative base for member states on matters such as asylum , immigration and the fight against terrorism , some progress had been made .
the commissioner quoted the implementation of the european arrest warrant as an example of the fruits of tampere 's labor . the commissioner was speaking on the day when the european commission adopted a communication on the results of the tampere program . a second program which will set out further plans for " an area of freedom , security and justice " is expected to be in place by the second half of 2004 despite continuing differences between states on the issues involved .
conflicting views the delay in formulating a common policy stems from conflicting views throughout the bloc .
there is particular controversy in germany where the social democrat government and conservative opposition have negotiated their own immigration law .
the european commission would require member states to take on more immigrants than the current german bill allows . vitorino said the negotiations needed in reaching a unanimous agreement on proposals made the resolving of the issue " complicated " and had led to less ambitious outcomes .
" there have been moments of joy , but also of sorrow and intense depression , " he admitted . human rights group criticizes eu the record of the european union in the area of immigration over the last five years has drawn criticism from human rights organization amnesty international .
a statement from amnesty said that " from a human rights perspective , the picture is not positive . " " the eu has created an area that has diminished the legitimate rights of refugees , that is less secure than it should be because of the lack of human rights safeguards hampering the fight against crime , and that is free for many , but certainly not for all , " the amnesty assessment read .

the eu 's justice and home affairs commissioner has called for more to be done to find a common policy on immigration across the bloc . five years after a common european asylum and immigration policy was initiated at a summit in the finnish city of tampere , justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino called on his european union colleagues to work towards a " uniform status " for admitting legal migrants for employment purposes into the union and encourage the immigration of more non-eu nationals . speaking in brussels on wednesday , vitorino told the gathered officials that the approach of different member states in the area of asylum and immigration had delayed the creation of a cohesive common policy and specifically stressed the need for the eu to regulate laws on legal immigration for economic reasons . " it is necessary to make headway in terms of economic immigration policy and the right of every member state to fix the number of immigrants , " vitorino said .
" we need collaboration on a european level and must specifically concentrate on the integration of immigrants . " vitorino added that , since the so-called tampere program was introduced in 1999 , which was intended to form a cooperative base for member states on matters such as asylum , immigration and the fight against terrorism , some progress had been made .
the commissioner quoted the implementation of the european arrest warrant as an example of the fruits of tampere 's labor . the commissioner was speaking on the day when the european commission adopted a communication on the results of the tampere program . a second program which will set out further plans for " an area of freedom , security and justice " is expected to be in place by the second half of 2004 despite continuing differences between states on the issues involved .
conflicting views the delay in formulating a common policy stems from conflicting views throughout the bloc .
there is particular controversy in germany where the social democrat government and conservative opposition have negotiated their own immigration law .
the european commission would require member states to take on more immigrants than the current german bill allows . vitorino said the negotiations needed in reaching a unanimous agreement on proposals made the resolving of the issue " complicated " and had led to less ambitious outcomes .
" there have been moments of joy , but also of sorrow and intense depression , " he admitted . human rights group criticizes eu the record of the european union in the area of immigration over the last five years has drawn criticism from human rights organization amnesty international .
a statement from amnesty said that " from a human rights perspective , the picture is not positive .

the eu 's justice and home affairs commissioner has called for more to be done to find a common policy on immigration across the bloc . five years after a common european asylum and immigration policy was initiated at a summit in the finnish city of tampere , justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino called on his european union colleagues to work towards a " uniform status " for admitting legal migrants for employment purposes into the union and encourage the immigration of more non-eu nationals . speaking in brussels on wednesday , vitorino told the gathered officials that the approach of different member states in the area of asylum and immigration had delayed the creation of a cohesive common policy and specifically stressed the need for the eu to regulate laws on legal immigration for economic reasons . " it is necessary to make headway in terms of economic immigration policy and the right of every member state to fix the number of immigrants , " vitorino said .
" we need collaboration on a european level and must specifically concentrate on the integration of immigrants . " vitorino added that , since the so-called tampere program was introduced in 1999 , which was intended to form a cooperative base for member states on matters such as asylum , immigration and the fight against terrorism , some progress had been made .
the commissioner quoted the implementation of the european arrest warrant as an example of the fruits of tampere 's labor . the commissioner was speaking on the day when the european commission adopted a communication on the results of the tampere program . a second program which will set out further plans for " an area of freedom , security and justice " is expected to be in place by the second half of 2004 despite continuing differences between states on the issues involved .
conflicting views the delay in formulating a common policy stems from conflicting views throughout the bloc .
there is particular controversy in germany where the social democrat government and conservative opposition have negotiated their own immigration law .
the european commission would require member states to take on more immigrants than the current german bill allows . vitorino said the negotiations needed in reaching a unanimous agreement on proposals made the resolving of the issue " complicated " and had led to less ambitious outcomes .
" there have been moments of joy , but also of sorrow and intense depression , " he admitted . human rights group criticizes eu the record of the european union in the area of immigration over the last five years has drawn criticism from human rights organization amnesty international .
a statement from amnesty said that " from a human rights perspective , the picture is not positive . " " the eu has created an area that has diminished the legitimate rights of refugees , that is less secure than it should be because of the lack of human rights safeguards hampering the fight against crime , and that is free for many , but certainly not for all , " the amnesty assessment read .

steps have been taken to dam the flow , but the next wave is already gathering strength . a huge crest of paperwork is rolling towards the european commission , threatening to swamp the 25,000 civil servants working in brussels .
last year , the arduous bureaucrats churned out more paper than ever before : 1.5 million pages had to be translated into what were then the 11 official eu languages .
now the translators are sinking in the vast ocean of work backing up behind them .
at last count , they were 60,000 pages behind , and if the momentum continues at the same pace , that could soon increase to 300,000 . keep it short ! the eu wants to drastically reduce the flow of work to be translated , and has issued an edict instructing beavering bureaucrats to reduce the length of " memorandums " - the official title for commission texts - from the current average of 50 pages to a mere 15 . " keep it short ! " is the new motto among the brussels insiders , a throwback to the days of public telephone boxes long before mobile phone become a mainstream play thing .
each year the pile of papers grows by about five percent .
and eu commissioner neil kinnock admits that if things continue as they are , it will be the death of the translation department . already , the translation department is the biggest single eu installation .
more than 2,400 translators transfer their colleagues ' warblings into the now 20 official languages , from finnish to maltese to slovenian .
although the number of translators working there was upped with expansion at the start of may , the eu personnel department did n't manage to get enough qualified staff onboard in advance of expansion .
despite seven years of planning , there were apparently not enough qualified translators available , or at least that is the line commissioner kinnock is sticking to . language acrobats rather than take on hundreds and hundreds of extra translators , the plan is to increase the productivity of the translation service by 40 percent by the end of 2006 .
internal working papers are now only translated into english , french or german , but everything that leaves the building to go to citizens , companies or courts has to be translated - and precisely . some of the new member states have already started grumbling that their language is not taken seriously enough by the commission .
and in some places , the internet presence of the nine new languages could serve to back their complaints .
the language acrobats back at base , however , claim this is only a transitional phase . but in 2007 , bulgarian , rumanian and maybe even croatia will join the swelling linguistic ranks of the union .
with a couple of years warning , there is ample time for the commission to go in search of translators who can work , let 's say from estonian into turkish .

a new german movie star is attempting to do what compatriots til schweiger and others failed to do - crack hollywood .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.06.2004 goethe institute opens center in north korea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pyongyang 's new german cultural center will open the doors to europe for north koreans with the opening of its reading room in pyongyang , germany ’ s goethe institute has become the first western cultural organization to open shop in north korea .
institute leaders believe they can operate free of censorship . the goethe institute in pyongyang comprises of 150 square meters packed with 8,000 books , newspapers , cds and videos stored in a cultural center in a space located deep in the heart of the city .
in that sense , the cultural center could be just like any other - if it were n't located in the north korean capital .
on june 3 , a delegation led by the president of the goethe institute opened the first western cultural institution in the stalinist state .
the move has been viewed as controversial , since north korea still remains almost completely shut off from the rest of the world .
after years of preparation , north korean officials opened the door for the goethe institute and its cultural undertaking .
uwe schmelter , who heads the goethe institute in neighboring south korea , led the negotiations , which began in early 2001 .
he found the atmosphere of the talks surprisingly good .
" the negotiations were not easy , " says schmelter , " but they were very friendly and harmonious .
at stake were the necessary requirements - at least from the goethe institute ’ s perspective - of opening and running such a reading room . "
this , schmelter adds , includes " the free and open access for all north koreans and the uncensored and accessible viewing of all media . "
a balancing act these stipulations , a hallmark of the goethe institute 's work , were at first hard to accept for the north korean authorities , who aim to prevent information from overseas from reaching the country .
but at the end of the negotiations , a delicate compromise was reached .
under the agreement , 50 percent of the goethe institute 's literature will focus on science and technology , with the other 50 percent devoted to general media that provides a complete and up-to-date view of germany .
although north korean authorities agreed to give the goethe institute complete control over which media to feature , the new reading room in pyongyang is to be run entirely by local north korean staff .
but schmelter is optimistic that the authorities will adhere to their agreement to allow uncensored and free access to everyone .
historic parallels schmelter also describes what he views as north koreans ’ affinity towards germans .
" the shared fate of living in a divided country for 40 years makes koreans feel very close to germans , " he says .
" in a way , north koreans even consider germans to be their chosen relatives . "
for some like schmelter , this historical parallel is reason enough to see the opening of the goethe institute in north korea as a source of hope for the future .
in a statement , germany 's foreign ministry said the opening of the institute marked an " important expansion of -lrb- the country 's -rrb- cultural presence " in north korea , a place where very little information is available about germany .
the goethe institute is the main arbiter of german culture and language abroad , with 127 institutes in other countries . marianna yahilevich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goethe institute opens doors in kabul germany ’ s international cultural organization , the goethe institute , is poised to re-open in the afghan capital of kabul after 12 years of closure brought on by the rise of the taliban regime .

institute leaders believe they can operate free of censorship . the goethe institute in pyongyang comprises of 150 square meters packed with 8,000 books , newspapers , cds and videos stored in a cultural center in a space located deep in the heart of the city .
in that sense , the cultural center could be just like any other - if it were n't located in the north korean capital .
on june 3 , a delegation led by the president of the goethe institute opened the first western cultural institution in the stalinist state .
the move has been viewed as controversial , since north korea still remains almost completely shut off from the rest of the world .
after years of preparation , north korean officials opened the door for the goethe institute and its cultural undertaking .
uwe schmelter , who heads the goethe institute in neighboring south korea , led the negotiations , which began in early 2001 .
he found the atmosphere of the talks surprisingly good .
" the negotiations were not easy , " says schmelter , " but they were very friendly and harmonious .
at stake were the necessary requirements - at least from the goethe institute ’ s perspective - of opening and running such a reading room . "
this , schmelter adds , includes " the free and open access for all north koreans and the uncensored and accessible viewing of all media . "
a balancing act these stipulations , a hallmark of the goethe institute 's work , were at first hard to accept for the north korean authorities , who aim to prevent information from overseas from reaching the country .
but at the end of the negotiations , a delicate compromise was reached .
under the agreement , 50 percent of the goethe institute 's literature will focus on science and technology , with the other 50 percent devoted to general media that provides a complete and up-to-date view of germany .
although north korean authorities agreed to give the goethe institute complete control over which media to feature , the new reading room in pyongyang is to be run entirely by local north korean staff .
but schmelter is optimistic that the authorities will adhere to their agreement to allow uncensored and free access to everyone .
historic parallels schmelter also describes what he views as north koreans ’ affinity towards germans .
" the shared fate of living in a divided country for 40 years makes koreans feel very close to germans , " he says .
" in a way , north koreans even consider germans to be their chosen relatives . "
for some like schmelter , this historical parallel is reason enough to see the opening of the goethe institute in north korea as a source of hope for the future .
in a statement , germany 's foreign ministry said the opening of the institute marked an " important expansion of -lrb- the country 's -rrb- cultural presence " in north korea , a place where very little information is available about germany .
the goethe institute is the main arbiter of german culture and language abroad , with 127 institutes in other countries . marianna yahilevich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goethe institute opens doors in kabul germany ’ s international cultural organization , the goethe institute , is poised to re-open in the afghan capital of kabul after 12 years of closure brought on by the rise of the taliban regime .

but at the end of the negotiations , a delicate compromise was reached .
under the agreement , 50 percent of the goethe institute 's literature will focus on science and technology , with the other 50 percent devoted to general media that provides a complete and up-to-date view of germany .
although north korean authorities agreed to give the goethe institute complete control over which media to feature , the new reading room in pyongyang is to be run entirely by local north korean staff .
but schmelter is optimistic that the authorities will adhere to their agreement to allow uncensored and free access to everyone .
historic parallels schmelter also describes what he views as north koreans ’ affinity towards germans .
" the shared fate of living in a divided country for 40 years makes koreans feel very close to germans , " he says .
" in a way , north koreans even consider germans to be their chosen relatives . "
for some like schmelter , this historical parallel is reason enough to see the opening of the goethe institute in north korea as a source of hope for the future .
in a statement , germany 's foreign ministry said the opening of the institute marked an " important expansion of -lrb- the country 's -rrb- cultural presence " in north korea , a place where very little information is available about germany .
the goethe institute is the main arbiter of german culture and language abroad , with 127 institutes in other countries . marianna yahilevich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goethe institute opens doors in kabul germany ’ s international cultural organization , the goethe institute , is poised to re-open in the afghan capital of kabul after 12 years of closure brought on by the rise of the taliban regime .

president bush has likened the u.s.-led war on terror to world war ii ahead of d-day celebrations .
deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments that a dip into history books would have been advisable before his talk . in a speech to 981 air force academy cadets on wednesday , united states president george w. bush said the soldiers were fighting the same war as those who battled the nazis . he also said the war on terror resembled " the great clashes of the last century " between democracy and totalitarianism .
the u.s. president vowed that america would continue to strike terror groups around the world . deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments . there it is again - the comparison that george w. bush used even before the iraq war : the battle against saddam hussein and against terrorism is comparable to world war ii .
the enemies of the united states still believe today , as they did then , that the americans are weak and can be defeated .
but today , much like then , the u.s. will prove they are wrong .
the americans will fight resolutely and not rest until the enemies are crushed . it 's a strident tone that fits the run-up to the d-day ceremony and also the presidential election campaign , but not the political reality in which the u.s. president is ordering his military deployments . sept .
11 was n't and is n't comparable to pearl harbor , the terror groups of osama bin laden are n't comparable to nazi germany .
even saddam hussein 's regime can not and should not be likened to hitler 's . al qaeda 's bloody terror is to be totally condemned and rejected .
but these groups do n't conquer new lands , they do n't perpetrate genocide and they do n't wage a conventional war against the united states or any other country .
not even against israel , which they have declared as their arch enemy . al qaeda perpetrates terror much like other groups before it have done in other places and much like others that will do the same after it .
only the criminal efficiency of al qaeda is much greater than ever before . this is certainly a challenge and not just for the u.s. but it 's by no means a " war . "
and military means is not the only way -lrb- or at least not in the long-term -rrb- to defeat terrorism .
afghanistan has more than clearly demonstrated that .
and what about saddam hussein 's regime ? bush 's father was in a better position to remind one of world war ii when he freed kuwait .
bush junior waged a war without iraq having occupied other countries and without any scrap of proof for his alleged evil plans - right from weapons of mass destruction to the threat of new aggression . even the american officials , whom bush reminded of world war ii , know that the evidence does not exist .
it 's difficult to imagine that they believe bush 's words about a holy mission . and what of the questions of democracy and freedom ? naturally " d-day " was the prelude to the liberation of europe from nazi-german occupation .
but it 's not comparable to the middle east : the only occupier there is called israel and is - at least on its own state territory - the only democracy in the region . the other countries are repressed by their own leaders , who do n't consider giving their people more freedom .
in any case not because saddam hussein was toppled .
what has taken place since saddam 's unseating should be guarantee enough for the arab regimes that washington will not want to wage any further wars in the region . after all , even a year after the war and the appointment of an interim government , democracy in iraq is still a distant dream .
even in this respect bush is wrong .
or he 's making a mistake if he equates " liberation " with " democratization . "
here , one can only advise , and not just him , a glance in the history books . even today in germany one does n't speak of " day of liberation " , but of " defeat " , " capitulation " and similar things .
and that , despite the fact that we 've long become a democracy .
but even this process takes a while : it took four years for germany to frame its constitution and hold its first post-world war ii free elections .
then it took a full ten years until sovereignty was achieved . and in iraq the same should happen overnight ?

president bush has likened the u.s.-led war on terror to world war ii ahead of d-day celebrations .
deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments that a dip into history books would have been advisable before his talk . in a speech to 981 air force academy cadets on wednesday , united states president george w. bush said the soldiers were fighting the same war as those who battled the nazis . he also said the war on terror resembled " the great clashes of the last century " between democracy and totalitarianism .
the u.s. president vowed that america would continue to strike terror groups around the world . deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments . there it is again - the comparison that george w. bush used even before the iraq war : the battle against saddam hussein and against terrorism is comparable to world war ii .
the enemies of the united states still believe today , as they did then , that the americans are weak and can be defeated .
but today , much like then , the u.s. will prove they are wrong .
the americans will fight resolutely and not rest until the enemies are crushed . it 's a strident tone that fits the run-up to the d-day ceremony and also the presidential election campaign , but not the political reality in which the u.s. president is ordering his military deployments . sept .
11 was n't and is n't comparable to pearl harbor , the terror groups of osama bin laden are n't comparable to nazi germany .
even saddam hussein 's regime can not and should not be likened to hitler 's . al qaeda 's bloody terror is to be totally condemned and rejected .
but these groups do n't conquer new lands , they do n't perpetrate genocide and they do n't wage a conventional war against the united states or any other country .
not even against israel , which they have declared as their arch enemy . al qaeda perpetrates terror much like other groups before it have done in other places and much like others that will do the same after it .
only the criminal efficiency of al qaeda is much greater than ever before . this is certainly a challenge and not just for the u.s. but it 's by no means a " war . "
and military means is not the only way -lrb- or at least not in the long-term -rrb- to defeat terrorism .
afghanistan has more than clearly demonstrated that .
and what about saddam hussein 's regime ? bush 's father was in a better position to remind one of world war ii when he freed kuwait .
bush junior waged a war without iraq having occupied other countries and without any scrap of proof for his alleged evil plans - right from weapons of mass destruction to the threat of new aggression . even the american officials , whom bush reminded of world war ii , know that the evidence does not exist .
it 's difficult to imagine that they believe bush 's words about a holy mission . and what of the questions of democracy and freedom ? naturally " d-day " was the prelude to the liberation of europe from nazi-german occupation .
but it 's not comparable to the middle east : the only occupier there is called israel and is - at least on its own state territory - the only democracy in the region . the other countries are repressed by their own leaders , who do n't consider giving their people more freedom .
in any case not because saddam hussein was toppled .
what has taken place since saddam 's unseating should be guarantee enough for the arab regimes that washington will not want to wage any further wars in the region . after all , even a year after the war and the appointment of an interim government , democracy in iraq is still a distant dream .
even in this respect bush is wrong .
or he 's making a mistake if he equates " liberation " with " democratization . "
here , one can only advise , and not just him , a glance in the history books . even today in germany one does n't speak of " day of liberation " , but of " defeat " , " capitulation " and similar things .
and that , despite the fact that we 've long become a democracy .
but even this process takes a while : it took four years for germany to frame its constitution and hold its first post-world war ii free elections .
then it took a full ten years until sovereignty was achieved . and in iraq the same should happen overnight ?
without any kind of democratic past , without experienced and untarnished politicians ? the u.s. president should know that some things just ca n't be compared . peter philipp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism continues despite new resolution on iraq a revised draft for a un resolution on iraq 's future proposed by the u.s. and britain would set a departure date for foreign troops , but some security council members said more changes are still needed .

the enemies of the united states still believe today , as they did then , that the americans are weak and can be defeated .
but today , much like then , the u.s. will prove they are wrong .
the americans will fight resolutely and not rest until the enemies are crushed . it 's a strident tone that fits the run-up to the d-day ceremony and also the presidential election campaign , but not the political reality in which the u.s. president is ordering his military deployments . sept .
11 was n't and is n't comparable to pearl harbor , the terror groups of osama bin laden are n't comparable to nazi germany .
even saddam hussein 's regime can not and should not be likened to hitler 's . al qaeda 's bloody terror is to be totally condemned and rejected .
but these groups do n't conquer new lands , they do n't perpetrate genocide and they do n't wage a conventional war against the united states or any other country .
not even against israel , which they have declared as their arch enemy . al qaeda perpetrates terror much like other groups before it have done in other places and much like others that will do the same after it .
only the criminal efficiency of al qaeda is much greater than ever before . this is certainly a challenge and not just for the u.s. but it 's by no means a " war . "
and military means is not the only way -lrb- or at least not in the long-term -rrb- to defeat terrorism .
afghanistan has more than clearly demonstrated that .
and what about saddam hussein 's regime ? bush 's father was in a better position to remind one of world war ii when he freed kuwait .
bush junior waged a war without iraq having occupied other countries and without any scrap of proof for his alleged evil plans - right from weapons of mass destruction to the threat of new aggression . even the american officials , whom bush reminded of world war ii , know that the evidence does not exist .
it 's difficult to imagine that they believe bush 's words about a holy mission . and what of the questions of democracy and freedom ? naturally " d-day " was the prelude to the liberation of europe from nazi-german occupation .
but it 's not comparable to the middle east : the only occupier there is called israel and is - at least on its own state territory - the only democracy in the region . the other countries are repressed by their own leaders , who do n't consider giving their people more freedom .
in any case not because saddam hussein was toppled .
what has taken place since saddam 's unseating should be guarantee enough for the arab regimes that washington will not want to wage any further wars in the region . after all , even a year after the war and the appointment of an interim government , democracy in iraq is still a distant dream .
even in this respect bush is wrong .
or he 's making a mistake if he equates " liberation " with " democratization . "
here , one can only advise , and not just him , a glance in the history books . even today in germany one does n't speak of " day of liberation " , but of " defeat " , " capitulation " and similar things .
and that , despite the fact that we 've long become a democracy .
but even this process takes a while : it took four years for germany to frame its constitution and hold its first post-world war ii free elections .
then it took a full ten years until sovereignty was achieved . and in iraq the same should happen overnight ?
without any kind of democratic past , without experienced and untarnished politicians ? the u.s. president should know that some things just ca n't be compared . peter philipp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism continues despite new resolution on iraq a revised draft for a un resolution on iraq 's future proposed by the u.s. and britain would set a departure date for foreign troops , but some security council members said more changes are still needed .

the eu 's justice and home affairs commissioner has called for more to be done to find a common policy on immigration across the bloc . five years after a common european asylum and immigration policy was initiated at a summit in the finnish city of tampere , justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino called on his european union colleagues to work towards a " uniform status " for admitting legal migrants for employment purposes into the union and encourage the immigration of more non-eu nationals . speaking in brussels on wednesday , vitorino told the gathered officials that the approach of different member states in the area of asylum and immigration had delayed the creation of a cohesive common policy and specifically stressed the need for the eu to regulate laws on legal immigration for economic reasons . " it is necessary to make headway in terms of economic immigration policy and the right of every member state to fix the number of immigrants , " vitorino said .
" we need collaboration on a european level and must specifically concentrate on the integration of immigrants . " vitorino added that , since the so-called tampere program was introduced in 1999 , which was intended to form a cooperative base for member states on matters such as asylum , immigration and the fight against terrorism , some progress had been made .
the commissioner quoted the implementation of the european arrest warrant as an example of the fruits of tampere 's labor . the commissioner was speaking on the day when the european commission adopted a communication on the results of the tampere program . a second program which will set out further plans for " an area of freedom , security and justice " is expected to be in place by the second half of 2004 despite continuing differences between states on the issues involved .
conflicting views the delay in formulating a common policy stems from conflicting views throughout the bloc .
there is particular controversy in germany where the social democrat government and conservative opposition have negotiated their own immigration law .
the european commission would require member states to take on more immigrants than the current german bill allows . vitorino said the negotiations needed in reaching a unanimous agreement on proposals made the resolving of the issue " complicated " and had led to less ambitious outcomes .
" there have been moments of joy , but also of sorrow and intense depression , " he admitted . human rights group criticizes eu the record of the european union in the area of immigration over the last five years has drawn criticism from human rights organization amnesty international .
a statement from amnesty said that " from a human rights perspective , the picture is not positive . " " the eu has created an area that has diminished the legitimate rights of refugees , that is less secure than it should be because of the lack of human rights safeguards hampering the fight against crime , and that is free for many , but certainly not for all , " the amnesty assessment read .
un body calls for cohesion on refugees the united nations commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- also called on the eu to regulate a common refugee policy to guarantee that those seeking protection from certain crisis regions would be treated on an equal basis everywhere within the bloc .
jean mouchet , the unhcr representative in brussels , added to the statement by telling reporters that some member states , especially the ten new countries admitted at the start of may , urgently needed help to improve their asylum systems . one particular area in which the european union was accused of compromising the rights of immigrants was the bloc 's security agenda .
amnesty criticized the eu for shifting its focus to combating illegal immigration as part of its anti-terror initiatives at the expense of making policies to facilitate legal immigration . the fight against terror goes on , says vitorino vitorino countered the criticism by pledging that the fight against terrorism would remain among the union 's priorities .
he added that the eu would also continue to cooperate in future to shore up the bloc 's external frontiers in the east to prevent unlawful immigration . but he warned germany , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and austria , who want to form a pilot group to increase the fight against terrorism and unlawful immigration , not to consider separatist police actions outside the european union .
he added that any initiative to increase security must be done so as part of a common policy and with the full involvement of all eu member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough on german immigration law after years of acrimonious talks and two failed attempts to push through a controversial immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder managed to secure a deal with the opposition conservatives .

german chancellor gerhard schröder said thursday economic dependency on oil was playing into the hands of terrorists and urged moving to renewable energy .
separately , opec agreed to raise oil production to ease prices . addressing a four-day international conference on renewable energy in bonn , schröder warned that the one-sidedness of the world 's energy sources had made it a target for terror attacks like the ones last week on saudi arabia 's oil facilities .

schröder said the recent attacks in saudi arabia and the continued instability in iraq made it dramatically clear that the availability of a variety of sources of energy was vital to international security . " making renewable energies a mainstream resource is imperative not just for our economies , it is imperative for security in a globalized world , " he said . schröder urged the 3,000 representatives from 154 nations at the conference to diversify into other energy resources and invest in solar , wind and other renewable fuels and added that countries needed to " reorientate the global energy policy . " schröder pointed towards germany 's own achievements in renewable energy : the country is investing some € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- a year to build wind farms , solar panels and tapping geothermal and other alternative sources of energy . some 120,000 people are estimated to be working in germany 's renewables sector .
the country has also reduced its emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases by nearly a fifth . opec decides to hike output referring to the steady rise in oil prices in recent weeks , in particular after the saudi attacks , schröder warned , " higher energy prices damage the chance for economic development .

german chancellor gerhard schröder said thursday economic dependency on oil was playing into the hands of terrorists and urged moving to renewable energy .
separately , opec agreed to raise oil production to ease prices . addressing a four-day international conference on renewable energy in bonn , schröder warned that the one-sidedness of the world 's energy sources had made it a target for terror attacks like the ones last week on saudi arabia 's oil facilities . " we must realize that the world 's overwhelming dependence on oil has enormously increased our vulnerability to this form of terrorism , " schröder said .

schröder said the recent attacks in saudi arabia and the continued instability in iraq made it dramatically clear that the availability of a variety of sources of energy was vital to international security . " making renewable energies a mainstream resource is imperative not just for our economies , it is imperative for security in a globalized world , " he said . schröder urged the 3,000 representatives from 154 nations at the conference to diversify into other energy resources and invest in solar , wind and other renewable fuels and added that countries needed to " reorientate the global energy policy . " schröder pointed towards germany 's own achievements in renewable energy : the country is investing some € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- a year to build wind farms , solar panels and tapping geothermal and other alternative sources of energy . some 120,000 people are estimated to be working in germany 's renewables sector .
the country has also reduced its emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases by nearly a fifth . opec decides to hike output referring to the steady rise in oil prices in recent weeks , in particular after the saudi attacks , schröder warned , " higher energy prices damage the chance for economic development .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.06.2004 smoother flying with laser technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the technology could make air travel safer .
a german research institute has come up with a novel new air traffic device designed to warn pilots about dangerous air turbulence , which could make for safer soaring all round . for all the abstract beauty of white lines slicing through picture book blue skies , the vapor trails which aircraft leave in their wake as they blast through the air are a warning for anything which moves too close .
planes , particularly after take-off , whip up micro-cosmic storms which are powerful enough to throw any unsuspecting aircraft off course , with potentially devastating consequences . as things stand , the world of commercial aviation is governed by a rule which dictates a minimum distance between aircraft of 11.1 kilometers .
but this gap has now been deemed significant enough to merit a solution . with a reduced distance , more planes could take to the skies , which would mean more money for the industry , and take-off and landing delays could be minimized , thus heightening overall airport efficiency .
at least that is how the argument goes .
and based upon it , the fraunhofer institute for applied optics and precision engineering -lrb- iof -rrb- in the german city of jena , has come up with a pocket-sized problem-solver . " if it were possible to measure the position and actual extent of the contrail , the actual safe distance could be adjusted to the actual conditions , which would increase take-off and landing frequency at airports , " said thomas peschel of the iof . smart sensor project i-wake - short for instrumentation wake - is a joint effort between thomas peschel and eight teams from four different countries .
together , the scientists have developed a smart sensor which can tell when the air is calm enough for a safe take-off regardless of the current 11.1 mile restriction .
ultimately the idea is to make the optical scanner a standard fixture , ensuring a fast and accurate way of assessing dangerous levels of turbulence prior to take-off .
a prototype is currently being tested on board a cessna . for all the apparent complexity of the innovation , peschel stresses the simplicity of the technology behind it .

a german research institute has come up with a novel new air traffic device designed to warn pilots about dangerous air turbulence , which could make for safer soaring all round . for all the abstract beauty of white lines slicing through picture book blue skies , the vapor trails which aircraft leave in their wake as they blast through the air are a warning for anything which moves too close .
planes , particularly after take-off , whip up micro-cosmic storms which are powerful enough to throw any unsuspecting aircraft off course , with potentially devastating consequences . as things stand , the world of commercial aviation is governed by a rule which dictates a minimum distance between aircraft of 11.1 kilometers .
but this gap has now been deemed significant enough to merit a solution . with a reduced distance , more planes could take to the skies , which would mean more money for the industry , and take-off and landing delays could be minimized , thus heightening overall airport efficiency .
at least that is how the argument goes .
and based upon it , the fraunhofer institute for applied optics and precision engineering -lrb- iof -rrb- in the german city of jena , has come up with a pocket-sized problem-solver . " if it were possible to measure the position and actual extent of the contrail , the actual safe distance could be adjusted to the actual conditions , which would increase take-off and landing frequency at airports , " said thomas peschel of the iof . smart sensor project i-wake - short for instrumentation wake - is a joint effort between thomas peschel and eight teams from four different countries .
together , the scientists have developed a smart sensor which can tell when the air is calm enough for a safe take-off regardless of the current 11.1 mile restriction .
ultimately the idea is to make the optical scanner a standard fixture , ensuring a fast and accurate way of assessing dangerous levels of turbulence prior to take-off .
a prototype is currently being tested on board a cessna . for all the apparent complexity of the innovation , peschel stresses the simplicity of the technology behind it .

a german research institute has come up with a novel new air traffic device designed to warn pilots about dangerous air turbulence , which could make for safer soaring all round . for all the abstract beauty of white lines slicing through picture book blue skies , the vapor trails which aircraft leave in their wake as they blast through the air are a warning for anything which moves too close .
planes , particularly after take-off , whip up micro-cosmic storms which are powerful enough to throw any unsuspecting aircraft off course , with potentially devastating consequences . as things stand , the world of commercial aviation is governed by a rule which dictates a minimum distance between aircraft of 11.1 kilometers .
but this gap has now been deemed significant enough to merit a solution . with a reduced distance , more planes could take to the skies , which would mean more money for the industry , and take-off and landing delays could be minimized , thus heightening overall airport efficiency .
at least that is how the argument goes .
and based upon it , the fraunhofer institute for applied optics and precision engineering -lrb- iof -rrb- in the german city of jena , has come up with a pocket-sized problem-solver . " if it were possible to measure the position and actual extent of the contrail , the actual safe distance could be adjusted to the actual conditions , which would increase take-off and landing frequency at airports , " said thomas peschel of the iof . smart sensor project i-wake - short for instrumentation wake - is a joint effort between thomas peschel and eight teams from four different countries .
together , the scientists have developed a smart sensor which can tell when the air is calm enough for a safe take-off regardless of the current 11.1 mile restriction .
ultimately the idea is to make the optical scanner a standard fixture , ensuring a fast and accurate way of assessing dangerous levels of turbulence prior to take-off .
a prototype is currently being tested on board a cessna . for all the apparent complexity of the innovation , peschel stresses the simplicity of the technology behind it .
" a laser sends pulses into the air space just ahead of the plane , the light is dispersed on aerosols or dust particles and registered by a detector , " peschel explains .
the effect is that the frequency of the laser pulse changes according to whether the particles of dust are moving towards or away from the beam .
by adjusting the wave lengths of the dispersed laser light , it is possible to tell within fractions of a second whether the air is still turbulent following take-off , or whether it is calm enough for the next plane to hit the skies . " the challenge in developing the device was to be able to use the laser beam to scan the area in front of the plane at a relatively high frequency , " peschel recalls .
in order to achieve this , the team of scientists came up with a small , high-precision mirror which moves back and forth seven and a half times a second , taking the measurements , and consequently the first steps towards filling the skies with yet more traffic . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space shuttle glides to success scientists conducted a successful test of a german-made prototype of a future european space shuttle on saturday .

german chancellor gerhard schröder said thursday economic dependency on oil was playing into the hands of terrorists and urged moving to renewable energy .
separately , opec agreed to raise oil production to ease prices . addressing a four-day international conference on renewable energy in bonn , schröder warned that the one-sidedness of the world 's energy sources had made it a target for terror attacks like the ones last week on saudi arabia 's oil facilities . " we must realize that the world 's overwhelming dependence on oil has enormously increased our vulnerability to this form of terrorism , " schröder said .

schröder said the recent attacks in saudi arabia and the continued instability in iraq made it dramatically clear that the availability of a variety of sources of energy was vital to international security . " making renewable energies a mainstream resource is imperative not just for our economies , it is imperative for security in a globalized world , " he said . schröder urged the 3,000 representatives from 154 nations at the conference to diversify into other energy resources and invest in solar , wind and other renewable fuels and added that countries needed to " reorientate the global energy policy . " schröder pointed towards germany 's own achievements in renewable energy : the country is investing some € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- a year to build wind farms , solar panels and tapping geothermal and other alternative sources of energy . some 120,000 people are estimated to be working in germany 's renewables sector .
the country has also reduced its emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases by nearly a fifth . opec decides to hike output referring to the steady rise in oil prices in recent weeks , in particular after the saudi attacks , schröder warned , " higher energy prices damage the chance for economic development .
they threaten the recovery in developed economies and around the world they hamper the fight against poverty and hunger .

the organization also agreed to raise the target by an additional 500,000 barrels a day in august if it sees a need , it said . opec representatives from qatar , nigeria and the united arab emirates confirmed the decision before the group met for a closed-door meeting to ratify the increase .
in his opening address at the meeting , opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia called on members to do " as much as they can to help stabilize the oil market . " nigerian representative edmund maduabebe daukoru said , " to act as responsible members of the world community , we have to make this strong signal to the market that we are ready to produce to cool the system . " more for alternative energy schröder also backed up his speech with concrete promises of money as he assured that germany would take responsibility for global development . the chancellor vowed germany would provide low-interest loans worth € 500 million between 2005 and 2010 to encourage renewable energy and energy efficiency in developing countries .
the money , channeled through the state development credit agency kredit für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , will go to public , private and semi-public enterprises and local banks , he said . the funds come on top of germany 's pledge of a billion euro until 2010 at the world summit for sustainable development in johannesburg in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first solar-powered ferry shuttle serves the german city of gaienhofen and steckborn on the swiss shore of lake constance .

german chancellor gerhard schröder said thursday economic dependency on oil was playing into the hands of terrorists and urged moving to renewable energy .
separately , opec agreed to raise oil production to ease prices . addressing a four-day international conference on renewable energy in bonn , schröder warned that the one-sidedness of the world 's energy sources had made it a target for terror attacks like the ones last week on saudi arabia 's oil facilities . " we must realize that the world 's overwhelming dependence on oil has enormously increased our vulnerability to this form of terrorism , " schröder said .
the attacks " are directly aimed at striking a vital nerve of humankind , " he added . need for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , right with environment minister jürgen trittin , center , and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul at the renewables conference 2004 in bonn .
schröder said the recent attacks in saudi arabia and the continued instability in iraq made it dramatically clear that the availability of a variety of sources of energy was vital to international security . " making renewable energies a mainstream resource is imperative not just for our economies , it is imperative for security in a globalized world , " he said . schröder urged the 3,000 representatives from 154 nations at the conference to diversify into other energy resources and invest in solar , wind and other renewable fuels and added that countries needed to " reorientate the global energy policy . " schröder pointed towards germany 's own achievements in renewable energy : the country is investing some € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- a year to build wind farms , solar panels and tapping geothermal and other alternative sources of energy . some 120,000 people are estimated to be working in germany 's renewables sector .
the country has also reduced its emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases by nearly a fifth . opec decides to hike output referring to the steady rise in oil prices in recent weeks , in particular after the saudi attacks , schröder warned , " higher energy prices damage the chance for economic development .
they threaten the recovery in developed economies and around the world they hamper the fight against poverty and hunger .

the organization also agreed to raise the target by an additional 500,000 barrels a day in august if it sees a need , it said . opec representatives from qatar , nigeria and the united arab emirates confirmed the decision before the group met for a closed-door meeting to ratify the increase .
in his opening address at the meeting , opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia called on members to do " as much as they can to help stabilize the oil market . " nigerian representative edmund maduabebe daukoru said , " to act as responsible members of the world community , we have to make this strong signal to the market that we are ready to produce to cool the system . " more for alternative energy schröder also backed up his speech with concrete promises of money as he assured that germany would take responsibility for global development . the chancellor vowed germany would provide low-interest loans worth € 500 million between 2005 and 2010 to encourage renewable energy and energy efficiency in developing countries .
the money , channeled through the state development credit agency kredit für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , will go to public , private and semi-public enterprises and local banks , he said . the funds come on top of germany 's pledge of a billion euro until 2010 at the world summit for sustainable development in johannesburg in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first solar-powered ferry shuttle serves the german city of gaienhofen and steckborn on the swiss shore of lake constance .

while stalwart goalkeeper oliver kahn mulls a possible move to manchester united , midfielder ballack - who cost the bavarian giants € 6.5 million -lrb- $ 11.4 million -rrb- two years ago when he moved from bayer leverkusen - has been given permission by the german federation speak to barcelona president joan laporta and his deputy sandro rosell .
ballack will travel to zurich for the meeting after germany 's international warm-up against hungary on sunday .
the barcelona president has reportedly made a € 15 million bid for ballack and is also chasing bayer leverkusen midfielder and fellow german international bernd schneider .
bayern munich chief franz beckenbauer said last week ballack could go if the two clubs struck a deal but bayern 's new coach felix magath was opposed to the move . more briefs 02.06.2004 -pipe- life expectancy rate increases for german men 02.06.2004 -pipe- court hears triple murder case 14.05.2004 -pipe- matthäus in talks with istanbul 11.05.2004 -pipe- is europe striving to be too much like u.s. ? 10.05.2004 -pipe- british veterans oppose schröder d-day visit 27.04.2004 -pipe- berlin offers aid in north korea blast 16.04.2004 -pipe- germans refuse to pay new fee for doctor 's visit 14.04.2004 -pipe- rent-a-crowd a hit on soccer circuit radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

today they are a commodity .
but there still are ways to stand out from the crowd : either by refusing to own a phone altogether , or by spending € 3500 euro for a vertu . it has become hard to impress people with a mobile phone lately .
getting a call on a trendy handset alone certainly wo n't do the trick anymore .
the same goes for funky gadgets to pep up the drab phones like cameras , ring tones or messaging services .
soon after these are released , everyone appears to have them , and instead of being part of the handset avantgarde , the mobile phone afficionado is thrown back into the faceless pool of ordinary handset users .
but thanks to nokia , there is a way for the handset lover to distinguish oneself from the masses .
it is called vertu and comes with a hefty price tag .
the self-proclaimed " first luxury communication company " was launched two years ago as a spin-off by nokia , the world 's largest handset-maker .
the ties to the finnish mother company , however , are kept almost as secret as vertu 's sales or revenue figures .
" we are not allowed to give any sales figure " , daniela wübbeke , the company 's spokesperson for germany , told dw-world .
no gimmicks deep pockets are required to own a vertu phone .
the more affordable " ascent " collection geared towards a younger clientele and launched this year comes in at € 3500 .
the more expensive " signature " collection starts at € 5000 euro for the regular handset and goes up to € 24,000 for the platinum version .
no camera , no video and no radio .
what then , besides the price , makes a vertu so special ?
" each phone consists of 400 separate parts that are put together manually , " explains wübbeke . vertu tries to set itself apart by working with materials commonly not associated with handsets .
" the leather we use for the phones stems from the same people that supply luxury carmakers rolls royce and bentley . "
other materials used are liquidmetal , sapphire , ceramic , gold and silver .
" our phones last at least 15 to 20 years because we use only the best material and refined technology , " says wübbeke .
technology is also the reason vertu phones lack features like cameras , wap or gprs .
" our first collection came without a color display , but as soon as the technology was refined enough , we gave all our customers the option of equipping their phones free of charge with a color display . "
beckham 's concierge another virtu freebie for the first year is the concierge button on every phone .
by pushing it customers are put through to a 24-hour hotline that attends to the callers needs .
whether it is a hotel reservation or getting tickets for otherwise sold out events , the concierge service will try to fulfil requests vertu owners like madonna , gwyneth paltrow or david beckham may have .
while some female celebrities are vertu customers , the majority of vertu owners , at least in germany , are male , says christine meister , who runs the luxury jeweller store brahmfeld & gutrof on the ritzy german resort island sylt .
" men , especially those you also enjoy luxury cars , like vertu more than women do , " she points out .
" many of our customers already own a rolls royce .
for them a vertu phone is a similar status symbol , and by having it , they possess something that other people do n't . "
pricy headset however , success in this market is anything but certain .
just consider the fate of so called fashion-phone xelibri from siemens .
the claim that " xelibri lives on a totally different planet from the technology driven mobile phone brands that exist today " was validated a week ago , when siemens pulled the plug on the brand after only two collections .
according to media reports , the demand for models like the xelibri 6 that let 's one " talk on the phone and apply makeup simultaneously " was weak .
vertu 's future looks bright , insists wübbeke .

today they are a commodity .
but there still are ways to stand out from the crowd : either by refusing to own a phone altogether , or by spending € 3500 euro for a vertu . it has become hard to impress people with a mobile phone lately .
getting a call on a trendy handset alone certainly wo n't do the trick anymore .
the same goes for funky gadgets to pep up the drab phones like cameras , ring tones or messaging services .
soon after these are released , everyone appears to have them , and instead of being part of the handset avantgarde , the mobile phone afficionado is thrown back into the faceless pool of ordinary handset users .
but thanks to nokia , there is a way for the handset lover to distinguish oneself from the masses .
it is called vertu and comes with a hefty price tag .
the self-proclaimed " first luxury communication company " was launched two years ago as a spin-off by nokia , the world 's largest handset-maker .
the ties to the finnish mother company , however , are kept almost as secret as vertu 's sales or revenue figures .
" we are not allowed to give any sales figure " , daniela wübbeke , the company 's spokesperson for germany , told dw-world .
no gimmicks deep pockets are required to own a vertu phone .
the more affordable " ascent " collection geared towards a younger clientele and launched this year comes in at € 3500 .
the more expensive " signature " collection starts at € 5000 euro for the regular handset and goes up to € 24,000 for the platinum version .
no camera , no video and no radio .
what then , besides the price , makes a vertu so special ?
" each phone consists of 400 separate parts that are put together manually , " explains wübbeke . vertu tries to set itself apart by working with materials commonly not associated with handsets .
" the leather we use for the phones stems from the same people that supply luxury carmakers rolls royce and bentley . "
other materials used are liquidmetal , sapphire , ceramic , gold and silver .
" our phones last at least 15 to 20 years because we use only the best material and refined technology , " says wübbeke .
technology is also the reason vertu phones lack features like cameras , wap or gprs .
" our first collection came without a color display , but as soon as the technology was refined enough , we gave all our customers the option of equipping their phones free of charge with a color display . "
beckham 's concierge another virtu freebie for the first year is the concierge button on every phone .
by pushing it customers are put through to a 24-hour hotline that attends to the callers needs .
whether it is a hotel reservation or getting tickets for otherwise sold out events , the concierge service will try to fulfil requests vertu owners like madonna , gwyneth paltrow or david beckham may have .
while some female celebrities are vertu customers , the majority of vertu owners , at least in germany , are male , says christine meister , who runs the luxury jeweller store brahmfeld & gutrof on the ritzy german resort island sylt .
" men , especially those you also enjoy luxury cars , like vertu more than women do , " she points out .
" many of our customers already own a rolls royce .
for them a vertu phone is a similar status symbol , and by having it , they possess something that other people do n't . "
pricy headset however , success in this market is anything but certain .
just consider the fate of so called fashion-phone xelibri from siemens .
the claim that " xelibri lives on a totally different planet from the technology driven mobile phone brands that exist today " was validated a week ago , when siemens pulled the plug on the brand after only two collections .
according to media reports , the demand for models like the xelibri 6 that let 's one " talk on the phone and apply makeup simultaneously " was weak .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.06.2004 powering ahead with renewable energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delegates at renewables 2004 in bonn are looking to a greener and brighter future .
as the international conference for the promotion of renewable energies enters its third day in bonn , the german chancellor gerhard schröder is preparing to bang his drum for a cause close to his heart . the chancellor proposed the meeting after the 2002 world summit for sustainable development in the south african city of johannesburg failed to buckle under european pressure to draw up timetables and targets for boosting renewable energy use .
this time around , delegates at the four-day conference in bonn aim to come up with an " international action program , " setting out specific commitments by individual governments and the international community .
environment minister jürgen trittin told the 3,000 conference delegates wednesday that renewable energy sources could be the solution to poverty and climate change across the world .
" we need an accelerated global increase in the use of renewable energies , " he said . " we must get down to business .
we must enable this global increase to become reality , to combat global poverty , to combat global warming .
let 's make it real . "
concrete steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants in the renewables 2004 conference attend a session in germany 's former parliament building in bonn .
on wednesday , 350 parliamentarians from more than 70 countries took a significant step towards pushing renewable energy sources further towards the mainstream when they released a document calling for the establishment of an international renewable energy agency modeled after the international atomic agency in vienna .
german parliamentarian and president of the eurosolar organization for renewables , hermann scheer , believes it is the only logical way forward .
" intergovernemtal agencies exist for the promotion of atomic energy , for the promotion of fossil energy , but not exclusively for renewable energies , " scheer told deutsche welle . " and this bias is one of the reasons why the dissemination of renewable energies does n't come through world-wide and why much misinformation is filling decision-maker 's minds . "
broad agreement remarkably , german politicians across the political spectrum have agreed on the fundamental ideas of the new agency , as have parliamentarians from countries such as pakistan and nigeria .the precise content of the action plan is still unclear , but germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , co-host of the bonn conference , has her sights set ambitiously high .
she wants to see half the world using renewable energy sources by the year 2050 , and not only for geo-political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- spd -rrb- and environment minister jürgen trittin open the conference in bonn .
" i think it could be possible to give one billion energy-poor people access to renewable energy .
it might be ambitious , but it would also prevent other conflicts , make us less dependent on centralised powers , and fight climate change .

as the international conference for the promotion of renewable energies enters its third day in bonn , the german chancellor gerhard schröder is preparing to bang his drum for a cause close to his heart . the chancellor proposed the meeting after the 2002 world summit for sustainable development in the south african city of johannesburg failed to buckle under european pressure to draw up timetables and targets for boosting renewable energy use .
this time around , delegates at the four-day conference in bonn aim to come up with an " international action program , " setting out specific commitments by individual governments and the international community .
environment minister jürgen trittin told the 3,000 conference delegates wednesday that renewable energy sources could be the solution to poverty and climate change across the world .
" we need an accelerated global increase in the use of renewable energies , " he said . " we must get down to business .
we must enable this global increase to become reality , to combat global poverty , to combat global warming .

on wednesday , 350 parliamentarians from more than 70 countries took a significant step towards pushing renewable energy sources further towards the mainstream when they released a document calling for the establishment of an international renewable energy agency modeled after the international atomic agency in vienna .

" and this bias is one of the reasons why the dissemination of renewable energies does n't come through world-wide and why much misinformation is filling decision-maker 's minds . "
broad agreement remarkably , german politicians across the political spectrum have agreed on the fundamental ideas of the new agency , as have parliamentarians from countries such as pakistan and nigeria .the precise content of the action plan is still unclear , but germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , co-host of the bonn conference , has her sights set ambitiously high .
she wants to see half the world using renewable energy sources by the year 2050 , and not only for geo-political reasons .

"
a new german movie star is attempting to do what compatriots til schweiger and others failed to do - crack hollywood .
his first film is a huge hit which will keep him in cheese for the rest of his life . the latest german actor to try and break hollywood has got off to an extremely successful start .
the film he makes his debut in , harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban , the third instalment in the series that follows the magical adventures of the boy wizard , has already grossed a hugely impressive € 9.8 million -lrb- $ 12 million , £ 5 million -rrb- on the first day of its release in britain alone .
the global appeal of the characters made famous by the novels by j.k. rowling will almost certainly give the latest german star a box office smash when the figures start to role in from the film 's worldwide release on june 4 . so who is germany 's newest favorite son of the cinema ?
well , his name remains shrouded in mystery but he will be known from now on by that of the character he plays - scabbers the rat .
germany 's latest movie star is a west african rodent who was plucked from the relative obscurity of the berlin zoo to play the somewhat disheveled and perpetually somnolent pet of hogwarts student ron weasley , the best friend of harry potter . rat not fazed by famous co-stars after finding his way into movies through an animal casting agency , " scabbers " was shipped over to england with an understudy to join actors daniel radcliffe , emma watson and rupert grint on the set of the new potter movie .
it is the german rat 's big break after beginning his acting career at the tender age of six weeks .
" scabbers " plays the mangy 12-year-old comedy sidekick alongside the more intense snowy owl " hedwig " and impressive " crookshanks " the cat . but it seems that appearing with such esteemed colleagues , as well as cgi-created phantoms and fantastic beasts like buckbeak the hippogriff , has not fazed the nine-year-old rodent .
reports suggest that " scabbers " is very settled in england where he has remained since the end of shooting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de harry potter speaks german harry potter fans in germany couldn ’ t wait for the just-published fifth book by j.k. rowling to appear on the german market .

"
a new german movie star is attempting to do what compatriots til schweiger and others failed to do - crack hollywood .
his first film is a huge hit which will keep him in cheese for the rest of his life . the latest german actor to try and break hollywood has got off to an extremely successful start .
the film he makes his debut in , harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban , the third instalment in the series that follows the magical adventures of the boy wizard , has already grossed a hugely impressive € 9.8 million -lrb- $ 12 million , £ 5 million -rrb- on the first day of its release in britain alone .
the global appeal of the characters made famous by the novels by j.k. rowling will almost certainly give the latest german star a box office smash when the figures start to role in from the film 's worldwide release on june 4 . so who is germany 's newest favorite son of the cinema ?
well , his name remains shrouded in mystery but he will be known from now on by that of the character he plays - scabbers the rat .
germany 's latest movie star is a west african rodent who was plucked from the relative obscurity of the berlin zoo to play the somewhat disheveled and perpetually somnolent pet of hogwarts student ron weasley , the best friend of harry potter . rat not fazed by famous co-stars after finding his way into movies through an animal casting agency , " scabbers " was shipped over to england with an understudy to join actors daniel radcliffe , emma watson and rupert grint on the set of the new potter movie .
it is the german rat 's big break after beginning his acting career at the tender age of six weeks .
" scabbers " plays the mangy 12-year-old comedy sidekick alongside the more intense snowy owl " hedwig " and impressive " crookshanks " the cat . but it seems that appearing with such esteemed colleagues , as well as cgi-created phantoms and fantastic beasts like buckbeak the hippogriff , has not fazed the nine-year-old rodent .

president bush has likened the u.s.-led war on terror to world war ii ahead of d-day celebrations .
deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments that a dip into history books would have been advisable before his talk . in a speech to 981 air force academy cadets on wednesday , united states president george w. bush said the soldiers were fighting the same war as those who battled the nazis . he also said the war on terror resembled " the great clashes of the last century " between democracy and totalitarianism .
the u.s. president vowed that america would continue to strike terror groups around the world . deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments . there it is again - the comparison that george w. bush used even before the iraq war : the battle against saddam hussein and against terrorism is comparable to world war ii .
the enemies of the united states still believe today , as they did then , that the americans are weak and can be defeated .
but today , much like then , the u.s. will prove they are wrong .
the americans will fight resolutely and not rest until the enemies are crushed . it 's a strident tone that fits the run-up to the d-day ceremony and also the presidential election campaign , but not the political reality in which the u.s. president is ordering his military deployments . sept .
11 was n't and is n't comparable to pearl harbor , the terror groups of osama bin laden are n't comparable to nazi germany .
even saddam hussein 's regime can not and should not be likened to hitler 's . al qaeda 's bloody terror is to be totally condemned and rejected .
but these groups do n't conquer new lands , they do n't perpetrate genocide and they do n't wage a conventional war against the united states or any other country .
not even against israel , which they have declared as their arch enemy . al qaeda perpetrates terror much like other groups before it have done in other places and much like others that will do the same after it .
only the criminal efficiency of al qaeda is much greater than ever before . this is certainly a challenge and not just for the u.s. but it 's by no means a " war . "
and military means is not the only way -lrb- or at least not in the long-term -rrb- to defeat terrorism .
afghanistan has more than clearly demonstrated that .
and what about saddam hussein 's regime ? bush 's father was in a better position to remind one of world war ii when he freed kuwait .
bush junior waged a war without iraq having occupied other countries and without any scrap of proof for his alleged evil plans - right from weapons of mass destruction to the threat of new aggression . even the american officials , whom bush reminded of world war ii , know that the evidence does not exist .
it 's difficult to imagine that they believe bush 's words about a holy mission . and what of the questions of democracy and freedom ? naturally " d-day " was the prelude to the liberation of europe from nazi-german occupation .
but it 's not comparable to the middle east : the only occupier there is called israel and is - at least on its own state territory - the only democracy in the region . the other countries are repressed by their own leaders , who do n't consider giving their people more freedom .
in any case not because saddam hussein was toppled .
what has taken place since saddam 's unseating should be guarantee enough for the arab regimes that washington will not want to wage any further wars in the region . after all , even a year after the war and the appointment of an interim government , democracy in iraq is still a distant dream .
even in this respect bush is wrong .
or he 's making a mistake if he equates " liberation " with " democratization . "
here , one can only advise , and not just him , a glance in the history books . even today in germany one does n't speak of " day of liberation " , but of " defeat " , " capitulation " and similar things .
and that , despite the fact that we 've long become a democracy .
but even this process takes a while : it took four years for germany to frame its constitution and hold its first post-world war ii free elections .
then it took a full ten years until sovereignty was achieved . and in iraq the same should happen overnight ?
without any kind of democratic past , without experienced and untarnished politicians ? the u.s. president should know that some things just ca n't be compared . peter philipp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism continues despite new resolution on iraq a revised draft for a un resolution on iraq 's future proposed by the u.s. and britain would set a departure date for foreign troops , but some security council members said more changes are still needed .

a german research institute has come up with a novel new air traffic device designed to warn pilots about dangerous air turbulence , which could make for safer soaring all round . for all the abstract beauty of white lines slicing through picture book blue skies , the vapor trails which aircraft leave in their wake as they blast through the air are a warning for anything which moves too close .
planes , particularly after take-off , whip up micro-cosmic storms which are powerful enough to throw any unsuspecting aircraft off course , with potentially devastating consequences . as things stand , the world of commercial aviation is governed by a rule which dictates a minimum distance between aircraft of 11.1 kilometers .
but this gap has now been deemed significant enough to merit a solution . with a reduced distance , more planes could take to the skies , which would mean more money for the industry , and take-off and landing delays could be minimized , thus heightening overall airport efficiency .
at least that is how the argument goes .
and based upon it , the fraunhofer institute for applied optics and precision engineering -lrb- iof -rrb- in the german city of jena , has come up with a pocket-sized problem-solver . " if it were possible to measure the position and actual extent of the contrail , the actual safe distance could be adjusted to the actual conditions , which would increase take-off and landing frequency at airports , " said thomas peschel of the iof . smart sensor project i-wake - short for instrumentation wake - is a joint effort between thomas peschel and eight teams from four different countries .
together , the scientists have developed a smart sensor which can tell when the air is calm enough for a safe take-off regardless of the current 11.1 mile restriction .
ultimately the idea is to make the optical scanner a standard fixture , ensuring a fast and accurate way of assessing dangerous levels of turbulence prior to take-off .
a prototype is currently being tested on board a cessna . for all the apparent complexity of the innovation , peschel stresses the simplicity of the technology behind it .
" a laser sends pulses into the air space just ahead of the plane , the light is dispersed on aerosols or dust particles and registered by a detector , " peschel explains .
the effect is that the frequency of the laser pulse changes according to whether the particles of dust are moving towards or away from the beam .
by adjusting the wave lengths of the dispersed laser light , it is possible to tell within fractions of a second whether the air is still turbulent following take-off , or whether it is calm enough for the next plane to hit the skies . " the challenge in developing the device was to be able to use the laser beam to scan the area in front of the plane at a relatively high frequency , " peschel recalls .
in order to achieve this , the team of scientists came up with a small , high-precision mirror which moves back and forth seven and a half times a second , taking the measurements , and consequently the first steps towards filling the skies with yet more traffic . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space shuttle glides to success scientists conducted a successful test of a german-made prototype of a future european space shuttle on saturday .

bush junior waged a war without iraq having occupied other countries and without any scrap of proof for his alleged evil plans - right from weapons of mass destruction to the threat of new aggression . even the american officials , whom bush reminded of world war ii , know that the evidence does not exist .
it 's difficult to imagine that they believe bush 's words about a holy mission . and what of the questions of democracy and freedom ? naturally " d-day " was the prelude to the liberation of europe from nazi-german occupation .
but it 's not comparable to the middle east : the only occupier there is called israel and is - at least on its own state territory - the only democracy in the region . the other countries are repressed by their own leaders , who do n't consider giving their people more freedom .
in any case not because saddam hussein was toppled .
what has taken place since saddam 's unseating should be guarantee enough for the arab regimes that washington will not want to wage any further wars in the region . after all , even a year after the war and the appointment of an interim government , democracy in iraq is still a distant dream .
even in this respect bush is wrong .
or he 's making a mistake if he equates " liberation " with " democratization . "
here , one can only advise , and not just him , a glance in the history books . even today in germany one does n't speak of " day of liberation " , but of " defeat " , " capitulation " and similar things .
and that , despite the fact that we 've long become a democracy .
but even this process takes a while : it took four years for germany to frame its constitution and hold its first post-world war ii free elections .
then it took a full ten years until sovereignty was achieved . and in iraq the same should happen overnight ?
without any kind of democratic past , without experienced and untarnished politicians ? the u.s. president should know that some things just ca n't be compared . peter philipp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism continues despite new resolution on iraq a revised draft for a un resolution on iraq 's future proposed by the u.s. and britain would set a departure date for foreign troops , but some security council members said more changes are still needed .

steps have been taken to dam the flow , but the next wave is already gathering strength . a huge crest of paperwork is rolling towards the european commission , threatening to swamp the 25,000 civil servants working in brussels .
last year , the arduous bureaucrats churned out more paper than ever before : 1.5 million pages had to be translated into what were then the 11 official eu languages .
now the translators are sinking in the vast ocean of work backing up behind them .
at last count , they were 60,000 pages behind , and if the momentum continues at the same pace , that could soon increase to 300,000 . keep it short ! the eu wants to drastically reduce the flow of work to be translated , and has issued an edict instructing beavering bureaucrats to reduce the length of " memorandums " - the official title for commission texts - from the current average of 50 pages to a mere 15 . " keep it short ! " is the new motto among the brussels insiders , a throwback to the days of public telephone boxes long before mobile phone become a mainstream play thing .
each year the pile of papers grows by about five percent .
and eu commissioner neil kinnock admits that if things continue as they are , it will be the death of the translation department . already , the translation department is the biggest single eu installation .
more than 2,400 translators transfer their colleagues ' warblings into the now 20 official languages , from finnish to maltese to slovenian .
although the number of translators working there was upped with expansion at the start of may , the eu personnel department did n't manage to get enough qualified staff onboard in advance of expansion .
despite seven years of planning , there were apparently not enough qualified translators available , or at least that is the line commissioner kinnock is sticking to . language acrobats rather than take on hundreds and hundreds of extra translators , the plan is to increase the productivity of the translation service by 40 percent by the end of 2006 .
internal working papers are now only translated into english , french or german , but everything that leaves the building to go to citizens , companies or courts has to be translated - and precisely . some of the new member states have already started grumbling that their language is not taken seriously enough by the commission .
and in some places , the internet presence of the nine new languages could serve to back their complaints .
the language acrobats back at base , however , claim this is only a transitional phase . but in 2007 , bulgarian , rumanian and maybe even croatia will join the swelling linguistic ranks of the union .
with a couple of years warning , there is ample time for the commission to go in search of translators who can work , let 's say from estonian into turkish .
if turkey were to join the eu at some point over the next ten or 15 years , it 's high population would mean it brought with it one of the most widely spoken languages .
it is not only the commission , but also the other institutions , such as the european council , the parliament and the european court of justice in luxembourg with massive translation departments .
and they , too , are feeling the force of the surging workload . flood on the horizon the next floods are already gathering strength on the horizon .
spain is currently applying to have catalan , galician and basque recognized as official eu languages .

but today , much like then , the u.s. will prove they are wrong .
the americans will fight resolutely and not rest until the enemies are crushed . it 's a strident tone that fits the run-up to the d-day ceremony and also the presidential election campaign , but not the political reality in which the u.s. president is ordering his military deployments . sept .
11 was n't and is n't comparable to pearl harbor , the terror groups of osama bin laden are n't comparable to nazi germany .
even saddam hussein 's regime can not and should not be likened to hitler 's . al qaeda 's bloody terror is to be totally condemned and rejected .
but these groups do n't conquer new lands , they do n't perpetrate genocide and they do n't wage a conventional war against the united states or any other country .
not even against israel , which they have declared as their arch enemy . al qaeda perpetrates terror much like other groups before it have done in other places and much like others that will do the same after it .
only the criminal efficiency of al qaeda is much greater than ever before . this is certainly a challenge and not just for the u.s. but it 's by no means a " war . "
and military means is not the only way -lrb- or at least not in the long-term -rrb- to defeat terrorism .
afghanistan has more than clearly demonstrated that .
and what about saddam hussein 's regime ? bush 's father was in a better position to remind one of world war ii when he freed kuwait .
bush junior waged a war without iraq having occupied other countries and without any scrap of proof for his alleged evil plans - right from weapons of mass destruction to the threat of new aggression . even the american officials , whom bush reminded of world war ii , know that the evidence does not exist .
it 's difficult to imagine that they believe bush 's words about a holy mission . and what of the questions of democracy and freedom ? naturally " d-day " was the prelude to the liberation of europe from nazi-german occupation .
but it 's not comparable to the middle east : the only occupier there is called israel and is - at least on its own state territory - the only democracy in the region . the other countries are repressed by their own leaders , who do n't consider giving their people more freedom .
in any case not because saddam hussein was toppled .
what has taken place since saddam 's unseating should be guarantee enough for the arab regimes that washington will not want to wage any further wars in the region . after all , even a year after the war and the appointment of an interim government , democracy in iraq is still a distant dream .
even in this respect bush is wrong .
or he 's making a mistake if he equates " liberation " with " democratization . "
here , one can only advise , and not just him , a glance in the history books . even today in germany one does n't speak of " day of liberation " , but of " defeat " , " capitulation " and similar things .
and that , despite the fact that we 've long become a democracy .
but even this process takes a while : it took four years for germany to frame its constitution and hold its first post-world war ii free elections .
then it took a full ten years until sovereignty was achieved . and in iraq the same should happen overnight ?
without any kind of democratic past , without experienced and untarnished politicians ? the u.s. president should know that some things just ca n't be compared . peter philipp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism continues despite new resolution on iraq a revised draft for a un resolution on iraq 's future proposed by the u.s. and britain would set a departure date for foreign troops , but some security council members said more changes are still needed .
-lrb- june 2 , 2004 -rrb- schröder : d-day is a symbol of freedom chancellor schröder lauded the 60th anniversary celebrations of the 1944 allied landings in normandy as a symbol of the fight for freedom and democracy .

german chancellor gerhard schröder said thursday economic dependency on oil was playing into the hands of terrorists and urged moving to renewable energy .
separately , opec agreed to raise oil production to ease prices . addressing a four-day international conference on renewable energy in bonn , schröder warned that the one-sidedness of the world 's energy sources had made it a target for terror attacks like the ones last week on saudi arabia 's oil facilities . " we must realize that the world 's overwhelming dependence on oil has enormously increased our vulnerability to this form of terrorism , " schröder said .
the attacks " are directly aimed at striking a vital nerve of humankind , " he added . need for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , right with environment minister jürgen trittin , center , and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul at the renewables conference 2004 in bonn .
schröder said the recent attacks in saudi arabia and the continued instability in iraq made it dramatically clear that the availability of a variety of sources of energy was vital to international security . " making renewable energies a mainstream resource is imperative not just for our economies , it is imperative for security in a globalized world , " he said . schröder urged the 3,000 representatives from 154 nations at the conference to diversify into other energy resources and invest in solar , wind and other renewable fuels and added that countries needed to " reorientate the global energy policy . " schröder pointed towards germany 's own achievements in renewable energy : the country is investing some € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- a year to build wind farms , solar panels and tapping geothermal and other alternative sources of energy . some 120,000 people are estimated to be working in germany 's renewables sector .
the country has also reduced its emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases by nearly a fifth . opec decides to hike output referring to the steady rise in oil prices in recent weeks , in particular after the saudi attacks , schröder warned , " higher energy prices damage the chance for economic development .

at the same time the german chancellor welcomed opec 's -lrb- organization of petroleum exporting countries -rrb- decision thursday to raise its production ceiling by two million barrels a day in july in a bid to bring down spiraling prices of crude oil .
the organization also agreed to raise the target by an additional 500,000 barrels a day in august if it sees a need , it said . opec representatives from qatar , nigeria and the united arab emirates confirmed the decision before the group met for a closed-door meeting to ratify the increase .
in his opening address at the meeting , opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia called on members to do " as much as they can to help stabilize the oil market . " nigerian representative edmund maduabebe daukoru said , " to act as responsible members of the world community , we have to make this strong signal to the market that we are ready to produce to cool the system . " more for alternative energy schröder also backed up his speech with concrete promises of money as he assured that germany would take responsibility for global development . the chancellor vowed germany would provide low-interest loans worth € 500 million between 2005 and 2010 to encourage renewable energy and energy efficiency in developing countries .
the money , channeled through the state development credit agency kredit für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , will go to public , private and semi-public enterprises and local banks , he said . the funds come on top of germany 's pledge of a billion euro until 2010 at the world summit for sustainable development in johannesburg in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first solar-powered ferry shuttle serves the german city of gaienhofen and steckborn on the swiss shore of lake constance .

german chancellor gerhard schröder said thursday economic dependency on oil was playing into the hands of terrorists and urged moving to renewable energy .
separately , opec agreed to raise oil production to ease prices . addressing a four-day international conference on renewable energy in bonn , schröder warned that the one-sidedness of the world 's energy sources had made it a target for terror attacks like the ones last week on saudi arabia 's oil facilities . " we must realize that the world 's overwhelming dependence on oil has enormously increased our vulnerability to this form of terrorism , " schröder said .
the attacks " are directly aimed at striking a vital nerve of humankind , " he added . need for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , right with environment minister jürgen trittin , center , and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul at the renewables conference 2004 in bonn .
schröder said the recent attacks in saudi arabia and the continued instability in iraq made it dramatically clear that the availability of a variety of sources of energy was vital to international security . " making renewable energies a mainstream resource is imperative not just for our economies , it is imperative for security in a globalized world , " he said . schröder urged the 3,000 representatives from 154 nations at the conference to diversify into other energy resources and invest in solar , wind and other renewable fuels and added that countries needed to " reorientate the global energy policy . " schröder pointed towards germany 's own achievements in renewable energy : the country is investing some € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- a year to build wind farms , solar panels and tapping geothermal and other alternative sources of energy . some 120,000 people are estimated to be working in germany 's renewables sector .
the country has also reduced its emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases by nearly a fifth . opec decides to hike output referring to the steady rise in oil prices in recent weeks , in particular after the saudi attacks , schröder warned , " higher energy prices damage the chance for economic development .

the organization also agreed to raise the target by an additional 500,000 barrels a day in august if it sees a need , it said . opec representatives from qatar , nigeria and the united arab emirates confirmed the decision before the group met for a closed-door meeting to ratify the increase .
in his opening address at the meeting , opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia called on members to do " as much as they can to help stabilize the oil market . " nigerian representative edmund maduabebe daukoru said , " to act as responsible members of the world community , we have to make this strong signal to the market that we are ready to produce to cool the system . " more for alternative energy schröder also backed up his speech with concrete promises of money as he assured that germany would take responsibility for global development . the chancellor vowed germany would provide low-interest loans worth € 500 million between 2005 and 2010 to encourage renewable energy and energy efficiency in developing countries .
the money , channeled through the state development credit agency kredit für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , will go to public , private and semi-public enterprises and local banks , he said . the funds come on top of germany 's pledge of a billion euro until 2010 at the world summit for sustainable development in johannesburg in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first solar-powered ferry shuttle serves the german city of gaienhofen and steckborn on the swiss shore of lake constance .

steps have been taken to dam the flow , but the next wave is already gathering strength . a huge crest of paperwork is rolling towards the european commission , threatening to swamp the 25,000 civil servants working in brussels .
last year , the arduous bureaucrats churned out more paper than ever before : 1.5 million pages had to be translated into what were then the 11 official eu languages .
now the translators are sinking in the vast ocean of work backing up behind them .
at last count , they were 60,000 pages behind , and if the momentum continues at the same pace , that could soon increase to 300,000 . keep it short ! the eu wants to drastically reduce the flow of work to be translated , and has issued an edict instructing beavering bureaucrats to reduce the length of " memorandums " - the official title for commission texts - from the current average of 50 pages to a mere 15 . " keep it short ! " is the new motto among the brussels insiders , a throwback to the days of public telephone boxes long before mobile phone become a mainstream play thing .
each year the pile of papers grows by about five percent .
and eu commissioner neil kinnock admits that if things continue as they are , it will be the death of the translation department . already , the translation department is the biggest single eu installation .
more than 2,400 translators transfer their colleagues ' warblings into the now 20 official languages , from finnish to maltese to slovenian .
although the number of translators working there was upped with expansion at the start of may , the eu personnel department did n't manage to get enough qualified staff onboard in advance of expansion .
despite seven years of planning , there were apparently not enough qualified translators available , or at least that is the line commissioner kinnock is sticking to . language acrobats rather than take on hundreds and hundreds of extra translators , the plan is to increase the productivity of the translation service by 40 percent by the end of 2006 .
internal working papers are now only translated into english , french or german , but everything that leaves the building to go to citizens , companies or courts has to be translated - and precisely . some of the new member states have already started grumbling that their language is not taken seriously enough by the commission .
and in some places , the internet presence of the nine new languages could serve to back their complaints .
the language acrobats back at base , however , claim this is only a transitional phase . but in 2007 , bulgarian , rumanian and maybe even croatia will join the swelling linguistic ranks of the union .
with a couple of years warning , there is ample time for the commission to go in search of translators who can work , let 's say from estonian into turkish .
if turkey were to join the eu at some point over the next ten or 15 years , it 's high population would mean it brought with it one of the most widely spoken languages .
it is not only the commission , but also the other institutions , such as the european council , the parliament and the european court of justice in luxembourg with massive translation departments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.06.2004 is europe dragging its feet on immigration ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has been slow to meet the challenge of balancing security and the rights of immigrants .
the eu 's justice and home affairs commissioner has called for more to be done to find a common policy on immigration across the bloc . five years after a common european asylum and immigration policy was initiated at a summit in the finnish city of tampere , justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino called on his european union colleagues to work towards a " uniform status " for admitting legal migrants for employment purposes into the union and encourage the immigration of more non-eu nationals . speaking in brussels on wednesday , vitorino told the gathered officials that the approach of different member states in the area of asylum and immigration had delayed the creation of a cohesive common policy and specifically stressed the need for the eu to regulate laws on legal immigration for economic reasons . " it is necessary to make headway in terms of economic immigration policy and the right of every member state to fix the number of immigrants , " vitorino said .
" we need collaboration on a european level and must specifically concentrate on the integration of immigrants . " vitorino added that , since the so-called tampere program was introduced in 1999 , which was intended to form a cooperative base for member states on matters such as asylum , immigration and the fight against terrorism , some progress had been made .
the commissioner quoted the implementation of the european arrest warrant as an example of the fruits of tampere 's labor . the commissioner was speaking on the day when the european commission adopted a communication on the results of the tampere program . a second program which will set out further plans for " an area of freedom , security and justice " is expected to be in place by the second half of 2004 despite continuing differences between states on the issues involved .
conflicting views the delay in formulating a common policy stems from conflicting views throughout the bloc .
there is particular controversy in germany where the social democrat government and conservative opposition have negotiated their own immigration law .
the european commission would require member states to take on more immigrants than the current german bill allows . vitorino said the negotiations needed in reaching a unanimous agreement on proposals made the resolving of the issue " complicated " and had led to less ambitious outcomes .
" there have been moments of joy , but also of sorrow and intense depression , " he admitted . human rights group criticizes eu the record of the european union in the area of immigration over the last five years has drawn criticism from human rights organization amnesty international .
a statement from amnesty said that " from a human rights perspective , the picture is not positive . " " the eu has created an area that has diminished the legitimate rights of refugees , that is less secure than it should be because of the lack of human rights safeguards hampering the fight against crime , and that is free for many , but certainly not for all , " the amnesty assessment read .
un body calls for cohesion on refugees the united nations commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- also called on the eu to regulate a common refugee policy to guarantee that those seeking protection from certain crisis regions would be treated on an equal basis everywhere within the bloc .
jean mouchet , the unhcr representative in brussels , added to the statement by telling reporters that some member states , especially the ten new countries admitted at the start of may , urgently needed help to improve their asylum systems . one particular area in which the european union was accused of compromising the rights of immigrants was the bloc 's security agenda .
amnesty criticized the eu for shifting its focus to combating illegal immigration as part of its anti-terror initiatives at the expense of making policies to facilitate legal immigration . the fight against terror goes on , says vitorino vitorino countered the criticism by pledging that the fight against terrorism would remain among the union 's priorities .
he added that the eu would also continue to cooperate in future to shore up the bloc 's external frontiers in the east to prevent unlawful immigration . but he warned germany , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and austria , who want to form a pilot group to increase the fight against terrorism and unlawful immigration , not to consider separatist police actions outside the european union .
he added that any initiative to increase security must be done so as part of a common policy and with the full involvement of all eu member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough on german immigration law after years of acrimonious talks and two failed attempts to push through a controversial immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder managed to secure a deal with the opposition conservatives .

the eu 's justice and home affairs commissioner has called for more to be done to find a common policy on immigration across the bloc . five years after a common european asylum and immigration policy was initiated at a summit in the finnish city of tampere , justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino called on his european union colleagues to work towards a " uniform status " for admitting legal migrants for employment purposes into the union and encourage the immigration of more non-eu nationals . speaking in brussels on wednesday , vitorino told the gathered officials that the approach of different member states in the area of asylum and immigration had delayed the creation of a cohesive common policy and specifically stressed the need for the eu to regulate laws on legal immigration for economic reasons . " it is necessary to make headway in terms of economic immigration policy and the right of every member state to fix the number of immigrants , " vitorino said .
" we need collaboration on a european level and must specifically concentrate on the integration of immigrants . " vitorino added that , since the so-called tampere program was introduced in 1999 , which was intended to form a cooperative base for member states on matters such as asylum , immigration and the fight against terrorism , some progress had been made .
the commissioner quoted the implementation of the european arrest warrant as an example of the fruits of tampere 's labor . the commissioner was speaking on the day when the european commission adopted a communication on the results of the tampere program . a second program which will set out further plans for " an area of freedom , security and justice " is expected to be in place by the second half of 2004 despite continuing differences between states on the issues involved .
conflicting views the delay in formulating a common policy stems from conflicting views throughout the bloc .
there is particular controversy in germany where the social democrat government and conservative opposition have negotiated their own immigration law .
the european commission would require member states to take on more immigrants than the current german bill allows . vitorino said the negotiations needed in reaching a unanimous agreement on proposals made the resolving of the issue " complicated " and had led to less ambitious outcomes .
" there have been moments of joy , but also of sorrow and intense depression , " he admitted . human rights group criticizes eu the record of the european union in the area of immigration over the last five years has drawn criticism from human rights organization amnesty international .
a statement from amnesty said that " from a human rights perspective , the picture is not positive . " " the eu has created an area that has diminished the legitimate rights of refugees , that is less secure than it should be because of the lack of human rights safeguards hampering the fight against crime , and that is free for many , but certainly not for all , " the amnesty assessment read .
un body calls for cohesion on refugees the united nations commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- also called on the eu to regulate a common refugee policy to guarantee that those seeking protection from certain crisis regions would be treated on an equal basis everywhere within the bloc .
jean mouchet , the unhcr representative in brussels , added to the statement by telling reporters that some member states , especially the ten new countries admitted at the start of may , urgently needed help to improve their asylum systems . one particular area in which the european union was accused of compromising the rights of immigrants was the bloc 's security agenda .
amnesty criticized the eu for shifting its focus to combating illegal immigration as part of its anti-terror initiatives at the expense of making policies to facilitate legal immigration . the fight against terror goes on , says vitorino vitorino countered the criticism by pledging that the fight against terrorism would remain among the union 's priorities .
he added that the eu would also continue to cooperate in future to shore up the bloc 's external frontiers in the east to prevent unlawful immigration . but he warned germany , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and austria , who want to form a pilot group to increase the fight against terrorism and unlawful immigration , not to consider separatist police actions outside the european union .
he added that any initiative to increase security must be done so as part of a common policy and with the full involvement of all eu member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough on german immigration law after years of acrimonious talks and two failed attempts to push through a controversial immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder managed to secure a deal with the opposition conservatives .

"
a new german movie star is attempting to do what compatriots til schweiger and others failed to do - crack hollywood .
his first film is a huge hit which will keep him in cheese for the rest of his life . the latest german actor to try and break hollywood has got off to an extremely successful start .
the film he makes his debut in , harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban , the third instalment in the series that follows the magical adventures of the boy wizard , has already grossed a hugely impressive € 9.8 million -lrb- $ 12 million , £ 5 million -rrb- on the first day of its release in britain alone .
the global appeal of the characters made famous by the novels by j.k. rowling will almost certainly give the latest german star a box office smash when the figures start to role in from the film 's worldwide release on june 4 . so who is germany 's newest favorite son of the cinema ?
well , his name remains shrouded in mystery but he will be known from now on by that of the character he plays - scabbers the rat .
germany 's latest movie star is a west african rodent who was plucked from the relative obscurity of the berlin zoo to play the somewhat disheveled and perpetually somnolent pet of hogwarts student ron weasley , the best friend of harry potter . rat not fazed by famous co-stars after finding his way into movies through an animal casting agency , " scabbers " was shipped over to england with an understudy to join actors daniel radcliffe , emma watson and rupert grint on the set of the new potter movie .
it is the german rat 's big break after beginning his acting career at the tender age of six weeks .
" scabbers " plays the mangy 12-year-old comedy sidekick alongside the more intense snowy owl " hedwig " and impressive " crookshanks " the cat . but it seems that appearing with such esteemed colleagues , as well as cgi-created phantoms and fantastic beasts like buckbeak the hippogriff , has not fazed the nine-year-old rodent .
reports suggest that " scabbers " is very settled in england where he has remained since the end of shooting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de harry potter speaks german harry potter fans in germany couldn ’ t wait for the just-published fifth book by j.k. rowling to appear on the german market .

institute leaders believe they can operate free of censorship . the goethe institute in pyongyang comprises of 150 square meters packed with 8,000 books , newspapers , cds and videos stored in a cultural center in a space located deep in the heart of the city .
in that sense , the cultural center could be just like any other - if it were n't located in the north korean capital .
on june 3 , a delegation led by the president of the goethe institute opened the first western cultural institution in the stalinist state .
the move has been viewed as controversial , since north korea still remains almost completely shut off from the rest of the world .
after years of preparation , north korean officials opened the door for the goethe institute and its cultural undertaking .
uwe schmelter , who heads the goethe institute in neighboring south korea , led the negotiations , which began in early 2001 .
he found the atmosphere of the talks surprisingly good .
" the negotiations were not easy , " says schmelter , " but they were very friendly and harmonious .
at stake were the necessary requirements - at least from the goethe institute ’ s perspective - of opening and running such a reading room . "
this , schmelter adds , includes " the free and open access for all north koreans and the uncensored and accessible viewing of all media . "
a balancing act these stipulations , a hallmark of the goethe institute 's work , were at first hard to accept for the north korean authorities , who aim to prevent information from overseas from reaching the country .
but at the end of the negotiations , a delicate compromise was reached .
under the agreement , 50 percent of the goethe institute 's literature will focus on science and technology , with the other 50 percent devoted to general media that provides a complete and up-to-date view of germany .
although north korean authorities agreed to give the goethe institute complete control over which media to feature , the new reading room in pyongyang is to be run entirely by local north korean staff .
but schmelter is optimistic that the authorities will adhere to their agreement to allow uncensored and free access to everyone .
historic parallels schmelter also describes what he views as north koreans ’ affinity towards germans .
" the shared fate of living in a divided country for 40 years makes koreans feel very close to germans , " he says .
" in a way , north koreans even consider germans to be their chosen relatives . "
for some like schmelter , this historical parallel is reason enough to see the opening of the goethe institute in north korea as a source of hope for the future .
in a statement , germany 's foreign ministry said the opening of the institute marked an " important expansion of -lrb- the country 's -rrb- cultural presence " in north korea , a place where very little information is available about germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.06.2004 smoother flying with laser technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the technology could make air travel safer .
a german research institute has come up with a novel new air traffic device designed to warn pilots about dangerous air turbulence , which could make for safer soaring all round . for all the abstract beauty of white lines slicing through picture book blue skies , the vapor trails which aircraft leave in their wake as they blast through the air are a warning for anything which moves too close .
planes , particularly after take-off , whip up micro-cosmic storms which are powerful enough to throw any unsuspecting aircraft off course , with potentially devastating consequences . as things stand , the world of commercial aviation is governed by a rule which dictates a minimum distance between aircraft of 11.1 kilometers .
but this gap has now been deemed significant enough to merit a solution . with a reduced distance , more planes could take to the skies , which would mean more money for the industry , and take-off and landing delays could be minimized , thus heightening overall airport efficiency .
at least that is how the argument goes .
and based upon it , the fraunhofer institute for applied optics and precision engineering -lrb- iof -rrb- in the german city of jena , has come up with a pocket-sized problem-solver . " if it were possible to measure the position and actual extent of the contrail , the actual safe distance could be adjusted to the actual conditions , which would increase take-off and landing frequency at airports , " said thomas peschel of the iof . smart sensor project i-wake - short for instrumentation wake - is a joint effort between thomas peschel and eight teams from four different countries .
together , the scientists have developed a smart sensor which can tell when the air is calm enough for a safe take-off regardless of the current 11.1 mile restriction .
ultimately the idea is to make the optical scanner a standard fixture , ensuring a fast and accurate way of assessing dangerous levels of turbulence prior to take-off .
a prototype is currently being tested on board a cessna . for all the apparent complexity of the innovation , peschel stresses the simplicity of the technology behind it .
" a laser sends pulses into the air space just ahead of the plane , the light is dispersed on aerosols or dust particles and registered by a detector , " peschel explains .
the effect is that the frequency of the laser pulse changes according to whether the particles of dust are moving towards or away from the beam .
by adjusting the wave lengths of the dispersed laser light , it is possible to tell within fractions of a second whether the air is still turbulent following take-off , or whether it is calm enough for the next plane to hit the skies . " the challenge in developing the device was to be able to use the laser beam to scan the area in front of the plane at a relatively high frequency , " peschel recalls .
in order to achieve this , the team of scientists came up with a small , high-precision mirror which moves back and forth seven and a half times a second , taking the measurements , and consequently the first steps towards filling the skies with yet more traffic . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space shuttle glides to success scientists conducted a successful test of a german-made prototype of a future european space shuttle on saturday .

as the international conference for the promotion of renewable energies enters its third day in bonn , the german chancellor gerhard schröder is preparing to bang his drum for a cause close to his heart . the chancellor proposed the meeting after the 2002 world summit for sustainable development in the south african city of johannesburg failed to buckle under european pressure to draw up timetables and targets for boosting renewable energy use .
this time around , delegates at the four-day conference in bonn aim to come up with an " international action program , " setting out specific commitments by individual governments and the international community .
environment minister jürgen trittin told the 3,000 conference delegates wednesday that renewable energy sources could be the solution to poverty and climate change across the world .
" we need an accelerated global increase in the use of renewable energies , " he said . " we must get down to business .
we must enable this global increase to become reality , to combat global poverty , to combat global warming .
let 's make it real . "
concrete steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants in the renewables 2004 conference attend a session in germany 's former parliament building in bonn .
on wednesday , 350 parliamentarians from more than 70 countries took a significant step towards pushing renewable energy sources further towards the mainstream when they released a document calling for the establishment of an international renewable energy agency modeled after the international atomic agency in vienna .
german parliamentarian and president of the eurosolar organization for renewables , hermann scheer , believes it is the only logical way forward .
" intergovernemtal agencies exist for the promotion of atomic energy , for the promotion of fossil energy , but not exclusively for renewable energies , " scheer told deutsche welle . " and this bias is one of the reasons why the dissemination of renewable energies does n't come through world-wide and why much misinformation is filling decision-maker 's minds . "
broad agreement remarkably , german politicians across the political spectrum have agreed on the fundamental ideas of the new agency , as have parliamentarians from countries such as pakistan and nigeria .the precise content of the action plan is still unclear , but germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , co-host of the bonn conference , has her sights set ambitiously high .
she wants to see half the world using renewable energy sources by the year 2050 , and not only for geo-political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- spd -rrb- and environment minister jürgen trittin open the conference in bonn .
" i think it could be possible to give one billion energy-poor people access to renewable energy .
it might be ambitious , but it would also prevent other conflicts , make us less dependent on centralised powers , and fight climate change .
so all the advantages are in this field , " wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
with latin american countries pledging to increase their share of renewable energy sources by 10 percent before the year 2020 , there is certainly some promise of commitment in the air in bonn .
but ecologists are worried that behind-the-scenes haggling could dangerously water down any real commitment , ruining the best political opportunity in a generation to help wean the world off oil .
there is a danger too , that the united states , japan , france and brazil , which managed to root out any reference to timetables or market percentages at the 2002 summit in johannesburg , might try to do the same once again in bonn . john hay -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy for the future dw-radio presents a special series on alternative power projects in germany and abroad .

" it looks like an approach with lufthansa will be a topic again - which we always thought was the safer option - even though that will of course not be said at the moment , " said claude zehnder , market analyst at zürcher kantonalbank .
however failure to join oneworld may endanger swiss ' declared goal to stem operating losses this year .
swiss had said that oneworld membership was set to boost operating results by 100 million swiss francs -lrb- $ 80.4 million -rrb- a year within three years . more briefs 03.06.2004 -pipe- german industry eyes iraq contracts after handover 03.06.2004 -pipe- karstadt enters online pharmacy market 02.06.2004 -pipe- german retail sales rise offers hope for economy 02.06.2004 -pipe- eu commission says german company violated antitrust rules 02.06.2004 -pipe- traffic climbs dramatically at frankfurt airport 02.06.2004 -pipe- deutsche post reaches agreement with union 01.06.2004 -pipe- increase in cigarette price reduces tax revenue 01.06.2004 -pipe- german stocks decline as oil prices rise 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

as the international conference for the promotion of renewable energies enters its third day in bonn , the german chancellor gerhard schröder is preparing to bang his drum for a cause close to his heart . the chancellor proposed the meeting after the 2002 world summit for sustainable development in the south african city of johannesburg failed to buckle under european pressure to draw up timetables and targets for boosting renewable energy use .
this time around , delegates at the four-day conference in bonn aim to come up with an " international action program , " setting out specific commitments by individual governments and the international community .
environment minister jürgen trittin told the 3,000 conference delegates wednesday that renewable energy sources could be the solution to poverty and climate change across the world .
" we need an accelerated global increase in the use of renewable energies , " he said . " we must get down to business .
we must enable this global increase to become reality , to combat global poverty , to combat global warming .
let 's make it real . "
concrete steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants in the renewables 2004 conference attend a session in germany 's former parliament building in bonn .
on wednesday , 350 parliamentarians from more than 70 countries took a significant step towards pushing renewable energy sources further towards the mainstream when they released a document calling for the establishment of an international renewable energy agency modeled after the international atomic agency in vienna .
german parliamentarian and president of the eurosolar organization for renewables , hermann scheer , believes it is the only logical way forward .
" intergovernemtal agencies exist for the promotion of atomic energy , for the promotion of fossil energy , but not exclusively for renewable energies , " scheer told deutsche welle . " and this bias is one of the reasons why the dissemination of renewable energies does n't come through world-wide and why much misinformation is filling decision-maker 's minds . "
broad agreement remarkably , german politicians across the political spectrum have agreed on the fundamental ideas of the new agency , as have parliamentarians from countries such as pakistan and nigeria .the precise content of the action plan is still unclear , but germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , co-host of the bonn conference , has her sights set ambitiously high .
she wants to see half the world using renewable energy sources by the year 2050 , and not only for geo-political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- spd -rrb- and environment minister jürgen trittin open the conference in bonn .
" i think it could be possible to give one billion energy-poor people access to renewable energy .
it might be ambitious , but it would also prevent other conflicts , make us less dependent on centralised powers , and fight climate change .
so all the advantages are in this field , " wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
with latin american countries pledging to increase their share of renewable energy sources by 10 percent before the year 2020 , there is certainly some promise of commitment in the air in bonn .
but ecologists are worried that behind-the-scenes haggling could dangerously water down any real commitment , ruining the best political opportunity in a generation to help wean the world off oil .
there is a danger too , that the united states , japan , france and brazil , which managed to root out any reference to timetables or market percentages at the 2002 summit in johannesburg , might try to do the same once again in bonn . john hay -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy for the future dw-radio presents a special series on alternative power projects in germany and abroad .

institute leaders believe they can operate free of censorship . the goethe institute in pyongyang comprises of 150 square meters packed with 8,000 books , newspapers , cds and videos stored in a cultural center in a space located deep in the heart of the city .
in that sense , the cultural center could be just like any other - if it were n't located in the north korean capital .
on june 3 , a delegation led by the president of the goethe institute opened the first western cultural institution in the stalinist state .
the move has been viewed as controversial , since north korea still remains almost completely shut off from the rest of the world .
after years of preparation , north korean officials opened the door for the goethe institute and its cultural undertaking .
uwe schmelter , who heads the goethe institute in neighboring south korea , led the negotiations , which began in early 2001 .
he found the atmosphere of the talks surprisingly good .
" the negotiations were not easy , " says schmelter , " but they were very friendly and harmonious .
at stake were the necessary requirements - at least from the goethe institute ’ s perspective - of opening and running such a reading room . "
this , schmelter adds , includes " the free and open access for all north koreans and the uncensored and accessible viewing of all media . "
a balancing act these stipulations , a hallmark of the goethe institute 's work , were at first hard to accept for the north korean authorities , who aim to prevent information from overseas from reaching the country .
but at the end of the negotiations , a delicate compromise was reached .
under the agreement , 50 percent of the goethe institute 's literature will focus on science and technology , with the other 50 percent devoted to general media that provides a complete and up-to-date view of germany .
although north korean authorities agreed to give the goethe institute complete control over which media to feature , the new reading room in pyongyang is to be run entirely by local north korean staff .
but schmelter is optimistic that the authorities will adhere to their agreement to allow uncensored and free access to everyone .
historic parallels schmelter also describes what he views as north koreans ’ affinity towards germans .
" the shared fate of living in a divided country for 40 years makes koreans feel very close to germans , " he says .
" in a way , north koreans even consider germans to be their chosen relatives . "
for some like schmelter , this historical parallel is reason enough to see the opening of the goethe institute in north korea as a source of hope for the future .
in a statement , germany 's foreign ministry said the opening of the institute marked an " important expansion of -lrb- the country 's -rrb- cultural presence " in north korea , a place where very little information is available about germany .
the goethe institute is the main arbiter of german culture and language abroad , with 127 institutes in other countries . marianna yahilevich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goethe institute opens doors in kabul germany ’ s international cultural organization , the goethe institute , is poised to re-open in the afghan capital of kabul after 12 years of closure brought on by the rise of the taliban regime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.06.2004 powering ahead with renewable energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delegates at renewables 2004 in bonn are looking to a greener and brighter future .
as the international conference for the promotion of renewable energies enters its third day in bonn , the german chancellor gerhard schröder is preparing to bang his drum for a cause close to his heart . the chancellor proposed the meeting after the 2002 world summit for sustainable development in the south african city of johannesburg failed to buckle under european pressure to draw up timetables and targets for boosting renewable energy use .
this time around , delegates at the four-day conference in bonn aim to come up with an " international action program , " setting out specific commitments by individual governments and the international community .
environment minister jürgen trittin told the 3,000 conference delegates wednesday that renewable energy sources could be the solution to poverty and climate change across the world .
" we need an accelerated global increase in the use of renewable energies , " he said . " we must get down to business .
we must enable this global increase to become reality , to combat global poverty , to combat global warming .
let 's make it real . "
concrete steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants in the renewables 2004 conference attend a session in germany 's former parliament building in bonn .
on wednesday , 350 parliamentarians from more than 70 countries took a significant step towards pushing renewable energy sources further towards the mainstream when they released a document calling for the establishment of an international renewable energy agency modeled after the international atomic agency in vienna .
german parliamentarian and president of the eurosolar organization for renewables , hermann scheer , believes it is the only logical way forward .
" intergovernemtal agencies exist for the promotion of atomic energy , for the promotion of fossil energy , but not exclusively for renewable energies , " scheer told deutsche welle . " and this bias is one of the reasons why the dissemination of renewable energies does n't come through world-wide and why much misinformation is filling decision-maker 's minds . "
broad agreement remarkably , german politicians across the political spectrum have agreed on the fundamental ideas of the new agency , as have parliamentarians from countries such as pakistan and nigeria .the precise content of the action plan is still unclear , but germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , co-host of the bonn conference , has her sights set ambitiously high .
she wants to see half the world using renewable energy sources by the year 2050 , and not only for geo-political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- spd -rrb- and environment minister jürgen trittin open the conference in bonn .
" i think it could be possible to give one billion energy-poor people access to renewable energy .
it might be ambitious , but it would also prevent other conflicts , make us less dependent on centralised powers , and fight climate change .
so all the advantages are in this field , " wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
with latin american countries pledging to increase their share of renewable energy sources by 10 percent before the year 2020 , there is certainly some promise of commitment in the air in bonn .
but ecologists are worried that behind-the-scenes haggling could dangerously water down any real commitment , ruining the best political opportunity in a generation to help wean the world off oil .
there is a danger too , that the united states , japan , france and brazil , which managed to root out any reference to timetables or market percentages at the 2002 summit in johannesburg , might try to do the same once again in bonn . john hay -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy for the future dw-radio presents a special series on alternative power projects in germany and abroad .

today they are a commodity .
but there still are ways to stand out from the crowd : either by refusing to own a phone altogether , or by spending € 3500 euro for a vertu . it has become hard to impress people with a mobile phone lately .
getting a call on a trendy handset alone certainly wo n't do the trick anymore .
the same goes for funky gadgets to pep up the drab phones like cameras , ring tones or messaging services .
soon after these are released , everyone appears to have them , and instead of being part of the handset avantgarde , the mobile phone afficionado is thrown back into the faceless pool of ordinary handset users .
but thanks to nokia , there is a way for the handset lover to distinguish oneself from the masses .
it is called vertu and comes with a hefty price tag .
the self-proclaimed " first luxury communication company " was launched two years ago as a spin-off by nokia , the world 's largest handset-maker .
the ties to the finnish mother company , however , are kept almost as secret as vertu 's sales or revenue figures .

no camera , no video and no radio .
what then , besides the price , makes a vertu so special ?
" each phone consists of 400 separate parts that are put together manually , " explains wübbeke . vertu tries to set itself apart by working with materials commonly not associated with handsets .
" the leather we use for the phones stems from the same people that supply luxury carmakers rolls royce and bentley . "
other materials used are liquidmetal , sapphire , ceramic , gold and silver .
" our phones last at least 15 to 20 years because we use only the best material and refined technology , " says wübbeke .
technology is also the reason vertu phones lack features like cameras , wap or gprs .
" our first collection came without a color display , but as soon as the technology was refined enough , we gave all our customers the option of equipping their phones free of charge with a color display . "

whether it is a hotel reservation or getting tickets for otherwise sold out events , the concierge service will try to fulfil requests vertu owners like madonna , gwyneth paltrow or david beckham may have .
while some female celebrities are vertu customers , the majority of vertu owners , at least in germany , are male , says christine meister , who runs the luxury jeweller store brahmfeld & gutrof on the ritzy german resort island sylt .
" men , especially those you also enjoy luxury cars , like vertu more than women do , " she points out .

today they are a commodity .
but there still are ways to stand out from the crowd : either by refusing to own a phone altogether , or by spending € 3500 euro for a vertu . it has become hard to impress people with a mobile phone lately .
getting a call on a trendy handset alone certainly wo n't do the trick anymore .
the same goes for funky gadgets to pep up the drab phones like cameras , ring tones or messaging services .
soon after these are released , everyone appears to have them , and instead of being part of the handset avantgarde , the mobile phone afficionado is thrown back into the faceless pool of ordinary handset users .
but thanks to nokia , there is a way for the handset lover to distinguish oneself from the masses .
it is called vertu and comes with a hefty price tag .
the self-proclaimed " first luxury communication company " was launched two years ago as a spin-off by nokia , the world 's largest handset-maker .
the ties to the finnish mother company , however , are kept almost as secret as vertu 's sales or revenue figures .
" we are not allowed to give any sales figure " , daniela wübbeke , the company 's spokesperson for germany , told dw-world .
no gimmicks deep pockets are required to own a vertu phone .
the more affordable " ascent " collection geared towards a younger clientele and launched this year comes in at € 3500 .
the more expensive " signature " collection starts at € 5000 euro for the regular handset and goes up to € 24,000 for the platinum version .
no camera , no video and no radio .
what then , besides the price , makes a vertu so special ?
" each phone consists of 400 separate parts that are put together manually , " explains wübbeke . vertu tries to set itself apart by working with materials commonly not associated with handsets .
" the leather we use for the phones stems from the same people that supply luxury carmakers rolls royce and bentley . "
other materials used are liquidmetal , sapphire , ceramic , gold and silver .
" our phones last at least 15 to 20 years because we use only the best material and refined technology , " says wübbeke .
technology is also the reason vertu phones lack features like cameras , wap or gprs .
" our first collection came without a color display , but as soon as the technology was refined enough , we gave all our customers the option of equipping their phones free of charge with a color display . "
beckham 's concierge another virtu freebie for the first year is the concierge button on every phone .
by pushing it customers are put through to a 24-hour hotline that attends to the callers needs .
whether it is a hotel reservation or getting tickets for otherwise sold out events , the concierge service will try to fulfil requests vertu owners like madonna , gwyneth paltrow or david beckham may have .
while some female celebrities are vertu customers , the majority of vertu owners , at least in germany , are male , says christine meister , who runs the luxury jeweller store brahmfeld & gutrof on the ritzy german resort island sylt .
" men , especially those you also enjoy luxury cars , like vertu more than women do , " she points out .
" many of our customers already own a rolls royce .
for them a vertu phone is a similar status symbol , and by having it , they possess something that other people do n't . "
pricy headset however , success in this market is anything but certain .
just consider the fate of so called fashion-phone xelibri from siemens .
the claim that " xelibri lives on a totally different planet from the technology driven mobile phone brands that exist today " was validated a week ago , when siemens pulled the plug on the brand after only two collections .
according to media reports , the demand for models like the xelibri 6 that let 's one " talk on the phone and apply makeup simultaneously " was weak .
vertu 's future looks bright , insists wübbeke .

institute leaders believe they can operate free of censorship . the goethe institute in pyongyang comprises of 150 square meters packed with 8,000 books , newspapers , cds and videos stored in a cultural center in a space located deep in the heart of the city .
in that sense , the cultural center could be just like any other - if it were n't located in the north korean capital .
on june 3 , a delegation led by the president of the goethe institute opened the first western cultural institution in the stalinist state .
the move has been viewed as controversial , since north korea still remains almost completely shut off from the rest of the world .
after years of preparation , north korean officials opened the door for the goethe institute and its cultural undertaking .
uwe schmelter , who heads the goethe institute in neighboring south korea , led the negotiations , which began in early 2001 .
he found the atmosphere of the talks surprisingly good .
" the negotiations were not easy , " says schmelter , " but they were very friendly and harmonious .
at stake were the necessary requirements - at least from the goethe institute ’ s perspective - of opening and running such a reading room . "
this , schmelter adds , includes " the free and open access for all north koreans and the uncensored and accessible viewing of all media . "
a balancing act these stipulations , a hallmark of the goethe institute 's work , were at first hard to accept for the north korean authorities , who aim to prevent information from overseas from reaching the country .
but at the end of the negotiations , a delicate compromise was reached .
under the agreement , 50 percent of the goethe institute 's literature will focus on science and technology , with the other 50 percent devoted to general media that provides a complete and up-to-date view of germany .
although north korean authorities agreed to give the goethe institute complete control over which media to feature , the new reading room in pyongyang is to be run entirely by local north korean staff .
but schmelter is optimistic that the authorities will adhere to their agreement to allow uncensored and free access to everyone .
historic parallels schmelter also describes what he views as north koreans ’ affinity towards germans .
" the shared fate of living in a divided country for 40 years makes koreans feel very close to germans , " he says .
" in a way , north koreans even consider germans to be their chosen relatives . "
for some like schmelter , this historical parallel is reason enough to see the opening of the goethe institute in north korea as a source of hope for the future .
in a statement , germany 's foreign ministry said the opening of the institute marked an " important expansion of -lrb- the country 's -rrb- cultural presence " in north korea , a place where very little information is available about germany .
the goethe institute is the main arbiter of german culture and language abroad , with 127 institutes in other countries . marianna yahilevich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goethe institute opens doors in kabul germany ’ s international cultural organization , the goethe institute , is poised to re-open in the afghan capital of kabul after 12 years of closure brought on by the rise of the taliban regime .

institute leaders believe they can operate free of censorship . the goethe institute in pyongyang comprises of 150 square meters packed with 8,000 books , newspapers , cds and videos stored in a cultural center in a space located deep in the heart of the city .
in that sense , the cultural center could be just like any other - if it were n't located in the north korean capital .
on june 3 , a delegation led by the president of the goethe institute opened the first western cultural institution in the stalinist state .
the move has been viewed as controversial , since north korea still remains almost completely shut off from the rest of the world .
after years of preparation , north korean officials opened the door for the goethe institute and its cultural undertaking .
uwe schmelter , who heads the goethe institute in neighboring south korea , led the negotiations , which began in early 2001 .
he found the atmosphere of the talks surprisingly good .
" the negotiations were not easy , " says schmelter , " but they were very friendly and harmonious .
at stake were the necessary requirements - at least from the goethe institute ’ s perspective - of opening and running such a reading room . "
this , schmelter adds , includes " the free and open access for all north koreans and the uncensored and accessible viewing of all media . "
a balancing act these stipulations , a hallmark of the goethe institute 's work , were at first hard to accept for the north korean authorities , who aim to prevent information from overseas from reaching the country .
but at the end of the negotiations , a delicate compromise was reached .
under the agreement , 50 percent of the goethe institute 's literature will focus on science and technology , with the other 50 percent devoted to general media that provides a complete and up-to-date view of germany .
although north korean authorities agreed to give the goethe institute complete control over which media to feature , the new reading room in pyongyang is to be run entirely by local north korean staff .
but schmelter is optimistic that the authorities will adhere to their agreement to allow uncensored and free access to everyone .
historic parallels schmelter also describes what he views as north koreans ’ affinity towards germans .
" the shared fate of living in a divided country for 40 years makes koreans feel very close to germans , " he says .
" in a way , north koreans even consider germans to be their chosen relatives . "
for some like schmelter , this historical parallel is reason enough to see the opening of the goethe institute in north korea as a source of hope for the future .
in a statement , germany 's foreign ministry said the opening of the institute marked an " important expansion of -lrb- the country 's -rrb- cultural presence " in north korea , a place where very little information is available about germany .
the goethe institute is the main arbiter of german culture and language abroad , with 127 institutes in other countries . marianna yahilevich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goethe institute opens doors in kabul germany ’ s international cultural organization , the goethe institute , is poised to re-open in the afghan capital of kabul after 12 years of closure brought on by the rise of the taliban regime .

a german research institute has come up with a novel new air traffic device designed to warn pilots about dangerous air turbulence , which could make for safer soaring all round . for all the abstract beauty of white lines slicing through picture book blue skies , the vapor trails which aircraft leave in their wake as they blast through the air are a warning for anything which moves too close .
planes , particularly after take-off , whip up micro-cosmic storms which are powerful enough to throw any unsuspecting aircraft off course , with potentially devastating consequences . as things stand , the world of commercial aviation is governed by a rule which dictates a minimum distance between aircraft of 11.1 kilometers .
but this gap has now been deemed significant enough to merit a solution . with a reduced distance , more planes could take to the skies , which would mean more money for the industry , and take-off and landing delays could be minimized , thus heightening overall airport efficiency .
at least that is how the argument goes .
and based upon it , the fraunhofer institute for applied optics and precision engineering -lrb- iof -rrb- in the german city of jena , has come up with a pocket-sized problem-solver . " if it were possible to measure the position and actual extent of the contrail , the actual safe distance could be adjusted to the actual conditions , which would increase take-off and landing frequency at airports , " said thomas peschel of the iof . smart sensor project i-wake - short for instrumentation wake - is a joint effort between thomas peschel and eight teams from four different countries .
together , the scientists have developed a smart sensor which can tell when the air is calm enough for a safe take-off regardless of the current 11.1 mile restriction .
ultimately the idea is to make the optical scanner a standard fixture , ensuring a fast and accurate way of assessing dangerous levels of turbulence prior to take-off .
a prototype is currently being tested on board a cessna . for all the apparent complexity of the innovation , peschel stresses the simplicity of the technology behind it .
" a laser sends pulses into the air space just ahead of the plane , the light is dispersed on aerosols or dust particles and registered by a detector , " peschel explains .
the effect is that the frequency of the laser pulse changes according to whether the particles of dust are moving towards or away from the beam .
by adjusting the wave lengths of the dispersed laser light , it is possible to tell within fractions of a second whether the air is still turbulent following take-off , or whether it is calm enough for the next plane to hit the skies . " the challenge in developing the device was to be able to use the laser beam to scan the area in front of the plane at a relatively high frequency , " peschel recalls .
in order to achieve this , the team of scientists came up with a small , high-precision mirror which moves back and forth seven and a half times a second , taking the measurements , and consequently the first steps towards filling the skies with yet more traffic . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space shuttle glides to success scientists conducted a successful test of a german-made prototype of a future european space shuttle on saturday .

president bush has likened the u.s.-led war on terror to world war ii ahead of d-day celebrations .
deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments that a dip into history books would have been advisable before his talk . in a speech to 981 air force academy cadets on wednesday , united states president george w. bush said the soldiers were fighting the same war as those who battled the nazis . he also said the war on terror resembled " the great clashes of the last century " between democracy and totalitarianism .
the u.s. president vowed that america would continue to strike terror groups around the world . deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments . there it is again - the comparison that george w. bush used even before the iraq war : the battle against saddam hussein and against terrorism is comparable to world war ii .
the enemies of the united states still believe today , as they did then , that the americans are weak and can be defeated .
but today , much like then , the u.s. will prove they are wrong .
the americans will fight resolutely and not rest until the enemies are crushed . it 's a strident tone that fits the run-up to the d-day ceremony and also the presidential election campaign , but not the political reality in which the u.s. president is ordering his military deployments . sept .
11 was n't and is n't comparable to pearl harbor , the terror groups of osama bin laden are n't comparable to nazi germany .
even saddam hussein 's regime can not and should not be likened to hitler 's . al qaeda 's bloody terror is to be totally condemned and rejected .
but these groups do n't conquer new lands , they do n't perpetrate genocide and they do n't wage a conventional war against the united states or any other country .
not even against israel , which they have declared as their arch enemy . al qaeda perpetrates terror much like other groups before it have done in other places and much like others that will do the same after it .
only the criminal efficiency of al qaeda is much greater than ever before . this is certainly a challenge and not just for the u.s. but it 's by no means a " war . "
and military means is not the only way -lrb- or at least not in the long-term -rrb- to defeat terrorism .
afghanistan has more than clearly demonstrated that .
and what about saddam hussein 's regime ? bush 's father was in a better position to remind one of world war ii when he freed kuwait .
bush junior waged a war without iraq having occupied other countries and without any scrap of proof for his alleged evil plans - right from weapons of mass destruction to the threat of new aggression . even the american officials , whom bush reminded of world war ii , know that the evidence does not exist .
it 's difficult to imagine that they believe bush 's words about a holy mission . and what of the questions of democracy and freedom ? naturally " d-day " was the prelude to the liberation of europe from nazi-german occupation .
but it 's not comparable to the middle east : the only occupier there is called israel and is - at least on its own state territory - the only democracy in the region . the other countries are repressed by their own leaders , who do n't consider giving their people more freedom .
in any case not because saddam hussein was toppled .
what has taken place since saddam 's unseating should be guarantee enough for the arab regimes that washington will not want to wage any further wars in the region . after all , even a year after the war and the appointment of an interim government , democracy in iraq is still a distant dream .
even in this respect bush is wrong .
or he 's making a mistake if he equates " liberation " with " democratization . "
here , one can only advise , and not just him , a glance in the history books . even today in germany one does n't speak of " day of liberation " , but of " defeat " , " capitulation " and similar things .
and that , despite the fact that we 've long become a democracy .
but even this process takes a while : it took four years for germany to frame its constitution and hold its first post-world war ii free elections .
then it took a full ten years until sovereignty was achieved . and in iraq the same should happen overnight ?
without any kind of democratic past , without experienced and untarnished politicians ? the u.s. president should know that some things just ca n't be compared . peter philipp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism continues despite new resolution on iraq a revised draft for a un resolution on iraq 's future proposed by the u.s. and britain would set a departure date for foreign troops , but some security council members said more changes are still needed .

steps have been taken to dam the flow , but the next wave is already gathering strength . a huge crest of paperwork is rolling towards the european commission , threatening to swamp the 25,000 civil servants working in brussels .
last year , the arduous bureaucrats churned out more paper than ever before : 1.5 million pages had to be translated into what were then the 11 official eu languages .
now the translators are sinking in the vast ocean of work backing up behind them .
at last count , they were 60,000 pages behind , and if the momentum continues at the same pace , that could soon increase to 300,000 . keep it short ! the eu wants to drastically reduce the flow of work to be translated , and has issued an edict instructing beavering bureaucrats to reduce the length of " memorandums " - the official title for commission texts - from the current average of 50 pages to a mere 15 .

although the number of translators working there was upped with expansion at the start of may , the eu personnel department did n't manage to get enough qualified staff onboard in advance of expansion .
despite seven years of planning , there were apparently not enough qualified translators available , or at least that is the line commissioner kinnock is sticking to . language acrobats rather than take on hundreds and hundreds of extra translators , the plan is to increase the productivity of the translation service by 40 percent by the end of 2006 .
internal working papers are now only translated into english , french or german , but everything that leaves the building to go to citizens , companies or courts has to be translated - and precisely . some of the new member states have already started grumbling that their language is not taken seriously enough by the commission .

steps have been taken to dam the flow , but the next wave is already gathering strength . a huge crest of paperwork is rolling towards the european commission , threatening to swamp the 25,000 civil servants working in brussels .
last year , the arduous bureaucrats churned out more paper than ever before : 1.5 million pages had to be translated into what were then the 11 official eu languages .
now the translators are sinking in the vast ocean of work backing up behind them .
at last count , they were 60,000 pages behind , and if the momentum continues at the same pace , that could soon increase to 300,000 . keep it short ! the eu wants to drastically reduce the flow of work to be translated , and has issued an edict instructing beavering bureaucrats to reduce the length of " memorandums " - the official title for commission texts - from the current average of 50 pages to a mere 15 . " keep it short ! " is the new motto among the brussels insiders , a throwback to the days of public telephone boxes long before mobile phone become a mainstream play thing .
each year the pile of papers grows by about five percent .
and eu commissioner neil kinnock admits that if things continue as they are , it will be the death of the translation department . already , the translation department is the biggest single eu installation .
more than 2,400 translators transfer their colleagues ' warblings into the now 20 official languages , from finnish to maltese to slovenian .
although the number of translators working there was upped with expansion at the start of may , the eu personnel department did n't manage to get enough qualified staff onboard in advance of expansion .
despite seven years of planning , there were apparently not enough qualified translators available , or at least that is the line commissioner kinnock is sticking to . language acrobats rather than take on hundreds and hundreds of extra translators , the plan is to increase the productivity of the translation service by 40 percent by the end of 2006 .
internal working papers are now only translated into english , french or german , but everything that leaves the building to go to citizens , companies or courts has to be translated - and precisely . some of the new member states have already started grumbling that their language is not taken seriously enough by the commission .
and in some places , the internet presence of the nine new languages could serve to back their complaints .
the language acrobats back at base , however , claim this is only a transitional phase . but in 2007 , bulgarian , rumanian and maybe even croatia will join the swelling linguistic ranks of the union .
with a couple of years warning , there is ample time for the commission to go in search of translators who can work , let 's say from estonian into turkish .
if turkey were to join the eu at some point over the next ten or 15 years , it 's high population would mean it brought with it one of the most widely spoken languages .
it is not only the commission , but also the other institutions , such as the european council , the parliament and the european court of justice in luxembourg with massive translation departments .
and they , too , are feeling the force of the surging workload . flood on the horizon the next floods are already gathering strength on the horizon .
spain is currently applying to have catalan , galician and basque recognized as official eu languages .
if accepted , it would n't mean that everything had to be translated into these languages , but catalans , galicians and the basques would have the right to approach eu organs in their mother tongue , just as the irish can already do in their traditional gaelic . bernd riegert -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how do you say accession in maltese ?
the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs . -lrb- 2 may 2004 -rrb- 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

president bush has likened the u.s.-led war on terror to world war ii ahead of d-day celebrations .
deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments that a dip into history books would have been advisable before his talk . in a speech to 981 air force academy cadets on wednesday , united states president george w. bush said the soldiers were fighting the same war as those who battled the nazis . he also said the war on terror resembled " the great clashes of the last century " between democracy and totalitarianism .
the u.s. president vowed that america would continue to strike terror groups around the world . deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments . there it is again - the comparison that george w. bush used even before the iraq war : the battle against saddam hussein and against terrorism is comparable to world war ii .
the enemies of the united states still believe today , as they did then , that the americans are weak and can be defeated .
but today , much like then , the u.s. will prove they are wrong .
the americans will fight resolutely and not rest until the enemies are crushed . it 's a strident tone that fits the run-up to the d-day ceremony and also the presidential election campaign , but not the political reality in which the u.s. president is ordering his military deployments . sept .
11 was n't and is n't comparable to pearl harbor , the terror groups of osama bin laden are n't comparable to nazi germany .
even saddam hussein 's regime can not and should not be likened to hitler 's . al qaeda 's bloody terror is to be totally condemned and rejected .
but these groups do n't conquer new lands , they do n't perpetrate genocide and they do n't wage a conventional war against the united states or any other country .
not even against israel , which they have declared as their arch enemy . al qaeda perpetrates terror much like other groups before it have done in other places and much like others that will do the same after it .
only the criminal efficiency of al qaeda is much greater than ever before . this is certainly a challenge and not just for the u.s. but it 's by no means a " war . "
and military means is not the only way -lrb- or at least not in the long-term -rrb- to defeat terrorism .
afghanistan has more than clearly demonstrated that .
and what about saddam hussein 's regime ? bush 's father was in a better position to remind one of world war ii when he freed kuwait .
bush junior waged a war without iraq having occupied other countries and without any scrap of proof for his alleged evil plans - right from weapons of mass destruction to the threat of new aggression . even the american officials , whom bush reminded of world war ii , know that the evidence does not exist .
it 's difficult to imagine that they believe bush 's words about a holy mission . and what of the questions of democracy and freedom ? naturally " d-day " was the prelude to the liberation of europe from nazi-german occupation .
but it 's not comparable to the middle east : the only occupier there is called israel and is - at least on its own state territory - the only democracy in the region . the other countries are repressed by their own leaders , who do n't consider giving their people more freedom .
in any case not because saddam hussein was toppled .
what has taken place since saddam 's unseating should be guarantee enough for the arab regimes that washington will not want to wage any further wars in the region . after all , even a year after the war and the appointment of an interim government , democracy in iraq is still a distant dream .
even in this respect bush is wrong .
or he 's making a mistake if he equates " liberation " with " democratization . "
here , one can only advise , and not just him , a glance in the history books . even today in germany one does n't speak of " day of liberation " , but of " defeat " , " capitulation " and similar things .
and that , despite the fact that we 've long become a democracy .
but even this process takes a while : it took four years for germany to frame its constitution and hold its first post-world war ii free elections .
then it took a full ten years until sovereignty was achieved . and in iraq the same should happen overnight ?
without any kind of democratic past , without experienced and untarnished politicians ? the u.s. president should know that some things just ca n't be compared . peter philipp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism continues despite new resolution on iraq a revised draft for a un resolution on iraq 's future proposed by the u.s. and britain would set a departure date for foreign troops , but some security council members said more changes are still needed .

german chancellor gerhard schröder said thursday economic dependency on oil was playing into the hands of terrorists and urged moving to renewable energy .
separately , opec agreed to raise oil production to ease prices . addressing a four-day international conference on renewable energy in bonn , schröder warned that the one-sidedness of the world 's energy sources had made it a target for terror attacks like the ones last week on saudi arabia 's oil facilities .

schröder said the recent attacks in saudi arabia and the continued instability in iraq made it dramatically clear that the availability of a variety of sources of energy was vital to international security . " making renewable energies a mainstream resource is imperative not just for our economies , it is imperative for security in a globalized world , " he said . schröder urged the 3,000 representatives from 154 nations at the conference to diversify into other energy resources and invest in solar , wind and other renewable fuels and added that countries needed to " reorientate the global energy policy . " schröder pointed towards germany 's own achievements in renewable energy : the country is investing some € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- a year to build wind farms , solar panels and tapping geothermal and other alternative sources of energy . some 120,000 people are estimated to be working in germany 's renewables sector .
the country has also reduced its emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases by nearly a fifth . opec decides to hike output referring to the steady rise in oil prices in recent weeks , in particular after the saudi attacks , schröder warned , " higher energy prices damage the chance for economic development .

a german research institute has come up with a novel new air traffic device designed to warn pilots about dangerous air turbulence , which could make for safer soaring all round . for all the abstract beauty of white lines slicing through picture book blue skies , the vapor trails which aircraft leave in their wake as they blast through the air are a warning for anything which moves too close .
planes , particularly after take-off , whip up micro-cosmic storms which are powerful enough to throw any unsuspecting aircraft off course , with potentially devastating consequences . as things stand , the world of commercial aviation is governed by a rule which dictates a minimum distance between aircraft of 11.1 kilometers .
but this gap has now been deemed significant enough to merit a solution . with a reduced distance , more planes could take to the skies , which would mean more money for the industry , and take-off and landing delays could be minimized , thus heightening overall airport efficiency .
at least that is how the argument goes .
and based upon it , the fraunhofer institute for applied optics and precision engineering -lrb- iof -rrb- in the german city of jena , has come up with a pocket-sized problem-solver . " if it were possible to measure the position and actual extent of the contrail , the actual safe distance could be adjusted to the actual conditions , which would increase take-off and landing frequency at airports , " said thomas peschel of the iof . smart sensor project i-wake - short for instrumentation wake - is a joint effort between thomas peschel and eight teams from four different countries .
together , the scientists have developed a smart sensor which can tell when the air is calm enough for a safe take-off regardless of the current 11.1 mile restriction .
ultimately the idea is to make the optical scanner a standard fixture , ensuring a fast and accurate way of assessing dangerous levels of turbulence prior to take-off .
a prototype is currently being tested on board a cessna . for all the apparent complexity of the innovation , peschel stresses the simplicity of the technology behind it .
" a laser sends pulses into the air space just ahead of the plane , the light is dispersed on aerosols or dust particles and registered by a detector , " peschel explains .
the effect is that the frequency of the laser pulse changes according to whether the particles of dust are moving towards or away from the beam .
by adjusting the wave lengths of the dispersed laser light , it is possible to tell within fractions of a second whether the air is still turbulent following take-off , or whether it is calm enough for the next plane to hit the skies . " the challenge in developing the device was to be able to use the laser beam to scan the area in front of the plane at a relatively high frequency , " peschel recalls .
in order to achieve this , the team of scientists came up with a small , high-precision mirror which moves back and forth seven and a half times a second , taking the measurements , and consequently the first steps towards filling the skies with yet more traffic . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space shuttle glides to success scientists conducted a successful test of a german-made prototype of a future european space shuttle on saturday .

" it looks like an approach with lufthansa will be a topic again - which we always thought was the safer option - even though that will of course not be said at the moment , " said claude zehnder , market analyst at zürcher kantonalbank .

a german research institute has come up with a novel new air traffic device designed to warn pilots about dangerous air turbulence , which could make for safer soaring all round . for all the abstract beauty of white lines slicing through picture book blue skies , the vapor trails which aircraft leave in their wake as they blast through the air are a warning for anything which moves too close .
planes , particularly after take-off , whip up micro-cosmic storms which are powerful enough to throw any unsuspecting aircraft off course , with potentially devastating consequences . as things stand , the world of commercial aviation is governed by a rule which dictates a minimum distance between aircraft of 11.1 kilometers .
but this gap has now been deemed significant enough to merit a solution . with a reduced distance , more planes could take to the skies , which would mean more money for the industry , and take-off and landing delays could be minimized , thus heightening overall airport efficiency .
at least that is how the argument goes .
and based upon it , the fraunhofer institute for applied optics and precision engineering -lrb- iof -rrb- in the german city of jena , has come up with a pocket-sized problem-solver . " if it were possible to measure the position and actual extent of the contrail , the actual safe distance could be adjusted to the actual conditions , which would increase take-off and landing frequency at airports , " said thomas peschel of the iof . smart sensor project i-wake - short for instrumentation wake - is a joint effort between thomas peschel and eight teams from four different countries .
together , the scientists have developed a smart sensor which can tell when the air is calm enough for a safe take-off regardless of the current 11.1 mile restriction .
ultimately the idea is to make the optical scanner a standard fixture , ensuring a fast and accurate way of assessing dangerous levels of turbulence prior to take-off .
a prototype is currently being tested on board a cessna . for all the apparent complexity of the innovation , peschel stresses the simplicity of the technology behind it .
" a laser sends pulses into the air space just ahead of the plane , the light is dispersed on aerosols or dust particles and registered by a detector , " peschel explains .
the effect is that the frequency of the laser pulse changes according to whether the particles of dust are moving towards or away from the beam .
by adjusting the wave lengths of the dispersed laser light , it is possible to tell within fractions of a second whether the air is still turbulent following take-off , or whether it is calm enough for the next plane to hit the skies . " the challenge in developing the device was to be able to use the laser beam to scan the area in front of the plane at a relatively high frequency , " peschel recalls .
in order to achieve this , the team of scientists came up with a small , high-precision mirror which moves back and forth seven and a half times a second , taking the measurements , and consequently the first steps towards filling the skies with yet more traffic . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space shuttle glides to success scientists conducted a successful test of a german-made prototype of a future european space shuttle on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.06.2004 nokia 's jetset mobile : it blings and rings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleek and expensive : mobile phones for the rich and famous five years ago mobile phones were the latest rage .
today they are a commodity .
but there still are ways to stand out from the crowd : either by refusing to own a phone altogether , or by spending € 3500 euro for a vertu . it has become hard to impress people with a mobile phone lately .
getting a call on a trendy handset alone certainly wo n't do the trick anymore .
the same goes for funky gadgets to pep up the drab phones like cameras , ring tones or messaging services .
soon after these are released , everyone appears to have them , and instead of being part of the handset avantgarde , the mobile phone afficionado is thrown back into the faceless pool of ordinary handset users .
but thanks to nokia , there is a way for the handset lover to distinguish oneself from the masses .
it is called vertu and comes with a hefty price tag .
the self-proclaimed " first luxury communication company " was launched two years ago as a spin-off by nokia , the world 's largest handset-maker .
the ties to the finnish mother company , however , are kept almost as secret as vertu 's sales or revenue figures .
" we are not allowed to give any sales figure " , daniela wübbeke , the company 's spokesperson for germany , told dw-world .
no gimmicks deep pockets are required to own a vertu phone .
the more affordable " ascent " collection geared towards a younger clientele and launched this year comes in at € 3500 .
the more expensive " signature " collection starts at € 5000 euro for the regular handset and goes up to € 24,000 for the platinum version .
no camera , no video and no radio .
what then , besides the price , makes a vertu so special ?
" each phone consists of 400 separate parts that are put together manually , " explains wübbeke . vertu tries to set itself apart by working with materials commonly not associated with handsets .
" the leather we use for the phones stems from the same people that supply luxury carmakers rolls royce and bentley . "
other materials used are liquidmetal , sapphire , ceramic , gold and silver .
" our phones last at least 15 to 20 years because we use only the best material and refined technology , " says wübbeke .
technology is also the reason vertu phones lack features like cameras , wap or gprs .
" our first collection came without a color display , but as soon as the technology was refined enough , we gave all our customers the option of equipping their phones free of charge with a color display . "
beckham 's concierge another virtu freebie for the first year is the concierge button on every phone .
by pushing it customers are put through to a 24-hour hotline that attends to the callers needs .
whether it is a hotel reservation or getting tickets for otherwise sold out events , the concierge service will try to fulfil requests vertu owners like madonna , gwyneth paltrow or david beckham may have .
while some female celebrities are vertu customers , the majority of vertu owners , at least in germany , are male , says christine meister , who runs the luxury jeweller store brahmfeld & gutrof on the ritzy german resort island sylt .
" men , especially those you also enjoy luxury cars , like vertu more than women do , " she points out .
" many of our customers already own a rolls royce .
for them a vertu phone is a similar status symbol , and by having it , they possess something that other people do n't . "
pricy headset however , success in this market is anything but certain .
just consider the fate of so called fashion-phone xelibri from siemens .
the claim that " xelibri lives on a totally different planet from the technology driven mobile phone brands that exist today " was validated a week ago , when siemens pulled the plug on the brand after only two collections .
according to media reports , the demand for models like the xelibri 6 that let 's one " talk on the phone and apply makeup simultaneously " was weak .
vertu 's future looks bright , insists wübbeke .
" we have so many orders for our new collection that we have to run extra shifts to speed up production .

"
a new german movie star is attempting to do what compatriots til schweiger and others failed to do - crack hollywood .
his first film is a huge hit which will keep him in cheese for the rest of his life . the latest german actor to try and break hollywood has got off to an extremely successful start .
the film he makes his debut in , harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban , the third instalment in the series that follows the magical adventures of the boy wizard , has already grossed a hugely impressive € 9.8 million -lrb- $ 12 million , £ 5 million -rrb- on the first day of its release in britain alone .
the global appeal of the characters made famous by the novels by j.k. rowling will almost certainly give the latest german star a box office smash when the figures start to role in from the film 's worldwide release on june 4 . so who is germany 's newest favorite son of the cinema ?
well , his name remains shrouded in mystery but he will be known from now on by that of the character he plays - scabbers the rat .
germany 's latest movie star is a west african rodent who was plucked from the relative obscurity of the berlin zoo to play the somewhat disheveled and perpetually somnolent pet of hogwarts student ron weasley , the best friend of harry potter . rat not fazed by famous co-stars after finding his way into movies through an animal casting agency , " scabbers " was shipped over to england with an understudy to join actors daniel radcliffe , emma watson and rupert grint on the set of the new potter movie .
it is the german rat 's big break after beginning his acting career at the tender age of six weeks .
" scabbers " plays the mangy 12-year-old comedy sidekick alongside the more intense snowy owl " hedwig " and impressive " crookshanks " the cat . but it seems that appearing with such esteemed colleagues , as well as cgi-created phantoms and fantastic beasts like buckbeak the hippogriff , has not fazed the nine-year-old rodent .
reports suggest that " scabbers " is very settled in england where he has remained since the end of shooting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de harry potter speaks german harry potter fans in germany couldn ’ t wait for the just-published fifth book by j.k. rowling to appear on the german market .

a german research institute has come up with a novel new air traffic device designed to warn pilots about dangerous air turbulence , which could make for safer soaring all round . for all the abstract beauty of white lines slicing through picture book blue skies , the vapor trails which aircraft leave in their wake as they blast through the air are a warning for anything which moves too close .
planes , particularly after take-off , whip up micro-cosmic storms which are powerful enough to throw any unsuspecting aircraft off course , with potentially devastating consequences . as things stand , the world of commercial aviation is governed by a rule which dictates a minimum distance between aircraft of 11.1 kilometers .
but this gap has now been deemed significant enough to merit a solution . with a reduced distance , more planes could take to the skies , which would mean more money for the industry , and take-off and landing delays could be minimized , thus heightening overall airport efficiency .
at least that is how the argument goes .
and based upon it , the fraunhofer institute for applied optics and precision engineering -lrb- iof -rrb- in the german city of jena , has come up with a pocket-sized problem-solver . " if it were possible to measure the position and actual extent of the contrail , the actual safe distance could be adjusted to the actual conditions , which would increase take-off and landing frequency at airports , " said thomas peschel of the iof . smart sensor project i-wake - short for instrumentation wake - is a joint effort between thomas peschel and eight teams from four different countries .
together , the scientists have developed a smart sensor which can tell when the air is calm enough for a safe take-off regardless of the current 11.1 mile restriction .
ultimately the idea is to make the optical scanner a standard fixture , ensuring a fast and accurate way of assessing dangerous levels of turbulence prior to take-off .
a prototype is currently being tested on board a cessna . for all the apparent complexity of the innovation , peschel stresses the simplicity of the technology behind it .
" a laser sends pulses into the air space just ahead of the plane , the light is dispersed on aerosols or dust particles and registered by a detector , " peschel explains .
the effect is that the frequency of the laser pulse changes according to whether the particles of dust are moving towards or away from the beam .
by adjusting the wave lengths of the dispersed laser light , it is possible to tell within fractions of a second whether the air is still turbulent following take-off , or whether it is calm enough for the next plane to hit the skies .

steps have been taken to dam the flow , but the next wave is already gathering strength . a huge crest of paperwork is rolling towards the european commission , threatening to swamp the 25,000 civil servants working in brussels .
last year , the arduous bureaucrats churned out more paper than ever before : 1.5 million pages had to be translated into what were then the 11 official eu languages .
now the translators are sinking in the vast ocean of work backing up behind them .
at last count , they were 60,000 pages behind , and if the momentum continues at the same pace , that could soon increase to 300,000 . keep it short ! the eu wants to drastically reduce the flow of work to be translated , and has issued an edict instructing beavering bureaucrats to reduce the length of " memorandums " - the official title for commission texts - from the current average of 50 pages to a mere 15 . " keep it short ! " is the new motto among the brussels insiders , a throwback to the days of public telephone boxes long before mobile phone become a mainstream play thing .
each year the pile of papers grows by about five percent .
and eu commissioner neil kinnock admits that if things continue as they are , it will be the death of the translation department . already , the translation department is the biggest single eu installation .
more than 2,400 translators transfer their colleagues ' warblings into the now 20 official languages , from finnish to maltese to slovenian .
although the number of translators working there was upped with expansion at the start of may , the eu personnel department did n't manage to get enough qualified staff onboard in advance of expansion .
despite seven years of planning , there were apparently not enough qualified translators available , or at least that is the line commissioner kinnock is sticking to . language acrobats rather than take on hundreds and hundreds of extra translators , the plan is to increase the productivity of the translation service by 40 percent by the end of 2006 .
internal working papers are now only translated into english , french or german , but everything that leaves the building to go to citizens , companies or courts has to be translated - and precisely . some of the new member states have already started grumbling that their language is not taken seriously enough by the commission .
and in some places , the internet presence of the nine new languages could serve to back their complaints .
the language acrobats back at base , however , claim this is only a transitional phase . but in 2007 , bulgarian , rumanian and maybe even croatia will join the swelling linguistic ranks of the union .
with a couple of years warning , there is ample time for the commission to go in search of translators who can work , let 's say from estonian into turkish .
if turkey were to join the eu at some point over the next ten or 15 years , it 's high population would mean it brought with it one of the most widely spoken languages .
it is not only the commission , but also the other institutions , such as the european council , the parliament and the european court of justice in luxembourg with massive translation departments .
and they , too , are feeling the force of the surging workload . flood on the horizon the next floods are already gathering strength on the horizon .
spain is currently applying to have catalan , galician and basque recognized as official eu languages .
if accepted , it would n't mean that everything had to be translated into these languages , but catalans , galicians and the basques would have the right to approach eu organs in their mother tongue , just as the irish can already do in their traditional gaelic . bernd riegert -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how do you say accession in maltese ?
the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs . -lrb- 2 may 2004 -rrb- 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.06.2004 nokia 's jetset mobile : it blings and rings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sleek and expensive : mobile phones for the rich and famous five years ago mobile phones were the latest rage .
today they are a commodity .
but there still are ways to stand out from the crowd : either by refusing to own a phone altogether , or by spending € 3500 euro for a vertu . it has become hard to impress people with a mobile phone lately .
getting a call on a trendy handset alone certainly wo n't do the trick anymore .
the same goes for funky gadgets to pep up the drab phones like cameras , ring tones or messaging services .
soon after these are released , everyone appears to have them , and instead of being part of the handset avantgarde , the mobile phone afficionado is thrown back into the faceless pool of ordinary handset users .
but thanks to nokia , there is a way for the handset lover to distinguish oneself from the masses .
it is called vertu and comes with a hefty price tag .
the self-proclaimed " first luxury communication company " was launched two years ago as a spin-off by nokia , the world 's largest handset-maker .
the ties to the finnish mother company , however , are kept almost as secret as vertu 's sales or revenue figures .
" we are not allowed to give any sales figure " , daniela wübbeke , the company 's spokesperson for germany , told dw-world .
no gimmicks deep pockets are required to own a vertu phone .
the more affordable " ascent " collection geared towards a younger clientele and launched this year comes in at € 3500 .
the more expensive " signature " collection starts at € 5000 euro for the regular handset and goes up to € 24,000 for the platinum version .
no camera , no video and no radio .
what then , besides the price , makes a vertu so special ?
" each phone consists of 400 separate parts that are put together manually , " explains wübbeke . vertu tries to set itself apart by working with materials commonly not associated with handsets .
" the leather we use for the phones stems from the same people that supply luxury carmakers rolls royce and bentley . "
other materials used are liquidmetal , sapphire , ceramic , gold and silver .
" our phones last at least 15 to 20 years because we use only the best material and refined technology , " says wübbeke .
technology is also the reason vertu phones lack features like cameras , wap or gprs .
" our first collection came without a color display , but as soon as the technology was refined enough , we gave all our customers the option of equipping their phones free of charge with a color display . "
beckham 's concierge another virtu freebie for the first year is the concierge button on every phone .
by pushing it customers are put through to a 24-hour hotline that attends to the callers needs .
whether it is a hotel reservation or getting tickets for otherwise sold out events , the concierge service will try to fulfil requests vertu owners like madonna , gwyneth paltrow or david beckham may have .
while some female celebrities are vertu customers , the majority of vertu owners , at least in germany , are male , says christine meister , who runs the luxury jeweller store brahmfeld & gutrof on the ritzy german resort island sylt .
" men , especially those you also enjoy luxury cars , like vertu more than women do , " she points out .
" many of our customers already own a rolls royce .
for them a vertu phone is a similar status symbol , and by having it , they possess something that other people do n't . "
pricy headset however , success in this market is anything but certain .
just consider the fate of so called fashion-phone xelibri from siemens .
the claim that " xelibri lives on a totally different planet from the technology driven mobile phone brands that exist today " was validated a week ago , when siemens pulled the plug on the brand after only two collections .
according to media reports , the demand for models like the xelibri 6 that let 's one " talk on the phone and apply makeup simultaneously " was weak .

today they are a commodity .
but there still are ways to stand out from the crowd : either by refusing to own a phone altogether , or by spending € 3500 euro for a vertu . it has become hard to impress people with a mobile phone lately .
getting a call on a trendy handset alone certainly wo n't do the trick anymore .
the same goes for funky gadgets to pep up the drab phones like cameras , ring tones or messaging services .
soon after these are released , everyone appears to have them , and instead of being part of the handset avantgarde , the mobile phone afficionado is thrown back into the faceless pool of ordinary handset users .
but thanks to nokia , there is a way for the handset lover to distinguish oneself from the masses .
it is called vertu and comes with a hefty price tag .
the self-proclaimed " first luxury communication company " was launched two years ago as a spin-off by nokia , the world 's largest handset-maker .
the ties to the finnish mother company , however , are kept almost as secret as vertu 's sales or revenue figures .
" we are not allowed to give any sales figure " , daniela wübbeke , the company 's spokesperson for germany , told dw-world .
no gimmicks deep pockets are required to own a vertu phone .
the more affordable " ascent " collection geared towards a younger clientele and launched this year comes in at € 3500 .
the more expensive " signature " collection starts at € 5000 euro for the regular handset and goes up to € 24,000 for the platinum version .
no camera , no video and no radio .
what then , besides the price , makes a vertu so special ?
" each phone consists of 400 separate parts that are put together manually , " explains wübbeke . vertu tries to set itself apart by working with materials commonly not associated with handsets .
" the leather we use for the phones stems from the same people that supply luxury carmakers rolls royce and bentley . "
other materials used are liquidmetal , sapphire , ceramic , gold and silver .
" our phones last at least 15 to 20 years because we use only the best material and refined technology , " says wübbeke .
technology is also the reason vertu phones lack features like cameras , wap or gprs .
" our first collection came without a color display , but as soon as the technology was refined enough , we gave all our customers the option of equipping their phones free of charge with a color display . "

whether it is a hotel reservation or getting tickets for otherwise sold out events , the concierge service will try to fulfil requests vertu owners like madonna , gwyneth paltrow or david beckham may have .
while some female celebrities are vertu customers , the majority of vertu owners , at least in germany , are male , says christine meister , who runs the luxury jeweller store brahmfeld & gutrof on the ritzy german resort island sylt .
" men , especially those you also enjoy luxury cars , like vertu more than women do , " she points out .

the claim that " xelibri lives on a totally different planet from the technology driven mobile phone brands that exist today " was validated a week ago , when siemens pulled the plug on the brand after only two collections .

german chancellor gerhard schröder said thursday economic dependency on oil was playing into the hands of terrorists and urged moving to renewable energy .
separately , opec agreed to raise oil production to ease prices . addressing a four-day international conference on renewable energy in bonn , schröder warned that the one-sidedness of the world 's energy sources had made it a target for terror attacks like the ones last week on saudi arabia 's oil facilities . " we must realize that the world 's overwhelming dependence on oil has enormously increased our vulnerability to this form of terrorism , " schröder said .
the attacks " are directly aimed at striking a vital nerve of humankind , " he added . need for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , right with environment minister jürgen trittin , center , and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul at the renewables conference 2004 in bonn .
schröder said the recent attacks in saudi arabia and the continued instability in iraq made it dramatically clear that the availability of a variety of sources of energy was vital to international security . " making renewable energies a mainstream resource is imperative not just for our economies , it is imperative for security in a globalized world , " he said . schröder urged the 3,000 representatives from 154 nations at the conference to diversify into other energy resources and invest in solar , wind and other renewable fuels and added that countries needed to " reorientate the global energy policy . " schröder pointed towards germany 's own achievements in renewable energy : the country is investing some € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- a year to build wind farms , solar panels and tapping geothermal and other alternative sources of energy . some 120,000 people are estimated to be working in germany 's renewables sector .
the country has also reduced its emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases by nearly a fifth . opec decides to hike output referring to the steady rise in oil prices in recent weeks , in particular after the saudi attacks , schröder warned , " higher energy prices damage the chance for economic development .
they threaten the recovery in developed economies and around the world they hamper the fight against poverty and hunger . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuwaiti oil minister ahmed al-sabah speaks to reporters during the opec meeting in beirut , lebanon on thursday .
at the same time the german chancellor welcomed opec 's -lrb- organization of petroleum exporting countries -rrb- decision thursday to raise its production ceiling by two million barrels a day in july in a bid to bring down spiraling prices of crude oil .
the organization also agreed to raise the target by an additional 500,000 barrels a day in august if it sees a need , it said . opec representatives from qatar , nigeria and the united arab emirates confirmed the decision before the group met for a closed-door meeting to ratify the increase .
in his opening address at the meeting , opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia called on members to do " as much as they can to help stabilize the oil market . " nigerian representative edmund maduabebe daukoru said , " to act as responsible members of the world community , we have to make this strong signal to the market that we are ready to produce to cool the system . " more for alternative energy schröder also backed up his speech with concrete promises of money as he assured that germany would take responsibility for global development . the chancellor vowed germany would provide low-interest loans worth € 500 million between 2005 and 2010 to encourage renewable energy and energy efficiency in developing countries .
the money , channeled through the state development credit agency kredit für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , will go to public , private and semi-public enterprises and local banks , he said . the funds come on top of germany 's pledge of a billion euro until 2010 at the world summit for sustainable development in johannesburg in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first solar-powered ferry shuttle serves the german city of gaienhofen and steckborn on the swiss shore of lake constance .
it can carry up to 50 passengers and 25 bicycles .
schröder 's commitment to renewable energy has been welcomed by environmental organizations and green groups . " schröder is listening to the signals , " said jennifer morgan , head of the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- delegation .
she said the chancellor had made it clear that not just ecological , but also security arguments spoke in favor of renewable energy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " environmental protection is thriving in germany " german environment minister trittin , who has clashed with industry and unions in the past , argues in an interview with dw-tv that eco- friendly policies do n't necessarily run contrary to business interests .

in his opening address at the meeting , opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia called on members to do " as much as they can to help stabilize the oil market . " nigerian representative edmund maduabebe daukoru said , " to act as responsible members of the world community , we have to make this strong signal to the market that we are ready to produce to cool the system . " more for alternative energy schröder also backed up his speech with concrete promises of money as he assured that germany would take responsibility for global development . the chancellor vowed germany would provide low-interest loans worth € 500 million between 2005 and 2010 to encourage renewable energy and energy efficiency in developing countries .
the money , channeled through the state development credit agency kredit für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , will go to public , private and semi-public enterprises and local banks , he said . the funds come on top of germany 's pledge of a billion euro until 2010 at the world summit for sustainable development in johannesburg in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first solar-powered ferry shuttle serves the german city of gaienhofen and steckborn on the swiss shore of lake constance .

institute leaders believe they can operate free of censorship . the goethe institute in pyongyang comprises of 150 square meters packed with 8,000 books , newspapers , cds and videos stored in a cultural center in a space located deep in the heart of the city .
in that sense , the cultural center could be just like any other - if it were n't located in the north korean capital .
on june 3 , a delegation led by the president of the goethe institute opened the first western cultural institution in the stalinist state .
the move has been viewed as controversial , since north korea still remains almost completely shut off from the rest of the world .
after years of preparation , north korean officials opened the door for the goethe institute and its cultural undertaking .
uwe schmelter , who heads the goethe institute in neighboring south korea , led the negotiations , which began in early 2001 .
he found the atmosphere of the talks surprisingly good .
" the negotiations were not easy , " says schmelter , " but they were very friendly and harmonious .
at stake were the necessary requirements - at least from the goethe institute ’ s perspective - of opening and running such a reading room . "
this , schmelter adds , includes " the free and open access for all north koreans and the uncensored and accessible viewing of all media . "
a balancing act these stipulations , a hallmark of the goethe institute 's work , were at first hard to accept for the north korean authorities , who aim to prevent information from overseas from reaching the country .
but at the end of the negotiations , a delicate compromise was reached .
under the agreement , 50 percent of the goethe institute 's literature will focus on science and technology , with the other 50 percent devoted to general media that provides a complete and up-to-date view of germany .
although north korean authorities agreed to give the goethe institute complete control over which media to feature , the new reading room in pyongyang is to be run entirely by local north korean staff .
but schmelter is optimistic that the authorities will adhere to their agreement to allow uncensored and free access to everyone .
historic parallels schmelter also describes what he views as north koreans ’ affinity towards germans .
" the shared fate of living in a divided country for 40 years makes koreans feel very close to germans , " he says .
" in a way , north koreans even consider germans to be their chosen relatives . "
for some like schmelter , this historical parallel is reason enough to see the opening of the goethe institute in north korea as a source of hope for the future .
in a statement , germany 's foreign ministry said the opening of the institute marked an " important expansion of -lrb- the country 's -rrb- cultural presence " in north korea , a place where very little information is available about germany .

today they are a commodity .
but there still are ways to stand out from the crowd : either by refusing to own a phone altogether , or by spending € 3500 euro for a vertu . it has become hard to impress people with a mobile phone lately .
getting a call on a trendy handset alone certainly wo n't do the trick anymore .
the same goes for funky gadgets to pep up the drab phones like cameras , ring tones or messaging services .
soon after these are released , everyone appears to have them , and instead of being part of the handset avantgarde , the mobile phone afficionado is thrown back into the faceless pool of ordinary handset users .
but thanks to nokia , there is a way for the handset lover to distinguish oneself from the masses .
it is called vertu and comes with a hefty price tag .
the self-proclaimed " first luxury communication company " was launched two years ago as a spin-off by nokia , the world 's largest handset-maker .
the ties to the finnish mother company , however , are kept almost as secret as vertu 's sales or revenue figures .
" we are not allowed to give any sales figure " , daniela wübbeke , the company 's spokesperson for germany , told dw-world .
no gimmicks deep pockets are required to own a vertu phone .
the more affordable " ascent " collection geared towards a younger clientele and launched this year comes in at € 3500 .
the more expensive " signature " collection starts at € 5000 euro for the regular handset and goes up to € 24,000 for the platinum version .
no camera , no video and no radio .
what then , besides the price , makes a vertu so special ?
" each phone consists of 400 separate parts that are put together manually , " explains wübbeke . vertu tries to set itself apart by working with materials commonly not associated with handsets .
" the leather we use for the phones stems from the same people that supply luxury carmakers rolls royce and bentley . "
other materials used are liquidmetal , sapphire , ceramic , gold and silver .
" our phones last at least 15 to 20 years because we use only the best material and refined technology , " says wübbeke .
technology is also the reason vertu phones lack features like cameras , wap or gprs .
" our first collection came without a color display , but as soon as the technology was refined enough , we gave all our customers the option of equipping their phones free of charge with a color display . "
beckham 's concierge another virtu freebie for the first year is the concierge button on every phone .
by pushing it customers are put through to a 24-hour hotline that attends to the callers needs .
whether it is a hotel reservation or getting tickets for otherwise sold out events , the concierge service will try to fulfil requests vertu owners like madonna , gwyneth paltrow or david beckham may have .
while some female celebrities are vertu customers , the majority of vertu owners , at least in germany , are male , says christine meister , who runs the luxury jeweller store brahmfeld & gutrof on the ritzy german resort island sylt .
" men , especially those you also enjoy luxury cars , like vertu more than women do , " she points out .
" many of our customers already own a rolls royce .
for them a vertu phone is a similar status symbol , and by having it , they possess something that other people do n't . "
pricy headset however , success in this market is anything but certain .
just consider the fate of so called fashion-phone xelibri from siemens .
the claim that " xelibri lives on a totally different planet from the technology driven mobile phone brands that exist today " was validated a week ago , when siemens pulled the plug on the brand after only two collections .
according to media reports , the demand for models like the xelibri 6 that let 's one " talk on the phone and apply makeup simultaneously " was weak .
vertu 's future looks bright , insists wübbeke .
" we have so many orders for our new collection that we have to run extra shifts to speed up production .

in a statement , germany 's foreign ministry said the opening of the institute marked an " important expansion of -lrb- the country 's -rrb- cultural presence " in north korea , a place where very little information is available about germany .
the goethe institute is the main arbiter of german culture and language abroad , with 127 institutes in other countries . marianna yahilevich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goethe institute opens doors in kabul germany ’ s international cultural organization , the goethe institute , is poised to re-open in the afghan capital of kabul after 12 years of closure brought on by the rise of the taliban regime .

as the international conference for the promotion of renewable energies enters its third day in bonn , the german chancellor gerhard schröder is preparing to bang his drum for a cause close to his heart . the chancellor proposed the meeting after the 2002 world summit for sustainable development in the south african city of johannesburg failed to buckle under european pressure to draw up timetables and targets for boosting renewable energy use .
this time around , delegates at the four-day conference in bonn aim to come up with an " international action program , " setting out specific commitments by individual governments and the international community .
environment minister jürgen trittin told the 3,000 conference delegates wednesday that renewable energy sources could be the solution to poverty and climate change across the world .
" we need an accelerated global increase in the use of renewable energies , " he said . " we must get down to business .
we must enable this global increase to become reality , to combat global poverty , to combat global warming .
let 's make it real . "
concrete steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants in the renewables 2004 conference attend a session in germany 's former parliament building in bonn .
on wednesday , 350 parliamentarians from more than 70 countries took a significant step towards pushing renewable energy sources further towards the mainstream when they released a document calling for the establishment of an international renewable energy agency modeled after the international atomic agency in vienna .
german parliamentarian and president of the eurosolar organization for renewables , hermann scheer , believes it is the only logical way forward .
" intergovernemtal agencies exist for the promotion of atomic energy , for the promotion of fossil energy , but not exclusively for renewable energies , " scheer told deutsche welle . " and this bias is one of the reasons why the dissemination of renewable energies does n't come through world-wide and why much misinformation is filling decision-maker 's minds . "
broad agreement remarkably , german politicians across the political spectrum have agreed on the fundamental ideas of the new agency , as have parliamentarians from countries such as pakistan and nigeria .the precise content of the action plan is still unclear , but germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , co-host of the bonn conference , has her sights set ambitiously high .
she wants to see half the world using renewable energy sources by the year 2050 , and not only for geo-political reasons .

with latin american countries pledging to increase their share of renewable energy sources by 10 percent before the year 2020 , there is certainly some promise of commitment in the air in bonn .

as the international conference for the promotion of renewable energies enters its third day in bonn , the german chancellor gerhard schröder is preparing to bang his drum for a cause close to his heart . the chancellor proposed the meeting after the 2002 world summit for sustainable development in the south african city of johannesburg failed to buckle under european pressure to draw up timetables and targets for boosting renewable energy use .
this time around , delegates at the four-day conference in bonn aim to come up with an " international action program , " setting out specific commitments by individual governments and the international community .
environment minister jürgen trittin told the 3,000 conference delegates wednesday that renewable energy sources could be the solution to poverty and climate change across the world .
" we need an accelerated global increase in the use of renewable energies , " he said . " we must get down to business .
we must enable this global increase to become reality , to combat global poverty , to combat global warming .
let 's make it real . "
concrete steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants in the renewables 2004 conference attend a session in germany 's former parliament building in bonn .
on wednesday , 350 parliamentarians from more than 70 countries took a significant step towards pushing renewable energy sources further towards the mainstream when they released a document calling for the establishment of an international renewable energy agency modeled after the international atomic agency in vienna .
german parliamentarian and president of the eurosolar organization for renewables , hermann scheer , believes it is the only logical way forward .
" intergovernemtal agencies exist for the promotion of atomic energy , for the promotion of fossil energy , but not exclusively for renewable energies , " scheer told deutsche welle . " and this bias is one of the reasons why the dissemination of renewable energies does n't come through world-wide and why much misinformation is filling decision-maker 's minds . "
broad agreement remarkably , german politicians across the political spectrum have agreed on the fundamental ideas of the new agency , as have parliamentarians from countries such as pakistan and nigeria .the precise content of the action plan is still unclear , but germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , co-host of the bonn conference , has her sights set ambitiously high .
she wants to see half the world using renewable energy sources by the year 2050 , and not only for geo-political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- spd -rrb- and environment minister jürgen trittin open the conference in bonn .
" i think it could be possible to give one billion energy-poor people access to renewable energy .
it might be ambitious , but it would also prevent other conflicts , make us less dependent on centralised powers , and fight climate change .
so all the advantages are in this field , " wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
with latin american countries pledging to increase their share of renewable energy sources by 10 percent before the year 2020 , there is certainly some promise of commitment in the air in bonn .
but ecologists are worried that behind-the-scenes haggling could dangerously water down any real commitment , ruining the best political opportunity in a generation to help wean the world off oil .
there is a danger too , that the united states , japan , france and brazil , which managed to root out any reference to timetables or market percentages at the 2002 summit in johannesburg , might try to do the same once again in bonn . john hay -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy for the future dw-radio presents a special series on alternative power projects in germany and abroad .

the eu 's justice and home affairs commissioner has called for more to be done to find a common policy on immigration across the bloc . five years after a common european asylum and immigration policy was initiated at a summit in the finnish city of tampere , justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino called on his european union colleagues to work towards a " uniform status " for admitting legal migrants for employment purposes into the union and encourage the immigration of more non-eu nationals . speaking in brussels on wednesday , vitorino told the gathered officials that the approach of different member states in the area of asylum and immigration had delayed the creation of a cohesive common policy and specifically stressed the need for the eu to regulate laws on legal immigration for economic reasons . " it is necessary to make headway in terms of economic immigration policy and the right of every member state to fix the number of immigrants , " vitorino said .
" we need collaboration on a european level and must specifically concentrate on the integration of immigrants . " vitorino added that , since the so-called tampere program was introduced in 1999 , which was intended to form a cooperative base for member states on matters such as asylum , immigration and the fight against terrorism , some progress had been made .
the commissioner quoted the implementation of the european arrest warrant as an example of the fruits of tampere 's labor . the commissioner was speaking on the day when the european commission adopted a communication on the results of the tampere program . a second program which will set out further plans for " an area of freedom , security and justice " is expected to be in place by the second half of 2004 despite continuing differences between states on the issues involved .
conflicting views the delay in formulating a common policy stems from conflicting views throughout the bloc .
there is particular controversy in germany where the social democrat government and conservative opposition have negotiated their own immigration law .
the european commission would require member states to take on more immigrants than the current german bill allows . vitorino said the negotiations needed in reaching a unanimous agreement on proposals made the resolving of the issue " complicated " and had led to less ambitious outcomes .
" there have been moments of joy , but also of sorrow and intense depression , " he admitted . human rights group criticizes eu the record of the european union in the area of immigration over the last five years has drawn criticism from human rights organization amnesty international .
a statement from amnesty said that " from a human rights perspective , the picture is not positive . " " the eu has created an area that has diminished the legitimate rights of refugees , that is less secure than it should be because of the lack of human rights safeguards hampering the fight against crime , and that is free for many , but certainly not for all , " the amnesty assessment read .
un body calls for cohesion on refugees the united nations commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- also called on the eu to regulate a common refugee policy to guarantee that those seeking protection from certain crisis regions would be treated on an equal basis everywhere within the bloc .
jean mouchet , the unhcr representative in brussels , added to the statement by telling reporters that some member states , especially the ten new countries admitted at the start of may , urgently needed help to improve their asylum systems . one particular area in which the european union was accused of compromising the rights of immigrants was the bloc 's security agenda .
amnesty criticized the eu for shifting its focus to combating illegal immigration as part of its anti-terror initiatives at the expense of making policies to facilitate legal immigration . the fight against terror goes on , says vitorino vitorino countered the criticism by pledging that the fight against terrorism would remain among the union 's priorities .
he added that the eu would also continue to cooperate in future to shore up the bloc 's external frontiers in the east to prevent unlawful immigration . but he warned germany , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and austria , who want to form a pilot group to increase the fight against terrorism and unlawful immigration , not to consider separatist police actions outside the european union .

president bush has likened the u.s.-led war on terror to world war ii ahead of d-day celebrations .
deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments that a dip into history books would have been advisable before his talk . in a speech to 981 air force academy cadets on wednesday , united states president george w. bush said the soldiers were fighting the same war as those who battled the nazis . he also said the war on terror resembled " the great clashes of the last century " between democracy and totalitarianism .
the u.s. president vowed that america would continue to strike terror groups around the world . deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments . there it is again - the comparison that george w. bush used even before the iraq war : the battle against saddam hussein and against terrorism is comparable to world war ii .
the enemies of the united states still believe today , as they did then , that the americans are weak and can be defeated .
but today , much like then , the u.s. will prove they are wrong .
the americans will fight resolutely and not rest until the enemies are crushed . it 's a strident tone that fits the run-up to the d-day ceremony and also the presidential election campaign , but not the political reality in which the u.s. president is ordering his military deployments . sept .
11 was n't and is n't comparable to pearl harbor , the terror groups of osama bin laden are n't comparable to nazi germany .
even saddam hussein 's regime can not and should not be likened to hitler 's . al qaeda 's bloody terror is to be totally condemned and rejected .
but these groups do n't conquer new lands , they do n't perpetrate genocide and they do n't wage a conventional war against the united states or any other country .
not even against israel , which they have declared as their arch enemy . al qaeda perpetrates terror much like other groups before it have done in other places and much like others that will do the same after it .
only the criminal efficiency of al qaeda is much greater than ever before . this is certainly a challenge and not just for the u.s. but it 's by no means a " war . "
and military means is not the only way -lrb- or at least not in the long-term -rrb- to defeat terrorism .
afghanistan has more than clearly demonstrated that .
and what about saddam hussein 's regime ? bush 's father was in a better position to remind one of world war ii when he freed kuwait .
bush junior waged a war without iraq having occupied other countries and without any scrap of proof for his alleged evil plans - right from weapons of mass destruction to the threat of new aggression . even the american officials , whom bush reminded of world war ii , know that the evidence does not exist .
it 's difficult to imagine that they believe bush 's words about a holy mission . and what of the questions of democracy and freedom ? naturally " d-day " was the prelude to the liberation of europe from nazi-german occupation .
but it 's not comparable to the middle east : the only occupier there is called israel and is - at least on its own state territory - the only democracy in the region . the other countries are repressed by their own leaders , who do n't consider giving their people more freedom .
in any case not because saddam hussein was toppled .
what has taken place since saddam 's unseating should be guarantee enough for the arab regimes that washington will not want to wage any further wars in the region . after all , even a year after the war and the appointment of an interim government , democracy in iraq is still a distant dream .
even in this respect bush is wrong .
or he 's making a mistake if he equates " liberation " with " democratization . "
here , one can only advise , and not just him , a glance in the history books . even today in germany one does n't speak of " day of liberation " , but of " defeat " , " capitulation " and similar things .
and that , despite the fact that we 've long become a democracy .
but even this process takes a while : it took four years for germany to frame its constitution and hold its first post-world war ii free elections .
then it took a full ten years until sovereignty was achieved . and in iraq the same should happen overnight ?
without any kind of democratic past , without experienced and untarnished politicians ? the u.s. president should know that some things just ca n't be compared . peter philipp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism continues despite new resolution on iraq a revised draft for a un resolution on iraq 's future proposed by the u.s. and britain would set a departure date for foreign troops , but some security council members said more changes are still needed .
-lrb- june 2 , 2004 -rrb- schröder : d-day is a symbol of freedom chancellor schröder lauded the 60th anniversary celebrations of the 1944 allied landings in normandy as a symbol of the fight for freedom and democracy .
he 'll be the first german leader to take part in d-day festivities .

the eu 's justice and home affairs commissioner has called for more to be done to find a common policy on immigration across the bloc . five years after a common european asylum and immigration policy was initiated at a summit in the finnish city of tampere , justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino called on his european union colleagues to work towards a " uniform status " for admitting legal migrants for employment purposes into the union and encourage the immigration of more non-eu nationals . speaking in brussels on wednesday , vitorino told the gathered officials that the approach of different member states in the area of asylum and immigration had delayed the creation of a cohesive common policy and specifically stressed the need for the eu to regulate laws on legal immigration for economic reasons . " it is necessary to make headway in terms of economic immigration policy and the right of every member state to fix the number of immigrants , " vitorino said .
" we need collaboration on a european level and must specifically concentrate on the integration of immigrants . " vitorino added that , since the so-called tampere program was introduced in 1999 , which was intended to form a cooperative base for member states on matters such as asylum , immigration and the fight against terrorism , some progress had been made .
the commissioner quoted the implementation of the european arrest warrant as an example of the fruits of tampere 's labor . the commissioner was speaking on the day when the european commission adopted a communication on the results of the tampere program . a second program which will set out further plans for " an area of freedom , security and justice " is expected to be in place by the second half of 2004 despite continuing differences between states on the issues involved .
conflicting views the delay in formulating a common policy stems from conflicting views throughout the bloc .
there is particular controversy in germany where the social democrat government and conservative opposition have negotiated their own immigration law .
the european commission would require member states to take on more immigrants than the current german bill allows . vitorino said the negotiations needed in reaching a unanimous agreement on proposals made the resolving of the issue " complicated " and had led to less ambitious outcomes .
" there have been moments of joy , but also of sorrow and intense depression , " he admitted . human rights group criticizes eu the record of the european union in the area of immigration over the last five years has drawn criticism from human rights organization amnesty international .
a statement from amnesty said that " from a human rights perspective , the picture is not positive . " " the eu has created an area that has diminished the legitimate rights of refugees , that is less secure than it should be because of the lack of human rights safeguards hampering the fight against crime , and that is free for many , but certainly not for all , " the amnesty assessment read .
un body calls for cohesion on refugees the united nations commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- also called on the eu to regulate a common refugee policy to guarantee that those seeking protection from certain crisis regions would be treated on an equal basis everywhere within the bloc .
jean mouchet , the unhcr representative in brussels , added to the statement by telling reporters that some member states , especially the ten new countries admitted at the start of may , urgently needed help to improve their asylum systems . one particular area in which the european union was accused of compromising the rights of immigrants was the bloc 's security agenda .
amnesty criticized the eu for shifting its focus to combating illegal immigration as part of its anti-terror initiatives at the expense of making policies to facilitate legal immigration . the fight against terror goes on , says vitorino vitorino countered the criticism by pledging that the fight against terrorism would remain among the union 's priorities .
he added that the eu would also continue to cooperate in future to shore up the bloc 's external frontiers in the east to prevent unlawful immigration . but he warned germany , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and austria , who want to form a pilot group to increase the fight against terrorism and unlawful immigration , not to consider separatist police actions outside the european union .

steps have been taken to dam the flow , but the next wave is already gathering strength . a huge crest of paperwork is rolling towards the european commission , threatening to swamp the 25,000 civil servants working in brussels .
last year , the arduous bureaucrats churned out more paper than ever before : 1.5 million pages had to be translated into what were then the 11 official eu languages .
now the translators are sinking in the vast ocean of work backing up behind them .
at last count , they were 60,000 pages behind , and if the momentum continues at the same pace , that could soon increase to 300,000 . keep it short ! the eu wants to drastically reduce the flow of work to be translated , and has issued an edict instructing beavering bureaucrats to reduce the length of " memorandums " - the official title for commission texts - from the current average of 50 pages to a mere 15 . " keep it short ! " is the new motto among the brussels insiders , a throwback to the days of public telephone boxes long before mobile phone become a mainstream play thing .
each year the pile of papers grows by about five percent .
and eu commissioner neil kinnock admits that if things continue as they are , it will be the death of the translation department . already , the translation department is the biggest single eu installation .
more than 2,400 translators transfer their colleagues ' warblings into the now 20 official languages , from finnish to maltese to slovenian .
although the number of translators working there was upped with expansion at the start of may , the eu personnel department did n't manage to get enough qualified staff onboard in advance of expansion .
despite seven years of planning , there were apparently not enough qualified translators available , or at least that is the line commissioner kinnock is sticking to . language acrobats rather than take on hundreds and hundreds of extra translators , the plan is to increase the productivity of the translation service by 40 percent by the end of 2006 .
internal working papers are now only translated into english , french or german , but everything that leaves the building to go to citizens , companies or courts has to be translated - and precisely . some of the new member states have already started grumbling that their language is not taken seriously enough by the commission .
and in some places , the internet presence of the nine new languages could serve to back their complaints .
the language acrobats back at base , however , claim this is only a transitional phase . but in 2007 , bulgarian , rumanian and maybe even croatia will join the swelling linguistic ranks of the union .
with a couple of years warning , there is ample time for the commission to go in search of translators who can work , let 's say from estonian into turkish .
if turkey were to join the eu at some point over the next ten or 15 years , it 's high population would mean it brought with it one of the most widely spoken languages .
it is not only the commission , but also the other institutions , such as the european council , the parliament and the european court of justice in luxembourg with massive translation departments .
and they , too , are feeling the force of the surging workload . flood on the horizon the next floods are already gathering strength on the horizon .
spain is currently applying to have catalan , galician and basque recognized as official eu languages .
if accepted , it would n't mean that everything had to be translated into these languages , but catalans , galicians and the basques would have the right to approach eu organs in their mother tongue , just as the irish can already do in their traditional gaelic . bernd riegert -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how do you say accession in maltese ?
the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs . -lrb- 2 may 2004 -rrb- 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

president bush has likened the u.s.-led war on terror to world war ii ahead of d-day celebrations .
deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments that a dip into history books would have been advisable before his talk . in a speech to 981 air force academy cadets on wednesday , united states president george w. bush said the soldiers were fighting the same war as those who battled the nazis . he also said the war on terror resembled " the great clashes of the last century " between democracy and totalitarianism .
the u.s. president vowed that america would continue to strike terror groups around the world . deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments . there it is again - the comparison that george w. bush used even before the iraq war : the battle against saddam hussein and against terrorism is comparable to world war ii .
the enemies of the united states still believe today , as they did then , that the americans are weak and can be defeated .
but today , much like then , the u.s. will prove they are wrong .
the americans will fight resolutely and not rest until the enemies are crushed . it 's a strident tone that fits the run-up to the d-day ceremony and also the presidential election campaign , but not the political reality in which the u.s. president is ordering his military deployments . sept .
11 was n't and is n't comparable to pearl harbor , the terror groups of osama bin laden are n't comparable to nazi germany .
even saddam hussein 's regime can not and should not be likened to hitler 's . al qaeda 's bloody terror is to be totally condemned and rejected .
but these groups do n't conquer new lands , they do n't perpetrate genocide and they do n't wage a conventional war against the united states or any other country .
not even against israel , which they have declared as their arch enemy . al qaeda perpetrates terror much like other groups before it have done in other places and much like others that will do the same after it .
only the criminal efficiency of al qaeda is much greater than ever before . this is certainly a challenge and not just for the u.s. but it 's by no means a " war . "
and military means is not the only way -lrb- or at least not in the long-term -rrb- to defeat terrorism .
afghanistan has more than clearly demonstrated that .
and what about saddam hussein 's regime ? bush 's father was in a better position to remind one of world war ii when he freed kuwait .
bush junior waged a war without iraq having occupied other countries and without any scrap of proof for his alleged evil plans - right from weapons of mass destruction to the threat of new aggression . even the american officials , whom bush reminded of world war ii , know that the evidence does not exist .
it 's difficult to imagine that they believe bush 's words about a holy mission . and what of the questions of democracy and freedom ? naturally " d-day " was the prelude to the liberation of europe from nazi-german occupation .
but it 's not comparable to the middle east : the only occupier there is called israel and is - at least on its own state territory - the only democracy in the region . the other countries are repressed by their own leaders , who do n't consider giving their people more freedom .
in any case not because saddam hussein was toppled .
what has taken place since saddam 's unseating should be guarantee enough for the arab regimes that washington will not want to wage any further wars in the region . after all , even a year after the war and the appointment of an interim government , democracy in iraq is still a distant dream .
even in this respect bush is wrong .
or he 's making a mistake if he equates " liberation " with " democratization . "
here , one can only advise , and not just him , a glance in the history books . even today in germany one does n't speak of " day of liberation " , but of " defeat " , " capitulation " and similar things .
and that , despite the fact that we 've long become a democracy .
but even this process takes a while : it took four years for germany to frame its constitution and hold its first post-world war ii free elections .
then it took a full ten years until sovereignty was achieved . and in iraq the same should happen overnight ?
without any kind of democratic past , without experienced and untarnished politicians ? the u.s. president should know that some things just ca n't be compared . peter philipp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism continues despite new resolution on iraq a revised draft for a un resolution on iraq 's future proposed by the u.s. and britain would set a departure date for foreign troops , but some security council members said more changes are still needed .

institute leaders believe they can operate free of censorship . the goethe institute in pyongyang comprises of 150 square meters packed with 8,000 books , newspapers , cds and videos stored in a cultural center in a space located deep in the heart of the city .
in that sense , the cultural center could be just like any other - if it were n't located in the north korean capital .
on june 3 , a delegation led by the president of the goethe institute opened the first western cultural institution in the stalinist state .
the move has been viewed as controversial , since north korea still remains almost completely shut off from the rest of the world .
after years of preparation , north korean officials opened the door for the goethe institute and its cultural undertaking .
uwe schmelter , who heads the goethe institute in neighboring south korea , led the negotiations , which began in early 2001 .
he found the atmosphere of the talks surprisingly good .
" the negotiations were not easy , " says schmelter , " but they were very friendly and harmonious .
at stake were the necessary requirements - at least from the goethe institute ’ s perspective - of opening and running such a reading room . "
this , schmelter adds , includes " the free and open access for all north koreans and the uncensored and accessible viewing of all media . "
a balancing act these stipulations , a hallmark of the goethe institute 's work , were at first hard to accept for the north korean authorities , who aim to prevent information from overseas from reaching the country .
but at the end of the negotiations , a delicate compromise was reached .
under the agreement , 50 percent of the goethe institute 's literature will focus on science and technology , with the other 50 percent devoted to general media that provides a complete and up-to-date view of germany .
although north korean authorities agreed to give the goethe institute complete control over which media to feature , the new reading room in pyongyang is to be run entirely by local north korean staff .
but schmelter is optimistic that the authorities will adhere to their agreement to allow uncensored and free access to everyone .
historic parallels schmelter also describes what he views as north koreans ’ affinity towards germans .
" the shared fate of living in a divided country for 40 years makes koreans feel very close to germans , " he says .
" in a way , north koreans even consider germans to be their chosen relatives . "
for some like schmelter , this historical parallel is reason enough to see the opening of the goethe institute in north korea as a source of hope for the future .
in a statement , germany 's foreign ministry said the opening of the institute marked an " important expansion of -lrb- the country 's -rrb- cultural presence " in north korea , a place where very little information is available about germany .
the goethe institute is the main arbiter of german culture and language abroad , with 127 institutes in other countries . marianna yahilevich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goethe institute opens doors in kabul germany ’ s international cultural organization , the goethe institute , is poised to re-open in the afghan capital of kabul after 12 years of closure brought on by the rise of the taliban regime .

president bush has likened the u.s.-led war on terror to world war ii ahead of d-day celebrations .
deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments that a dip into history books would have been advisable before his talk . in a speech to 981 air force academy cadets on wednesday , united states president george w. bush said the soldiers were fighting the same war as those who battled the nazis . he also said the war on terror resembled " the great clashes of the last century " between democracy and totalitarianism .
the u.s. president vowed that america would continue to strike terror groups around the world . deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments . there it is again - the comparison that george w. bush used even before the iraq war : the battle against saddam hussein and against terrorism is comparable to world war ii .
the enemies of the united states still believe today , as they did then , that the americans are weak and can be defeated .
but today , much like then , the u.s. will prove they are wrong .
the americans will fight resolutely and not rest until the enemies are crushed . it 's a strident tone that fits the run-up to the d-day ceremony and also the presidential election campaign , but not the political reality in which the u.s. president is ordering his military deployments . sept .
11 was n't and is n't comparable to pearl harbor , the terror groups of osama bin laden are n't comparable to nazi germany .
even saddam hussein 's regime can not and should not be likened to hitler 's . al qaeda 's bloody terror is to be totally condemned and rejected .
but these groups do n't conquer new lands , they do n't perpetrate genocide and they do n't wage a conventional war against the united states or any other country .
not even against israel , which they have declared as their arch enemy . al qaeda perpetrates terror much like other groups before it have done in other places and much like others that will do the same after it .
only the criminal efficiency of al qaeda is much greater than ever before . this is certainly a challenge and not just for the u.s. but it 's by no means a " war . "
and military means is not the only way -lrb- or at least not in the long-term -rrb- to defeat terrorism .
afghanistan has more than clearly demonstrated that .
and what about saddam hussein 's regime ? bush 's father was in a better position to remind one of world war ii when he freed kuwait .
bush junior waged a war without iraq having occupied other countries and without any scrap of proof for his alleged evil plans - right from weapons of mass destruction to the threat of new aggression . even the american officials , whom bush reminded of world war ii , know that the evidence does not exist .
it 's difficult to imagine that they believe bush 's words about a holy mission . and what of the questions of democracy and freedom ? naturally " d-day " was the prelude to the liberation of europe from nazi-german occupation .
but it 's not comparable to the middle east : the only occupier there is called israel and is - at least on its own state territory - the only democracy in the region . the other countries are repressed by their own leaders , who do n't consider giving their people more freedom .
in any case not because saddam hussein was toppled .
what has taken place since saddam 's unseating should be guarantee enough for the arab regimes that washington will not want to wage any further wars in the region . after all , even a year after the war and the appointment of an interim government , democracy in iraq is still a distant dream .
even in this respect bush is wrong .
or he 's making a mistake if he equates " liberation " with " democratization . "
here , one can only advise , and not just him , a glance in the history books . even today in germany one does n't speak of " day of liberation " , but of " defeat " , " capitulation " and similar things .
and that , despite the fact that we 've long become a democracy .
but even this process takes a while : it took four years for germany to frame its constitution and hold its first post-world war ii free elections .
then it took a full ten years until sovereignty was achieved . and in iraq the same should happen overnight ?

swiss finance minister hans-rudolf merz on thursday said he was in favor of an alliance with lufthansa .
in frankfurt , a lufthansa spokesman told reuters the airline saw no need for further talks with swiss after the latter decided to cast its lot with british airways last year , but added it would be open if swiss knocked on its door again .
" it looks like an approach with lufthansa will be a topic again - which we always thought was the safer option - even though that will of course not be said at the moment , " said claude zehnder , market analyst at zürcher kantonalbank .

steps have been taken to dam the flow , but the next wave is already gathering strength . a huge crest of paperwork is rolling towards the european commission , threatening to swamp the 25,000 civil servants working in brussels .
last year , the arduous bureaucrats churned out more paper than ever before : 1.5 million pages had to be translated into what were then the 11 official eu languages .
now the translators are sinking in the vast ocean of work backing up behind them .
at last count , they were 60,000 pages behind , and if the momentum continues at the same pace , that could soon increase to 300,000 . keep it short ! the eu wants to drastically reduce the flow of work to be translated , and has issued an edict instructing beavering bureaucrats to reduce the length of " memorandums " - the official title for commission texts - from the current average of 50 pages to a mere 15 . " keep it short ! " is the new motto among the brussels insiders , a throwback to the days of public telephone boxes long before mobile phone become a mainstream play thing .
each year the pile of papers grows by about five percent .
and eu commissioner neil kinnock admits that if things continue as they are , it will be the death of the translation department . already , the translation department is the biggest single eu installation .
more than 2,400 translators transfer their colleagues ' warblings into the now 20 official languages , from finnish to maltese to slovenian .
although the number of translators working there was upped with expansion at the start of may , the eu personnel department did n't manage to get enough qualified staff onboard in advance of expansion .
despite seven years of planning , there were apparently not enough qualified translators available , or at least that is the line commissioner kinnock is sticking to . language acrobats rather than take on hundreds and hundreds of extra translators , the plan is to increase the productivity of the translation service by 40 percent by the end of 2006 .
internal working papers are now only translated into english , french or german , but everything that leaves the building to go to citizens , companies or courts has to be translated - and precisely . some of the new member states have already started grumbling that their language is not taken seriously enough by the commission .
and in some places , the internet presence of the nine new languages could serve to back their complaints .
the language acrobats back at base , however , claim this is only a transitional phase . but in 2007 , bulgarian , rumanian and maybe even croatia will join the swelling linguistic ranks of the union .
with a couple of years warning , there is ample time for the commission to go in search of translators who can work , let 's say from estonian into turkish .
if turkey were to join the eu at some point over the next ten or 15 years , it 's high population would mean it brought with it one of the most widely spoken languages .
it is not only the commission , but also the other institutions , such as the european council , the parliament and the european court of justice in luxembourg with massive translation departments .
and they , too , are feeling the force of the surging workload . flood on the horizon the next floods are already gathering strength on the horizon .
spain is currently applying to have catalan , galician and basque recognized as official eu languages .
if accepted , it would n't mean that everything had to be translated into these languages , but catalans , galicians and the basques would have the right to approach eu organs in their mother tongue , just as the irish can already do in their traditional gaelic . bernd riegert -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how do you say accession in maltese ?
the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs . -lrb- 2 may 2004 -rrb- 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the u.s. president vowed that america would continue to strike terror groups around the world . deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments . there it is again - the comparison that george w. bush used even before the iraq war : the battle against saddam hussein and against terrorism is comparable to world war ii .
the enemies of the united states still believe today , as they did then , that the americans are weak and can be defeated .
but today , much like then , the u.s. will prove they are wrong .
the americans will fight resolutely and not rest until the enemies are crushed . it 's a strident tone that fits the run-up to the d-day ceremony and also the presidential election campaign , but not the political reality in which the u.s. president is ordering his military deployments . sept .
11 was n't and is n't comparable to pearl harbor , the terror groups of osama bin laden are n't comparable to nazi germany .
even saddam hussein 's regime can not and should not be likened to hitler 's . al qaeda 's bloody terror is to be totally condemned and rejected .
but these groups do n't conquer new lands , they do n't perpetrate genocide and they do n't wage a conventional war against the united states or any other country .
not even against israel , which they have declared as their arch enemy . al qaeda perpetrates terror much like other groups before it have done in other places and much like others that will do the same after it .
only the criminal efficiency of al qaeda is much greater than ever before . this is certainly a challenge and not just for the u.s. but it 's by no means a " war . "
and military means is not the only way -lrb- or at least not in the long-term -rrb- to defeat terrorism .
afghanistan has more than clearly demonstrated that .
and what about saddam hussein 's regime ? bush 's father was in a better position to remind one of world war ii when he freed kuwait .
bush junior waged a war without iraq having occupied other countries and without any scrap of proof for his alleged evil plans - right from weapons of mass destruction to the threat of new aggression . even the american officials , whom bush reminded of world war ii , know that the evidence does not exist .
it 's difficult to imagine that they believe bush 's words about a holy mission . and what of the questions of democracy and freedom ? naturally " d-day " was the prelude to the liberation of europe from nazi-german occupation .
but it 's not comparable to the middle east : the only occupier there is called israel and is - at least on its own state territory - the only democracy in the region . the other countries are repressed by their own leaders , who do n't consider giving their people more freedom .
in any case not because saddam hussein was toppled .
what has taken place since saddam 's unseating should be guarantee enough for the arab regimes that washington will not want to wage any further wars in the region . after all , even a year after the war and the appointment of an interim government , democracy in iraq is still a distant dream .
even in this respect bush is wrong .
or he 's making a mistake if he equates " liberation " with " democratization . "
here , one can only advise , and not just him , a glance in the history books . even today in germany one does n't speak of " day of liberation " , but of " defeat " , " capitulation " and similar things .
and that , despite the fact that we 've long become a democracy .
but even this process takes a while : it took four years for germany to frame its constitution and hold its first post-world war ii free elections .
then it took a full ten years until sovereignty was achieved . and in iraq the same should happen overnight ?
without any kind of democratic past , without experienced and untarnished politicians ? the u.s. president should know that some things just ca n't be compared . peter philipp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism continues despite new resolution on iraq a revised draft for a un resolution on iraq 's future proposed by the u.s. and britain would set a departure date for foreign troops , but some security council members said more changes are still needed .

the eu 's justice and home affairs commissioner has called for more to be done to find a common policy on immigration across the bloc . five years after a common european asylum and immigration policy was initiated at a summit in the finnish city of tampere , justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino called on his european union colleagues to work towards a " uniform status " for admitting legal migrants for employment purposes into the union and encourage the immigration of more non-eu nationals . speaking in brussels on wednesday , vitorino told the gathered officials that the approach of different member states in the area of asylum and immigration had delayed the creation of a cohesive common policy and specifically stressed the need for the eu to regulate laws on legal immigration for economic reasons . " it is necessary to make headway in terms of economic immigration policy and the right of every member state to fix the number of immigrants , " vitorino said .
" we need collaboration on a european level and must specifically concentrate on the integration of immigrants . " vitorino added that , since the so-called tampere program was introduced in 1999 , which was intended to form a cooperative base for member states on matters such as asylum , immigration and the fight against terrorism , some progress had been made .
the commissioner quoted the implementation of the european arrest warrant as an example of the fruits of tampere 's labor . the commissioner was speaking on the day when the european commission adopted a communication on the results of the tampere program . a second program which will set out further plans for " an area of freedom , security and justice " is expected to be in place by the second half of 2004 despite continuing differences between states on the issues involved .
conflicting views the delay in formulating a common policy stems from conflicting views throughout the bloc .
there is particular controversy in germany where the social democrat government and conservative opposition have negotiated their own immigration law .
the european commission would require member states to take on more immigrants than the current german bill allows . vitorino said the negotiations needed in reaching a unanimous agreement on proposals made the resolving of the issue " complicated " and had led to less ambitious outcomes .
" there have been moments of joy , but also of sorrow and intense depression , " he admitted . human rights group criticizes eu the record of the european union in the area of immigration over the last five years has drawn criticism from human rights organization amnesty international .
a statement from amnesty said that " from a human rights perspective , the picture is not positive . " " the eu has created an area that has diminished the legitimate rights of refugees , that is less secure than it should be because of the lack of human rights safeguards hampering the fight against crime , and that is free for many , but certainly not for all , " the amnesty assessment read .
un body calls for cohesion on refugees the united nations commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- also called on the eu to regulate a common refugee policy to guarantee that those seeking protection from certain crisis regions would be treated on an equal basis everywhere within the bloc .
jean mouchet , the unhcr representative in brussels , added to the statement by telling reporters that some member states , especially the ten new countries admitted at the start of may , urgently needed help to improve their asylum systems . one particular area in which the european union was accused of compromising the rights of immigrants was the bloc 's security agenda .
amnesty criticized the eu for shifting its focus to combating illegal immigration as part of its anti-terror initiatives at the expense of making policies to facilitate legal immigration . the fight against terror goes on , says vitorino vitorino countered the criticism by pledging that the fight against terrorism would remain among the union 's priorities .
he added that the eu would also continue to cooperate in future to shore up the bloc 's external frontiers in the east to prevent unlawful immigration . but he warned germany , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and austria , who want to form a pilot group to increase the fight against terrorism and unlawful immigration , not to consider separatist police actions outside the european union .
he added that any initiative to increase security must be done so as part of a common policy and with the full involvement of all eu member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough on german immigration law after years of acrimonious talks and two failed attempts to push through a controversial immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder managed to secure a deal with the opposition conservatives .

a german research institute has come up with a novel new air traffic device designed to warn pilots about dangerous air turbulence , which could make for safer soaring all round . for all the abstract beauty of white lines slicing through picture book blue skies , the vapor trails which aircraft leave in their wake as they blast through the air are a warning for anything which moves too close .
planes , particularly after take-off , whip up micro-cosmic storms which are powerful enough to throw any unsuspecting aircraft off course , with potentially devastating consequences . as things stand , the world of commercial aviation is governed by a rule which dictates a minimum distance between aircraft of 11.1 kilometers .
but this gap has now been deemed significant enough to merit a solution . with a reduced distance , more planes could take to the skies , which would mean more money for the industry , and take-off and landing delays could be minimized , thus heightening overall airport efficiency .
at least that is how the argument goes .
and based upon it , the fraunhofer institute for applied optics and precision engineering -lrb- iof -rrb- in the german city of jena , has come up with a pocket-sized problem-solver . " if it were possible to measure the position and actual extent of the contrail , the actual safe distance could be adjusted to the actual conditions , which would increase take-off and landing frequency at airports , " said thomas peschel of the iof . smart sensor project i-wake - short for instrumentation wake - is a joint effort between thomas peschel and eight teams from four different countries .
together , the scientists have developed a smart sensor which can tell when the air is calm enough for a safe take-off regardless of the current 11.1 mile restriction .
ultimately the idea is to make the optical scanner a standard fixture , ensuring a fast and accurate way of assessing dangerous levels of turbulence prior to take-off .
a prototype is currently being tested on board a cessna . for all the apparent complexity of the innovation , peschel stresses the simplicity of the technology behind it .
" a laser sends pulses into the air space just ahead of the plane , the light is dispersed on aerosols or dust particles and registered by a detector , " peschel explains .
the effect is that the frequency of the laser pulse changes according to whether the particles of dust are moving towards or away from the beam .
by adjusting the wave lengths of the dispersed laser light , it is possible to tell within fractions of a second whether the air is still turbulent following take-off , or whether it is calm enough for the next plane to hit the skies . " the challenge in developing the device was to be able to use the laser beam to scan the area in front of the plane at a relatively high frequency , " peschel recalls .
in order to achieve this , the team of scientists came up with a small , high-precision mirror which moves back and forth seven and a half times a second , taking the measurements , and consequently the first steps towards filling the skies with yet more traffic . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space shuttle glides to success scientists conducted a successful test of a german-made prototype of a future european space shuttle on saturday .

deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments that a dip into history books would have been advisable before his talk . in a speech to 981 air force academy cadets on wednesday , united states president george w. bush said the soldiers were fighting the same war as those who battled the nazis . he also said the war on terror resembled " the great clashes of the last century " between democracy and totalitarianism .
the u.s. president vowed that america would continue to strike terror groups around the world . deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments . there it is again - the comparison that george w. bush used even before the iraq war : the battle against saddam hussein and against terrorism is comparable to world war ii .
the enemies of the united states still believe today , as they did then , that the americans are weak and can be defeated .
but today , much like then , the u.s. will prove they are wrong .
the americans will fight resolutely and not rest until the enemies are crushed . it 's a strident tone that fits the run-up to the d-day ceremony and also the presidential election campaign , but not the political reality in which the u.s. president is ordering his military deployments . sept .
11 was n't and is n't comparable to pearl harbor , the terror groups of osama bin laden are n't comparable to nazi germany .
even saddam hussein 's regime can not and should not be likened to hitler 's . al qaeda 's bloody terror is to be totally condemned and rejected .
but these groups do n't conquer new lands , they do n't perpetrate genocide and they do n't wage a conventional war against the united states or any other country .
not even against israel , which they have declared as their arch enemy . al qaeda perpetrates terror much like other groups before it have done in other places and much like others that will do the same after it .
only the criminal efficiency of al qaeda is much greater than ever before . this is certainly a challenge and not just for the u.s. but it 's by no means a " war . "
and military means is not the only way -lrb- or at least not in the long-term -rrb- to defeat terrorism .
afghanistan has more than clearly demonstrated that .
and what about saddam hussein 's regime ? bush 's father was in a better position to remind one of world war ii when he freed kuwait .
bush junior waged a war without iraq having occupied other countries and without any scrap of proof for his alleged evil plans - right from weapons of mass destruction to the threat of new aggression . even the american officials , whom bush reminded of world war ii , know that the evidence does not exist .
it 's difficult to imagine that they believe bush 's words about a holy mission . and what of the questions of democracy and freedom ? naturally " d-day " was the prelude to the liberation of europe from nazi-german occupation .
but it 's not comparable to the middle east : the only occupier there is called israel and is - at least on its own state territory - the only democracy in the region . the other countries are repressed by their own leaders , who do n't consider giving their people more freedom .
in any case not because saddam hussein was toppled .
what has taken place since saddam 's unseating should be guarantee enough for the arab regimes that washington will not want to wage any further wars in the region . after all , even a year after the war and the appointment of an interim government , democracy in iraq is still a distant dream .
even in this respect bush is wrong .
or he 's making a mistake if he equates " liberation " with " democratization . "
here , one can only advise , and not just him , a glance in the history books . even today in germany one does n't speak of " day of liberation " , but of " defeat " , " capitulation " and similar things .
and that , despite the fact that we 've long become a democracy .
but even this process takes a while : it took four years for germany to frame its constitution and hold its first post-world war ii free elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.06.2004 goethe institute opens center in north korea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pyongyang 's new german cultural center will open the doors to europe for north koreans with the opening of its reading room in pyongyang , germany ’ s goethe institute has become the first western cultural organization to open shop in north korea .
institute leaders believe they can operate free of censorship . the goethe institute in pyongyang comprises of 150 square meters packed with 8,000 books , newspapers , cds and videos stored in a cultural center in a space located deep in the heart of the city .
in that sense , the cultural center could be just like any other - if it were n't located in the north korean capital .
on june 3 , a delegation led by the president of the goethe institute opened the first western cultural institution in the stalinist state .
the move has been viewed as controversial , since north korea still remains almost completely shut off from the rest of the world .
after years of preparation , north korean officials opened the door for the goethe institute and its cultural undertaking .
uwe schmelter , who heads the goethe institute in neighboring south korea , led the negotiations , which began in early 2001 .
he found the atmosphere of the talks surprisingly good .
" the negotiations were not easy , " says schmelter , " but they were very friendly and harmonious .
at stake were the necessary requirements - at least from the goethe institute ’ s perspective - of opening and running such a reading room . "
this , schmelter adds , includes " the free and open access for all north koreans and the uncensored and accessible viewing of all media . "
a balancing act these stipulations , a hallmark of the goethe institute 's work , were at first hard to accept for the north korean authorities , who aim to prevent information from overseas from reaching the country .
but at the end of the negotiations , a delicate compromise was reached .
under the agreement , 50 percent of the goethe institute 's literature will focus on science and technology , with the other 50 percent devoted to general media that provides a complete and up-to-date view of germany .
although north korean authorities agreed to give the goethe institute complete control over which media to feature , the new reading room in pyongyang is to be run entirely by local north korean staff .
but schmelter is optimistic that the authorities will adhere to their agreement to allow uncensored and free access to everyone .

in that sense , the cultural center could be just like any other - if it were n't located in the north korean capital .
on june 3 , a delegation led by the president of the goethe institute opened the first western cultural institution in the stalinist state .

he found the atmosphere of the talks surprisingly good .
" the negotiations were not easy , " says schmelter , " but they were very friendly and harmonious .
at stake were the necessary requirements - at least from the goethe institute ’ s perspective - of opening and running such a reading room . "
this , schmelter adds , includes " the free and open access for all north koreans and the uncensored and accessible viewing of all media . "
a balancing act these stipulations , a hallmark of the goethe institute 's work , were at first hard to accept for the north korean authorities , who aim to prevent information from overseas from reaching the country .
but at the end of the negotiations , a delicate compromise was reached .
under the agreement , 50 percent of the goethe institute 's literature will focus on science and technology , with the other 50 percent devoted to general media that provides a complete and up-to-date view of germany .

"
a new german movie star is attempting to do what compatriots til schweiger and others failed to do - crack hollywood .
his first film is a huge hit which will keep him in cheese for the rest of his life . the latest german actor to try and break hollywood has got off to an extremely successful start .
the film he makes his debut in , harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban , the third instalment in the series that follows the magical adventures of the boy wizard , has already grossed a hugely impressive € 9.8 million -lrb- $ 12 million , £ 5 million -rrb- on the first day of its release in britain alone .
the global appeal of the characters made famous by the novels by j.k. rowling will almost certainly give the latest german star a box office smash when the figures start to role in from the film 's worldwide release on june 4 . so who is germany 's newest favorite son of the cinema ?
well , his name remains shrouded in mystery but he will be known from now on by that of the character he plays - scabbers the rat .
germany 's latest movie star is a west african rodent who was plucked from the relative obscurity of the berlin zoo to play the somewhat disheveled and perpetually somnolent pet of hogwarts student ron weasley , the best friend of harry potter . rat not fazed by famous co-stars after finding his way into movies through an animal casting agency , " scabbers " was shipped over to england with an understudy to join actors daniel radcliffe , emma watson and rupert grint on the set of the new potter movie .
it is the german rat 's big break after beginning his acting career at the tender age of six weeks .
" scabbers " plays the mangy 12-year-old comedy sidekick alongside the more intense snowy owl " hedwig " and impressive " crookshanks " the cat . but it seems that appearing with such esteemed colleagues , as well as cgi-created phantoms and fantastic beasts like buckbeak the hippogriff , has not fazed the nine-year-old rodent .
reports suggest that " scabbers " is very settled in england where he has remained since the end of shooting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de harry potter speaks german harry potter fans in germany couldn ’ t wait for the just-published fifth book by j.k. rowling to appear on the german market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.06.2004 opinion : drowning in the eu 's tower of babel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with so many languages , some fear the eu is building its own tower of babel the eu is flailing around in a flood of papers which have to be translated .
steps have been taken to dam the flow , but the next wave is already gathering strength . a huge crest of paperwork is rolling towards the european commission , threatening to swamp the 25,000 civil servants working in brussels .
last year , the arduous bureaucrats churned out more paper than ever before : 1.5 million pages had to be translated into what were then the 11 official eu languages .
now the translators are sinking in the vast ocean of work backing up behind them .
at last count , they were 60,000 pages behind , and if the momentum continues at the same pace , that could soon increase to 300,000 . keep it short ! the eu wants to drastically reduce the flow of work to be translated , and has issued an edict instructing beavering bureaucrats to reduce the length of " memorandums " - the official title for commission texts - from the current average of 50 pages to a mere 15 . " keep it short ! " is the new motto among the brussels insiders , a throwback to the days of public telephone boxes long before mobile phone become a mainstream play thing .
each year the pile of papers grows by about five percent .
and eu commissioner neil kinnock admits that if things continue as they are , it will be the death of the translation department . already , the translation department is the biggest single eu installation .
more than 2,400 translators transfer their colleagues ' warblings into the now 20 official languages , from finnish to maltese to slovenian .
although the number of translators working there was upped with expansion at the start of may , the eu personnel department did n't manage to get enough qualified staff onboard in advance of expansion .
despite seven years of planning , there were apparently not enough qualified translators available , or at least that is the line commissioner kinnock is sticking to . language acrobats rather than take on hundreds and hundreds of extra translators , the plan is to increase the productivity of the translation service by 40 percent by the end of 2006 .
internal working papers are now only translated into english , french or german , but everything that leaves the building to go to citizens , companies or courts has to be translated - and precisely . some of the new member states have already started grumbling that their language is not taken seriously enough by the commission .
and in some places , the internet presence of the nine new languages could serve to back their complaints .
the language acrobats back at base , however , claim this is only a transitional phase . but in 2007 , bulgarian , rumanian and maybe even croatia will join the swelling linguistic ranks of the union .
with a couple of years warning , there is ample time for the commission to go in search of translators who can work , let 's say from estonian into turkish .
if turkey were to join the eu at some point over the next ten or 15 years , it 's high population would mean it brought with it one of the most widely spoken languages .
it is not only the commission , but also the other institutions , such as the european council , the parliament and the european court of justice in luxembourg with massive translation departments .
and they , too , are feeling the force of the surging workload . flood on the horizon the next floods are already gathering strength on the horizon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.06.2004 is europe dragging its feet on immigration ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has been slow to meet the challenge of balancing security and the rights of immigrants .
the eu 's justice and home affairs commissioner has called for more to be done to find a common policy on immigration across the bloc . five years after a common european asylum and immigration policy was initiated at a summit in the finnish city of tampere , justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino called on his european union colleagues to work towards a " uniform status " for admitting legal migrants for employment purposes into the union and encourage the immigration of more non-eu nationals . speaking in brussels on wednesday , vitorino told the gathered officials that the approach of different member states in the area of asylum and immigration had delayed the creation of a cohesive common policy and specifically stressed the need for the eu to regulate laws on legal immigration for economic reasons . " it is necessary to make headway in terms of economic immigration policy and the right of every member state to fix the number of immigrants , " vitorino said .
" we need collaboration on a european level and must specifically concentrate on the integration of immigrants . " vitorino added that , since the so-called tampere program was introduced in 1999 , which was intended to form a cooperative base for member states on matters such as asylum , immigration and the fight against terrorism , some progress had been made .
the commissioner quoted the implementation of the european arrest warrant as an example of the fruits of tampere 's labor . the commissioner was speaking on the day when the european commission adopted a communication on the results of the tampere program . a second program which will set out further plans for " an area of freedom , security and justice " is expected to be in place by the second half of 2004 despite continuing differences between states on the issues involved .
conflicting views the delay in formulating a common policy stems from conflicting views throughout the bloc .
there is particular controversy in germany where the social democrat government and conservative opposition have negotiated their own immigration law .
the european commission would require member states to take on more immigrants than the current german bill allows . vitorino said the negotiations needed in reaching a unanimous agreement on proposals made the resolving of the issue " complicated " and had led to less ambitious outcomes .
" there have been moments of joy , but also of sorrow and intense depression , " he admitted . human rights group criticizes eu the record of the european union in the area of immigration over the last five years has drawn criticism from human rights organization amnesty international .
a statement from amnesty said that " from a human rights perspective , the picture is not positive . " " the eu has created an area that has diminished the legitimate rights of refugees , that is less secure than it should be because of the lack of human rights safeguards hampering the fight against crime , and that is free for many , but certainly not for all , " the amnesty assessment read .
un body calls for cohesion on refugees the united nations commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- also called on the eu to regulate a common refugee policy to guarantee that those seeking protection from certain crisis regions would be treated on an equal basis everywhere within the bloc .
jean mouchet , the unhcr representative in brussels , added to the statement by telling reporters that some member states , especially the ten new countries admitted at the start of may , urgently needed help to improve their asylum systems . one particular area in which the european union was accused of compromising the rights of immigrants was the bloc 's security agenda .
amnesty criticized the eu for shifting its focus to combating illegal immigration as part of its anti-terror initiatives at the expense of making policies to facilitate legal immigration . the fight against terror goes on , says vitorino vitorino countered the criticism by pledging that the fight against terrorism would remain among the union 's priorities .
he added that the eu would also continue to cooperate in future to shore up the bloc 's external frontiers in the east to prevent unlawful immigration . but he warned germany , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and austria , who want to form a pilot group to increase the fight against terrorism and unlawful immigration , not to consider separatist police actions outside the european union .
he added that any initiative to increase security must be done so as part of a common policy and with the full involvement of all eu member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough on german immigration law after years of acrimonious talks and two failed attempts to push through a controversial immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder managed to secure a deal with the opposition conservatives .

the eu 's justice and home affairs commissioner has called for more to be done to find a common policy on immigration across the bloc . five years after a common european asylum and immigration policy was initiated at a summit in the finnish city of tampere , justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino called on his european union colleagues to work towards a " uniform status " for admitting legal migrants for employment purposes into the union and encourage the immigration of more non-eu nationals . speaking in brussels on wednesday , vitorino told the gathered officials that the approach of different member states in the area of asylum and immigration had delayed the creation of a cohesive common policy and specifically stressed the need for the eu to regulate laws on legal immigration for economic reasons . " it is necessary to make headway in terms of economic immigration policy and the right of every member state to fix the number of immigrants , " vitorino said .
" we need collaboration on a european level and must specifically concentrate on the integration of immigrants . " vitorino added that , since the so-called tampere program was introduced in 1999 , which was intended to form a cooperative base for member states on matters such as asylum , immigration and the fight against terrorism , some progress had been made .
the commissioner quoted the implementation of the european arrest warrant as an example of the fruits of tampere 's labor . the commissioner was speaking on the day when the european commission adopted a communication on the results of the tampere program . a second program which will set out further plans for " an area of freedom , security and justice " is expected to be in place by the second half of 2004 despite continuing differences between states on the issues involved .
conflicting views the delay in formulating a common policy stems from conflicting views throughout the bloc .
there is particular controversy in germany where the social democrat government and conservative opposition have negotiated their own immigration law .
the european commission would require member states to take on more immigrants than the current german bill allows . vitorino said the negotiations needed in reaching a unanimous agreement on proposals made the resolving of the issue " complicated " and had led to less ambitious outcomes .
" there have been moments of joy , but also of sorrow and intense depression , " he admitted . human rights group criticizes eu the record of the european union in the area of immigration over the last five years has drawn criticism from human rights organization amnesty international .
a statement from amnesty said that " from a human rights perspective , the picture is not positive . " " the eu has created an area that has diminished the legitimate rights of refugees , that is less secure than it should be because of the lack of human rights safeguards hampering the fight against crime , and that is free for many , but certainly not for all , " the amnesty assessment read .
un body calls for cohesion on refugees the united nations commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- also called on the eu to regulate a common refugee policy to guarantee that those seeking protection from certain crisis regions would be treated on an equal basis everywhere within the bloc .
jean mouchet , the unhcr representative in brussels , added to the statement by telling reporters that some member states , especially the ten new countries admitted at the start of may , urgently needed help to improve their asylum systems . one particular area in which the european union was accused of compromising the rights of immigrants was the bloc 's security agenda .
amnesty criticized the eu for shifting its focus to combating illegal immigration as part of its anti-terror initiatives at the expense of making policies to facilitate legal immigration . the fight against terror goes on , says vitorino vitorino countered the criticism by pledging that the fight against terrorism would remain among the union 's priorities .
he added that the eu would also continue to cooperate in future to shore up the bloc 's external frontiers in the east to prevent unlawful immigration . but he warned germany , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and austria , who want to form a pilot group to increase the fight against terrorism and unlawful immigration , not to consider separatist police actions outside the european union .
he added that any initiative to increase security must be done so as part of a common policy and with the full involvement of all eu member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough on german immigration law after years of acrimonious talks and two failed attempts to push through a controversial immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder managed to secure a deal with the opposition conservatives .

as the international conference for the promotion of renewable energies enters its third day in bonn , the german chancellor gerhard schröder is preparing to bang his drum for a cause close to his heart . the chancellor proposed the meeting after the 2002 world summit for sustainable development in the south african city of johannesburg failed to buckle under european pressure to draw up timetables and targets for boosting renewable energy use .
this time around , delegates at the four-day conference in bonn aim to come up with an " international action program , " setting out specific commitments by individual governments and the international community .
environment minister jürgen trittin told the 3,000 conference delegates wednesday that renewable energy sources could be the solution to poverty and climate change across the world .
" we need an accelerated global increase in the use of renewable energies , " he said . " we must get down to business .
we must enable this global increase to become reality , to combat global poverty , to combat global warming .
let 's make it real . "
concrete steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants in the renewables 2004 conference attend a session in germany 's former parliament building in bonn .
on wednesday , 350 parliamentarians from more than 70 countries took a significant step towards pushing renewable energy sources further towards the mainstream when they released a document calling for the establishment of an international renewable energy agency modeled after the international atomic agency in vienna .
german parliamentarian and president of the eurosolar organization for renewables , hermann scheer , believes it is the only logical way forward .
" intergovernemtal agencies exist for the promotion of atomic energy , for the promotion of fossil energy , but not exclusively for renewable energies , " scheer told deutsche welle . " and this bias is one of the reasons why the dissemination of renewable energies does n't come through world-wide and why much misinformation is filling decision-maker 's minds . "
broad agreement remarkably , german politicians across the political spectrum have agreed on the fundamental ideas of the new agency , as have parliamentarians from countries such as pakistan and nigeria .the precise content of the action plan is still unclear , but germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , co-host of the bonn conference , has her sights set ambitiously high .
she wants to see half the world using renewable energy sources by the year 2050 , and not only for geo-political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- spd -rrb- and environment minister jürgen trittin open the conference in bonn .

it might be ambitious , but it would also prevent other conflicts , make us less dependent on centralised powers , and fight climate change .
so all the advantages are in this field , " wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
with latin american countries pledging to increase their share of renewable energy sources by 10 percent before the year 2020 , there is certainly some promise of commitment in the air in bonn .
but ecologists are worried that behind-the-scenes haggling could dangerously water down any real commitment , ruining the best political opportunity in a generation to help wean the world off oil .

this time around , delegates at the four-day conference in bonn aim to come up with an " international action program , " setting out specific commitments by individual governments and the international community .
environment minister jürgen trittin told the 3,000 conference delegates wednesday that renewable energy sources could be the solution to poverty and climate change across the world .
" we need an accelerated global increase in the use of renewable energies , " he said . " we must get down to business .
we must enable this global increase to become reality , to combat global poverty , to combat global warming .
let 's make it real . "
concrete steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants in the renewables 2004 conference attend a session in germany 's former parliament building in bonn .
on wednesday , 350 parliamentarians from more than 70 countries took a significant step towards pushing renewable energy sources further towards the mainstream when they released a document calling for the establishment of an international renewable energy agency modeled after the international atomic agency in vienna .
german parliamentarian and president of the eurosolar organization for renewables , hermann scheer , believes it is the only logical way forward .
" intergovernemtal agencies exist for the promotion of atomic energy , for the promotion of fossil energy , but not exclusively for renewable energies , " scheer told deutsche welle . " and this bias is one of the reasons why the dissemination of renewable energies does n't come through world-wide and why much misinformation is filling decision-maker 's minds . "
broad agreement remarkably , german politicians across the political spectrum have agreed on the fundamental ideas of the new agency , as have parliamentarians from countries such as pakistan and nigeria .the precise content of the action plan is still unclear , but germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , co-host of the bonn conference , has her sights set ambitiously high .
she wants to see half the world using renewable energy sources by the year 2050 , and not only for geo-political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- spd -rrb- and environment minister jürgen trittin open the conference in bonn .
" i think it could be possible to give one billion energy-poor people access to renewable energy .
it might be ambitious , but it would also prevent other conflicts , make us less dependent on centralised powers , and fight climate change .
so all the advantages are in this field , " wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
with latin american countries pledging to increase their share of renewable energy sources by 10 percent before the year 2020 , there is certainly some promise of commitment in the air in bonn .
but ecologists are worried that behind-the-scenes haggling could dangerously water down any real commitment , ruining the best political opportunity in a generation to help wean the world off oil .
there is a danger too , that the united states , japan , france and brazil , which managed to root out any reference to timetables or market percentages at the 2002 summit in johannesburg , might try to do the same once again in bonn . john hay -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy for the future dw-radio presents a special series on alternative power projects in germany and abroad .

today they are a commodity .
but there still are ways to stand out from the crowd : either by refusing to own a phone altogether , or by spending € 3500 euro for a vertu . it has become hard to impress people with a mobile phone lately .
getting a call on a trendy handset alone certainly wo n't do the trick anymore .
the same goes for funky gadgets to pep up the drab phones like cameras , ring tones or messaging services .
soon after these are released , everyone appears to have them , and instead of being part of the handset avantgarde , the mobile phone afficionado is thrown back into the faceless pool of ordinary handset users .
but thanks to nokia , there is a way for the handset lover to distinguish oneself from the masses .
it is called vertu and comes with a hefty price tag .
the self-proclaimed " first luxury communication company " was launched two years ago as a spin-off by nokia , the world 's largest handset-maker .
the ties to the finnish mother company , however , are kept almost as secret as vertu 's sales or revenue figures .
" we are not allowed to give any sales figure " , daniela wübbeke , the company 's spokesperson for germany , told dw-world .
no gimmicks deep pockets are required to own a vertu phone .
the more affordable " ascent " collection geared towards a younger clientele and launched this year comes in at € 3500 .
the more expensive " signature " collection starts at € 5000 euro for the regular handset and goes up to € 24,000 for the platinum version .
no camera , no video and no radio .
what then , besides the price , makes a vertu so special ?
" each phone consists of 400 separate parts that are put together manually , " explains wübbeke . vertu tries to set itself apart by working with materials commonly not associated with handsets .
" the leather we use for the phones stems from the same people that supply luxury carmakers rolls royce and bentley . "
other materials used are liquidmetal , sapphire , ceramic , gold and silver .
" our phones last at least 15 to 20 years because we use only the best material and refined technology , " says wübbeke .
technology is also the reason vertu phones lack features like cameras , wap or gprs .
" our first collection came without a color display , but as soon as the technology was refined enough , we gave all our customers the option of equipping their phones free of charge with a color display . "
beckham 's concierge another virtu freebie for the first year is the concierge button on every phone .
by pushing it customers are put through to a 24-hour hotline that attends to the callers needs .
whether it is a hotel reservation or getting tickets for otherwise sold out events , the concierge service will try to fulfil requests vertu owners like madonna , gwyneth paltrow or david beckham may have .
while some female celebrities are vertu customers , the majority of vertu owners , at least in germany , are male , says christine meister , who runs the luxury jeweller store brahmfeld & gutrof on the ritzy german resort island sylt .
" men , especially those you also enjoy luxury cars , like vertu more than women do , " she points out .
" many of our customers already own a rolls royce .
for them a vertu phone is a similar status symbol , and by having it , they possess something that other people do n't . "

just consider the fate of so called fashion-phone xelibri from siemens .
the claim that " xelibri lives on a totally different planet from the technology driven mobile phone brands that exist today " was validated a week ago , when siemens pulled the plug on the brand after only two collections .
according to media reports , the demand for models like the xelibri 6 that let 's one " talk on the phone and apply makeup simultaneously " was weak .

"
a new german movie star is attempting to do what compatriots til schweiger and others failed to do - crack hollywood .
his first film is a huge hit which will keep him in cheese for the rest of his life . the latest german actor to try and break hollywood has got off to an extremely successful start .
the film he makes his debut in , harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban , the third instalment in the series that follows the magical adventures of the boy wizard , has already grossed a hugely impressive € 9.8 million -lrb- $ 12 million , £ 5 million -rrb- on the first day of its release in britain alone .
the global appeal of the characters made famous by the novels by j.k. rowling will almost certainly give the latest german star a box office smash when the figures start to role in from the film 's worldwide release on june 4 . so who is germany 's newest favorite son of the cinema ?
well , his name remains shrouded in mystery but he will be known from now on by that of the character he plays - scabbers the rat .
germany 's latest movie star is a west african rodent who was plucked from the relative obscurity of the berlin zoo to play the somewhat disheveled and perpetually somnolent pet of hogwarts student ron weasley , the best friend of harry potter . rat not fazed by famous co-stars after finding his way into movies through an animal casting agency , " scabbers " was shipped over to england with an understudy to join actors daniel radcliffe , emma watson and rupert grint on the set of the new potter movie .
it is the german rat 's big break after beginning his acting career at the tender age of six weeks .
" scabbers " plays the mangy 12-year-old comedy sidekick alongside the more intense snowy owl " hedwig " and impressive " crookshanks " the cat . but it seems that appearing with such esteemed colleagues , as well as cgi-created phantoms and fantastic beasts like buckbeak the hippogriff , has not fazed the nine-year-old rodent .
reports suggest that " scabbers " is very settled in england where he has remained since the end of shooting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de harry potter speaks german harry potter fans in germany couldn ’ t wait for the just-published fifth book by j.k. rowling to appear on the german market .

german chancellor gerhard schröder said thursday economic dependency on oil was playing into the hands of terrorists and urged moving to renewable energy .
separately , opec agreed to raise oil production to ease prices . addressing a four-day international conference on renewable energy in bonn , schröder warned that the one-sidedness of the world 's energy sources had made it a target for terror attacks like the ones last week on saudi arabia 's oil facilities . " we must realize that the world 's overwhelming dependence on oil has enormously increased our vulnerability to this form of terrorism , " schröder said .
the attacks " are directly aimed at striking a vital nerve of humankind , " he added . need for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , right with environment minister jürgen trittin , center , and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul at the renewables conference 2004 in bonn .
schröder said the recent attacks in saudi arabia and the continued instability in iraq made it dramatically clear that the availability of a variety of sources of energy was vital to international security . " making renewable energies a mainstream resource is imperative not just for our economies , it is imperative for security in a globalized world , " he said . schröder urged the 3,000 representatives from 154 nations at the conference to diversify into other energy resources and invest in solar , wind and other renewable fuels and added that countries needed to " reorientate the global energy policy . " schröder pointed towards germany 's own achievements in renewable energy : the country is investing some € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- a year to build wind farms , solar panels and tapping geothermal and other alternative sources of energy . some 120,000 people are estimated to be working in germany 's renewables sector .
the country has also reduced its emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases by nearly a fifth . opec decides to hike output referring to the steady rise in oil prices in recent weeks , in particular after the saudi attacks , schröder warned , " higher energy prices damage the chance for economic development .
they threaten the recovery in developed economies and around the world they hamper the fight against poverty and hunger . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuwaiti oil minister ahmed al-sabah speaks to reporters during the opec meeting in beirut , lebanon on thursday .
at the same time the german chancellor welcomed opec 's -lrb- organization of petroleum exporting countries -rrb- decision thursday to raise its production ceiling by two million barrels a day in july in a bid to bring down spiraling prices of crude oil .
the organization also agreed to raise the target by an additional 500,000 barrels a day in august if it sees a need , it said . opec representatives from qatar , nigeria and the united arab emirates confirmed the decision before the group met for a closed-door meeting to ratify the increase .
in his opening address at the meeting , opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia called on members to do " as much as they can to help stabilize the oil market . " nigerian representative edmund maduabebe daukoru said , " to act as responsible members of the world community , we have to make this strong signal to the market that we are ready to produce to cool the system . " more for alternative energy schröder also backed up his speech with concrete promises of money as he assured that germany would take responsibility for global development . the chancellor vowed germany would provide low-interest loans worth € 500 million between 2005 and 2010 to encourage renewable energy and energy efficiency in developing countries .
the money , channeled through the state development credit agency kredit für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , will go to public , private and semi-public enterprises and local banks , he said . the funds come on top of germany 's pledge of a billion euro until 2010 at the world summit for sustainable development in johannesburg in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first solar-powered ferry shuttle serves the german city of gaienhofen and steckborn on the swiss shore of lake constance .
it can carry up to 50 passengers and 25 bicycles .
schröder 's commitment to renewable energy has been welcomed by environmental organizations and green groups . " schröder is listening to the signals , " said jennifer morgan , head of the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- delegation .
she said the chancellor had made it clear that not just ecological , but also security arguments spoke in favor of renewable energy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " environmental protection is thriving in germany " german environment minister trittin , who has clashed with industry and unions in the past , argues in an interview with dw-tv that eco- friendly policies do n't necessarily run contrary to business interests .

a german research institute has come up with a novel new air traffic device designed to warn pilots about dangerous air turbulence , which could make for safer soaring all round . for all the abstract beauty of white lines slicing through picture book blue skies , the vapor trails which aircraft leave in their wake as they blast through the air are a warning for anything which moves too close .
planes , particularly after take-off , whip up micro-cosmic storms which are powerful enough to throw any unsuspecting aircraft off course , with potentially devastating consequences . as things stand , the world of commercial aviation is governed by a rule which dictates a minimum distance between aircraft of 11.1 kilometers .
but this gap has now been deemed significant enough to merit a solution . with a reduced distance , more planes could take to the skies , which would mean more money for the industry , and take-off and landing delays could be minimized , thus heightening overall airport efficiency .

german chancellor gerhard schröder said thursday economic dependency on oil was playing into the hands of terrorists and urged moving to renewable energy .
separately , opec agreed to raise oil production to ease prices . addressing a four-day international conference on renewable energy in bonn , schröder warned that the one-sidedness of the world 's energy sources had made it a target for terror attacks like the ones last week on saudi arabia 's oil facilities . " we must realize that the world 's overwhelming dependence on oil has enormously increased our vulnerability to this form of terrorism , " schröder said .
the attacks " are directly aimed at striking a vital nerve of humankind , " he added . need for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , right with environment minister jürgen trittin , center , and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul at the renewables conference 2004 in bonn .
schröder said the recent attacks in saudi arabia and the continued instability in iraq made it dramatically clear that the availability of a variety of sources of energy was vital to international security . " making renewable energies a mainstream resource is imperative not just for our economies , it is imperative for security in a globalized world , " he said . schröder urged the 3,000 representatives from 154 nations at the conference to diversify into other energy resources and invest in solar , wind and other renewable fuels and added that countries needed to " reorientate the global energy policy . " schröder pointed towards germany 's own achievements in renewable energy : the country is investing some € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- a year to build wind farms , solar panels and tapping geothermal and other alternative sources of energy . some 120,000 people are estimated to be working in germany 's renewables sector .
the country has also reduced its emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases by nearly a fifth . opec decides to hike output referring to the steady rise in oil prices in recent weeks , in particular after the saudi attacks , schröder warned , " higher energy prices damage the chance for economic development .
they threaten the recovery in developed economies and around the world they hamper the fight against poverty and hunger . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuwaiti oil minister ahmed al-sabah speaks to reporters during the opec meeting in beirut , lebanon on thursday .
at the same time the german chancellor welcomed opec 's -lrb- organization of petroleum exporting countries -rrb- decision thursday to raise its production ceiling by two million barrels a day in july in a bid to bring down spiraling prices of crude oil .
the organization also agreed to raise the target by an additional 500,000 barrels a day in august if it sees a need , it said . opec representatives from qatar , nigeria and the united arab emirates confirmed the decision before the group met for a closed-door meeting to ratify the increase .
in his opening address at the meeting , opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia called on members to do " as much as they can to help stabilize the oil market . " nigerian representative edmund maduabebe daukoru said , " to act as responsible members of the world community , we have to make this strong signal to the market that we are ready to produce to cool the system . " more for alternative energy schröder also backed up his speech with concrete promises of money as he assured that germany would take responsibility for global development . the chancellor vowed germany would provide low-interest loans worth € 500 million between 2005 and 2010 to encourage renewable energy and energy efficiency in developing countries .
the money , channeled through the state development credit agency kredit für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , will go to public , private and semi-public enterprises and local banks , he said . the funds come on top of germany 's pledge of a billion euro until 2010 at the world summit for sustainable development in johannesburg in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first solar-powered ferry shuttle serves the german city of gaienhofen and steckborn on the swiss shore of lake constance .

schröder 's commitment to renewable energy has been welcomed by environmental organizations and green groups . " schröder is listening to the signals , " said jennifer morgan , head of the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- delegation .

a german research institute has come up with a novel new air traffic device designed to warn pilots about dangerous air turbulence , which could make for safer soaring all round . for all the abstract beauty of white lines slicing through picture book blue skies , the vapor trails which aircraft leave in their wake as they blast through the air are a warning for anything which moves too close .
planes , particularly after take-off , whip up micro-cosmic storms which are powerful enough to throw any unsuspecting aircraft off course , with potentially devastating consequences . as things stand , the world of commercial aviation is governed by a rule which dictates a minimum distance between aircraft of 11.1 kilometers .
but this gap has now been deemed significant enough to merit a solution . with a reduced distance , more planes could take to the skies , which would mean more money for the industry , and take-off and landing delays could be minimized , thus heightening overall airport efficiency .
at least that is how the argument goes .
and based upon it , the fraunhofer institute for applied optics and precision engineering -lrb- iof -rrb- in the german city of jena , has come up with a pocket-sized problem-solver . " if it were possible to measure the position and actual extent of the contrail , the actual safe distance could be adjusted to the actual conditions , which would increase take-off and landing frequency at airports , " said thomas peschel of the iof . smart sensor project i-wake - short for instrumentation wake - is a joint effort between thomas peschel and eight teams from four different countries .
together , the scientists have developed a smart sensor which can tell when the air is calm enough for a safe take-off regardless of the current 11.1 mile restriction .
ultimately the idea is to make the optical scanner a standard fixture , ensuring a fast and accurate way of assessing dangerous levels of turbulence prior to take-off .
a prototype is currently being tested on board a cessna . for all the apparent complexity of the innovation , peschel stresses the simplicity of the technology behind it .
" a laser sends pulses into the air space just ahead of the plane , the light is dispersed on aerosols or dust particles and registered by a detector , " peschel explains .
the effect is that the frequency of the laser pulse changes according to whether the particles of dust are moving towards or away from the beam .
by adjusting the wave lengths of the dispersed laser light , it is possible to tell within fractions of a second whether the air is still turbulent following take-off , or whether it is calm enough for the next plane to hit the skies . " the challenge in developing the device was to be able to use the laser beam to scan the area in front of the plane at a relatively high frequency , " peschel recalls .
in order to achieve this , the team of scientists came up with a small , high-precision mirror which moves back and forth seven and a half times a second , taking the measurements , and consequently the first steps towards filling the skies with yet more traffic . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space shuttle glides to success scientists conducted a successful test of a german-made prototype of a future european space shuttle on saturday .

german chancellor gerhard schröder said thursday economic dependency on oil was playing into the hands of terrorists and urged moving to renewable energy .
separately , opec agreed to raise oil production to ease prices . addressing a four-day international conference on renewable energy in bonn , schröder warned that the one-sidedness of the world 's energy sources had made it a target for terror attacks like the ones last week on saudi arabia 's oil facilities . " we must realize that the world 's overwhelming dependence on oil has enormously increased our vulnerability to this form of terrorism , " schröder said .

schröder said the recent attacks in saudi arabia and the continued instability in iraq made it dramatically clear that the availability of a variety of sources of energy was vital to international security . " making renewable energies a mainstream resource is imperative not just for our economies , it is imperative for security in a globalized world , " he said . schröder urged the 3,000 representatives from 154 nations at the conference to diversify into other energy resources and invest in solar , wind and other renewable fuels and added that countries needed to " reorientate the global energy policy . " schröder pointed towards germany 's own achievements in renewable energy : the country is investing some € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- a year to build wind farms , solar panels and tapping geothermal and other alternative sources of energy . some 120,000 people are estimated to be working in germany 's renewables sector .
the country has also reduced its emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases by nearly a fifth . opec decides to hike output referring to the steady rise in oil prices in recent weeks , in particular after the saudi attacks , schröder warned , " higher energy prices damage the chance for economic development .

the organization also agreed to raise the target by an additional 500,000 barrels a day in august if it sees a need , it said . opec representatives from qatar , nigeria and the united arab emirates confirmed the decision before the group met for a closed-door meeting to ratify the increase .
in his opening address at the meeting , opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia called on members to do " as much as they can to help stabilize the oil market . " nigerian representative edmund maduabebe daukoru said , " to act as responsible members of the world community , we have to make this strong signal to the market that we are ready to produce to cool the system .

today they are a commodity .
but there still are ways to stand out from the crowd : either by refusing to own a phone altogether , or by spending € 3500 euro for a vertu . it has become hard to impress people with a mobile phone lately .
getting a call on a trendy handset alone certainly wo n't do the trick anymore .
the same goes for funky gadgets to pep up the drab phones like cameras , ring tones or messaging services .
soon after these are released , everyone appears to have them , and instead of being part of the handset avantgarde , the mobile phone afficionado is thrown back into the faceless pool of ordinary handset users .
but thanks to nokia , there is a way for the handset lover to distinguish oneself from the masses .
it is called vertu and comes with a hefty price tag .
the self-proclaimed " first luxury communication company " was launched two years ago as a spin-off by nokia , the world 's largest handset-maker .
the ties to the finnish mother company , however , are kept almost as secret as vertu 's sales or revenue figures .
" we are not allowed to give any sales figure " , daniela wübbeke , the company 's spokesperson for germany , told dw-world .
no gimmicks deep pockets are required to own a vertu phone .
the more affordable " ascent " collection geared towards a younger clientele and launched this year comes in at € 3500 .
the more expensive " signature " collection starts at € 5000 euro for the regular handset and goes up to € 24,000 for the platinum version .
no camera , no video and no radio .
what then , besides the price , makes a vertu so special ?
" each phone consists of 400 separate parts that are put together manually , " explains wübbeke . vertu tries to set itself apart by working with materials commonly not associated with handsets .
" the leather we use for the phones stems from the same people that supply luxury carmakers rolls royce and bentley . "
other materials used are liquidmetal , sapphire , ceramic , gold and silver .
" our phones last at least 15 to 20 years because we use only the best material and refined technology , " says wübbeke .
technology is also the reason vertu phones lack features like cameras , wap or gprs .
" our first collection came without a color display , but as soon as the technology was refined enough , we gave all our customers the option of equipping their phones free of charge with a color display . "
beckham 's concierge another virtu freebie for the first year is the concierge button on every phone .
by pushing it customers are put through to a 24-hour hotline that attends to the callers needs .
whether it is a hotel reservation or getting tickets for otherwise sold out events , the concierge service will try to fulfil requests vertu owners like madonna , gwyneth paltrow or david beckham may have .
while some female celebrities are vertu customers , the majority of vertu owners , at least in germany , are male , says christine meister , who runs the luxury jeweller store brahmfeld & gutrof on the ritzy german resort island sylt .
" men , especially those you also enjoy luxury cars , like vertu more than women do , " she points out .
" many of our customers already own a rolls royce .
for them a vertu phone is a similar status symbol , and by having it , they possess something that other people do n't . "
pricy headset however , success in this market is anything but certain .
just consider the fate of so called fashion-phone xelibri from siemens .
the claim that " xelibri lives on a totally different planet from the technology driven mobile phone brands that exist today " was validated a week ago , when siemens pulled the plug on the brand after only two collections .
according to media reports , the demand for models like the xelibri 6 that let 's one " talk on the phone and apply makeup simultaneously " was weak .
vertu 's future looks bright , insists wübbeke .
" we have so many orders for our new collection that we have to run extra shifts to speed up production .

as the international conference for the promotion of renewable energies enters its third day in bonn , the german chancellor gerhard schröder is preparing to bang his drum for a cause close to his heart . the chancellor proposed the meeting after the 2002 world summit for sustainable development in the south african city of johannesburg failed to buckle under european pressure to draw up timetables and targets for boosting renewable energy use .
this time around , delegates at the four-day conference in bonn aim to come up with an " international action program , " setting out specific commitments by individual governments and the international community .
environment minister jürgen trittin told the 3,000 conference delegates wednesday that renewable energy sources could be the solution to poverty and climate change across the world .
" we need an accelerated global increase in the use of renewable energies , " he said . " we must get down to business .
we must enable this global increase to become reality , to combat global poverty , to combat global warming .
let 's make it real . "
concrete steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants in the renewables 2004 conference attend a session in germany 's former parliament building in bonn .
on wednesday , 350 parliamentarians from more than 70 countries took a significant step towards pushing renewable energy sources further towards the mainstream when they released a document calling for the establishment of an international renewable energy agency modeled after the international atomic agency in vienna .
german parliamentarian and president of the eurosolar organization for renewables , hermann scheer , believes it is the only logical way forward .
" intergovernemtal agencies exist for the promotion of atomic energy , for the promotion of fossil energy , but not exclusively for renewable energies , " scheer told deutsche welle . " and this bias is one of the reasons why the dissemination of renewable energies does n't come through world-wide and why much misinformation is filling decision-maker 's minds . "
broad agreement remarkably , german politicians across the political spectrum have agreed on the fundamental ideas of the new agency , as have parliamentarians from countries such as pakistan and nigeria .the precise content of the action plan is still unclear , but germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , co-host of the bonn conference , has her sights set ambitiously high .
she wants to see half the world using renewable energy sources by the year 2050 , and not only for geo-political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- spd -rrb- and environment minister jürgen trittin open the conference in bonn .
" i think it could be possible to give one billion energy-poor people access to renewable energy .
it might be ambitious , but it would also prevent other conflicts , make us less dependent on centralised powers , and fight climate change .
so all the advantages are in this field , " wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
with latin american countries pledging to increase their share of renewable energy sources by 10 percent before the year 2020 , there is certainly some promise of commitment in the air in bonn .
but ecologists are worried that behind-the-scenes haggling could dangerously water down any real commitment , ruining the best political opportunity in a generation to help wean the world off oil .
there is a danger too , that the united states , japan , france and brazil , which managed to root out any reference to timetables or market percentages at the 2002 summit in johannesburg , might try to do the same once again in bonn . john hay -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy for the future dw-radio presents a special series on alternative power projects in germany and abroad .

she wants to see half the world using renewable energy sources by the year 2050 , and not only for geo-political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- spd -rrb- and environment minister jürgen trittin open the conference in bonn .
" i think it could be possible to give one billion energy-poor people access to renewable energy .
it might be ambitious , but it would also prevent other conflicts , make us less dependent on centralised powers , and fight climate change .
so all the advantages are in this field , " wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
with latin american countries pledging to increase their share of renewable energy sources by 10 percent before the year 2020 , there is certainly some promise of commitment in the air in bonn .
but ecologists are worried that behind-the-scenes haggling could dangerously water down any real commitment , ruining the best political opportunity in a generation to help wean the world off oil .
there is a danger too , that the united states , japan , france and brazil , which managed to root out any reference to timetables or market percentages at the 2002 summit in johannesburg , might try to do the same once again in bonn . john hay -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy for the future dw-radio presents a special series on alternative power projects in germany and abroad .

the eu 's justice and home affairs commissioner has called for more to be done to find a common policy on immigration across the bloc . five years after a common european asylum and immigration policy was initiated at a summit in the finnish city of tampere , justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino called on his european union colleagues to work towards a " uniform status " for admitting legal migrants for employment purposes into the union and encourage the immigration of more non-eu nationals . speaking in brussels on wednesday , vitorino told the gathered officials that the approach of different member states in the area of asylum and immigration had delayed the creation of a cohesive common policy and specifically stressed the need for the eu to regulate laws on legal immigration for economic reasons . " it is necessary to make headway in terms of economic immigration policy and the right of every member state to fix the number of immigrants , " vitorino said .
" we need collaboration on a european level and must specifically concentrate on the integration of immigrants . " vitorino added that , since the so-called tampere program was introduced in 1999 , which was intended to form a cooperative base for member states on matters such as asylum , immigration and the fight against terrorism , some progress had been made .
the commissioner quoted the implementation of the european arrest warrant as an example of the fruits of tampere 's labor . the commissioner was speaking on the day when the european commission adopted a communication on the results of the tampere program . a second program which will set out further plans for " an area of freedom , security and justice " is expected to be in place by the second half of 2004 despite continuing differences between states on the issues involved .
conflicting views the delay in formulating a common policy stems from conflicting views throughout the bloc .
there is particular controversy in germany where the social democrat government and conservative opposition have negotiated their own immigration law .
the european commission would require member states to take on more immigrants than the current german bill allows . vitorino said the negotiations needed in reaching a unanimous agreement on proposals made the resolving of the issue " complicated " and had led to less ambitious outcomes .
" there have been moments of joy , but also of sorrow and intense depression , " he admitted . human rights group criticizes eu the record of the european union in the area of immigration over the last five years has drawn criticism from human rights organization amnesty international .
a statement from amnesty said that " from a human rights perspective , the picture is not positive . " " the eu has created an area that has diminished the legitimate rights of refugees , that is less secure than it should be because of the lack of human rights safeguards hampering the fight against crime , and that is free for many , but certainly not for all , " the amnesty assessment read .
un body calls for cohesion on refugees the united nations commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- also called on the eu to regulate a common refugee policy to guarantee that those seeking protection from certain crisis regions would be treated on an equal basis everywhere within the bloc .
jean mouchet , the unhcr representative in brussels , added to the statement by telling reporters that some member states , especially the ten new countries admitted at the start of may , urgently needed help to improve their asylum systems . one particular area in which the european union was accused of compromising the rights of immigrants was the bloc 's security agenda .
amnesty criticized the eu for shifting its focus to combating illegal immigration as part of its anti-terror initiatives at the expense of making policies to facilitate legal immigration . the fight against terror goes on , says vitorino vitorino countered the criticism by pledging that the fight against terrorism would remain among the union 's priorities .
he added that the eu would also continue to cooperate in future to shore up the bloc 's external frontiers in the east to prevent unlawful immigration . but he warned germany , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and austria , who want to form a pilot group to increase the fight against terrorism and unlawful immigration , not to consider separatist police actions outside the european union .
he added that any initiative to increase security must be done so as part of a common policy and with the full involvement of all eu member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough on german immigration law after years of acrimonious talks and two failed attempts to push through a controversial immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder managed to secure a deal with the opposition conservatives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.06.2004 is europe dragging its feet on immigration ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has been slow to meet the challenge of balancing security and the rights of immigrants .
the eu 's justice and home affairs commissioner has called for more to be done to find a common policy on immigration across the bloc . five years after a common european asylum and immigration policy was initiated at a summit in the finnish city of tampere , justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino called on his european union colleagues to work towards a " uniform status " for admitting legal migrants for employment purposes into the union and encourage the immigration of more non-eu nationals . speaking in brussels on wednesday , vitorino told the gathered officials that the approach of different member states in the area of asylum and immigration had delayed the creation of a cohesive common policy and specifically stressed the need for the eu to regulate laws on legal immigration for economic reasons . " it is necessary to make headway in terms of economic immigration policy and the right of every member state to fix the number of immigrants , " vitorino said .
" we need collaboration on a european level and must specifically concentrate on the integration of immigrants . " vitorino added that , since the so-called tampere program was introduced in 1999 , which was intended to form a cooperative base for member states on matters such as asylum , immigration and the fight against terrorism , some progress had been made .
the commissioner quoted the implementation of the european arrest warrant as an example of the fruits of tampere 's labor . the commissioner was speaking on the day when the european commission adopted a communication on the results of the tampere program . a second program which will set out further plans for " an area of freedom , security and justice " is expected to be in place by the second half of 2004 despite continuing differences between states on the issues involved .
conflicting views the delay in formulating a common policy stems from conflicting views throughout the bloc .
there is particular controversy in germany where the social democrat government and conservative opposition have negotiated their own immigration law .
the european commission would require member states to take on more immigrants than the current german bill allows . vitorino said the negotiations needed in reaching a unanimous agreement on proposals made the resolving of the issue " complicated " and had led to less ambitious outcomes .
" there have been moments of joy , but also of sorrow and intense depression , " he admitted . human rights group criticizes eu the record of the european union in the area of immigration over the last five years has drawn criticism from human rights organization amnesty international .
a statement from amnesty said that " from a human rights perspective , the picture is not positive . " " the eu has created an area that has diminished the legitimate rights of refugees , that is less secure than it should be because of the lack of human rights safeguards hampering the fight against crime , and that is free for many , but certainly not for all , " the amnesty assessment read .

"
a new german movie star is attempting to do what compatriots til schweiger and others failed to do - crack hollywood .
his first film is a huge hit which will keep him in cheese for the rest of his life . the latest german actor to try and break hollywood has got off to an extremely successful start .
the film he makes his debut in , harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban , the third instalment in the series that follows the magical adventures of the boy wizard , has already grossed a hugely impressive € 9.8 million -lrb- $ 12 million , £ 5 million -rrb- on the first day of its release in britain alone .
the global appeal of the characters made famous by the novels by j.k. rowling will almost certainly give the latest german star a box office smash when the figures start to role in from the film 's worldwide release on june 4 . so who is germany 's newest favorite son of the cinema ?
well , his name remains shrouded in mystery but he will be known from now on by that of the character he plays - scabbers the rat .
germany 's latest movie star is a west african rodent who was plucked from the relative obscurity of the berlin zoo to play the somewhat disheveled and perpetually somnolent pet of hogwarts student ron weasley , the best friend of harry potter . rat not fazed by famous co-stars after finding his way into movies through an animal casting agency , " scabbers " was shipped over to england with an understudy to join actors daniel radcliffe , emma watson and rupert grint on the set of the new potter movie .
it is the german rat 's big break after beginning his acting career at the tender age of six weeks .
" scabbers " plays the mangy 12-year-old comedy sidekick alongside the more intense snowy owl " hedwig " and impressive " crookshanks " the cat . but it seems that appearing with such esteemed colleagues , as well as cgi-created phantoms and fantastic beasts like buckbeak the hippogriff , has not fazed the nine-year-old rodent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.06.2004 smoother flying with laser technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the technology could make air travel safer .
a german research institute has come up with a novel new air traffic device designed to warn pilots about dangerous air turbulence , which could make for safer soaring all round . for all the abstract beauty of white lines slicing through picture book blue skies , the vapor trails which aircraft leave in their wake as they blast through the air are a warning for anything which moves too close .
planes , particularly after take-off , whip up micro-cosmic storms which are powerful enough to throw any unsuspecting aircraft off course , with potentially devastating consequences . as things stand , the world of commercial aviation is governed by a rule which dictates a minimum distance between aircraft of 11.1 kilometers .
but this gap has now been deemed significant enough to merit a solution . with a reduced distance , more planes could take to the skies , which would mean more money for the industry , and take-off and landing delays could be minimized , thus heightening overall airport efficiency .
at least that is how the argument goes .
and based upon it , the fraunhofer institute for applied optics and precision engineering -lrb- iof -rrb- in the german city of jena , has come up with a pocket-sized problem-solver . " if it were possible to measure the position and actual extent of the contrail , the actual safe distance could be adjusted to the actual conditions , which would increase take-off and landing frequency at airports , " said thomas peschel of the iof . smart sensor project i-wake - short for instrumentation wake - is a joint effort between thomas peschel and eight teams from four different countries .
together , the scientists have developed a smart sensor which can tell when the air is calm enough for a safe take-off regardless of the current 11.1 mile restriction .
ultimately the idea is to make the optical scanner a standard fixture , ensuring a fast and accurate way of assessing dangerous levels of turbulence prior to take-off .
a prototype is currently being tested on board a cessna . for all the apparent complexity of the innovation , peschel stresses the simplicity of the technology behind it .
" a laser sends pulses into the air space just ahead of the plane , the light is dispersed on aerosols or dust particles and registered by a detector , " peschel explains .
the effect is that the frequency of the laser pulse changes according to whether the particles of dust are moving towards or away from the beam .
by adjusting the wave lengths of the dispersed laser light , it is possible to tell within fractions of a second whether the air is still turbulent following take-off , or whether it is calm enough for the next plane to hit the skies . " the challenge in developing the device was to be able to use the laser beam to scan the area in front of the plane at a relatively high frequency , " peschel recalls .
in order to achieve this , the team of scientists came up with a small , high-precision mirror which moves back and forth seven and a half times a second , taking the measurements , and consequently the first steps towards filling the skies with yet more traffic . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space shuttle glides to success scientists conducted a successful test of a german-made prototype of a future european space shuttle on saturday .

a german research institute has come up with a novel new air traffic device designed to warn pilots about dangerous air turbulence , which could make for safer soaring all round . for all the abstract beauty of white lines slicing through picture book blue skies , the vapor trails which aircraft leave in their wake as they blast through the air are a warning for anything which moves too close .
planes , particularly after take-off , whip up micro-cosmic storms which are powerful enough to throw any unsuspecting aircraft off course , with potentially devastating consequences . as things stand , the world of commercial aviation is governed by a rule which dictates a minimum distance between aircraft of 11.1 kilometers .
but this gap has now been deemed significant enough to merit a solution . with a reduced distance , more planes could take to the skies , which would mean more money for the industry , and take-off and landing delays could be minimized , thus heightening overall airport efficiency .
at least that is how the argument goes .
and based upon it , the fraunhofer institute for applied optics and precision engineering -lrb- iof -rrb- in the german city of jena , has come up with a pocket-sized problem-solver . " if it were possible to measure the position and actual extent of the contrail , the actual safe distance could be adjusted to the actual conditions , which would increase take-off and landing frequency at airports , " said thomas peschel of the iof . smart sensor project i-wake - short for instrumentation wake - is a joint effort between thomas peschel and eight teams from four different countries .
together , the scientists have developed a smart sensor which can tell when the air is calm enough for a safe take-off regardless of the current 11.1 mile restriction .
ultimately the idea is to make the optical scanner a standard fixture , ensuring a fast and accurate way of assessing dangerous levels of turbulence prior to take-off .
a prototype is currently being tested on board a cessna . for all the apparent complexity of the innovation , peschel stresses the simplicity of the technology behind it .
" a laser sends pulses into the air space just ahead of the plane , the light is dispersed on aerosols or dust particles and registered by a detector , " peschel explains .
the effect is that the frequency of the laser pulse changes according to whether the particles of dust are moving towards or away from the beam .
by adjusting the wave lengths of the dispersed laser light , it is possible to tell within fractions of a second whether the air is still turbulent following take-off , or whether it is calm enough for the next plane to hit the skies . " the challenge in developing the device was to be able to use the laser beam to scan the area in front of the plane at a relatively high frequency , " peschel recalls .
in order to achieve this , the team of scientists came up with a small , high-precision mirror which moves back and forth seven and a half times a second , taking the measurements , and consequently the first steps towards filling the skies with yet more traffic . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space shuttle glides to success scientists conducted a successful test of a german-made prototype of a future european space shuttle on saturday .

steps have been taken to dam the flow , but the next wave is already gathering strength . a huge crest of paperwork is rolling towards the european commission , threatening to swamp the 25,000 civil servants working in brussels .
last year , the arduous bureaucrats churned out more paper than ever before : 1.5 million pages had to be translated into what were then the 11 official eu languages .
now the translators are sinking in the vast ocean of work backing up behind them .
at last count , they were 60,000 pages behind , and if the momentum continues at the same pace , that could soon increase to 300,000 . keep it short ! the eu wants to drastically reduce the flow of work to be translated , and has issued an edict instructing beavering bureaucrats to reduce the length of " memorandums " - the official title for commission texts - from the current average of 50 pages to a mere 15 .

more than 2,400 translators transfer their colleagues ' warblings into the now 20 official languages , from finnish to maltese to slovenian .
although the number of translators working there was upped with expansion at the start of may , the eu personnel department did n't manage to get enough qualified staff onboard in advance of expansion .
despite seven years of planning , there were apparently not enough qualified translators available , or at least that is the line commissioner kinnock is sticking to . language acrobats rather than take on hundreds and hundreds of extra translators , the plan is to increase the productivity of the translation service by 40 percent by the end of 2006 .
internal working papers are now only translated into english , french or german , but everything that leaves the building to go to citizens , companies or courts has to be translated - and precisely . some of the new member states have already started grumbling that their language is not taken seriously enough by the commission .
and in some places , the internet presence of the nine new languages could serve to back their complaints .
the language acrobats back at base , however , claim this is only a transitional phase . but in 2007 , bulgarian , rumanian and maybe even croatia will join the swelling linguistic ranks of the union .
with a couple of years warning , there is ample time for the commission to go in search of translators who can work , let 's say from estonian into turkish .
if turkey were to join the eu at some point over the next ten or 15 years , it 's high population would mean it brought with it one of the most widely spoken languages .
it is not only the commission , but also the other institutions , such as the european council , the parliament and the european court of justice in luxembourg with massive translation departments .
and they , too , are feeling the force of the surging workload . flood on the horizon the next floods are already gathering strength on the horizon .
spain is currently applying to have catalan , galician and basque recognized as official eu languages .

steps have been taken to dam the flow , but the next wave is already gathering strength . a huge crest of paperwork is rolling towards the european commission , threatening to swamp the 25,000 civil servants working in brussels .
last year , the arduous bureaucrats churned out more paper than ever before : 1.5 million pages had to be translated into what were then the 11 official eu languages .
now the translators are sinking in the vast ocean of work backing up behind them .
at last count , they were 60,000 pages behind , and if the momentum continues at the same pace , that could soon increase to 300,000 . keep it short ! the eu wants to drastically reduce the flow of work to be translated , and has issued an edict instructing beavering bureaucrats to reduce the length of " memorandums " - the official title for commission texts - from the current average of 50 pages to a mere 15 . " keep it short ! " is the new motto among the brussels insiders , a throwback to the days of public telephone boxes long before mobile phone become a mainstream play thing .
each year the pile of papers grows by about five percent .
and eu commissioner neil kinnock admits that if things continue as they are , it will be the death of the translation department . already , the translation department is the biggest single eu installation .
more than 2,400 translators transfer their colleagues ' warblings into the now 20 official languages , from finnish to maltese to slovenian .
although the number of translators working there was upped with expansion at the start of may , the eu personnel department did n't manage to get enough qualified staff onboard in advance of expansion .
despite seven years of planning , there were apparently not enough qualified translators available , or at least that is the line commissioner kinnock is sticking to . language acrobats rather than take on hundreds and hundreds of extra translators , the plan is to increase the productivity of the translation service by 40 percent by the end of 2006 .
internal working papers are now only translated into english , french or german , but everything that leaves the building to go to citizens , companies or courts has to be translated - and precisely . some of the new member states have already started grumbling that their language is not taken seriously enough by the commission .
and in some places , the internet presence of the nine new languages could serve to back their complaints .
the language acrobats back at base , however , claim this is only a transitional phase . but in 2007 , bulgarian , rumanian and maybe even croatia will join the swelling linguistic ranks of the union .
with a couple of years warning , there is ample time for the commission to go in search of translators who can work , let 's say from estonian into turkish .
if turkey were to join the eu at some point over the next ten or 15 years , it 's high population would mean it brought with it one of the most widely spoken languages .
it is not only the commission , but also the other institutions , such as the european council , the parliament and the european court of justice in luxembourg with massive translation departments .
and they , too , are feeling the force of the surging workload . flood on the horizon the next floods are already gathering strength on the horizon .
spain is currently applying to have catalan , galician and basque recognized as official eu languages .
if accepted , it would n't mean that everything had to be translated into these languages , but catalans , galicians and the basques would have the right to approach eu organs in their mother tongue , just as the irish can already do in their traditional gaelic . bernd riegert -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how do you say accession in maltese ?
the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs . -lrb- 2 may 2004 -rrb- 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

president bush has likened the u.s.-led war on terror to world war ii ahead of d-day celebrations .
deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments that a dip into history books would have been advisable before his talk . in a speech to 981 air force academy cadets on wednesday , united states president george w. bush said the soldiers were fighting the same war as those who battled the nazis . he also said the war on terror resembled " the great clashes of the last century " between democracy and totalitarianism .
the u.s. president vowed that america would continue to strike terror groups around the world . deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments . there it is again - the comparison that george w. bush used even before the iraq war : the battle against saddam hussein and against terrorism is comparable to world war ii .
the enemies of the united states still believe today , as they did then , that the americans are weak and can be defeated .
but today , much like then , the u.s. will prove they are wrong .
the americans will fight resolutely and not rest until the enemies are crushed . it 's a strident tone that fits the run-up to the d-day ceremony and also the presidential election campaign , but not the political reality in which the u.s. president is ordering his military deployments . sept .
11 was n't and is n't comparable to pearl harbor , the terror groups of osama bin laden are n't comparable to nazi germany .
even saddam hussein 's regime can not and should not be likened to hitler 's . al qaeda 's bloody terror is to be totally condemned and rejected .
but these groups do n't conquer new lands , they do n't perpetrate genocide and they do n't wage a conventional war against the united states or any other country .
not even against israel , which they have declared as their arch enemy . al qaeda perpetrates terror much like other groups before it have done in other places and much like others that will do the same after it .
only the criminal efficiency of al qaeda is much greater than ever before . this is certainly a challenge and not just for the u.s. but it 's by no means a " war . "
and military means is not the only way -lrb- or at least not in the long-term -rrb- to defeat terrorism .
afghanistan has more than clearly demonstrated that .
and what about saddam hussein 's regime ? bush 's father was in a better position to remind one of world war ii when he freed kuwait .
bush junior waged a war without iraq having occupied other countries and without any scrap of proof for his alleged evil plans - right from weapons of mass destruction to the threat of new aggression . even the american officials , whom bush reminded of world war ii , know that the evidence does not exist .
it 's difficult to imagine that they believe bush 's words about a holy mission . and what of the questions of democracy and freedom ? naturally " d-day " was the prelude to the liberation of europe from nazi-german occupation .
but it 's not comparable to the middle east : the only occupier there is called israel and is - at least on its own state territory - the only democracy in the region . the other countries are repressed by their own leaders , who do n't consider giving their people more freedom .
in any case not because saddam hussein was toppled .
what has taken place since saddam 's unseating should be guarantee enough for the arab regimes that washington will not want to wage any further wars in the region . after all , even a year after the war and the appointment of an interim government , democracy in iraq is still a distant dream .
even in this respect bush is wrong .
or he 's making a mistake if he equates " liberation " with " democratization . "
here , one can only advise , and not just him , a glance in the history books . even today in germany one does n't speak of " day of liberation " , but of " defeat " , " capitulation " and similar things .
and that , despite the fact that we 've long become a democracy .
but even this process takes a while : it took four years for germany to frame its constitution and hold its first post-world war ii free elections .
then it took a full ten years until sovereignty was achieved . and in iraq the same should happen overnight ?
without any kind of democratic past , without experienced and untarnished politicians ? the u.s. president should know that some things just ca n't be compared . peter philipp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism continues despite new resolution on iraq a revised draft for a un resolution on iraq 's future proposed by the u.s. and britain would set a departure date for foreign troops , but some security council members said more changes are still needed .

president bush has likened the u.s.-led war on terror to world war ii ahead of d-day celebrations .
deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments that a dip into history books would have been advisable before his talk . in a speech to 981 air force academy cadets on wednesday , united states president george w. bush said the soldiers were fighting the same war as those who battled the nazis . he also said the war on terror resembled " the great clashes of the last century " between democracy and totalitarianism .
the u.s. president vowed that america would continue to strike terror groups around the world . deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments . there it is again - the comparison that george w. bush used even before the iraq war : the battle against saddam hussein and against terrorism is comparable to world war ii .
the enemies of the united states still believe today , as they did then , that the americans are weak and can be defeated .
but today , much like then , the u.s. will prove they are wrong .
the americans will fight resolutely and not rest until the enemies are crushed . it 's a strident tone that fits the run-up to the d-day ceremony and also the presidential election campaign , but not the political reality in which the u.s. president is ordering his military deployments . sept .
11 was n't and is n't comparable to pearl harbor , the terror groups of osama bin laden are n't comparable to nazi germany .
even saddam hussein 's regime can not and should not be likened to hitler 's . al qaeda 's bloody terror is to be totally condemned and rejected .
but these groups do n't conquer new lands , they do n't perpetrate genocide and they do n't wage a conventional war against the united states or any other country .
not even against israel , which they have declared as their arch enemy . al qaeda perpetrates terror much like other groups before it have done in other places and much like others that will do the same after it .
only the criminal efficiency of al qaeda is much greater than ever before . this is certainly a challenge and not just for the u.s. but it 's by no means a " war . "

institute leaders believe they can operate free of censorship . the goethe institute in pyongyang comprises of 150 square meters packed with 8,000 books , newspapers , cds and videos stored in a cultural center in a space located deep in the heart of the city .
in that sense , the cultural center could be just like any other - if it were n't located in the north korean capital .
on june 3 , a delegation led by the president of the goethe institute opened the first western cultural institution in the stalinist state .
the move has been viewed as controversial , since north korea still remains almost completely shut off from the rest of the world .
after years of preparation , north korean officials opened the door for the goethe institute and its cultural undertaking .
uwe schmelter , who heads the goethe institute in neighboring south korea , led the negotiations , which began in early 2001 .
he found the atmosphere of the talks surprisingly good .
" the negotiations were not easy , " says schmelter , " but they were very friendly and harmonious .
at stake were the necessary requirements - at least from the goethe institute ’ s perspective - of opening and running such a reading room . "
this , schmelter adds , includes " the free and open access for all north koreans and the uncensored and accessible viewing of all media . "
a balancing act these stipulations , a hallmark of the goethe institute 's work , were at first hard to accept for the north korean authorities , who aim to prevent information from overseas from reaching the country .
but at the end of the negotiations , a delicate compromise was reached .
under the agreement , 50 percent of the goethe institute 's literature will focus on science and technology , with the other 50 percent devoted to general media that provides a complete and up-to-date view of germany .
although north korean authorities agreed to give the goethe institute complete control over which media to feature , the new reading room in pyongyang is to be run entirely by local north korean staff .
but schmelter is optimistic that the authorities will adhere to their agreement to allow uncensored and free access to everyone .
historic parallels schmelter also describes what he views as north koreans ’ affinity towards germans .
" the shared fate of living in a divided country for 40 years makes koreans feel very close to germans , " he says .
" in a way , north koreans even consider germans to be their chosen relatives . "
for some like schmelter , this historical parallel is reason enough to see the opening of the goethe institute in north korea as a source of hope for the future .
in a statement , germany 's foreign ministry said the opening of the institute marked an " important expansion of -lrb- the country 's -rrb- cultural presence " in north korea , a place where very little information is available about germany .
the goethe institute is the main arbiter of german culture and language abroad , with 127 institutes in other countries . marianna yahilevich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goethe institute opens doors in kabul germany ’ s international cultural organization , the goethe institute , is poised to re-open in the afghan capital of kabul after 12 years of closure brought on by the rise of the taliban regime .

institute leaders believe they can operate free of censorship . the goethe institute in pyongyang comprises of 150 square meters packed with 8,000 books , newspapers , cds and videos stored in a cultural center in a space located deep in the heart of the city .
in that sense , the cultural center could be just like any other - if it were n't located in the north korean capital .
on june 3 , a delegation led by the president of the goethe institute opened the first western cultural institution in the stalinist state .
the move has been viewed as controversial , since north korea still remains almost completely shut off from the rest of the world .
after years of preparation , north korean officials opened the door for the goethe institute and its cultural undertaking .
uwe schmelter , who heads the goethe institute in neighboring south korea , led the negotiations , which began in early 2001 .
he found the atmosphere of the talks surprisingly good .
" the negotiations were not easy , " says schmelter , " but they were very friendly and harmonious .
at stake were the necessary requirements - at least from the goethe institute ’ s perspective - of opening and running such a reading room . "
this , schmelter adds , includes " the free and open access for all north koreans and the uncensored and accessible viewing of all media . "
a balancing act these stipulations , a hallmark of the goethe institute 's work , were at first hard to accept for the north korean authorities , who aim to prevent information from overseas from reaching the country .
but at the end of the negotiations , a delicate compromise was reached .
under the agreement , 50 percent of the goethe institute 's literature will focus on science and technology , with the other 50 percent devoted to general media that provides a complete and up-to-date view of germany .
although north korean authorities agreed to give the goethe institute complete control over which media to feature , the new reading room in pyongyang is to be run entirely by local north korean staff .
but schmelter is optimistic that the authorities will adhere to their agreement to allow uncensored and free access to everyone .
historic parallels schmelter also describes what he views as north koreans ’ affinity towards germans .
" the shared fate of living in a divided country for 40 years makes koreans feel very close to germans , " he says .
" in a way , north koreans even consider germans to be their chosen relatives . "
for some like schmelter , this historical parallel is reason enough to see the opening of the goethe institute in north korea as a source of hope for the future .
in a statement , germany 's foreign ministry said the opening of the institute marked an " important expansion of -lrb- the country 's -rrb- cultural presence " in north korea , a place where very little information is available about germany .
the goethe institute is the main arbiter of german culture and language abroad , with 127 institutes in other countries . marianna yahilevich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goethe institute opens doors in kabul germany ’ s international cultural organization , the goethe institute , is poised to re-open in the afghan capital of kabul after 12 years of closure brought on by the rise of the taliban regime .

"
a new german movie star is attempting to do what compatriots til schweiger and others failed to do - crack hollywood .
his first film is a huge hit which will keep him in cheese for the rest of his life . the latest german actor to try and break hollywood has got off to an extremely successful start .
the film he makes his debut in , harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban , the third instalment in the series that follows the magical adventures of the boy wizard , has already grossed a hugely impressive € 9.8 million -lrb- $ 12 million , £ 5 million -rrb- on the first day of its release in britain alone .
the global appeal of the characters made famous by the novels by j.k. rowling will almost certainly give the latest german star a box office smash when the figures start to role in from the film 's worldwide release on june 4 . so who is germany 's newest favorite son of the cinema ?
well , his name remains shrouded in mystery but he will be known from now on by that of the character he plays - scabbers the rat .
germany 's latest movie star is a west african rodent who was plucked from the relative obscurity of the berlin zoo to play the somewhat disheveled and perpetually somnolent pet of hogwarts student ron weasley , the best friend of harry potter . rat not fazed by famous co-stars after finding his way into movies through an animal casting agency , " scabbers " was shipped over to england with an understudy to join actors daniel radcliffe , emma watson and rupert grint on the set of the new potter movie .
it is the german rat 's big break after beginning his acting career at the tender age of six weeks .
" scabbers " plays the mangy 12-year-old comedy sidekick alongside the more intense snowy owl " hedwig " and impressive " crookshanks " the cat . but it seems that appearing with such esteemed colleagues , as well as cgi-created phantoms and fantastic beasts like buckbeak the hippogriff , has not fazed the nine-year-old rodent .

schröder said the recent attacks in saudi arabia and the continued instability in iraq made it dramatically clear that the availability of a variety of sources of energy was vital to international security . " making renewable energies a mainstream resource is imperative not just for our economies , it is imperative for security in a globalized world , " he said . schröder urged the 3,000 representatives from 154 nations at the conference to diversify into other energy resources and invest in solar , wind and other renewable fuels and added that countries needed to " reorientate the global energy policy . " schröder pointed towards germany 's own achievements in renewable energy : the country is investing some € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- a year to build wind farms , solar panels and tapping geothermal and other alternative sources of energy . some 120,000 people are estimated to be working in germany 's renewables sector .

in his opening address at the meeting , opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia called on members to do " as much as they can to help stabilize the oil market . " nigerian representative edmund maduabebe daukoru said , " to act as responsible members of the world community , we have to make this strong signal to the market that we are ready to produce to cool the system .

getting a call on a trendy handset alone certainly wo n't do the trick anymore .
the same goes for funky gadgets to pep up the drab phones like cameras , ring tones or messaging services .
soon after these are released , everyone appears to have them , and instead of being part of the handset avantgarde , the mobile phone afficionado is thrown back into the faceless pool of ordinary handset users .
but thanks to nokia , there is a way for the handset lover to distinguish oneself from the masses .
it is called vertu and comes with a hefty price tag .
the self-proclaimed " first luxury communication company " was launched two years ago as a spin-off by nokia , the world 's largest handset-maker .

what then , besides the price , makes a vertu so special ?
" each phone consists of 400 separate parts that are put together manually , " explains wübbeke . vertu tries to set itself apart by working with materials commonly not associated with handsets .
" the leather we use for the phones stems from the same people that supply luxury carmakers rolls royce and bentley . "
other materials used are liquidmetal , sapphire , ceramic , gold and silver .
" our phones last at least 15 to 20 years because we use only the best material and refined technology , " says wübbeke .
technology is also the reason vertu phones lack features like cameras , wap or gprs .
" our first collection came without a color display , but as soon as the technology was refined enough , we gave all our customers the option of equipping their phones free of charge with a color display . "

while some female celebrities are vertu customers , the majority of vertu owners , at least in germany , are male , says christine meister , who runs the luxury jeweller store brahmfeld & gutrof on the ritzy german resort island sylt .
" men , especially those you also enjoy luxury cars , like vertu more than women do , " she points out .
" many of our customers already own a rolls royce .
for them a vertu phone is a similar status symbol , and by having it , they possess something that other people do n't . "

just consider the fate of so called fashion-phone xelibri from siemens .
the claim that " xelibri lives on a totally different planet from the technology driven mobile phone brands that exist today " was validated a week ago , when siemens pulled the plug on the brand after only two collections .
according to media reports , the demand for models like the xelibri 6 that let 's one " talk on the phone and apply makeup simultaneously " was weak .

german chancellor gerhard schröder said thursday economic dependency on oil was playing into the hands of terrorists and urged moving to renewable energy .
separately , opec agreed to raise oil production to ease prices . addressing a four-day international conference on renewable energy in bonn , schröder warned that the one-sidedness of the world 's energy sources had made it a target for terror attacks like the ones last week on saudi arabia 's oil facilities . " we must realize that the world 's overwhelming dependence on oil has enormously increased our vulnerability to this form of terrorism , " schröder said .
the attacks " are directly aimed at striking a vital nerve of humankind , " he added . need for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , right with environment minister jürgen trittin , center , and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul at the renewables conference 2004 in bonn .
schröder said the recent attacks in saudi arabia and the continued instability in iraq made it dramatically clear that the availability of a variety of sources of energy was vital to international security . " making renewable energies a mainstream resource is imperative not just for our economies , it is imperative for security in a globalized world , " he said . schröder urged the 3,000 representatives from 154 nations at the conference to diversify into other energy resources and invest in solar , wind and other renewable fuels and added that countries needed to " reorientate the global energy policy . " schröder pointed towards germany 's own achievements in renewable energy : the country is investing some € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- a year to build wind farms , solar panels and tapping geothermal and other alternative sources of energy . some 120,000 people are estimated to be working in germany 's renewables sector .
the country has also reduced its emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases by nearly a fifth . opec decides to hike output referring to the steady rise in oil prices in recent weeks , in particular after the saudi attacks , schröder warned , " higher energy prices damage the chance for economic development .
they threaten the recovery in developed economies and around the world they hamper the fight against poverty and hunger . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuwaiti oil minister ahmed al-sabah speaks to reporters during the opec meeting in beirut , lebanon on thursday .
at the same time the german chancellor welcomed opec 's -lrb- organization of petroleum exporting countries -rrb- decision thursday to raise its production ceiling by two million barrels a day in july in a bid to bring down spiraling prices of crude oil .
the organization also agreed to raise the target by an additional 500,000 barrels a day in august if it sees a need , it said . opec representatives from qatar , nigeria and the united arab emirates confirmed the decision before the group met for a closed-door meeting to ratify the increase .
in his opening address at the meeting , opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia called on members to do " as much as they can to help stabilize the oil market . " nigerian representative edmund maduabebe daukoru said , " to act as responsible members of the world community , we have to make this strong signal to the market that we are ready to produce to cool the system . " more for alternative energy schröder also backed up his speech with concrete promises of money as he assured that germany would take responsibility for global development . the chancellor vowed germany would provide low-interest loans worth € 500 million between 2005 and 2010 to encourage renewable energy and energy efficiency in developing countries .
the money , channeled through the state development credit agency kredit für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , will go to public , private and semi-public enterprises and local banks , he said . the funds come on top of germany 's pledge of a billion euro until 2010 at the world summit for sustainable development in johannesburg in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first solar-powered ferry shuttle serves the german city of gaienhofen and steckborn on the swiss shore of lake constance .

schröder 's commitment to renewable energy has been welcomed by environmental organizations and green groups . " schröder is listening to the signals , " said jennifer morgan , head of the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- delegation .

swiss finance minister hans-rudolf merz on thursday said he was in favor of an alliance with lufthansa .
in frankfurt , a lufthansa spokesman told reuters the airline saw no need for further talks with swiss after the latter decided to cast its lot with british airways last year , but added it would be open if swiss knocked on its door again .

today they are a commodity .
but there still are ways to stand out from the crowd : either by refusing to own a phone altogether , or by spending € 3500 euro for a vertu . it has become hard to impress people with a mobile phone lately .
getting a call on a trendy handset alone certainly wo n't do the trick anymore .
the same goes for funky gadgets to pep up the drab phones like cameras , ring tones or messaging services .
soon after these are released , everyone appears to have them , and instead of being part of the handset avantgarde , the mobile phone afficionado is thrown back into the faceless pool of ordinary handset users .
but thanks to nokia , there is a way for the handset lover to distinguish oneself from the masses .
it is called vertu and comes with a hefty price tag .
the self-proclaimed " first luxury communication company " was launched two years ago as a spin-off by nokia , the world 's largest handset-maker .
the ties to the finnish mother company , however , are kept almost as secret as vertu 's sales or revenue figures .
" we are not allowed to give any sales figure " , daniela wübbeke , the company 's spokesperson for germany , told dw-world .
no gimmicks deep pockets are required to own a vertu phone .
the more affordable " ascent " collection geared towards a younger clientele and launched this year comes in at € 3500 .
the more expensive " signature " collection starts at € 5000 euro for the regular handset and goes up to € 24,000 for the platinum version .
no camera , no video and no radio .
what then , besides the price , makes a vertu so special ?
" each phone consists of 400 separate parts that are put together manually , " explains wübbeke . vertu tries to set itself apart by working with materials commonly not associated with handsets .
" the leather we use for the phones stems from the same people that supply luxury carmakers rolls royce and bentley . "
other materials used are liquidmetal , sapphire , ceramic , gold and silver .
" our phones last at least 15 to 20 years because we use only the best material and refined technology , " says wübbeke .
technology is also the reason vertu phones lack features like cameras , wap or gprs .
" our first collection came without a color display , but as soon as the technology was refined enough , we gave all our customers the option of equipping their phones free of charge with a color display . "
beckham 's concierge another virtu freebie for the first year is the concierge button on every phone .
by pushing it customers are put through to a 24-hour hotline that attends to the callers needs .
whether it is a hotel reservation or getting tickets for otherwise sold out events , the concierge service will try to fulfil requests vertu owners like madonna , gwyneth paltrow or david beckham may have .
while some female celebrities are vertu customers , the majority of vertu owners , at least in germany , are male , says christine meister , who runs the luxury jeweller store brahmfeld & gutrof on the ritzy german resort island sylt .
" men , especially those you also enjoy luxury cars , like vertu more than women do , " she points out .
" many of our customers already own a rolls royce .
for them a vertu phone is a similar status symbol , and by having it , they possess something that other people do n't . "
pricy headset however , success in this market is anything but certain .
just consider the fate of so called fashion-phone xelibri from siemens .
the claim that " xelibri lives on a totally different planet from the technology driven mobile phone brands that exist today " was validated a week ago , when siemens pulled the plug on the brand after only two collections .
according to media reports , the demand for models like the xelibri 6 that let 's one " talk on the phone and apply makeup simultaneously " was weak .
vertu 's future looks bright , insists wübbeke .

as the international conference for the promotion of renewable energies enters its third day in bonn , the german chancellor gerhard schröder is preparing to bang his drum for a cause close to his heart . the chancellor proposed the meeting after the 2002 world summit for sustainable development in the south african city of johannesburg failed to buckle under european pressure to draw up timetables and targets for boosting renewable energy use .
this time around , delegates at the four-day conference in bonn aim to come up with an " international action program , " setting out specific commitments by individual governments and the international community .
environment minister jürgen trittin told the 3,000 conference delegates wednesday that renewable energy sources could be the solution to poverty and climate change across the world .
" we need an accelerated global increase in the use of renewable energies , " he said . " we must get down to business .
we must enable this global increase to become reality , to combat global poverty , to combat global warming .
let 's make it real . "
concrete steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants in the renewables 2004 conference attend a session in germany 's former parliament building in bonn .
on wednesday , 350 parliamentarians from more than 70 countries took a significant step towards pushing renewable energy sources further towards the mainstream when they released a document calling for the establishment of an international renewable energy agency modeled after the international atomic agency in vienna .
german parliamentarian and president of the eurosolar organization for renewables , hermann scheer , believes it is the only logical way forward .
" intergovernemtal agencies exist for the promotion of atomic energy , for the promotion of fossil energy , but not exclusively for renewable energies , " scheer told deutsche welle . " and this bias is one of the reasons why the dissemination of renewable energies does n't come through world-wide and why much misinformation is filling decision-maker 's minds . "
broad agreement remarkably , german politicians across the political spectrum have agreed on the fundamental ideas of the new agency , as have parliamentarians from countries such as pakistan and nigeria .the precise content of the action plan is still unclear , but germany 's development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , co-host of the bonn conference , has her sights set ambitiously high .
she wants to see half the world using renewable energy sources by the year 2050 , and not only for geo-political reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- spd -rrb- and environment minister jürgen trittin open the conference in bonn .
" i think it could be possible to give one billion energy-poor people access to renewable energy .
it might be ambitious , but it would also prevent other conflicts , make us less dependent on centralised powers , and fight climate change .
so all the advantages are in this field , " wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
with latin american countries pledging to increase their share of renewable energy sources by 10 percent before the year 2020 , there is certainly some promise of commitment in the air in bonn .
but ecologists are worried that behind-the-scenes haggling could dangerously water down any real commitment , ruining the best political opportunity in a generation to help wean the world off oil .
there is a danger too , that the united states , japan , france and brazil , which managed to root out any reference to timetables or market percentages at the 2002 summit in johannesburg , might try to do the same once again in bonn . john hay -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy for the future dw-radio presents a special series on alternative power projects in germany and abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.06.2004 is europe dragging its feet on immigration ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has been slow to meet the challenge of balancing security and the rights of immigrants .
the eu 's justice and home affairs commissioner has called for more to be done to find a common policy on immigration across the bloc . five years after a common european asylum and immigration policy was initiated at a summit in the finnish city of tampere , justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino called on his european union colleagues to work towards a " uniform status " for admitting legal migrants for employment purposes into the union and encourage the immigration of more non-eu nationals . speaking in brussels on wednesday , vitorino told the gathered officials that the approach of different member states in the area of asylum and immigration had delayed the creation of a cohesive common policy and specifically stressed the need for the eu to regulate laws on legal immigration for economic reasons . " it is necessary to make headway in terms of economic immigration policy and the right of every member state to fix the number of immigrants , " vitorino said .
" we need collaboration on a european level and must specifically concentrate on the integration of immigrants . " vitorino added that , since the so-called tampere program was introduced in 1999 , which was intended to form a cooperative base for member states on matters such as asylum , immigration and the fight against terrorism , some progress had been made .
the commissioner quoted the implementation of the european arrest warrant as an example of the fruits of tampere 's labor . the commissioner was speaking on the day when the european commission adopted a communication on the results of the tampere program . a second program which will set out further plans for " an area of freedom , security and justice " is expected to be in place by the second half of 2004 despite continuing differences between states on the issues involved .
conflicting views the delay in formulating a common policy stems from conflicting views throughout the bloc .
there is particular controversy in germany where the social democrat government and conservative opposition have negotiated their own immigration law .
the european commission would require member states to take on more immigrants than the current german bill allows . vitorino said the negotiations needed in reaching a unanimous agreement on proposals made the resolving of the issue " complicated " and had led to less ambitious outcomes .
" there have been moments of joy , but also of sorrow and intense depression , " he admitted . human rights group criticizes eu the record of the european union in the area of immigration over the last five years has drawn criticism from human rights organization amnesty international .
a statement from amnesty said that " from a human rights perspective , the picture is not positive . " " the eu has created an area that has diminished the legitimate rights of refugees , that is less secure than it should be because of the lack of human rights safeguards hampering the fight against crime , and that is free for many , but certainly not for all , " the amnesty assessment read .
un body calls for cohesion on refugees the united nations commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- also called on the eu to regulate a common refugee policy to guarantee that those seeking protection from certain crisis regions would be treated on an equal basis everywhere within the bloc .
jean mouchet , the unhcr representative in brussels , added to the statement by telling reporters that some member states , especially the ten new countries admitted at the start of may , urgently needed help to improve their asylum systems . one particular area in which the european union was accused of compromising the rights of immigrants was the bloc 's security agenda .
amnesty criticized the eu for shifting its focus to combating illegal immigration as part of its anti-terror initiatives at the expense of making policies to facilitate legal immigration . the fight against terror goes on , says vitorino vitorino countered the criticism by pledging that the fight against terrorism would remain among the union 's priorities .
he added that the eu would also continue to cooperate in future to shore up the bloc 's external frontiers in the east to prevent unlawful immigration . but he warned germany , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and austria , who want to form a pilot group to increase the fight against terrorism and unlawful immigration , not to consider separatist police actions outside the european union .
he added that any initiative to increase security must be done so as part of a common policy and with the full involvement of all eu member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough on german immigration law after years of acrimonious talks and two failed attempts to push through a controversial immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder managed to secure a deal with the opposition conservatives .

the eu 's justice and home affairs commissioner has called for more to be done to find a common policy on immigration across the bloc . five years after a common european asylum and immigration policy was initiated at a summit in the finnish city of tampere , justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino called on his european union colleagues to work towards a " uniform status " for admitting legal migrants for employment purposes into the union and encourage the immigration of more non-eu nationals . speaking in brussels on wednesday , vitorino told the gathered officials that the approach of different member states in the area of asylum and immigration had delayed the creation of a cohesive common policy and specifically stressed the need for the eu to regulate laws on legal immigration for economic reasons . " it is necessary to make headway in terms of economic immigration policy and the right of every member state to fix the number of immigrants , " vitorino said .
" we need collaboration on a european level and must specifically concentrate on the integration of immigrants . " vitorino added that , since the so-called tampere program was introduced in 1999 , which was intended to form a cooperative base for member states on matters such as asylum , immigration and the fight against terrorism , some progress had been made .
the commissioner quoted the implementation of the european arrest warrant as an example of the fruits of tampere 's labor . the commissioner was speaking on the day when the european commission adopted a communication on the results of the tampere program . a second program which will set out further plans for " an area of freedom , security and justice " is expected to be in place by the second half of 2004 despite continuing differences between states on the issues involved .
conflicting views the delay in formulating a common policy stems from conflicting views throughout the bloc .
there is particular controversy in germany where the social democrat government and conservative opposition have negotiated their own immigration law .
the european commission would require member states to take on more immigrants than the current german bill allows . vitorino said the negotiations needed in reaching a unanimous agreement on proposals made the resolving of the issue " complicated " and had led to less ambitious outcomes .
" there have been moments of joy , but also of sorrow and intense depression , " he admitted . human rights group criticizes eu the record of the european union in the area of immigration over the last five years has drawn criticism from human rights organization amnesty international .
a statement from amnesty said that " from a human rights perspective , the picture is not positive . " " the eu has created an area that has diminished the legitimate rights of refugees , that is less secure than it should be because of the lack of human rights safeguards hampering the fight against crime , and that is free for many , but certainly not for all , " the amnesty assessment read .
un body calls for cohesion on refugees the united nations commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- also called on the eu to regulate a common refugee policy to guarantee that those seeking protection from certain crisis regions would be treated on an equal basis everywhere within the bloc .
jean mouchet , the unhcr representative in brussels , added to the statement by telling reporters that some member states , especially the ten new countries admitted at the start of may , urgently needed help to improve their asylum systems . one particular area in which the european union was accused of compromising the rights of immigrants was the bloc 's security agenda .
amnesty criticized the eu for shifting its focus to combating illegal immigration as part of its anti-terror initiatives at the expense of making policies to facilitate legal immigration . the fight against terror goes on , says vitorino vitorino countered the criticism by pledging that the fight against terrorism would remain among the union 's priorities .
he added that the eu would also continue to cooperate in future to shore up the bloc 's external frontiers in the east to prevent unlawful immigration . but he warned germany , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg and austria , who want to form a pilot group to increase the fight against terrorism and unlawful immigration , not to consider separatist police actions outside the european union .
he added that any initiative to increase security must be done so as part of a common policy and with the full involvement of all eu member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough on german immigration law after years of acrimonious talks and two failed attempts to push through a controversial immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder managed to secure a deal with the opposition conservatives .

german chancellor gerhard schröder said thursday economic dependency on oil was playing into the hands of terrorists and urged moving to renewable energy .
separately , opec agreed to raise oil production to ease prices . addressing a four-day international conference on renewable energy in bonn , schröder warned that the one-sidedness of the world 's energy sources had made it a target for terror attacks like the ones last week on saudi arabia 's oil facilities . " we must realize that the world 's overwhelming dependence on oil has enormously increased our vulnerability to this form of terrorism , " schröder said .
the attacks " are directly aimed at striking a vital nerve of humankind , " he added . need for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , right with environment minister jürgen trittin , center , and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul at the renewables conference 2004 in bonn .
schröder said the recent attacks in saudi arabia and the continued instability in iraq made it dramatically clear that the availability of a variety of sources of energy was vital to international security . " making renewable energies a mainstream resource is imperative not just for our economies , it is imperative for security in a globalized world , " he said . schröder urged the 3,000 representatives from 154 nations at the conference to diversify into other energy resources and invest in solar , wind and other renewable fuels and added that countries needed to " reorientate the global energy policy . " schröder pointed towards germany 's own achievements in renewable energy : the country is investing some € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- a year to build wind farms , solar panels and tapping geothermal and other alternative sources of energy . some 120,000 people are estimated to be working in germany 's renewables sector .
the country has also reduced its emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases by nearly a fifth . opec decides to hike output referring to the steady rise in oil prices in recent weeks , in particular after the saudi attacks , schröder warned , " higher energy prices damage the chance for economic development .
they threaten the recovery in developed economies and around the world they hamper the fight against poverty and hunger . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuwaiti oil minister ahmed al-sabah speaks to reporters during the opec meeting in beirut , lebanon on thursday .
at the same time the german chancellor welcomed opec 's -lrb- organization of petroleum exporting countries -rrb- decision thursday to raise its production ceiling by two million barrels a day in july in a bid to bring down spiraling prices of crude oil .
the organization also agreed to raise the target by an additional 500,000 barrels a day in august if it sees a need , it said . opec representatives from qatar , nigeria and the united arab emirates confirmed the decision before the group met for a closed-door meeting to ratify the increase .
in his opening address at the meeting , opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia called on members to do " as much as they can to help stabilize the oil market . " nigerian representative edmund maduabebe daukoru said , " to act as responsible members of the world community , we have to make this strong signal to the market that we are ready to produce to cool the system . " more for alternative energy schröder also backed up his speech with concrete promises of money as he assured that germany would take responsibility for global development . the chancellor vowed germany would provide low-interest loans worth € 500 million between 2005 and 2010 to encourage renewable energy and energy efficiency in developing countries .
the money , channeled through the state development credit agency kredit für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , will go to public , private and semi-public enterprises and local banks , he said . the funds come on top of germany 's pledge of a billion euro until 2010 at the world summit for sustainable development in johannesburg in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first solar-powered ferry shuttle serves the german city of gaienhofen and steckborn on the swiss shore of lake constance .

schröder 's commitment to renewable energy has been welcomed by environmental organizations and green groups . " schröder is listening to the signals , " said jennifer morgan , head of the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- delegation .

schröder said the recent attacks in saudi arabia and the continued instability in iraq made it dramatically clear that the availability of a variety of sources of energy was vital to international security . " making renewable energies a mainstream resource is imperative not just for our economies , it is imperative for security in a globalized world , " he said . schröder urged the 3,000 representatives from 154 nations at the conference to diversify into other energy resources and invest in solar , wind and other renewable fuels and added that countries needed to " reorientate the global energy policy .

"
a new german movie star is attempting to do what compatriots til schweiger and others failed to do - crack hollywood .
his first film is a huge hit which will keep him in cheese for the rest of his life . the latest german actor to try and break hollywood has got off to an extremely successful start .
the film he makes his debut in , harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban , the third instalment in the series that follows the magical adventures of the boy wizard , has already grossed a hugely impressive € 9.8 million -lrb- $ 12 million , £ 5 million -rrb- on the first day of its release in britain alone .
the global appeal of the characters made famous by the novels by j.k. rowling will almost certainly give the latest german star a box office smash when the figures start to role in from the film 's worldwide release on june 4 . so who is germany 's newest favorite son of the cinema ?
well , his name remains shrouded in mystery but he will be known from now on by that of the character he plays - scabbers the rat .
germany 's latest movie star is a west african rodent who was plucked from the relative obscurity of the berlin zoo to play the somewhat disheveled and perpetually somnolent pet of hogwarts student ron weasley , the best friend of harry potter . rat not fazed by famous co-stars after finding his way into movies through an animal casting agency , " scabbers " was shipped over to england with an understudy to join actors daniel radcliffe , emma watson and rupert grint on the set of the new potter movie .
it is the german rat 's big break after beginning his acting career at the tender age of six weeks .
" scabbers " plays the mangy 12-year-old comedy sidekick alongside the more intense snowy owl " hedwig " and impressive " crookshanks " the cat . but it seems that appearing with such esteemed colleagues , as well as cgi-created phantoms and fantastic beasts like buckbeak the hippogriff , has not fazed the nine-year-old rodent .
reports suggest that " scabbers " is very settled in england where he has remained since the end of shooting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de harry potter speaks german harry potter fans in germany couldn ’ t wait for the just-published fifth book by j.k. rowling to appear on the german market .

institute leaders believe they can operate free of censorship . the goethe institute in pyongyang comprises of 150 square meters packed with 8,000 books , newspapers , cds and videos stored in a cultural center in a space located deep in the heart of the city .
in that sense , the cultural center could be just like any other - if it were n't located in the north korean capital .
on june 3 , a delegation led by the president of the goethe institute opened the first western cultural institution in the stalinist state .
the move has been viewed as controversial , since north korea still remains almost completely shut off from the rest of the world .
after years of preparation , north korean officials opened the door for the goethe institute and its cultural undertaking .
uwe schmelter , who heads the goethe institute in neighboring south korea , led the negotiations , which began in early 2001 .
he found the atmosphere of the talks surprisingly good .
" the negotiations were not easy , " says schmelter , " but they were very friendly and harmonious .
at stake were the necessary requirements - at least from the goethe institute ’ s perspective - of opening and running such a reading room . "
this , schmelter adds , includes " the free and open access for all north koreans and the uncensored and accessible viewing of all media . "
a balancing act these stipulations , a hallmark of the goethe institute 's work , were at first hard to accept for the north korean authorities , who aim to prevent information from overseas from reaching the country .
but at the end of the negotiations , a delicate compromise was reached .
under the agreement , 50 percent of the goethe institute 's literature will focus on science and technology , with the other 50 percent devoted to general media that provides a complete and up-to-date view of germany .
although north korean authorities agreed to give the goethe institute complete control over which media to feature , the new reading room in pyongyang is to be run entirely by local north korean staff .
but schmelter is optimistic that the authorities will adhere to their agreement to allow uncensored and free access to everyone .
historic parallels schmelter also describes what he views as north koreans ’ affinity towards germans .
" the shared fate of living in a divided country for 40 years makes koreans feel very close to germans , " he says .
" in a way , north koreans even consider germans to be their chosen relatives . "
for some like schmelter , this historical parallel is reason enough to see the opening of the goethe institute in north korea as a source of hope for the future .
in a statement , germany 's foreign ministry said the opening of the institute marked an " important expansion of -lrb- the country 's -rrb- cultural presence " in north korea , a place where very little information is available about germany .
the goethe institute is the main arbiter of german culture and language abroad , with 127 institutes in other countries . marianna yahilevich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goethe institute opens doors in kabul germany ’ s international cultural organization , the goethe institute , is poised to re-open in the afghan capital of kabul after 12 years of closure brought on by the rise of the taliban regime .

institute leaders believe they can operate free of censorship . the goethe institute in pyongyang comprises of 150 square meters packed with 8,000 books , newspapers , cds and videos stored in a cultural center in a space located deep in the heart of the city .
in that sense , the cultural center could be just like any other - if it were n't located in the north korean capital .
on june 3 , a delegation led by the president of the goethe institute opened the first western cultural institution in the stalinist state .
the move has been viewed as controversial , since north korea still remains almost completely shut off from the rest of the world .
after years of preparation , north korean officials opened the door for the goethe institute and its cultural undertaking .
uwe schmelter , who heads the goethe institute in neighboring south korea , led the negotiations , which began in early 2001 .
he found the atmosphere of the talks surprisingly good .
" the negotiations were not easy , " says schmelter , " but they were very friendly and harmonious .
at stake were the necessary requirements - at least from the goethe institute ’ s perspective - of opening and running such a reading room . "
this , schmelter adds , includes " the free and open access for all north koreans and the uncensored and accessible viewing of all media . "
a balancing act these stipulations , a hallmark of the goethe institute 's work , were at first hard to accept for the north korean authorities , who aim to prevent information from overseas from reaching the country .
but at the end of the negotiations , a delicate compromise was reached .
under the agreement , 50 percent of the goethe institute 's literature will focus on science and technology , with the other 50 percent devoted to general media that provides a complete and up-to-date view of germany .
although north korean authorities agreed to give the goethe institute complete control over which media to feature , the new reading room in pyongyang is to be run entirely by local north korean staff .
but schmelter is optimistic that the authorities will adhere to their agreement to allow uncensored and free access to everyone .
historic parallels schmelter also describes what he views as north koreans ’ affinity towards germans .
" the shared fate of living in a divided country for 40 years makes koreans feel very close to germans , " he says .
" in a way , north koreans even consider germans to be their chosen relatives . "
for some like schmelter , this historical parallel is reason enough to see the opening of the goethe institute in north korea as a source of hope for the future .
in a statement , germany 's foreign ministry said the opening of the institute marked an " important expansion of -lrb- the country 's -rrb- cultural presence " in north korea , a place where very little information is available about germany .
the goethe institute is the main arbiter of german culture and language abroad , with 127 institutes in other countries . marianna yahilevich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goethe institute opens doors in kabul germany ’ s international cultural organization , the goethe institute , is poised to re-open in the afghan capital of kabul after 12 years of closure brought on by the rise of the taliban regime .

but schmelter is optimistic that the authorities will adhere to their agreement to allow uncensored and free access to everyone .
historic parallels schmelter also describes what he views as north koreans ’ affinity towards germans .
" the shared fate of living in a divided country for 40 years makes koreans feel very close to germans , " he says .
" in a way , north koreans even consider germans to be their chosen relatives . "
for some like schmelter , this historical parallel is reason enough to see the opening of the goethe institute in north korea as a source of hope for the future .
in a statement , germany 's foreign ministry said the opening of the institute marked an " important expansion of -lrb- the country 's -rrb- cultural presence " in north korea , a place where very little information is available about germany .
the goethe institute is the main arbiter of german culture and language abroad , with 127 institutes in other countries . marianna yahilevich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goethe institute opens doors in kabul germany ’ s international cultural organization , the goethe institute , is poised to re-open in the afghan capital of kabul after 12 years of closure brought on by the rise of the taliban regime .

president bush has likened the u.s.-led war on terror to world war ii ahead of d-day celebrations .
deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments that a dip into history books would have been advisable before his talk . in a speech to 981 air force academy cadets on wednesday , united states president george w. bush said the soldiers were fighting the same war as those who battled the nazis . he also said the war on terror resembled " the great clashes of the last century " between democracy and totalitarianism .
the u.s. president vowed that america would continue to strike terror groups around the world . deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments . there it is again - the comparison that george w. bush used even before the iraq war : the battle against saddam hussein and against terrorism is comparable to world war ii .
the enemies of the united states still believe today , as they did then , that the americans are weak and can be defeated .
but today , much like then , the u.s. will prove they are wrong .
the americans will fight resolutely and not rest until the enemies are crushed . it 's a strident tone that fits the run-up to the d-day ceremony and also the presidential election campaign , but not the political reality in which the u.s. president is ordering his military deployments . sept .
11 was n't and is n't comparable to pearl harbor , the terror groups of osama bin laden are n't comparable to nazi germany .
even saddam hussein 's regime can not and should not be likened to hitler 's . al qaeda 's bloody terror is to be totally condemned and rejected .
but these groups do n't conquer new lands , they do n't perpetrate genocide and they do n't wage a conventional war against the united states or any other country .
not even against israel , which they have declared as their arch enemy . al qaeda perpetrates terror much like other groups before it have done in other places and much like others that will do the same after it .
only the criminal efficiency of al qaeda is much greater than ever before . this is certainly a challenge and not just for the u.s. but it 's by no means a " war . "
and military means is not the only way -lrb- or at least not in the long-term -rrb- to defeat terrorism .
afghanistan has more than clearly demonstrated that .
and what about saddam hussein 's regime ? bush 's father was in a better position to remind one of world war ii when he freed kuwait .
bush junior waged a war without iraq having occupied other countries and without any scrap of proof for his alleged evil plans - right from weapons of mass destruction to the threat of new aggression . even the american officials , whom bush reminded of world war ii , know that the evidence does not exist .
it 's difficult to imagine that they believe bush 's words about a holy mission . and what of the questions of democracy and freedom ? naturally " d-day " was the prelude to the liberation of europe from nazi-german occupation .
but it 's not comparable to the middle east : the only occupier there is called israel and is - at least on its own state territory - the only democracy in the region . the other countries are repressed by their own leaders , who do n't consider giving their people more freedom .
in any case not because saddam hussein was toppled .
what has taken place since saddam 's unseating should be guarantee enough for the arab regimes that washington will not want to wage any further wars in the region . after all , even a year after the war and the appointment of an interim government , democracy in iraq is still a distant dream .
even in this respect bush is wrong .
or he 's making a mistake if he equates " liberation " with " democratization . "
here , one can only advise , and not just him , a glance in the history books . even today in germany one does n't speak of " day of liberation " , but of " defeat " , " capitulation " and similar things .
and that , despite the fact that we 've long become a democracy .
but even this process takes a while : it took four years for germany to frame its constitution and hold its first post-world war ii free elections .
then it took a full ten years until sovereignty was achieved . and in iraq the same should happen overnight ?
without any kind of democratic past , without experienced and untarnished politicians ? the u.s. president should know that some things just ca n't be compared . peter philipp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism continues despite new resolution on iraq a revised draft for a un resolution on iraq 's future proposed by the u.s. and britain would set a departure date for foreign troops , but some security council members said more changes are still needed .

president bush has likened the u.s.-led war on terror to world war ii ahead of d-day celebrations .
deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments that a dip into history books would have been advisable before his talk . in a speech to 981 air force academy cadets on wednesday , united states president george w. bush said the soldiers were fighting the same war as those who battled the nazis . he also said the war on terror resembled " the great clashes of the last century " between democracy and totalitarianism .
the u.s. president vowed that america would continue to strike terror groups around the world . deutsche welle 's peter philipp comments . there it is again - the comparison that george w. bush used even before the iraq war : the battle against saddam hussein and against terrorism is comparable to world war ii .
the enemies of the united states still believe today , as they did then , that the americans are weak and can be defeated .
but today , much like then , the u.s. will prove they are wrong .
the americans will fight resolutely and not rest until the enemies are crushed . it 's a strident tone that fits the run-up to the d-day ceremony and also the presidential election campaign , but not the political reality in which the u.s. president is ordering his military deployments . sept .
11 was n't and is n't comparable to pearl harbor , the terror groups of osama bin laden are n't comparable to nazi germany .
even saddam hussein 's regime can not and should not be likened to hitler 's . al qaeda 's bloody terror is to be totally condemned and rejected .
but these groups do n't conquer new lands , they do n't perpetrate genocide and they do n't wage a conventional war against the united states or any other country .
not even against israel , which they have declared as their arch enemy . al qaeda perpetrates terror much like other groups before it have done in other places and much like others that will do the same after it .
only the criminal efficiency of al qaeda is much greater than ever before . this is certainly a challenge and not just for the u.s. but it 's by no means a " war . "
and military means is not the only way -lrb- or at least not in the long-term -rrb- to defeat terrorism .
afghanistan has more than clearly demonstrated that .
and what about saddam hussein 's regime ? bush 's father was in a better position to remind one of world war ii when he freed kuwait .
bush junior waged a war without iraq having occupied other countries and without any scrap of proof for his alleged evil plans - right from weapons of mass destruction to the threat of new aggression . even the american officials , whom bush reminded of world war ii , know that the evidence does not exist .
it 's difficult to imagine that they believe bush 's words about a holy mission . and what of the questions of democracy and freedom ? naturally " d-day " was the prelude to the liberation of europe from nazi-german occupation .
but it 's not comparable to the middle east : the only occupier there is called israel and is - at least on its own state territory - the only democracy in the region . the other countries are repressed by their own leaders , who do n't consider giving their people more freedom .
in any case not because saddam hussein was toppled .
what has taken place since saddam 's unseating should be guarantee enough for the arab regimes that washington will not want to wage any further wars in the region . after all , even a year after the war and the appointment of an interim government , democracy in iraq is still a distant dream .
even in this respect bush is wrong .
or he 's making a mistake if he equates " liberation " with " democratization . "
here , one can only advise , and not just him , a glance in the history books . even today in germany one does n't speak of " day of liberation " , but of " defeat " , " capitulation " and similar things .
and that , despite the fact that we 've long become a democracy .
but even this process takes a while : it took four years for germany to frame its constitution and hold its first post-world war ii free elections .
then it took a full ten years until sovereignty was achieved . and in iraq the same should happen overnight ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.06.2004 smoother flying with laser technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the technology could make air travel safer .
a german research institute has come up with a novel new air traffic device designed to warn pilots about dangerous air turbulence , which could make for safer soaring all round . for all the abstract beauty of white lines slicing through picture book blue skies , the vapor trails which aircraft leave in their wake as they blast through the air are a warning for anything which moves too close .
planes , particularly after take-off , whip up micro-cosmic storms which are powerful enough to throw any unsuspecting aircraft off course , with potentially devastating consequences . as things stand , the world of commercial aviation is governed by a rule which dictates a minimum distance between aircraft of 11.1 kilometers .
but this gap has now been deemed significant enough to merit a solution . with a reduced distance , more planes could take to the skies , which would mean more money for the industry , and take-off and landing delays could be minimized , thus heightening overall airport efficiency .
at least that is how the argument goes .
and based upon it , the fraunhofer institute for applied optics and precision engineering -lrb- iof -rrb- in the german city of jena , has come up with a pocket-sized problem-solver . " if it were possible to measure the position and actual extent of the contrail , the actual safe distance could be adjusted to the actual conditions , which would increase take-off and landing frequency at airports , " said thomas peschel of the iof . smart sensor project i-wake - short for instrumentation wake - is a joint effort between thomas peschel and eight teams from four different countries .
together , the scientists have developed a smart sensor which can tell when the air is calm enough for a safe take-off regardless of the current 11.1 mile restriction .
ultimately the idea is to make the optical scanner a standard fixture , ensuring a fast and accurate way of assessing dangerous levels of turbulence prior to take-off .
a prototype is currently being tested on board a cessna . for all the apparent complexity of the innovation , peschel stresses the simplicity of the technology behind it .
" a laser sends pulses into the air space just ahead of the plane , the light is dispersed on aerosols or dust particles and registered by a detector , " peschel explains .
the effect is that the frequency of the laser pulse changes according to whether the particles of dust are moving towards or away from the beam .
by adjusting the wave lengths of the dispersed laser light , it is possible to tell within fractions of a second whether the air is still turbulent following take-off , or whether it is calm enough for the next plane to hit the skies . " the challenge in developing the device was to be able to use the laser beam to scan the area in front of the plane at a relatively high frequency , " peschel recalls .
in order to achieve this , the team of scientists came up with a small , high-precision mirror which moves back and forth seven and a half times a second , taking the measurements , and consequently the first steps towards filling the skies with yet more traffic . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space shuttle glides to success scientists conducted a successful test of a german-made prototype of a future european space shuttle on saturday .

a german research institute has come up with a novel new air traffic device designed to warn pilots about dangerous air turbulence , which could make for safer soaring all round . for all the abstract beauty of white lines slicing through picture book blue skies , the vapor trails which aircraft leave in their wake as they blast through the air are a warning for anything which moves too close .
planes , particularly after take-off , whip up micro-cosmic storms which are powerful enough to throw any unsuspecting aircraft off course , with potentially devastating consequences . as things stand , the world of commercial aviation is governed by a rule which dictates a minimum distance between aircraft of 11.1 kilometers .
but this gap has now been deemed significant enough to merit a solution . with a reduced distance , more planes could take to the skies , which would mean more money for the industry , and take-off and landing delays could be minimized , thus heightening overall airport efficiency .
at least that is how the argument goes .
and based upon it , the fraunhofer institute for applied optics and precision engineering -lrb- iof -rrb- in the german city of jena , has come up with a pocket-sized problem-solver . " if it were possible to measure the position and actual extent of the contrail , the actual safe distance could be adjusted to the actual conditions , which would increase take-off and landing frequency at airports , " said thomas peschel of the iof . smart sensor project i-wake - short for instrumentation wake - is a joint effort between thomas peschel and eight teams from four different countries .
together , the scientists have developed a smart sensor which can tell when the air is calm enough for a safe take-off regardless of the current 11.1 mile restriction .
ultimately the idea is to make the optical scanner a standard fixture , ensuring a fast and accurate way of assessing dangerous levels of turbulence prior to take-off .
a prototype is currently being tested on board a cessna . for all the apparent complexity of the innovation , peschel stresses the simplicity of the technology behind it .
" a laser sends pulses into the air space just ahead of the plane , the light is dispersed on aerosols or dust particles and registered by a detector , " peschel explains .
the effect is that the frequency of the laser pulse changes according to whether the particles of dust are moving towards or away from the beam .

german chancellor gerhard schröder said thursday economic dependency on oil was playing into the hands of terrorists and urged moving to renewable energy .
separately , opec agreed to raise oil production to ease prices . addressing a four-day international conference on renewable energy in bonn , schröder warned that the one-sidedness of the world 's energy sources had made it a target for terror attacks like the ones last week on saudi arabia 's oil facilities . " we must realize that the world 's overwhelming dependence on oil has enormously increased our vulnerability to this form of terrorism , " schröder said .
the attacks " are directly aimed at striking a vital nerve of humankind , " he added . need for change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , right with environment minister jürgen trittin , center , and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul at the renewables conference 2004 in bonn .
schröder said the recent attacks in saudi arabia and the continued instability in iraq made it dramatically clear that the availability of a variety of sources of energy was vital to international security . " making renewable energies a mainstream resource is imperative not just for our economies , it is imperative for security in a globalized world , " he said . schröder urged the 3,000 representatives from 154 nations at the conference to diversify into other energy resources and invest in solar , wind and other renewable fuels and added that countries needed to " reorientate the global energy policy . " schröder pointed towards germany 's own achievements in renewable energy : the country is investing some € 6 billion -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- a year to build wind farms , solar panels and tapping geothermal and other alternative sources of energy . some 120,000 people are estimated to be working in germany 's renewables sector .
the country has also reduced its emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases by nearly a fifth . opec decides to hike output referring to the steady rise in oil prices in recent weeks , in particular after the saudi attacks , schröder warned , " higher energy prices damage the chance for economic development .
they threaten the recovery in developed economies and around the world they hamper the fight against poverty and hunger .

the organization also agreed to raise the target by an additional 500,000 barrels a day in august if it sees a need , it said . opec representatives from qatar , nigeria and the united arab emirates confirmed the decision before the group met for a closed-door meeting to ratify the increase .
in his opening address at the meeting , opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia called on members to do " as much as they can to help stabilize the oil market . " nigerian representative edmund maduabebe daukoru said , " to act as responsible members of the world community , we have to make this strong signal to the market that we are ready to produce to cool the system . " more for alternative energy schröder also backed up his speech with concrete promises of money as he assured that germany would take responsibility for global development . the chancellor vowed germany would provide low-interest loans worth € 500 million between 2005 and 2010 to encourage renewable energy and energy efficiency in developing countries .
the money , channeled through the state development credit agency kredit für wiederaufbau -lrb- kfw -rrb- , will go to public , private and semi-public enterprises and local banks , he said . the funds come on top of germany 's pledge of a billion euro until 2010 at the world summit for sustainable development in johannesburg in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first solar-powered ferry shuttle serves the german city of gaienhofen and steckborn on the swiss shore of lake constance .

today they are a commodity .
but there still are ways to stand out from the crowd : either by refusing to own a phone altogether , or by spending € 3500 euro for a vertu . it has become hard to impress people with a mobile phone lately .
getting a call on a trendy handset alone certainly wo n't do the trick anymore .
the same goes for funky gadgets to pep up the drab phones like cameras , ring tones or messaging services .
soon after these are released , everyone appears to have them , and instead of being part of the handset avantgarde , the mobile phone afficionado is thrown back into the faceless pool of ordinary handset users .
but thanks to nokia , there is a way for the handset lover to distinguish oneself from the masses .
it is called vertu and comes with a hefty price tag .
the self-proclaimed " first luxury communication company " was launched two years ago as a spin-off by nokia , the world 's largest handset-maker .
the ties to the finnish mother company , however , are kept almost as secret as vertu 's sales or revenue figures .
" we are not allowed to give any sales figure " , daniela wübbeke , the company 's spokesperson for germany , told dw-world .
no gimmicks deep pockets are required to own a vertu phone .
the more affordable " ascent " collection geared towards a younger clientele and launched this year comes in at € 3500 .
the more expensive " signature " collection starts at € 5000 euro for the regular handset and goes up to € 24,000 for the platinum version .
no camera , no video and no radio .
what then , besides the price , makes a vertu so special ?
" each phone consists of 400 separate parts that are put together manually , " explains wübbeke . vertu tries to set itself apart by working with materials commonly not associated with handsets .
" the leather we use for the phones stems from the same people that supply luxury carmakers rolls royce and bentley . "
other materials used are liquidmetal , sapphire , ceramic , gold and silver .
" our phones last at least 15 to 20 years because we use only the best material and refined technology , " says wübbeke .
technology is also the reason vertu phones lack features like cameras , wap or gprs .
" our first collection came without a color display , but as soon as the technology was refined enough , we gave all our customers the option of equipping their phones free of charge with a color display . "
beckham 's concierge another virtu freebie for the first year is the concierge button on every phone .
by pushing it customers are put through to a 24-hour hotline that attends to the callers needs .
whether it is a hotel reservation or getting tickets for otherwise sold out events , the concierge service will try to fulfil requests vertu owners like madonna , gwyneth paltrow or david beckham may have .
while some female celebrities are vertu customers , the majority of vertu owners , at least in germany , are male , says christine meister , who runs the luxury jeweller store brahmfeld & gutrof on the ritzy german resort island sylt .
" men , especially those you also enjoy luxury cars , like vertu more than women do , " she points out .
" many of our customers already own a rolls royce .
for them a vertu phone is a similar status symbol , and by having it , they possess something that other people do n't . "
pricy headset however , success in this market is anything but certain .
just consider the fate of so called fashion-phone xelibri from siemens .
the claim that " xelibri lives on a totally different planet from the technology driven mobile phone brands that exist today " was validated a week ago , when siemens pulled the plug on the brand after only two collections .
according to media reports , the demand for models like the xelibri 6 that let 's one " talk on the phone and apply makeup simultaneously " was weak .
vertu 's future looks bright , insists wübbeke .
" we have so many orders for our new collection that we have to run extra shifts to speed up production .

institute leaders believe they can operate free of censorship . the goethe institute in pyongyang comprises of 150 square meters packed with 8,000 books , newspapers , cds and videos stored in a cultural center in a space located deep in the heart of the city .
in that sense , the cultural center could be just like any other - if it were n't located in the north korean capital .
on june 3 , a delegation led by the president of the goethe institute opened the first western cultural institution in the stalinist state .
the move has been viewed as controversial , since north korea still remains almost completely shut off from the rest of the world .
after years of preparation , north korean officials opened the door for the goethe institute and its cultural undertaking .
uwe schmelter , who heads the goethe institute in neighboring south korea , led the negotiations , which began in early 2001 .
he found the atmosphere of the talks surprisingly good .
" the negotiations were not easy , " says schmelter , " but they were very friendly and harmonious .
at stake were the necessary requirements - at least from the goethe institute ’ s perspective - of opening and running such a reading room . "
this , schmelter adds , includes " the free and open access for all north koreans and the uncensored and accessible viewing of all media . "
a balancing act these stipulations , a hallmark of the goethe institute 's work , were at first hard to accept for the north korean authorities , who aim to prevent information from overseas from reaching the country .
but at the end of the negotiations , a delicate compromise was reached .
under the agreement , 50 percent of the goethe institute 's literature will focus on science and technology , with the other 50 percent devoted to general media that provides a complete and up-to-date view of germany .
although north korean authorities agreed to give the goethe institute complete control over which media to feature , the new reading room in pyongyang is to be run entirely by local north korean staff .
but schmelter is optimistic that the authorities will adhere to their agreement to allow uncensored and free access to everyone .
historic parallels schmelter also describes what he views as north koreans ’ affinity towards germans .
" the shared fate of living in a divided country for 40 years makes koreans feel very close to germans , " he says .
" in a way , north koreans even consider germans to be their chosen relatives . "
for some like schmelter , this historical parallel is reason enough to see the opening of the goethe institute in north korea as a source of hope for the future .
in a statement , germany 's foreign ministry said the opening of the institute marked an " important expansion of -lrb- the country 's -rrb- cultural presence " in north korea , a place where very little information is available about germany .
the goethe institute is the main arbiter of german culture and language abroad , with 127 institutes in other countries . marianna yahilevich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : goethe institute opens doors in kabul germany ’ s international cultural organization , the goethe institute , is poised to re-open in the afghan capital of kabul after 12 years of closure brought on by the rise of the taliban regime .

"
a new german movie star is attempting to do what compatriots til schweiger and others failed to do - crack hollywood .
his first film is a huge hit which will keep him in cheese for the rest of his life . the latest german actor to try and break hollywood has got off to an extremely successful start .
the film he makes his debut in , harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban , the third instalment in the series that follows the magical adventures of the boy wizard , has already grossed a hugely impressive € 9.8 million -lrb- $ 12 million , £ 5 million -rrb- on the first day of its release in britain alone .
the global appeal of the characters made famous by the novels by j.k. rowling will almost certainly give the latest german star a box office smash when the figures start to role in from the film 's worldwide release on june 4 . so who is germany 's newest favorite son of the cinema ?
well , his name remains shrouded in mystery but he will be known from now on by that of the character he plays - scabbers the rat .
germany 's latest movie star is a west african rodent who was plucked from the relative obscurity of the berlin zoo to play the somewhat disheveled and perpetually somnolent pet of hogwarts student ron weasley , the best friend of harry potter . rat not fazed by famous co-stars after finding his way into movies through an animal casting agency , " scabbers " was shipped over to england with an understudy to join actors daniel radcliffe , emma watson and rupert grint on the set of the new potter movie .
it is the german rat 's big break after beginning his acting career at the tender age of six weeks .
" scabbers " plays the mangy 12-year-old comedy sidekick alongside the more intense snowy owl " hedwig " and impressive " crookshanks " the cat . but it seems that appearing with such esteemed colleagues , as well as cgi-created phantoms and fantastic beasts like buckbeak the hippogriff , has not fazed the nine-year-old rodent .
reports suggest that " scabbers " is very settled in england where he has remained since the end of shooting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : harry potter speaks german harry potter fans in germany couldn ’ t wait for the just-published fifth book by j.k. rowling to appear on the german market .

the scottish executive says that the tenements bill , which will be debated on thursday , would make it easier to repair the country 's 800,000 flats .
ministers argue that home owners should have the power to maintain properties without any interference .
at present , repairs can only be carried out if the full consent of neighbours is granted - leaving them open to veto .
management scheme the key changes the bill seeks to introduce include a mandatory management scheme to set out the basic framework for maintenance of every tenement .
this means if title deeds do not specify how the cost of maintenance is to be divided , a tenement management scheme will apportion the costs between the owners .
it also contains relevant rules on a number of other aspects of tenement management , including ensuring emergency access for repair work and compulsory insurance .
the bill will ensure a fairer deal for home owners in enabling them to carry out repairs and maintenance with majority consent mary mulligan deputy minister for communities deputy minister for communities mary mulligan said : " the tenements bill will modernise a system of property law which is outdated and old-fashioned , and replace it with one which is modern , clear and just .

" the bill will ensure a fairer deal for home owners in enabling them to carry out repairs and maintenance with majority consent .
" everyone will then be liable for repair bills , ending frustration and delay and ensuring common areas are in a good condition .
the bill has been applauded by local authorities group cosla , which said the legislation is " based on common sense " .
housing spokesman councillor douglas reid said : " we particularly support the legal framework for the management of tenements , which encourages owners to have an effective role in property maintenance .
" we hope the bill introduces a clear and effective system , leading to well-maintained homes and easier agreement between owners in tenements . "

postwatch has been angered by revelations that the post office has planned the closure of nine post offices in swansea and seven in gower .
the proposed closures are part of the " urban reinvention " programme , under which many urban post offices will be closed and others modernised .
several branch offices across the country have already been closed under the programme - but one in kenfig hill , near bridgend , has been saved following local lobbying .
proposed closures in gower bwlchymynydd , loughor garden village kingsbridge , gorseinon llangyfelach newton norton upper loughor speaking to radio wales on thursday , dave barrett , head of the urban post office network for wales , said the decision to close so many branches was regrettable .
" it is part of our continuing programme of network reinvention , " he said .
" we have too many post offices chasing too little business , and we can not operate the same size branch network any more . "
mr barrett said the closure of the 16 branches would enable the survival of the remaining 73 in the swansea area .
but , he said he welcomed the views of members of the public during the consultation process , which lasts until 22 july .
under a restructuring scheme , the post office aims to close a third of its uk-wide network of more than 9,000 urban branches , while modernising many of the remaining ones .
the urban reinvention programme begun in november 2000 and has seen protests across wales and the uk in areas which face post office branch closures .
eifion pritchard , chairman of postwatch wales , said the organisation would try to ensure all customers still had access to a nearby post office if some were closed .
he added : " there is no doubt that customers are affected when a post office closes .
proposed closures in swansea crwys terrace , penlan cwmbwrla frederick place , llansamlet grenfell park port tennant treboeth carmarthen road mount pleasant parkway post office , sketty park " postwatch 's primary concern is to ensure that when this does happen , customers will still have good access to post office services .
" postwatch is examining the proposed closures of these post offices as well as every other proposed closure across wales .
" where we are not satisfied that customers will still have good access to post office services , we will strongly oppose the proposed closure through the agreed process .
" the consultation process we have negotiated is aimed at identifying whether customers in the swansea area will still have access to post office services if these post offices close . "

the 56-year-old mafia boss is said to have been at the heart of a 15-year killing spree in ho chi minh city - as well harbouring fugitives and being involved in gambling , bribery and prostitution rackets .
his trial for murder in the city 's people 's court has been one of the largest in vietnam 's history .
his execution by firing squad has brought an abrupt end to a violent but colourful life .
born to a poor family in the former saigon in 1947 , nam cam 's first brush with the law came at the age of 15 , when he was arrested for killing a man during a fight .
charges against nam cam murder assault gambling organising gambling organising bribery abetting criminals organising illegal emigration he spent more than two years in jail , and then joined the south vietnamese army in 1966 .
at the end of the vietnam war , he is said to have reverted to a life of crime in ho chi minh city .
he was arrested again in may 1995 for his criminal dealings , but was released early following an intervention by senior officials alleged to be on his payroll .
the father of eight children , nam cam is known throughout the city 's underworld as an inveterate gambler and womaniser .
in his heyday he was considered one of the most powerful figures in vietnam .
he certainly seems to have had friends in high places .
more than 150 people went on trial with him - some of them high-ranking communist party officials and members of the police .
in fact his connections were so close to the local police department that officers from other provinces were sent in to arrest him when the authorities finally decided to swoop in december 2001 .
revenge killing among the more sensational charges he faced was the alleged assassination of a rival gang boss , dung ha .
at one stage the two worked together , with dung ha joining forces with nam cam in the hope he would get her to run his underground gambling dens .
but the pair fell out when dung ha tried to create her own gang , and she once sent a box full of rats to one of his restaurants to annoy him , vietnamese state media reported last year .
in return nam cam is said to have ordered her death .
dung ha 's body was found shot through the head in october 2000 .

the treasury 's barker review of housing supply this year said up to 140,000 new homes a year were needed in britain .
but a report warns the proposals risk raising carbon dioxide emissions , which add to climate change , by a fifth .
a tory mp said it was " strange " the report was published only on an obscure part of a government website .
the report , by consultant groups entec , eftec and hodkinson , said the extra housing could create 40 % of the current level of domestic waste .

the consultants say there would be a " significant and severe " impact on the environment from the take-up of land needed from the barker plans .
chancellor gordon brown welcomed kate barker 's recommendations on housing as he unveiled his budget in march .
he said deputy prime minister john prescott would consult on how the need for more houses is balanced with environmental concerns .
having silenced local opposition , john prescott is planning to bulldoze england 's green fields caroline spelman shadow local government secretary but peter ainsworth , chairman of the commons environmental audit committee , said the report was difficult to find on the website of the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- .
the conservative mp told bbc news online he did not want to prejudge his committee 's inquiry into the housing plans .
" i do think , just as a matter of process , it is extremely strange that when they now say there is an inquiry going on into the environmental impact they do a paper on it and then put it out as if it was not there . "
waste burden mr ainsworth said ms barker 's remit had covered the economic case , not the environmental consequences , of housing supply problems .
the consultants ' report says : the extra housing could produce 20 % more carbon dioxide emissions by 2015-16 an extra 50,000 mega litres of water for homes could be needed , although demand could be reduced by introducing water meters for individual homes the extra waste costs could be up to £ 1.2m but building 39,000 extra homes according to " green " guidelines , one of the other possible scenarios being considered , could save millions of pounds , the consultants try to assess the environmental costs of the barker proposals in monetary terms , taking account of climate change , the impact on rivers and coral reefs , and waste pollution .
they put the possible bill at between £ 5.1bn and £ 8.4bn.

conservative shadow local government secretary caroline spelman said ministers were breaking their promises to protect the green belt by planning to build the equivalent of 26 towns the size of slough .
" having silenced local opposition , john prescott is planning to bulldoze england 's green fields and concrete over the green belt , irrespective of the wishes of local people , " she said .
a defra spokeswoman said there had been " no intended cover-up " of the report and the department was trying to rectify the problem .
she continued : " defra ministers recognise the need for more houses to be built .
our concern is that those houses are built in the most sustainable way possible . "

having silenced local opposition , john prescott is planning to bulldoze england 's green fields caroline spelman shadow local government secretary but peter ainsworth , chairman of the commons environmental audit committee , said the report was difficult to find on the website of the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- .
the conservative mp told bbc news online he did not want to prejudge his committee 's inquiry into the housing plans .
" i do think , just as a matter of process , it is extremely strange that when they now say there is an inquiry going on into the environmental impact they do a paper on it and then put it out as if it was not there . "
waste burden mr ainsworth said ms barker 's remit had covered the economic case , not the environmental consequences , of housing supply problems .
the consultants ' report says : the extra housing could produce 20 % more carbon dioxide emissions by 2015-16 an extra 50,000 mega litres of water for homes could be needed , although demand could be reduced by introducing water meters for individual homes the extra waste costs could be up to £ 1.2m but building 39,000 extra homes according to " green " guidelines , one of the other possible scenarios being considered , could save millions of pounds , the consultants try to assess the environmental costs of the barker proposals in monetary terms , taking account of climate change , the impact on rivers and coral reefs , and waste pollution .
they put the possible bill at between £ 5.1bn and £ 8.4bn.
' broken promises ' the report says there should be further work on the barker recommendations ' impact on the environment and sustainable development .
conservative shadow local government secretary caroline spelman said ministers were breaking their promises to protect the green belt by planning to build the equivalent of 26 towns the size of slough .
" having silenced local opposition , john prescott is planning to bulldoze england 's green fields and concrete over the green belt , irrespective of the wishes of local people , " she said .
a defra spokeswoman said there had been " no intended cover-up " of the report and the department was trying to rectify the problem .
she continued : " defra ministers recognise the need for more houses to be built .
our concern is that those houses are built in the most sustainable way possible . "

flights from newquay , plymouth and exeter are set to be delayed on thursday morning , although passengers are advised to check in as normal .
but the skybus service to the isles of scilly has not been affected .
flights grounded mike coombes , from air south west , said the first flights of the day from plymouth and newquay were able to get away more or less on time , but delays were being experienced .

at newquay airport , ryanair says their flights will be running about an hour later than scheduled throughout the rest of the day .
national air traffic services said flights in the uk were grounded for about an hour on thursday morning so that controllers could prioritise on planes in the air , but safety was unaffected .
it said the failure was due to the breakdown of a computer at west drayton control centre which processes the details of flights in and out of the uk .

when eager hands snatched up the singing detective dvd - not the new film version - eager eyes spotted it was labelled " the dennis potter collection " .
" collection " means more titles , and it is pennies from heaven that fans have been waiting for .
myself , i want to see his blue remembered hills again .
maybe that will come later .
but for now , this is potter 's famous drama in which everybody mimes to 1930s songs .
in a time when the bbc was making earnest dramas straight from the kitchen sink , this was more lip-sync .
a strikingly young bob hoskins stars as arthur , a sheet music seller who falls for a teacher .
with six parts , you know it does n't go smoothly .
most of the dvd transfer does - the title sequence on some episodes looks grainier than others and it always jars when you go from film to studio .
the 1930s music does not lend itself to great stereo effects - but does lend itself to toe-tapping along the way .
make sure you check the " set up " option - two audio commentaries are hidden under that menu .
these two producer commentaries are the only extras , but they are interesting , especially when talking about how they reacted to this strange dennis potter script .
open range was released at uk cinemas in march open range it used to be that if kevin costner 's career was wobbling , he 'd make another film about sport .
but it took another western to put him back on top .
more than a decade after dances with wolves , open range is not as strong as that , not as compelling , but still laudable and engrossing .
the future , in the form of ranchers , fights the past , in the form of what are called free-grazing cattle drives .
a very good costner and an excellent robert duvall are the past and michael gambon is the face of the future .
costner provides a commentary for the film and also deleted scenes , plus he narrates a documentary about the history of the open ranges .
