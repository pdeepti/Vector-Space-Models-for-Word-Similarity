goleo the lion was revealed as the official mascot for the 2006 world cup this weekend .
while fame and fortune beckons for the face of the soccer spectacular , goleo will find out it 's not all furry handshakes and waving . with great power comes great responsibility , something goleo - the newly revealed official mascot of the 2006 world cup - will soon learn .
the tall and imposing , although very approachable looking , lion becomes the latest in a long line of fake animals to become the figurehead of a major sporting event .
goleo will spend the next 18 months preparing for the global soccer showcase in germany , where he will stir the crowded stadiums and inspire millions of spectators around the world .
during that time , goleo 's face will become synonymous with the world cup in germany and the harmonious message of fair play that will no doubt be promoted throughout the entirety of the month-long tournament .
global superstardom and worldwide recognition awaits him .
he looks happy enough , but is he ready ?
such a high profile position comes with its own set of intense pressures .
goleo will not even be able to enjoy a quiet gazelle without a pack of paparazzi snappers being on hand to record his every bite and maul .
so what can the mascot of the 2006 world cup expect ?
if everything goes right , goleo could be the next misha the bear .
the mascot of the olympic games of 1980 went on to become one of the best loved and most marketable figureheads in sporting history , so much so that many people forget the us boycott of the moscow games - in protest of the december 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan - and remember them for the cute little teddy bear who even cried at the closing ceremony .
memorable misha endures misha 's tale should give the german lion some hope .
regardless of how well his countrymen perform at the world cup , goleo could still come out of the tournament smelling of roses .
a successful stint as the face of the 2006 tournament could bode well for a future career away from the sporting spotlight .
goleo may want to look to the example set by english soccer team hartlepool united 's h 'angus the monkey .
the all-singing , all-dancing mascot of the yorkshire club enjoyed a long career aping around for the hartlepool faithful and made such an impression on the town that in may 2002 , he was elected town mayor .
but while the world may be an oyster - or in goleo 's case , a wildebeest - for the successful mascot , there are pitfalls .
as with any celebrity , there are temptations for the sporting mascot , such as unscrupulous types waiting to accelerate their downfall for their own gains by exploiting any furry foot put wrong .
the seedier side of the mascot life is just a flip of the coin away .
when fake animals attack take wolfie , the mascot of another english soccer team , wolverhampton wanderers .
wolfie used to rally the crowds with playful and endearing kick-arounds with the opposing mascots before his team took to the pitch .
that is until the arrival of bristol city 's three little pigs .
in front of a television audience of millions , wolfie lost his cool in the pre-match contest and ended up battling all three pigs in a pitch-side punch-up .
needless to say , he never worked in that town again .
as the only official mascot of the world cup , goleo may not have any rivals to face and so potential fisticuffs should be avoided .
but even if he keeps his cold , wet nose clean , goleo must go into this new phase with his eyes open to the realities .
a mascot 's shelf life is a tangible one .
fame and fortune are assured in the run-up to the event and during it , but only the most endearing mascots linger in the memory when the glory fades .
the " aah " factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take the recent athens summer olympic games .
can anyone name the two asexual triangles that passed as the event 's co-mascots ?
well , they were phevos and athena , the siblings named after greek gods who represented the link between greek history and the modern olympic games .
the cumbersome and non-cuddly icons drew more baffled looks and questions than adoration this summer .
however , they contributed to the $ 81 million -lrb- € 63 million -rrb- or so that athens merchandising generated .
their success was assured mainly due to the usual ploy of covering everything from baby bonnets to thongs in their images .
if you wanted anything olympic , you had to have phevos and athena on it .
but despite this , it is unlikely that they will be the enduring memory of the games .
they did n't have that cute " aah " factor that mascots who want to live on need .
in portugal , the super-human wunderkind kinas , the mascot for the european soccer championships this summer , has also sunk without a trace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kinas , " the euro 2004 european soccer championship mascot .
the boy who was supposed to " embody the enthusiasm , skill , determination and sense of fun that make football the greatest sport on earth " has rarely been seen since and must be cursing his luck that he was chosen to front a tournament which would provide one of the greatest shocks in soccer history .
germany 's goleo may have an advantage .
he is a cuddly , eight-foot -lrb- 2.4 meter -rrb- tall lion with a touch of " sesame street " about him and not some cartoon child or a geometric shape with big feet .

its job is made harder by the lack of cohesion between many european institutions and organizations . human trafficking , computer crime and terrorism are just some of the crimes dealt with by eurojust , the eu authority charged with the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border and organized crime .
in addition to the specific crime areas , there are also the individual cases which flood in from all 25 member states in the european union to be dealt with .
as a body established as recently as 2002 to enhance the effectiveness of collective crime fighting , and one which has more than 1000 live cases on its books , eurojust could well claim to be one of the busiest and overwhelmed departments in the eu .
behind kilometers of razor wire , security checks and armored doors , the headquarters of eurojust in the hague is one of the most secure places in the eu .

" there has been a case where the italians and the germans were pursuing the same criminal at the same time in drug trafficking case , " german eurojust representative hermann von langsdorff told deutsche welle .
" in this instance , the germans were about to make an arrest and the italians came to us and asked if we could persuade the germans to hold off .
they waited for one week only and as a result the whole drug ring was smashed and many arrests made . "
despite such successes , not everything works as smoothly .
von langsdorff , who works with 24 other national representatives in mediating between public prosecutor 's offices all across europe , admitted that sometimes the influx of cases is too much .
" the big problem is that eurojust can only reasonably cope with one institution at a time , " he said .
lack of recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is one of the worst offenders for not offering or accepting help .

european public prosecutors continue to sit on vital information regarding terror suspects and some do not even know that eurojust exists and can help in the passing on of vital information , according to von langsdorff .
in the increasingly important fight against international terrorism , more collaboration is needed .
borders closed to exchange of information europe 's borders are open but not always in the eyes of the public prosecutors .
to obtain the right to make searches with foreign colleagues in a bordering country and even to make phone calls to other member states in relation to investigations require special approval .
even von langsdorff and his colleagues at eurojust have their hands tied to a certain extent .
without permission from the member states involved in a case , no results or information can be exchanged without permission .
von langsdorff believes a central data bank could change all this .
" the perfect scenario would be that a phone number discovered during a search in italy could immediately be put in the system and its origin ascertained , whether this number has been linked to terrorists in germany or france , " he said .

annette schavan , the christian democratic education minister for the state of baden-württemberg and a contender for the state 's premiership , made her radical proposal at the weekend because , she said , " we can no longer accept that prayers in mosques should be said in languages that can not be understood outside the muslim community . "
schavan 's proposal comes in the wake of the torching of mosques , schools and churches in the netherlands following the killing of film director theo van gogh , whose work was strongly critical of muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her suggestion drew a sharp reaction from the leaders of the more than two and a half million turks who live in germany .
" this is nonsense - terror can be spread in any language , " said kenan kolat , the co-president of the turkish community in germany .
cornelie sonntag-wolgast , a representative of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on the national parliamentary committee for domestic affairs also criticized the proposal .
" we can not suspect each and every person ... of violence just because they say their prayers in arabic , " said sonntag-wolgast .
volker beck , a spokesman for the greens , the junior partner in the governing coalition , said schavan 's proposal was " completely exaggerated " while liberal fdp interior minister max stadler criticized schavan , saying her proposal for the state to enforce the german language in mosques was " an offense against basic law . "
werner schiffauer , a cultural professor said , schavan 's plan was " out-of-touch and impractical " , a view supported by jürgen micksch , the chairperson of the intercultural council in germany .
professor schiffauer stated that there was little money available to provide language training for the large numbers of islamic preachers in germany and that , in addition , many foreigners living in germany stayed for only a short time and were dependent on mother-tongue services while they were there .
some support idea however , nadeem elyas , the chairman for the central council of muslims in germany , agreed with the proposal .
elyas explained that a lot of mosques already translate their prayers and sermons and offer simultaneous audio feeds in both arabic and german .

the council , he said , is made up of 19 organizations and about 500 mosque municipalities in germany , not all of which cater for purely arabic speakers .

annette schavan , the christian democratic education minister for the state of baden-württemberg and a contender for the state 's premiership , made her radical proposal at the weekend because , she said , " we can no longer accept that prayers in mosques should be said in languages that can not be understood outside the muslim community . "
schavan 's proposal comes in the wake of the torching of mosques , schools and churches in the netherlands following the killing of film director theo van gogh , whose work was strongly critical of muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her suggestion drew a sharp reaction from the leaders of the more than two and a half million turks who live in germany .
" this is nonsense - terror can be spread in any language , " said kenan kolat , the co-president of the turkish community in germany .
cornelie sonntag-wolgast , a representative of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on the national parliamentary committee for domestic affairs also criticized the proposal .
" we can not suspect each and every person ... of violence just because they say their prayers in arabic , " said sonntag-wolgast .
volker beck , a spokesman for the greens , the junior partner in the governing coalition , said schavan 's proposal was " completely exaggerated " while liberal fdp interior minister max stadler criticized schavan , saying her proposal for the state to enforce the german language in mosques was " an offense against basic law . "
werner schiffauer , a cultural professor said , schavan 's plan was " out-of-touch and impractical " , a view supported by jürgen micksch , the chairperson of the intercultural council in germany .
professor schiffauer stated that there was little money available to provide language training for the large numbers of islamic preachers in germany and that , in addition , many foreigners living in germany stayed for only a short time and were dependent on mother-tongue services while they were there .
some support idea however , nadeem elyas , the chairman for the central council of muslims in germany , agreed with the proposal .
elyas explained that a lot of mosques already translate their prayers and sermons and offer simultaneous audio feeds in both arabic and german .

the most controversial was italian conservative rocco buttiglione , who came up against strong resistance for his views on homosexuality and marriage .
but he is not the only one . on tuesday , the hungarian candidate , sixty-five year old laszlo kovacs has the chance to prove his worth for the customs and taxation portfolio .
he was originally nominated as energy commissioner , but performed disastrously at this first hearing in front of the parliament last month , astounding members of the parliament with his lack of knowledge on even basic matters . " from the academic point of view , i was probably wrong when i tried to define what i think of hydrogen , but i 'm to say i 'm not an academic , and not even an energy expert , " kovacs said after the hearing . should he stay or should he go although kovacs has managed to avoid the fate of buttiglione , janis emmanouilidis , an expert in european affairs at the centre for applied policy research in munich , said he believes hungary should have replaced kovacs . " there was a strong pressure to have him withdrawn , but the government in hungary strongly supported his nomination and did n't withdraw him , " he told dw-radio .
" i believe that because many parliamentarians , not only from the christian democrats but also from the socialist group , criticized him concerning his knowledge of the matter , it might have been a wise decision to have him withdrawn . " kovacs , who is the former hungarian minister for foreign affairs , is expected to face difficult questions on economics and currency , as well as domestic market and consumer protection matters .
the hearing is likely to be gruelling as parliamentarians feel that eu member states are n't take the nomination process seriously . " the european parliament is looking at its rights and exploiting its rights , " emmanouilidis said .
" it is looking for new areas to show the two other institutions in the eu that the parliament has a strong say . " the voice of experience however , he also said he believes that kovacs will bring some political know-how to the commission . " he 's one of a few politicians in the new member states with significant experience , " he said .
" he has a lot to offer from a political point of view , but concerning his technical knowledge in certain policy areas , he might be less strong . " the parliament ca n't refuse individual commissioners , only the entire commission , which means that kovac 's nomination is probably in the bag .

the most controversial was italian conservative rocco buttiglione , who came up against strong resistance for his views on homosexuality and marriage .
but he is not the only one . on tuesday , the hungarian candidate , sixty-five year old laszlo kovacs has the chance to prove his worth for the customs and taxation portfolio .
he was originally nominated as energy commissioner , but performed disastrously at this first hearing in front of the parliament last month , astounding members of the parliament with his lack of knowledge on even basic matters . " from the academic point of view , i was probably wrong when i tried to define what i think of hydrogen , but i 'm to say i 'm not an academic , and not even an energy expert , " kovacs said after the hearing . should he stay or should he go although kovacs has managed to avoid the fate of buttiglione , janis emmanouilidis , an expert in european affairs at the centre for applied policy research in munich , said he believes hungary should have replaced kovacs . " there was a strong pressure to have him withdrawn , but the government in hungary strongly supported his nomination and did n't withdraw him , " he told dw-radio .
" i believe that because many parliamentarians , not only from the christian democrats but also from the socialist group , criticized him concerning his knowledge of the matter , it might have been a wise decision to have him withdrawn . " kovacs , who is the former hungarian minister for foreign affairs , is expected to face difficult questions on economics and currency , as well as domestic market and consumer protection matters .
the hearing is likely to be gruelling as parliamentarians feel that eu member states are n't take the nomination process seriously . " the european parliament is looking at its rights and exploiting its rights , " emmanouilidis said .
" it is looking for new areas to show the two other institutions in the eu that the parliament has a strong say . " the voice of experience however , he also said he believes that kovacs will bring some political know-how to the commission . " he 's one of a few politicians in the new member states with significant experience , " he said .
" he has a lot to offer from a political point of view , but concerning his technical knowledge in certain policy areas , he might be less strong . " the parliament ca n't refuse individual commissioners , only the entire commission , which means that kovac 's nomination is probably in the bag .
so , barring interview disasters , the new commission president jose manuel barroso should be able to formally present his new team for approval on thursday . kate hairsine -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso 's commission faces new confidence vote incoming eu executive head jose manuel barroso said friday he hopes for " clear " approval when eu lawmakers finally vote on his new team later this month , to end an unprecedented state of limbo in brussels .

they 'll assess their successes and set out an ambitious plan for the region , a rich and diverse area encompassing 190,287 square kilometres with a population of more than 13 million .
but with the alpine convention remaining a non-binding framework with , until now , no permanent secretariat , it remains to be seen if it has the political muscle to get the job done .
regional thinking a good start with the growth of the environmental movement in the 1960 's and 1970 's an increased awareness of the threats facing the alps developed , and preservationists lobbied hard for a collective approach .
after years of wrangling , the alpine convention went into force in march of 1995 .
a framework agreement between seven european countries , it set out to limit environmental degradation by harmonizing economic and environmental policies in the region .
thus , with 13 protocols , including ones related to air and water pollution , the convention 's greatest initial achievement was that it promoted a regional way of thinking where highly territorial national policies once prevailed .

" the alpine convention increased the realization that the alps need to be treated as a region and the participants need to develop a regional way of thinking , " martin price , director of the center for mountain studies at perth college in great britain and the former chairman of the european mountain forum told dw-world .
andreas götz , the director of the international commission for the protection of the alps -lrb- cipra -rrb- agreed .
" the main thing is that a regional consciousness developed , " he told dw-world .

a network of protected areas was created , as well as an international scientific commission for alpine research , based in bern , to study environmental threats and possible solutions .
what 's more , related initiatives , such as the alliance in the alps , founded by cipra , encouraged individual regions to share information and best practices .

" the easier issues have been solved first and the more difficult ones left until later , " price said .
meeting to jumpstart agenda ?
at the meeting in germany on tuesday , the ministers are expected to announce a six-year plan to breath new life into the convention , and the creation of a permanent secretariat based in innsbruck to oversee the revised agenda and the establishment of a monitoring mechanism to chart progress will be announced .
likewise , cipra has launched a " future of the alps " initiative , which it hopes will - on a grass roots basis - help speed up the adaptation of the individual protocols .
" we do not have a lack of knowledge , " wolfgang pfefforkorn , the director of the future of the alps initiative , told dw-world .

in response , the owners of the threatened resorts are looking to build so-called " second generation ski resorts " above the revised snowline among the alps ' highest peeks and glaciers despite strict laws preventing further development .
in may , in the tirol , they succeeded .
the local government ruled to relax the law , paving the way for two major projects .
michel revaz , the deputy director of cipra told dw-world that he is worried the move will spark a dangerous game one upmanship among european ski resorts .
" now that it 's happened in austria , all the others will want to do the same , " he told dw-world .
he would prefer to see the affected regions look for an alternatives to ski tourism , rather than colonizing the alps remaining pristine peaks .

with new threats emerging , they 're meeting in germany on tuesday to plan for the future . next year , the alpine convention , a regional agreement for the protection and sustainable development of the alps , will celebrate its 10th anniversary .

environment ministers meet in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch-partenkirchen sits right near the german alps in southern bavaria on tuesday , the environmental ministers of the seven permanent members of the convention , led by germany , the current chair , will meet in garmisch-partenkirchen , germany for the eighth alpine conference .
they 'll assess their successes and set out an ambitious plan for the region , a rich and diverse area encompassing 190,287 square kilometres with a population of more than 13 million .
but with the alpine convention remaining a non-binding framework with , until now , no permanent secretariat , it remains to be seen if it has the political muscle to get the job done .
regional thinking a good start with the growth of the environmental movement in the 1960 's and 1970 's an increased awareness of the threats facing the alps developed , and preservationists lobbied hard for a collective approach .
after years of wrangling , the alpine convention went into force in march of 1995 .
a framework agreement between seven european countries , it set out to limit environmental degradation by harmonizing economic and environmental policies in the region .
thus , with 13 protocols , including ones related to air and water pollution , the convention 's greatest initial achievement was that it promoted a regional way of thinking where highly territorial national policies once prevailed .

" holland is everywhere , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the social democratic party 's domestic expert over the weekend . it was an oft-quoted line in newspaper editorials this week as the country once again re-examined its often troubled relationship to the 2 million muslims that call germany home . the country 's top policeman , interior minister otto schily , warned others not to overreact to news of mosque burnings and tensions in holland .
he said germany 's new immigration law , which offers integration measures such as language classes to earlier as well as current generations of immigrants , was an important step towards cultural understanding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily " there is , of course , also a danger for us , although we have significant integration successes to show , " schily -lrb- photo -rrb- told the german public broadcaster zdf .
" we should n't minimize those . "
" clash of civilizations " feared conservative politicians used the opportunity to warn of an impending " clash of civilizations " that could very well take place on german soil .
the head of bavaria 's christian scocial union , markus soeder , said the events in the netherlands showed the need for a leitkultur in germany .
the politically-loaded word can be translated as a " leading " or " guiding " culture . " when we look at the recent events in the netherlands , we see a clash of civilizations in full , and we must prevent anything similar from evolving here , " said soeder .
" we need a change in our integration policy which ought to be based strictly on the values and notion of a modern christian society . " terrorism investigators have estimated that there are about 1,000 radical members of the country 's muslim community that are prone to violence .
like their counterparts in holland , they are members of radical mosques where imams rail against israel and western society . misusing democracy bavarian interior minister günter beckstein said the imams must no longer be allowed to preach hate under the protection of the laws of german society .
" the enemies of freedom must not be allowed to use our liberties in order to harm us , " said beckstein .
" and there has to be a policy of zero tolerance towards them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan -lrb- middle -rrb- germany 's efforts to root out muslim fundamentalists have shown mixed success .
after years of trying , the country was finally able early this fall to deport fundamentalist metin kaplan , convicted of calling for the death of a rival imam in berlin , to turkey , where he is wanted for calling for the overthrow of the country 's government . bringing young muslims into the fold but two trials against suspected accomplices of the band of hamburg terrorists that carried out the sept .
11 terrorist attacks have ended in acquittals .
and the appeals do n't look to swing in the government 's favor . though a hard line against potential fundamentalists is preferable , politicians like the green party 's volker beck said the opposite should be done for moderate , young muslims .
" social exclusion and disintegration make young muslims vulnerable to radical ideologies and hatred , " beck said .
" the way out of this dilemma is not to brand them as outlaws , but rather to let them participate in german social life . " dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe faces new integration challenges the current wave of violence against muslims in the netherlands has forced all of europe to stop and examine the problems of integration .

" holland is everywhere , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the social democratic party 's domestic expert over the weekend . it was an oft-quoted line in newspaper editorials this week as the country once again re-examined its often troubled relationship to the 2 million muslims that call germany home . the country 's top policeman , interior minister otto schily , warned others not to overreact to news of mosque burnings and tensions in holland .

" in the same newspaper , the islam critic hans-peter raddatz writes that " the state allows extremists to create networks under the protection of the so-called dialogue , the beneficiaries of which have only one goal : to live in accordance to their own rules and cancel out the constitutional state . " fanatics are everywhere just as bad , if less so , was the opinion of other " experts " , who have been calling for tolerance and liberalism since the amsterdam murder while at the same time saying that a reason for the violence is that holland let in too many muslims - with a little less than a million , still a higher per capita count than in germany . can you declare liberalism and tolerance for dead just because one fanatic committed a ghastly murder and because he became a fanatic in a radical muslim community ? as unsatisfying as this sounds : things like that can happen - in every country .
there are fanatics everywhere ; especially in these times , where religion is increasingly being misused for political purposes . differences should be respected in opposition to the rhetoric since the van gogh murder the only solution can be the continued integration of those of other faiths - and not just muslims .
integration also should not mean giving up one 's identity . differences should be respected .
but they should align themselves under the still-generous european constitutional system .
those that want to live here need to obey the societal and democratic system otherwise they will continually be out of place . but this system needs to deal with " the others " with as much freedom , liberality and tolerance for which the pessimists are criticizing holland . art has its borders these critics do n't address the fact that the director , through a well-intended but visually provocative film , deeply hurt the feelings of faithful muslims .
it is no justification for violence , but as the worldwide debate over the jesus film -lrb- mel gibson 's " the passion " -rrb- and other cases showed , art can and is n't borderless , because it always finds its border with the other person 's freedom . if liberalism and tolerance have failed anywhere , then it is here . peter philipp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe faces new integration challenges the current wave of violence against muslims in the netherlands has forced all of europe to stop and examine the problems of integration .

goleo the lion was revealed as the official mascot for the 2006 world cup this weekend .
while fame and fortune beckons for the face of the soccer spectacular , goleo will find out it 's not all furry handshakes and waving . with great power comes great responsibility , something goleo - the newly revealed official mascot of the 2006 world cup - will soon learn .
the tall and imposing , although very approachable looking , lion becomes the latest in a long line of fake animals to become the figurehead of a major sporting event .
goleo will spend the next 18 months preparing for the global soccer showcase in germany , where he will stir the crowded stadiums and inspire millions of spectators around the world .
during that time , goleo 's face will become synonymous with the world cup in germany and the harmonious message of fair play that will no doubt be promoted throughout the entirety of the month-long tournament .
global superstardom and worldwide recognition awaits him .
he looks happy enough , but is he ready ?
such a high profile position comes with its own set of intense pressures .
goleo will not even be able to enjoy a quiet gazelle without a pack of paparazzi snappers being on hand to record his every bite and maul .
so what can the mascot of the 2006 world cup expect ?
if everything goes right , goleo could be the next misha the bear .
the mascot of the olympic games of 1980 went on to become one of the best loved and most marketable figureheads in sporting history , so much so that many people forget the us boycott of the moscow games - in protest of the december 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan - and remember them for the cute little teddy bear who even cried at the closing ceremony .
memorable misha endures misha 's tale should give the german lion some hope .
regardless of how well his countrymen perform at the world cup , goleo could still come out of the tournament smelling of roses .
a successful stint as the face of the 2006 tournament could bode well for a future career away from the sporting spotlight .
goleo may want to look to the example set by english soccer team hartlepool united 's h 'angus the monkey .
the all-singing , all-dancing mascot of the yorkshire club enjoyed a long career aping around for the hartlepool faithful and made such an impression on the town that in may 2002 , he was elected town mayor .
but while the world may be an oyster - or in goleo 's case , a wildebeest - for the successful mascot , there are pitfalls .
as with any celebrity , there are temptations for the sporting mascot , such as unscrupulous types waiting to accelerate their downfall for their own gains by exploiting any furry foot put wrong .
the seedier side of the mascot life is just a flip of the coin away .
when fake animals attack take wolfie , the mascot of another english soccer team , wolverhampton wanderers .
wolfie used to rally the crowds with playful and endearing kick-arounds with the opposing mascots before his team took to the pitch .
that is until the arrival of bristol city 's three little pigs .
in front of a television audience of millions , wolfie lost his cool in the pre-match contest and ended up battling all three pigs in a pitch-side punch-up .
needless to say , he never worked in that town again .
as the only official mascot of the world cup , goleo may not have any rivals to face and so potential fisticuffs should be avoided .
but even if he keeps his cold , wet nose clean , goleo must go into this new phase with his eyes open to the realities .

a successful stint as the face of the 2006 tournament could bode well for a future career away from the sporting spotlight .
goleo may want to look to the example set by english soccer team hartlepool united 's h 'angus the monkey .
the all-singing , all-dancing mascot of the yorkshire club enjoyed a long career aping around for the hartlepool faithful and made such an impression on the town that in may 2002 , he was elected town mayor .
but while the world may be an oyster - or in goleo 's case , a wildebeest - for the successful mascot , there are pitfalls .
as with any celebrity , there are temptations for the sporting mascot , such as unscrupulous types waiting to accelerate their downfall for their own gains by exploiting any furry foot put wrong .
the seedier side of the mascot life is just a flip of the coin away .
when fake animals attack take wolfie , the mascot of another english soccer team , wolverhampton wanderers .
wolfie used to rally the crowds with playful and endearing kick-arounds with the opposing mascots before his team took to the pitch .
that is until the arrival of bristol city 's three little pigs .
in front of a television audience of millions , wolfie lost his cool in the pre-match contest and ended up battling all three pigs in a pitch-side punch-up .
needless to say , he never worked in that town again .
as the only official mascot of the world cup , goleo may not have any rivals to face and so potential fisticuffs should be avoided .
but even if he keeps his cold , wet nose clean , goleo must go into this new phase with his eyes open to the realities .
a mascot 's shelf life is a tangible one .
fame and fortune are assured in the run-up to the event and during it , but only the most endearing mascots linger in the memory when the glory fades .
the " aah " factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take the recent athens summer olympic games .
can anyone name the two asexual triangles that passed as the event 's co-mascots ?
well , they were phevos and athena , the siblings named after greek gods who represented the link between greek history and the modern olympic games .
the cumbersome and non-cuddly icons drew more baffled looks and questions than adoration this summer .
however , they contributed to the $ 81 million -lrb- € 63 million -rrb- or so that athens merchandising generated .
their success was assured mainly due to the usual ploy of covering everything from baby bonnets to thongs in their images .
if you wanted anything olympic , you had to have phevos and athena on it .
but despite this , it is unlikely that they will be the enduring memory of the games .
they did n't have that cute " aah " factor that mascots who want to live on need .
in portugal , the super-human wunderkind kinas , the mascot for the european soccer championships this summer , has also sunk without a trace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kinas , " the euro 2004 european soccer championship mascot .
the boy who was supposed to " embody the enthusiasm , skill , determination and sense of fun that make football the greatest sport on earth " has rarely been seen since and must be cursing his luck that he was chosen to front a tournament which would provide one of the greatest shocks in soccer history .
germany 's goleo may have an advantage .
he is a cuddly , eight-foot -lrb- 2.4 meter -rrb- tall lion with a touch of " sesame street " about him and not some cartoon child or a geometric shape with big feet .
but even a moth-eaten , threadbare misha will tell him to enjoy the good times when they come because the light of the mascot burns fast and bright but can fade just as quickly . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing the world cup into the schools in the run-up to the 2006 world cup in germany , a new project headed by national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann aims to teach kids how to think globally and about the importance of good sportsmanship .

" our small genius is ... at the moon , " a delighted southwood declared . the probe achieved lunar orbit at 17:53 gmt on monday , and on tuesday was looping the moon at a height of 5,000-6000 kilometers -lrb- 3,000-3,500 miles -rrb- , smart-1 project manager giuseppe racca said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart-1 will gently spiral closer to the lunar surface , eventually stabilizing in an egg-shaped polar orbit that will vary from 300 kilometers -lrb- 187 miles -rrb- at the south pole to 3,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,870 miles -rrb- at the north pole . the 370-kilo -lrb- 814-pound -rrb- probe has been using a slow but revolutionary form of propulsion , taking it in ever-widening circles around the earth and using terrestrial gravity as a slingshot , to get to the moon . it is powered by an ion engine , which converts solar power into electricity that then charges atoms of the heavy gas xenon . these charged atoms , known as ions , are then disgorged from the back of the probe to give it thrust . slow , but persistent the motor is initially slow - launched on sept .
27 , 2003 , smart-1 took more than 13 months to make a trip achieved in three days by the chemical rockets of the apollo era - but speed gradually builds up in the frictionless environment of space , making ion power ideal for trips into the depths of the solar system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this artist 's rendition released by the european space agency , the european-made smart-1 solar-powered satellite is seen nearing the moon on its way to make the first comprehensive inventory of key chemical elements in the lunar surface .
smart-1 -lrb- photo -rrb- clocked up 332 orbits around earth and travelled more than 84 million kilometers -lrb- 52.5 million miles -rrb- , " a distance comparable to an interplanetary cruise , " esa pointed out in a press statement . it fired its engines 289 times , operating them for a total of about 3,700 hours , and sipped just 59 kilos -lrb- 129.8 pounds -rrb- of its 80 kilos -lrb- 176 pounds -rrb- of xenon gas .
space rockets typically carry tonnes of chemical fuel , which thus crimps the size of the payload . so much fuel has been saved that smart-1 will be placed in a closer approach to the moon for the scientific phase of the mission . " the performance -lsb- of the motor -rsb- has been better than we expected , " said giorgio saccoccia , head of esa propulsion division .

its job is made harder by the lack of cohesion between many european institutions and organizations . human trafficking , computer crime and terrorism are just some of the crimes dealt with by eurojust , the eu authority charged with the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border and organized crime .
in addition to the specific crime areas , there are also the individual cases which flood in from all 25 member states in the european union to be dealt with .
as a body established as recently as 2002 to enhance the effectiveness of collective crime fighting , and one which has more than 1000 live cases on its books , eurojust could well claim to be one of the busiest and overwhelmed departments in the eu .
behind kilometers of razor wire , security checks and armored doors , the headquarters of eurojust in the hague is one of the most secure places in the eu .

they waited for one week only and as a result the whole drug ring was smashed and many arrests made . "
despite such successes , not everything works as smoothly .
von langsdorff , who works with 24 other national representatives in mediating between public prosecutor 's offices all across europe , admitted that sometimes the influx of cases is too much .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.11.2004 row over plan for german in mosques großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would have moslems pray in german a proposal for the enforcement of german as a spoken language in mosques has erupted in germany as politicians look for ways to reform the country 's integration policy in the wake of violence in the netherlands . a regional politician 's proposal that prayers in german mosques should be said in german was greeted with dismay on monday amid fears that anti-muslim attacks may spread over the border from the netherlands .
annette schavan , the christian democratic education minister for the state of baden-württemberg and a contender for the state 's premiership , made her radical proposal at the weekend because , she said , " we can no longer accept that prayers in mosques should be said in languages that can not be understood outside the muslim community . "
schavan 's proposal comes in the wake of the torching of mosques , schools and churches in the netherlands following the killing of film director theo van gogh , whose work was strongly critical of muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her suggestion drew a sharp reaction from the leaders of the more than two and a half million turks who live in germany .
" this is nonsense - terror can be spread in any language , " said kenan kolat , the co-president of the turkish community in germany .
cornelie sonntag-wolgast , a representative of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on the national parliamentary committee for domestic affairs also criticized the proposal .
" we can not suspect each and every person ... of violence just because they say their prayers in arabic , " said sonntag-wolgast .
volker beck , a spokesman for the greens , the junior partner in the governing coalition , said schavan 's proposal was " completely exaggerated " while liberal fdp interior minister max stadler criticized schavan , saying her proposal for the state to enforce the german language in mosques was " an offense against basic law . "
werner schiffauer , a cultural professor said , schavan 's plan was " out-of-touch and impractical " , a view supported by jürgen micksch , the chairperson of the intercultural council in germany .
professor schiffauer stated that there was little money available to provide language training for the large numbers of islamic preachers in germany and that , in addition , many foreigners living in germany stayed for only a short time and were dependent on mother-tongue services while they were there .
some support idea however , nadeem elyas , the chairman for the central council of muslims in germany , agreed with the proposal .
elyas explained that a lot of mosques already translate their prayers and sermons and offer simultaneous audio feeds in both arabic and german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mosque in berlin neukölln .
the council , he said , is made up of 19 organizations and about 500 mosque municipalities in germany , not all of which cater for purely arabic speakers .
elyas added that german , turkish , arabian , albanian , bosnian and persian muslims all worship in germany and many have different language requirements .
call for islamic holiday the row over schaven 's proposal comes at a time when germany seems desperate to define its integration policy and avoid copycat violence spreading across the border from the neighboring netherlands .
just a day after schaven 's proposal was revealed , a member of the green party in germany called for the government to install an official islamic holiday in the german calendar .

annette schavan , the christian democratic education minister for the state of baden-württemberg and a contender for the state 's premiership , made her radical proposal at the weekend because , she said , " we can no longer accept that prayers in mosques should be said in languages that can not be understood outside the muslim community .

the most controversial was italian conservative rocco buttiglione , who came up against strong resistance for his views on homosexuality and marriage .
but he is not the only one . on tuesday , the hungarian candidate , sixty-five year old laszlo kovacs has the chance to prove his worth for the customs and taxation portfolio .
he was originally nominated as energy commissioner , but performed disastrously at this first hearing in front of the parliament last month , astounding members of the parliament with his lack of knowledge on even basic matters . " from the academic point of view , i was probably wrong when i tried to define what i think of hydrogen , but i 'm to say i 'm not an academic , and not even an energy expert , " kovacs said after the hearing . should he stay or should he go although kovacs has managed to avoid the fate of buttiglione , janis emmanouilidis , an expert in european affairs at the centre for applied policy research in munich , said he believes hungary should have replaced kovacs . " there was a strong pressure to have him withdrawn , but the government in hungary strongly supported his nomination and did n't withdraw him , " he told dw-radio .
" i believe that because many parliamentarians , not only from the christian democrats but also from the socialist group , criticized him concerning his knowledge of the matter , it might have been a wise decision to have him withdrawn . " kovacs , who is the former hungarian minister for foreign affairs , is expected to face difficult questions on economics and currency , as well as domestic market and consumer protection matters .
the hearing is likely to be gruelling as parliamentarians feel that eu member states are n't take the nomination process seriously . " the european parliament is looking at its rights and exploiting its rights , " emmanouilidis said .
" it is looking for new areas to show the two other institutions in the eu that the parliament has a strong say . " the voice of experience however , he also said he believes that kovacs will bring some political know-how to the commission . " he 's one of a few politicians in the new member states with significant experience , " he said .
" he has a lot to offer from a political point of view , but concerning his technical knowledge in certain policy areas , he might be less strong . " the parliament ca n't refuse individual commissioners , only the entire commission , which means that kovac 's nomination is probably in the bag .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.11.2004 hungarian faces commission hearing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a controversial candidate : laszlo kovacs new european commission president jose barroso is due to present his commissioners on thursday , but not before the hungarian candidate proves he is the right man for the job . the new commission should have started work at the beginning of november , but was held up by disagreements over a number of commissioner candidates .
the most controversial was italian conservative rocco buttiglione , who came up against strong resistance for his views on homosexuality and marriage .
but he is not the only one . on tuesday , the hungarian candidate , sixty-five year old laszlo kovacs has the chance to prove his worth for the customs and taxation portfolio .
he was originally nominated as energy commissioner , but performed disastrously at this first hearing in front of the parliament last month , astounding members of the parliament with his lack of knowledge on even basic matters . " from the academic point of view , i was probably wrong when i tried to define what i think of hydrogen , but i 'm to say i 'm not an academic , and not even an energy expert , " kovacs said after the hearing . should he stay or should he go although kovacs has managed to avoid the fate of buttiglione , janis emmanouilidis , an expert in european affairs at the centre for applied policy research in munich , said he believes hungary should have replaced kovacs . " there was a strong pressure to have him withdrawn , but the government in hungary strongly supported his nomination and did n't withdraw him , " he told dw-radio .
" i believe that because many parliamentarians , not only from the christian democrats but also from the socialist group , criticized him concerning his knowledge of the matter , it might have been a wise decision to have him withdrawn . " kovacs , who is the former hungarian minister for foreign affairs , is expected to face difficult questions on economics and currency , as well as domestic market and consumer protection matters .
the hearing is likely to be gruelling as parliamentarians feel that eu member states are n't take the nomination process seriously . " the european parliament is looking at its rights and exploiting its rights , " emmanouilidis said .
" it is looking for new areas to show the two other institutions in the eu that the parliament has a strong say . " the voice of experience however , he also said he believes that kovacs will bring some political know-how to the commission . " he 's one of a few politicians in the new member states with significant experience , " he said .
" he has a lot to offer from a political point of view , but concerning his technical knowledge in certain policy areas , he might be less strong . " the parliament ca n't refuse individual commissioners , only the entire commission , which means that kovac 's nomination is probably in the bag .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.11.2004 tackling alpine preservation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under threat it 's been almost a decade since european countries decided to work together to preserve the alps .
with new threats emerging , they 're meeting in germany on tuesday to plan for the future . next year , the alpine convention , a regional agreement for the protection and sustainable development of the alps , will celebrate its 10th anniversary .
but in the decade since european countries with part of their territory in the alps made a great leap forward and agreed to work together to find common solutions for common problems , critics say preservation efforts have not gone far enough .
meanwhile , a host of emerging threats demand urgent attention .
environment ministers meet in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch-partenkirchen sits right near the german alps in southern bavaria on tuesday , the environmental ministers of the seven permanent members of the convention , led by germany , the current chair , will meet in garmisch-partenkirchen , germany for the eighth alpine conference .
they 'll assess their successes and set out an ambitious plan for the region , a rich and diverse area encompassing 190,287 square kilometres with a population of more than 13 million .
but with the alpine convention remaining a non-binding framework with , until now , no permanent secretariat , it remains to be seen if it has the political muscle to get the job done .
regional thinking a good start with the growth of the environmental movement in the 1960 's and 1970 's an increased awareness of the threats facing the alps developed , and preservationists lobbied hard for a collective approach .
after years of wrangling , the alpine convention went into force in march of 1995 .
a framework agreement between seven european countries , it set out to limit environmental degradation by harmonizing economic and environmental policies in the region .
thus , with 13 protocols , including ones related to air and water pollution , the convention 's greatest initial achievement was that it promoted a regional way of thinking where highly territorial national policies once prevailed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morteratsch glacier in switzerland has been melting at a rapid pace .
" the alpine convention increased the realization that the alps need to be treated as a region and the participants need to develop a regional way of thinking , " martin price , director of the center for mountain studies at perth college in great britain and the former chairman of the european mountain forum told dw-world .
andreas götz , the director of the international commission for the protection of the alps -lrb- cipra -rrb- agreed .
" the main thing is that a regional consciousness developed , " he told dw-world .
initial success gives way to stalled agenda in the years since it went into force , the alpine convention has not been without its successes .
a network of protected areas was created , as well as an international scientific commission for alpine research , based in bern , to study environmental threats and possible solutions .
what 's more , related initiatives , such as the alliance in the alps , founded by cipra , encouraged individual regions to share information and best practices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a paraglider is flying in front of the alps down from the brauneck mountain near bad tölz in southern germany .
but after an initial flutter of activity , some say efforts have stalled .
though lots of data was collected and inter-regional relationships were forged , the tough issues - inter-state transportation , the effects of global warming , the impactof depopulation - have not been directly tackled .
" the easier issues have been solved first and the more difficult ones left until later , " price said .
meeting to jumpstart agenda ?
at the meeting in germany on tuesday , the ministers are expected to announce a six-year plan to breath new life into the convention , and the creation of a permanent secretariat based in innsbruck to oversee the revised agenda and the establishment of a monitoring mechanism to chart progress will be announced .
likewise , cipra has launched a " future of the alps " initiative , which it hopes will - on a grass roots basis - help speed up the adaptation of the individual protocols .
" we do not have a lack of knowledge , " wolfgang pfefforkorn , the director of the future of the alps initiative , told dw-world .
" we have a lack of the implementation . "
a more results-oriented agenda , with a regular " state of the alps " report would be a good start , werner baetzing , an expert in alpine research at the university of erlangen in germany told dw-world .
new ski resorts threaten highest peaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steeple of the church in the liechtenstein village of triesenberg is seen in front of the alvierkette mountain chain in the swiss alps .
a renewed commitment to alpine preservation could not come at a better time .
new threats are emerging , illustrating the alps delicate state .
chief among them : global warming , which will affect the region in a number of different ways , including , possibly precipitating the end of ski-related tourism .
according to a report released last year by the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , up to half of all alpine ski resorts in france , austria and switzerland may be forced to close over the next fifty years if current global warming trends continue and the snowline rises another 300 meters to 1800 meters above sea level .
in response , the owners of the threatened resorts are looking to build so-called " second generation ski resorts " above the revised snowline among the alps ' highest peeks and glaciers despite strict laws preventing further development .
in may , in the tirol , they succeeded .
the local government ruled to relax the law , paving the way for two major projects .
michel revaz , the deputy director of cipra told dw-world that he is worried the move will spark a dangerous game one upmanship among european ski resorts .
" now that it 's happened in austria , all the others will want to do the same , " he told dw-world .
he would prefer to see the affected regions look for an alternatives to ski tourism , rather than colonizing the alps remaining pristine peaks .
convention a model to learn from bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ski jumper sven hannawald soars in front of the zugspitze mountain ridge in the case of global warming and ski tourism , and a number of other areas , the benefits of a regional approach are many .
on tuesday , the members of the alpine convention will be looking to build on past successes and put bite into a decade-old agreement .
the future of a region representative of many people 's picture of europe hangs in the balance .
on the plus side , experts say that when it comes to the preservation of mountain regions , europe is leading the way and setting an excellent example for other mountain areas around the world struggling with similar issues .
" maybe it 's not the model to follow , " price said .
" but it 's the model to learn from .

with new threats emerging , they 're meeting in germany on tuesday to plan for the future . next year , the alpine convention , a regional agreement for the protection and sustainable development of the alps , will celebrate its 10th anniversary .
but in the decade since european countries with part of their territory in the alps made a great leap forward and agreed to work together to find common solutions for common problems , critics say preservation efforts have not gone far enough .
meanwhile , a host of emerging threats demand urgent attention .
environment ministers meet in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch-partenkirchen sits right near the german alps in southern bavaria on tuesday , the environmental ministers of the seven permanent members of the convention , led by germany , the current chair , will meet in garmisch-partenkirchen , germany for the eighth alpine conference .
they 'll assess their successes and set out an ambitious plan for the region , a rich and diverse area encompassing 190,287 square kilometres with a population of more than 13 million .
but with the alpine convention remaining a non-binding framework with , until now , no permanent secretariat , it remains to be seen if it has the political muscle to get the job done .
regional thinking a good start with the growth of the environmental movement in the 1960 's and 1970 's an increased awareness of the threats facing the alps developed , and preservationists lobbied hard for a collective approach .
after years of wrangling , the alpine convention went into force in march of 1995 .
a framework agreement between seven european countries , it set out to limit environmental degradation by harmonizing economic and environmental policies in the region .
thus , with 13 protocols , including ones related to air and water pollution , the convention 's greatest initial achievement was that it promoted a regional way of thinking where highly territorial national policies once prevailed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morteratsch glacier in switzerland has been melting at a rapid pace .
" the alpine convention increased the realization that the alps need to be treated as a region and the participants need to develop a regional way of thinking , " martin price , director of the center for mountain studies at perth college in great britain and the former chairman of the european mountain forum told dw-world .
andreas götz , the director of the international commission for the protection of the alps -lrb- cipra -rrb- agreed .
" the main thing is that a regional consciousness developed , " he told dw-world .
initial success gives way to stalled agenda in the years since it went into force , the alpine convention has not been without its successes .
a network of protected areas was created , as well as an international scientific commission for alpine research , based in bern , to study environmental threats and possible solutions .
what 's more , related initiatives , such as the alliance in the alps , founded by cipra , encouraged individual regions to share information and best practices .

" the easier issues have been solved first and the more difficult ones left until later , " price said .
meeting to jumpstart agenda ?
at the meeting in germany on tuesday , the ministers are expected to announce a six-year plan to breath new life into the convention , and the creation of a permanent secretariat based in innsbruck to oversee the revised agenda and the establishment of a monitoring mechanism to chart progress will be announced .
likewise , cipra has launched a " future of the alps " initiative , which it hopes will - on a grass roots basis - help speed up the adaptation of the individual protocols .
" we do not have a lack of knowledge , " wolfgang pfefforkorn , the director of the future of the alps initiative , told dw-world .
" we have a lack of the implementation . "
a more results-oriented agenda , with a regular " state of the alps " report would be a good start , werner baetzing , an expert in alpine research at the university of erlangen in germany told dw-world .
new ski resorts threaten highest peaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steeple of the church in the liechtenstein village of triesenberg is seen in front of the alvierkette mountain chain in the swiss alps .
a renewed commitment to alpine preservation could not come at a better time .
new threats are emerging , illustrating the alps delicate state .
chief among them : global warming , which will affect the region in a number of different ways , including , possibly precipitating the end of ski-related tourism .
according to a report released last year by the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , up to half of all alpine ski resorts in france , austria and switzerland may be forced to close over the next fifty years if current global warming trends continue and the snowline rises another 300 meters to 1800 meters above sea level .
in response , the owners of the threatened resorts are looking to build so-called " second generation ski resorts " above the revised snowline among the alps ' highest peeks and glaciers despite strict laws preventing further development .
in may , in the tirol , they succeeded .
the local government ruled to relax the law , paving the way for two major projects .
michel revaz , the deputy director of cipra told dw-world that he is worried the move will spark a dangerous game one upmanship among european ski resorts .
" now that it 's happened in austria , all the others will want to do the same , " he told dw-world .
he would prefer to see the affected regions look for an alternatives to ski tourism , rather than colonizing the alps remaining pristine peaks .

the future of a region representative of many people 's picture of europe hangs in the balance .
on the plus side , experts say that when it comes to the preservation of mountain regions , europe is leading the way and setting an excellent example for other mountain areas around the world struggling with similar issues .

they 'll assess their successes and set out an ambitious plan for the region , a rich and diverse area encompassing 190,287 square kilometres with a population of more than 13 million .
but with the alpine convention remaining a non-binding framework with , until now , no permanent secretariat , it remains to be seen if it has the political muscle to get the job done .
regional thinking a good start with the growth of the environmental movement in the 1960 's and 1970 's an increased awareness of the threats facing the alps developed , and preservationists lobbied hard for a collective approach .
after years of wrangling , the alpine convention went into force in march of 1995 .
a framework agreement between seven european countries , it set out to limit environmental degradation by harmonizing economic and environmental policies in the region .
thus , with 13 protocols , including ones related to air and water pollution , the convention 's greatest initial achievement was that it promoted a regional way of thinking where highly territorial national policies once prevailed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morteratsch glacier in switzerland has been melting at a rapid pace .
" the alpine convention increased the realization that the alps need to be treated as a region and the participants need to develop a regional way of thinking , " martin price , director of the center for mountain studies at perth college in great britain and the former chairman of the european mountain forum told dw-world .
andreas götz , the director of the international commission for the protection of the alps -lrb- cipra -rrb- agreed .
" the main thing is that a regional consciousness developed , " he told dw-world .
initial success gives way to stalled agenda in the years since it went into force , the alpine convention has not been without its successes .
a network of protected areas was created , as well as an international scientific commission for alpine research , based in bern , to study environmental threats and possible solutions .
what 's more , related initiatives , such as the alliance in the alps , founded by cipra , encouraged individual regions to share information and best practices .

" the easier issues have been solved first and the more difficult ones left until later , " price said .
meeting to jumpstart agenda ?
at the meeting in germany on tuesday , the ministers are expected to announce a six-year plan to breath new life into the convention , and the creation of a permanent secretariat based in innsbruck to oversee the revised agenda and the establishment of a monitoring mechanism to chart progress will be announced .
likewise , cipra has launched a " future of the alps " initiative , which it hopes will - on a grass roots basis - help speed up the adaptation of the individual protocols .
" we do not have a lack of knowledge , " wolfgang pfefforkorn , the director of the future of the alps initiative , told dw-world .
" we have a lack of the implementation . "
a more results-oriented agenda , with a regular " state of the alps " report would be a good start , werner baetzing , an expert in alpine research at the university of erlangen in germany told dw-world .
new ski resorts threaten highest peaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steeple of the church in the liechtenstein village of triesenberg is seen in front of the alvierkette mountain chain in the swiss alps .
a renewed commitment to alpine preservation could not come at a better time .
new threats are emerging , illustrating the alps delicate state .
chief among them : global warming , which will affect the region in a number of different ways , including , possibly precipitating the end of ski-related tourism .
according to a report released last year by the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , up to half of all alpine ski resorts in france , austria and switzerland may be forced to close over the next fifty years if current global warming trends continue and the snowline rises another 300 meters to 1800 meters above sea level .
in response , the owners of the threatened resorts are looking to build so-called " second generation ski resorts " above the revised snowline among the alps ' highest peeks and glaciers despite strict laws preventing further development .
in may , in the tirol , they succeeded .
the local government ruled to relax the law , paving the way for two major projects .
michel revaz , the deputy director of cipra told dw-world that he is worried the move will spark a dangerous game one upmanship among european ski resorts .
" now that it 's happened in austria , all the others will want to do the same , " he told dw-world .
he would prefer to see the affected regions look for an alternatives to ski tourism , rather than colonizing the alps remaining pristine peaks .

the future of a region representative of many people 's picture of europe hangs in the balance .
on the plus side , experts say that when it comes to the preservation of mountain regions , europe is leading the way and setting an excellent example for other mountain areas around the world struggling with similar issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.11.2004 opinion : no need to panic in holland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks on muslim institutions , like this school , have taken place despite simmering tensions in holland , a clash of civilizations wo n't break out in europe if people maintain their cool , writes deutsche welle 's peter philipp . you would think europe is about to break out into war .
just as the murder in sarajevo once began wwi , so has the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh been depicted by self-described terrorism or islam experts -lrb- the two fit together so wonderfully nowadays -rrb- as the first shot in the so-called " clash of civilizations " .
it is a clash that will no longer be waged with words , but with weapons , and where the future power structures in europe are at stake . a writer in the conservative daily , die welt , writes that fundamental muslims " strive for the reestablishment of an islamic order in accordance with the original islam of the 7th century which , according to them , is the only legitimate state and society .
this should replace other systems . " in the same newspaper , the islam critic hans-peter raddatz writes that " the state allows extremists to create networks under the protection of the so-called dialogue , the beneficiaries of which have only one goal : to live in accordance to their own rules and cancel out the constitutional state . " fanatics are everywhere just as bad , if less so , was the opinion of other " experts " , who have been calling for tolerance and liberalism since the amsterdam murder while at the same time saying that a reason for the violence is that holland let in too many muslims - with a little less than a million , still a higher per capita count than in germany . can you declare liberalism and tolerance for dead just because one fanatic committed a ghastly murder and because he became a fanatic in a radical muslim community ? as unsatisfying as this sounds : things like that can happen - in every country .
there are fanatics everywhere ; especially in these times , where religion is increasingly being misused for political purposes . differences should be respected in opposition to the rhetoric since the van gogh murder the only solution can be the continued integration of those of other faiths - and not just muslims .
integration also should not mean giving up one 's identity . differences should be respected .
but they should align themselves under the still-generous european constitutional system .
those that want to live here need to obey the societal and democratic system otherwise they will continually be out of place . but this system needs to deal with " the others " with as much freedom , liberality and tolerance for which the pessimists are criticizing holland . art has its borders these critics do n't address the fact that the director , through a well-intended but visually provocative film , deeply hurt the feelings of faithful muslims .
it is no justification for violence , but as the worldwide debate over the jesus film -lrb- mel gibson 's " the passion " -rrb- and other cases showed , art can and is n't borderless , because it always finds its border with the other person 's freedom . if liberalism and tolerance have failed anywhere , then it is here . peter philipp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe faces new integration challenges the current wave of violence against muslims in the netherlands has forced all of europe to stop and examine the problems of integration .

goleo the lion was revealed as the official mascot for the 2006 world cup this weekend .
while fame and fortune beckons for the face of the soccer spectacular , goleo will find out it 's not all furry handshakes and waving . with great power comes great responsibility , something goleo - the newly revealed official mascot of the 2006 world cup - will soon learn .
the tall and imposing , although very approachable looking , lion becomes the latest in a long line of fake animals to become the figurehead of a major sporting event .
goleo will spend the next 18 months preparing for the global soccer showcase in germany , where he will stir the crowded stadiums and inspire millions of spectators around the world .
during that time , goleo 's face will become synonymous with the world cup in germany and the harmonious message of fair play that will no doubt be promoted throughout the entirety of the month-long tournament .
global superstardom and worldwide recognition awaits him .
he looks happy enough , but is he ready ?
such a high profile position comes with its own set of intense pressures .
goleo will not even be able to enjoy a quiet gazelle without a pack of paparazzi snappers being on hand to record his every bite and maul .
so what can the mascot of the 2006 world cup expect ?
if everything goes right , goleo could be the next misha the bear .
the mascot of the olympic games of 1980 went on to become one of the best loved and most marketable figureheads in sporting history , so much so that many people forget the us boycott of the moscow games - in protest of the december 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan - and remember them for the cute little teddy bear who even cried at the closing ceremony .
memorable misha endures misha 's tale should give the german lion some hope .
regardless of how well his countrymen perform at the world cup , goleo could still come out of the tournament smelling of roses .
a successful stint as the face of the 2006 tournament could bode well for a future career away from the sporting spotlight .
goleo may want to look to the example set by english soccer team hartlepool united 's h 'angus the monkey .
the all-singing , all-dancing mascot of the yorkshire club enjoyed a long career aping around for the hartlepool faithful and made such an impression on the town that in may 2002 , he was elected town mayor .
but while the world may be an oyster - or in goleo 's case , a wildebeest - for the successful mascot , there are pitfalls .
as with any celebrity , there are temptations for the sporting mascot , such as unscrupulous types waiting to accelerate their downfall for their own gains by exploiting any furry foot put wrong .
the seedier side of the mascot life is just a flip of the coin away .
when fake animals attack take wolfie , the mascot of another english soccer team , wolverhampton wanderers .
wolfie used to rally the crowds with playful and endearing kick-arounds with the opposing mascots before his team took to the pitch .
that is until the arrival of bristol city 's three little pigs .
in front of a television audience of millions , wolfie lost his cool in the pre-match contest and ended up battling all three pigs in a pitch-side punch-up .
needless to say , he never worked in that town again .
as the only official mascot of the world cup , goleo may not have any rivals to face and so potential fisticuffs should be avoided .
but even if he keeps his cold , wet nose clean , goleo must go into this new phase with his eyes open to the realities .
a mascot 's shelf life is a tangible one .

top designer says world cup design " just embarrassing " when baring it all is not enough could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ? current affairs -pipe- 16.11.2004 a mascot for all seasons ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo enjoys his time in the sun but how will history remember him ?
goleo the lion was revealed as the official mascot for the 2006 world cup this weekend .
while fame and fortune beckons for the face of the soccer spectacular , goleo will find out it 's not all furry handshakes and waving . with great power comes great responsibility , something goleo - the newly revealed official mascot of the 2006 world cup - will soon learn .
the tall and imposing , although very approachable looking , lion becomes the latest in a long line of fake animals to become the figurehead of a major sporting event .
goleo will spend the next 18 months preparing for the global soccer showcase in germany , where he will stir the crowded stadiums and inspire millions of spectators around the world .
during that time , goleo 's face will become synonymous with the world cup in germany and the harmonious message of fair play that will no doubt be promoted throughout the entirety of the month-long tournament .
global superstardom and worldwide recognition awaits him .
he looks happy enough , but is he ready ?
such a high profile position comes with its own set of intense pressures .
goleo will not even be able to enjoy a quiet gazelle without a pack of paparazzi snappers being on hand to record his every bite and maul .
so what can the mascot of the 2006 world cup expect ?
if everything goes right , goleo could be the next misha the bear .
the mascot of the olympic games of 1980 went on to become one of the best loved and most marketable figureheads in sporting history , so much so that many people forget the us boycott of the moscow games - in protest of the december 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan - and remember them for the cute little teddy bear who even cried at the closing ceremony .
memorable misha endures misha 's tale should give the german lion some hope .
regardless of how well his countrymen perform at the world cup , goleo could still come out of the tournament smelling of roses .
a successful stint as the face of the 2006 tournament could bode well for a future career away from the sporting spotlight .
goleo may want to look to the example set by english soccer team hartlepool united 's h 'angus the monkey .
the all-singing , all-dancing mascot of the yorkshire club enjoyed a long career aping around for the hartlepool faithful and made such an impression on the town that in may 2002 , he was elected town mayor .
but while the world may be an oyster - or in goleo 's case , a wildebeest - for the successful mascot , there are pitfalls .
as with any celebrity , there are temptations for the sporting mascot , such as unscrupulous types waiting to accelerate their downfall for their own gains by exploiting any furry foot put wrong .
the seedier side of the mascot life is just a flip of the coin away .
when fake animals attack take wolfie , the mascot of another english soccer team , wolverhampton wanderers .
wolfie used to rally the crowds with playful and endearing kick-arounds with the opposing mascots before his team took to the pitch .
that is until the arrival of bristol city 's three little pigs .
in front of a television audience of millions , wolfie lost his cool in the pre-match contest and ended up battling all three pigs in a pitch-side punch-up .
needless to say , he never worked in that town again .
as the only official mascot of the world cup , goleo may not have any rivals to face and so potential fisticuffs should be avoided .
but even if he keeps his cold , wet nose clean , goleo must go into this new phase with his eyes open to the realities .
a mascot 's shelf life is a tangible one .
fame and fortune are assured in the run-up to the event and during it , but only the most endearing mascots linger in the memory when the glory fades .
the " aah " factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take the recent athens summer olympic games .
can anyone name the two asexual triangles that passed as the event 's co-mascots ?
well , they were phevos and athena , the siblings named after greek gods who represented the link between greek history and the modern olympic games .
the cumbersome and non-cuddly icons drew more baffled looks and questions than adoration this summer .
however , they contributed to the $ 81 million -lrb- € 63 million -rrb- or so that athens merchandising generated .
their success was assured mainly due to the usual ploy of covering everything from baby bonnets to thongs in their images .
if you wanted anything olympic , you had to have phevos and athena on it .
but despite this , it is unlikely that they will be the enduring memory of the games .
they did n't have that cute " aah " factor that mascots who want to live on need .
in portugal , the super-human wunderkind kinas , the mascot for the european soccer championships this summer , has also sunk without a trace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kinas , " the euro 2004 european soccer championship mascot .
the boy who was supposed to " embody the enthusiasm , skill , determination and sense of fun that make football the greatest sport on earth " has rarely been seen since and must be cursing his luck that he was chosen to front a tournament which would provide one of the greatest shocks in soccer history .
germany 's goleo may have an advantage .
he is a cuddly , eight-foot -lrb- 2.4 meter -rrb- tall lion with a touch of " sesame street " about him and not some cartoon child or a geometric shape with big feet .
but even a moth-eaten , threadbare misha will tell him to enjoy the good times when they come because the light of the mascot burns fast and bright but can fade just as quickly . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing the world cup into the schools in the run-up to the 2006 world cup in germany , a new project headed by national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann aims to teach kids how to think globally and about the importance of good sportsmanship .

they said the announcement would come on tuesday . bush plans to turn to deputy national security adviser stephen hadley to replace rice , who is one of the president 's closest advisers and confidants , said the officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity . rice , who was 50 on sunday , has been tipped for months as a leading contender to succeed powell .
she is a fluent russian speaker and an expert on arms control . hadley , who advised bush on foreign policy during the 2000 election campaign and took office in january 2001 , was also the favorite to take over as national security adviser . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush , right , and secretary of state colin powell powell indicated that he has been in longstanding discussions with the president about leaving . " as we have discussed in recent months , i believe that now that the election is over , the time has come for me to step down as secretary of state and return to private life , " powell , 67 , said in a letter to bush . deputy secretary of state richard armitage , 59 , was also likely to step down , officials said . the white house also announced the departure of agriculture secretary ann veneman , energy secretary spencer abraham and education secretary rod paige .
attorney general john ashcroft and commerce secretary don evans quit last week . but powell has created the greatest stir , depriving the administration of a highly regarded voice on the international scene at a time when bush hoped to mend fences after the iraq war and revive middle east peace talks . bush described powell as " a soldier , a diplomat , a civic leader , a statesman and a great patriot , " and praised his work over the past four years . powell " is one of the great public servants of our time , " bush said in a statement . international tributes tributes also flowed in from around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell and fischer in berlin in april german foreign minister joschka fischer considered powell a close friend as well as a colleague .
speaking to reporters following powell 's resignation , fischer said the secretary was a man who understood germany very well , from his time here as a soldier .
despite policy differences between the two countries , fischer said he never found it difficult to communicate with his counterpart . " i want to thank him , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
" we worked very closely together and even in the most critical issues , always as friends ...
i wish him all the best in the future . " un secretary general kofi annan had a " very warm working relationship " with powell and especially appreciated " support for the united nations and for multilateral approaches to problem-solving , " said annan spokesman fred eckhard . british prime minister tony blair called powell " a remarkable man who has been a good friend to this country over a very long period . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer also praised his country 's cooperation with powell . japanese government spokesman hiroyuki hosodan expressed disappointment but said powell 's resignation would not affect the strong alliance between the united states and japan . " as an extremely well-balanced secretary of state , he did a great job , " he said of powell . australian foreign minister alexander downer said powell had been a great friend to australia who helped fight terrorism in asia . " we will certainly miss him , " he said . powell is the son of jamaican immigrants who rose to become a four star general and then the highest ranking african american to serve in the us government .
as rice is also a black the changeover will again be a first in us administration history . timing unexpected the timing of the resignation announcement was unexpected , as powell plans to visit the middle east after the death of palestinian patriarch yasser arafat . the palestinians ' foreign minister , nabil shaath , said powell would visit next week .
the state department said no date had been set . powell , scheduled to attend an asian economic summit in chile this week , a conference on iraq in egypt next week and perhaps a spate of european meetings in december , denied his resignation would affect his work . " i expect to act fully as secretary of state until i do leave .
i will be working hard until the very , very end , " he told reporters . as head of the joint chiefs of staff , powell was the military architect of the 1991 gulf war effort to force iraqi forces out of kuwait .
he saw a turbulent four years as secretary of state marked by the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks and the iraq invasion . internal clashes pursuing a pragmatic policy of multilateral diplomacy , powell reportedly clashed frequently with administration hardliners such as vice president dick cheney and defense secretary donald rumsfeld who favored pre-emptive military action . but he refused to talk publicly about the tensions or his future intentions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell during the feb .

top designer says world cup design " just embarrassing " when baring it all is not enough could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ? current affairs -pipe- 16.11.2004 a mascot for all seasons ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo enjoys his time in the sun but how will history remember him ?
goleo the lion was revealed as the official mascot for the 2006 world cup this weekend .
while fame and fortune beckons for the face of the soccer spectacular , goleo will find out it 's not all furry handshakes and waving . with great power comes great responsibility , something goleo - the newly revealed official mascot of the 2006 world cup - will soon learn .
the tall and imposing , although very approachable looking , lion becomes the latest in a long line of fake animals to become the figurehead of a major sporting event .
goleo will spend the next 18 months preparing for the global soccer showcase in germany , where he will stir the crowded stadiums and inspire millions of spectators around the world .
during that time , goleo 's face will become synonymous with the world cup in germany and the harmonious message of fair play that will no doubt be promoted throughout the entirety of the month-long tournament .
global superstardom and worldwide recognition awaits him .
he looks happy enough , but is he ready ?
such a high profile position comes with its own set of intense pressures .
goleo will not even be able to enjoy a quiet gazelle without a pack of paparazzi snappers being on hand to record his every bite and maul .
so what can the mascot of the 2006 world cup expect ?
if everything goes right , goleo could be the next misha the bear .
the mascot of the olympic games of 1980 went on to become one of the best loved and most marketable figureheads in sporting history , so much so that many people forget the us boycott of the moscow games - in protest of the december 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan - and remember them for the cute little teddy bear who even cried at the closing ceremony .
memorable misha endures misha 's tale should give the german lion some hope .
regardless of how well his countrymen perform at the world cup , goleo could still come out of the tournament smelling of roses .
a successful stint as the face of the 2006 tournament could bode well for a future career away from the sporting spotlight .
goleo may want to look to the example set by english soccer team hartlepool united 's h 'angus the monkey .
the all-singing , all-dancing mascot of the yorkshire club enjoyed a long career aping around for the hartlepool faithful and made such an impression on the town that in may 2002 , he was elected town mayor .
but while the world may be an oyster - or in goleo 's case , a wildebeest - for the successful mascot , there are pitfalls .
as with any celebrity , there are temptations for the sporting mascot , such as unscrupulous types waiting to accelerate their downfall for their own gains by exploiting any furry foot put wrong .
the seedier side of the mascot life is just a flip of the coin away .
when fake animals attack take wolfie , the mascot of another english soccer team , wolverhampton wanderers .
wolfie used to rally the crowds with playful and endearing kick-arounds with the opposing mascots before his team took to the pitch .
that is until the arrival of bristol city 's three little pigs .
in front of a television audience of millions , wolfie lost his cool in the pre-match contest and ended up battling all three pigs in a pitch-side punch-up .
needless to say , he never worked in that town again .
as the only official mascot of the world cup , goleo may not have any rivals to face and so potential fisticuffs should be avoided .
but even if he keeps his cold , wet nose clean , goleo must go into this new phase with his eyes open to the realities .
a mascot 's shelf life is a tangible one .
fame and fortune are assured in the run-up to the event and during it , but only the most endearing mascots linger in the memory when the glory fades .
the " aah " factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take the recent athens summer olympic games .
can anyone name the two asexual triangles that passed as the event 's co-mascots ?
well , they were phevos and athena , the siblings named after greek gods who represented the link between greek history and the modern olympic games .
the cumbersome and non-cuddly icons drew more baffled looks and questions than adoration this summer .
however , they contributed to the $ 81 million -lrb- € 63 million -rrb- or so that athens merchandising generated .
their success was assured mainly due to the usual ploy of covering everything from baby bonnets to thongs in their images .
if you wanted anything olympic , you had to have phevos and athena on it .
but despite this , it is unlikely that they will be the enduring memory of the games .
they did n't have that cute " aah " factor that mascots who want to live on need .
in portugal , the super-human wunderkind kinas , the mascot for the european soccer championships this summer , has also sunk without a trace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kinas , " the euro 2004 european soccer championship mascot .
the boy who was supposed to " embody the enthusiasm , skill , determination and sense of fun that make football the greatest sport on earth " has rarely been seen since and must be cursing his luck that he was chosen to front a tournament which would provide one of the greatest shocks in soccer history .
germany 's goleo may have an advantage .
he is a cuddly , eight-foot -lrb- 2.4 meter -rrb- tall lion with a touch of " sesame street " about him and not some cartoon child or a geometric shape with big feet .
but even a moth-eaten , threadbare misha will tell him to enjoy the good times when they come because the light of the mascot burns fast and bright but can fade just as quickly . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing the world cup into the schools in the run-up to the 2006 world cup in germany , a new project headed by national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann aims to teach kids how to think globally and about the importance of good sportsmanship .

its job is made harder by the lack of cohesion between many european institutions and organizations . human trafficking , computer crime and terrorism are just some of the crimes dealt with by eurojust , the eu authority charged with the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border and organized crime .
in addition to the specific crime areas , there are also the individual cases which flood in from all 25 member states in the european union to be dealt with .
as a body established as recently as 2002 to enhance the effectiveness of collective crime fighting , and one which has more than 1000 live cases on its books , eurojust could well claim to be one of the busiest and overwhelmed departments in the eu .
behind kilometers of razor wire , security checks and armored doors , the headquarters of eurojust in the hague is one of the most secure places in the eu .
in contrast to the heavily guarded surroundings , it also one of the most open ; welcoming magistrates , public prosecutors and secret service agents from around the bloc every month for discussions and consultations .
a forum for investigation and prosecution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurojust brings security institutions and legal teams together in an attempt to open up dialogue and create a wider network of collaborative crime prevention across the eu .
everything from organized crime to international terrorism comes to the conference table in a sign that this type collaboration has become the single most important factor in the fight against crime .
and on the surface , it appears to be working .
" there has been a case where the italians and the germans were pursuing the same criminal at the same time in drug trafficking case , " german eurojust representative hermann von langsdorff told deutsche welle .
" in this instance , the germans were about to make an arrest and the italians came to us and asked if we could persuade the germans to hold off .
they waited for one week only and as a result the whole drug ring was smashed and many arrests made . "
despite such successes , not everything works as smoothly .
von langsdorff , who works with 24 other national representatives in mediating between public prosecutor 's offices all across europe , admitted that sometimes the influx of cases is too much .
" the big problem is that eurojust can only reasonably cope with one institution at a time , " he said .
lack of recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is one of the worst offenders for not offering or accepting help .
but there are also bigger problems .
contradictorily , few member states recognize the work of eurojust .
" for example , we have barely had any coordination requests from germany , " von langsdorff said .
" in 2003 , we received only one and in 2004 , up until now , just three .
in the overall scheme of things , this is too little . "
it is as if sept .
11 , 2001 never happened in most cases .
european public prosecutors continue to sit on vital information regarding terror suspects and some do not even know that eurojust exists and can help in the passing on of vital information , according to von langsdorff .
in the increasingly important fight against international terrorism , more collaboration is needed .
borders closed to exchange of information europe 's borders are open but not always in the eyes of the public prosecutors .
to obtain the right to make searches with foreign colleagues in a bordering country and even to make phone calls to other member states in relation to investigations require special approval .
even von langsdorff and his colleagues at eurojust have their hands tied to a certain extent .
without permission from the member states involved in a case , no results or information can be exchanged without permission .
von langsdorff believes a central data bank could change all this .
" the perfect scenario would be that a phone number discovered during a search in italy could immediately be put in the system and its origin ascertained , whether this number has been linked to terrorists in germany or france , " he said .
however , von langsdorff said he believes the eu is still a long way from that level of cooperation . georg matthes -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .

everything from organized crime to international terrorism comes to the conference table in a sign that this type collaboration has become the single most important factor in the fight against crime .
and on the surface , it appears to be working .
" there has been a case where the italians and the germans were pursuing the same criminal at the same time in drug trafficking case , " german eurojust representative hermann von langsdorff told deutsche welle .
" in this instance , the germans were about to make an arrest and the italians came to us and asked if we could persuade the germans to hold off .
they waited for one week only and as a result the whole drug ring was smashed and many arrests made . "
despite such successes , not everything works as smoothly .
von langsdorff , who works with 24 other national representatives in mediating between public prosecutor 's offices all across europe , admitted that sometimes the influx of cases is too much .
" the big problem is that eurojust can only reasonably cope with one institution at a time , " he said .
lack of recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is one of the worst offenders for not offering or accepting help .
but there are also bigger problems .
contradictorily , few member states recognize the work of eurojust .
" for example , we have barely had any coordination requests from germany , " von langsdorff said .
" in 2003 , we received only one and in 2004 , up until now , just three .
in the overall scheme of things , this is too little . "
it is as if sept .
11 , 2001 never happened in most cases .
european public prosecutors continue to sit on vital information regarding terror suspects and some do not even know that eurojust exists and can help in the passing on of vital information , according to von langsdorff .
in the increasingly important fight against international terrorism , more collaboration is needed .
borders closed to exchange of information europe 's borders are open but not always in the eyes of the public prosecutors .
to obtain the right to make searches with foreign colleagues in a bordering country and even to make phone calls to other member states in relation to investigations require special approval .
even von langsdorff and his colleagues at eurojust have their hands tied to a certain extent .
without permission from the member states involved in a case , no results or information can be exchanged without permission .
von langsdorff believes a central data bank could change all this .
" the perfect scenario would be that a phone number discovered during a search in italy could immediately be put in the system and its origin ascertained , whether this number has been linked to terrorists in germany or france , " he said .
however , von langsdorff said he believes the eu is still a long way from that level of cooperation . georg matthes -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .

space rockets typically carry tonnes of chemical fuel , which thus crimps the size of the payload . so much fuel has been saved that smart-1 will be placed in a closer approach to the moon for the scientific phase of the mission . " the performance -lsb- of the motor -rsb- has been better than we expected , " said giorgio saccoccia , head of esa propulsion division .
" we would certainly want to have it onboard in the future . " it is only the second time that ion propulsion has been used as a space mission 's primary propulsion system .
the first was nasa 's deep space 1 probe , launched in october 1998 . scanning the moon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after achieving its final orbit on jan .
13 , 2005 , smart-1 will start a six-month scan of the moon , using a big payload of sensors that are also a test bench of miniaturization . one of the spacecraft 's tasks is to check out hopes that deep craters near the moon 's poles may harbour water ice , a discovery that would be a huge boost for setting up a human settlement . and it will also explore theories as to the origin of the moon . the prevailing notion is that the moon was born from the earth - a mass of terrestrial mantle that was smashed away when earth was hit by a mars-sized object in the infancy of the solar system . this mass of rock and debris then re-condensed to become earth 's satellite , according to this theory . " with our x-ray eyes , we want to trace the moon 's beginnings , " said bernard foing , smart-1 project scientist . much is already known about the moon , thanks to robot craft and the manned us missions of the early sixties and seventies , but scientists say there are also many unknowns . smart-1 is the first in a flotilla of unmanned probes to earth 's companion .

just as the murder in sarajevo once began wwi , so has the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh been depicted by self-described terrorism or islam experts -lrb- the two fit together so wonderfully nowadays -rrb- as the first shot in the so-called " clash of civilizations " .
it is a clash that will no longer be waged with words , but with weapons , and where the future power structures in europe are at stake . a writer in the conservative daily , die welt , writes that fundamental muslims " strive for the reestablishment of an islamic order in accordance with the original islam of the 7th century which , according to them , is the only legitimate state and society .
this should replace other systems . " in the same newspaper , the islam critic hans-peter raddatz writes that " the state allows extremists to create networks under the protection of the so-called dialogue , the beneficiaries of which have only one goal : to live in accordance to their own rules and cancel out the constitutional state . " fanatics are everywhere just as bad , if less so , was the opinion of other " experts " , who have been calling for tolerance and liberalism since the amsterdam murder while at the same time saying that a reason for the violence is that holland let in too many muslims - with a little less than a million , still a higher per capita count than in germany . can you declare liberalism and tolerance for dead just because one fanatic committed a ghastly murder and because he became a fanatic in a radical muslim community ? as unsatisfying as this sounds : things like that can happen - in every country .
there are fanatics everywhere ; especially in these times , where religion is increasingly being misused for political purposes . differences should be respected in opposition to the rhetoric since the van gogh murder the only solution can be the continued integration of those of other faiths - and not just muslims .
integration also should not mean giving up one 's identity . differences should be respected .
but they should align themselves under the still-generous european constitutional system .
those that want to live here need to obey the societal and democratic system otherwise they will continually be out of place . but this system needs to deal with " the others " with as much freedom , liberality and tolerance for which the pessimists are criticizing holland . art has its borders these critics do n't address the fact that the director , through a well-intended but visually provocative film , deeply hurt the feelings of faithful muslims .
it is no justification for violence , but as the worldwide debate over the jesus film -lrb- mel gibson 's " the passion " -rrb- and other cases showed , art can and is n't borderless , because it always finds its border with the other person 's freedom . if liberalism and tolerance have failed anywhere , then it is here . peter philipp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe faces new integration challenges the current wave of violence against muslims in the netherlands has forced all of europe to stop and examine the problems of integration .
many worry that what the dutch are now facing could soon be an eu-wide reality .

its job is made harder by the lack of cohesion between many european institutions and organizations . human trafficking , computer crime and terrorism are just some of the crimes dealt with by eurojust , the eu authority charged with the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border and organized crime .
in addition to the specific crime areas , there are also the individual cases which flood in from all 25 member states in the european union to be dealt with .
as a body established as recently as 2002 to enhance the effectiveness of collective crime fighting , and one which has more than 1000 live cases on its books , eurojust could well claim to be one of the busiest and overwhelmed departments in the eu .
behind kilometers of razor wire , security checks and armored doors , the headquarters of eurojust in the hague is one of the most secure places in the eu .

" there has been a case where the italians and the germans were pursuing the same criminal at the same time in drug trafficking case , " german eurojust representative hermann von langsdorff told deutsche welle .
" in this instance , the germans were about to make an arrest and the italians came to us and asked if we could persuade the germans to hold off .
they waited for one week only and as a result the whole drug ring was smashed and many arrests made . "
despite such successes , not everything works as smoothly .
von langsdorff , who works with 24 other national representatives in mediating between public prosecutor 's offices all across europe , admitted that sometimes the influx of cases is too much .
" the big problem is that eurojust can only reasonably cope with one institution at a time , " he said .
lack of recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is one of the worst offenders for not offering or accepting help .

european public prosecutors continue to sit on vital information regarding terror suspects and some do not even know that eurojust exists and can help in the passing on of vital information , according to von langsdorff .

borders closed to exchange of information europe 's borders are open but not always in the eyes of the public prosecutors .
to obtain the right to make searches with foreign colleagues in a bordering country and even to make phone calls to other member states in relation to investigations require special approval .

without permission from the member states involved in a case , no results or information can be exchanged without permission .
von langsdorff believes a central data bank could change all this .
" the perfect scenario would be that a phone number discovered during a search in italy could immediately be put in the system and its origin ascertained , whether this number has been linked to terrorists in germany or france , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.11.2004 fighting crime and bureaucracy in the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cooperation between eu forces is an achievable , but complicated , dream eurojust , the eu body set up to investigate serious cross-border crime in the member states , faces a mountain of work .
its job is made harder by the lack of cohesion between many european institutions and organizations . human trafficking , computer crime and terrorism are just some of the crimes dealt with by eurojust , the eu authority charged with the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border and organized crime .
in addition to the specific crime areas , there are also the individual cases which flood in from all 25 member states in the european union to be dealt with .
as a body established as recently as 2002 to enhance the effectiveness of collective crime fighting , and one which has more than 1000 live cases on its books , eurojust could well claim to be one of the busiest and overwhelmed departments in the eu .
behind kilometers of razor wire , security checks and armored doors , the headquarters of eurojust in the hague is one of the most secure places in the eu .
in contrast to the heavily guarded surroundings , it also one of the most open ; welcoming magistrates , public prosecutors and secret service agents from around the bloc every month for discussions and consultations .
a forum for investigation and prosecution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurojust brings security institutions and legal teams together in an attempt to open up dialogue and create a wider network of collaborative crime prevention across the eu .
everything from organized crime to international terrorism comes to the conference table in a sign that this type collaboration has become the single most important factor in the fight against crime .
and on the surface , it appears to be working .
" there has been a case where the italians and the germans were pursuing the same criminal at the same time in drug trafficking case , " german eurojust representative hermann von langsdorff told deutsche welle .
" in this instance , the germans were about to make an arrest and the italians came to us and asked if we could persuade the germans to hold off .
they waited for one week only and as a result the whole drug ring was smashed and many arrests made . "
despite such successes , not everything works as smoothly .
von langsdorff , who works with 24 other national representatives in mediating between public prosecutor 's offices all across europe , admitted that sometimes the influx of cases is too much .
" the big problem is that eurojust can only reasonably cope with one institution at a time , " he said .
lack of recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is one of the worst offenders for not offering or accepting help .
but there are also bigger problems .
contradictorily , few member states recognize the work of eurojust .
" for example , we have barely had any coordination requests from germany , " von langsdorff said .
" in 2003 , we received only one and in 2004 , up until now , just three .
in the overall scheme of things , this is too little . "
it is as if sept .
11 , 2001 never happened in most cases .
european public prosecutors continue to sit on vital information regarding terror suspects and some do not even know that eurojust exists and can help in the passing on of vital information , according to von langsdorff .
in the increasingly important fight against international terrorism , more collaboration is needed .
borders closed to exchange of information europe 's borders are open but not always in the eyes of the public prosecutors .
to obtain the right to make searches with foreign colleagues in a bordering country and even to make phone calls to other member states in relation to investigations require special approval .
even von langsdorff and his colleagues at eurojust have their hands tied to a certain extent .
without permission from the member states involved in a case , no results or information can be exchanged without permission .
von langsdorff believes a central data bank could change all this .
" the perfect scenario would be that a phone number discovered during a search in italy could immediately be put in the system and its origin ascertained , whether this number has been linked to terrorists in germany or france , " he said .
however , von langsdorff said he believes the eu is still a long way from that level of cooperation . georg matthes -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.11.2004 row over plan for german in mosques großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would have moslems pray in german a proposal for the enforcement of german as a spoken language in mosques has erupted in germany as politicians look for ways to reform the country 's integration policy in the wake of violence in the netherlands . a regional politician 's proposal that prayers in german mosques should be said in german was greeted with dismay on monday amid fears that anti-muslim attacks may spread over the border from the netherlands .
annette schavan , the christian democratic education minister for the state of baden-württemberg and a contender for the state 's premiership , made her radical proposal at the weekend because , she said , " we can no longer accept that prayers in mosques should be said in languages that can not be understood outside the muslim community . "
schavan 's proposal comes in the wake of the torching of mosques , schools and churches in the netherlands following the killing of film director theo van gogh , whose work was strongly critical of muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her suggestion drew a sharp reaction from the leaders of the more than two and a half million turks who live in germany .
" this is nonsense - terror can be spread in any language , " said kenan kolat , the co-president of the turkish community in germany .
cornelie sonntag-wolgast , a representative of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on the national parliamentary committee for domestic affairs also criticized the proposal .
" we can not suspect each and every person ... of violence just because they say their prayers in arabic , " said sonntag-wolgast .
volker beck , a spokesman for the greens , the junior partner in the governing coalition , said schavan 's proposal was " completely exaggerated " while liberal fdp interior minister max stadler criticized schavan , saying her proposal for the state to enforce the german language in mosques was " an offense against basic law . "
werner schiffauer , a cultural professor said , schavan 's plan was " out-of-touch and impractical " , a view supported by jürgen micksch , the chairperson of the intercultural council in germany .
professor schiffauer stated that there was little money available to provide language training for the large numbers of islamic preachers in germany and that , in addition , many foreigners living in germany stayed for only a short time and were dependent on mother-tongue services while they were there .
some support idea however , nadeem elyas , the chairman for the central council of muslims in germany , agreed with the proposal .
elyas explained that a lot of mosques already translate their prayers and sermons and offer simultaneous audio feeds in both arabic and german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mosque in berlin neukölln .
the council , he said , is made up of 19 organizations and about 500 mosque municipalities in germany , not all of which cater for purely arabic speakers .
elyas added that german , turkish , arabian , albanian , bosnian and persian muslims all worship in germany and many have different language requirements .
call for islamic holiday the row over schaven 's proposal comes at a time when germany seems desperate to define its integration policy and avoid copycat violence spreading across the border from the neighboring netherlands .
just a day after schaven 's proposal was revealed , a member of the green party in germany called for the government to install an official islamic holiday in the german calendar .

annette schavan , the christian democratic education minister for the state of baden-württemberg and a contender for the state 's premiership , made her radical proposal at the weekend because , she said , " we can no longer accept that prayers in mosques should be said in languages that can not be understood outside the muslim community . "
schavan 's proposal comes in the wake of the torching of mosques , schools and churches in the netherlands following the killing of film director theo van gogh , whose work was strongly critical of muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her suggestion drew a sharp reaction from the leaders of the more than two and a half million turks who live in germany .
" this is nonsense - terror can be spread in any language , " said kenan kolat , the co-president of the turkish community in germany .
cornelie sonntag-wolgast , a representative of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on the national parliamentary committee for domestic affairs also criticized the proposal .
" we can not suspect each and every person ... of violence just because they say their prayers in arabic , " said sonntag-wolgast .
volker beck , a spokesman for the greens , the junior partner in the governing coalition , said schavan 's proposal was " completely exaggerated " while liberal fdp interior minister max stadler criticized schavan , saying her proposal for the state to enforce the german language in mosques was " an offense against basic law . "
werner schiffauer , a cultural professor said , schavan 's plan was " out-of-touch and impractical " , a view supported by jürgen micksch , the chairperson of the intercultural council in germany .
professor schiffauer stated that there was little money available to provide language training for the large numbers of islamic preachers in germany and that , in addition , many foreigners living in germany stayed for only a short time and were dependent on mother-tongue services while they were there .
some support idea however , nadeem elyas , the chairman for the central council of muslims in germany , agreed with the proposal .
elyas explained that a lot of mosques already translate their prayers and sermons and offer simultaneous audio feeds in both arabic and german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mosque in berlin neukölln .
the council , he said , is made up of 19 organizations and about 500 mosque municipalities in germany , not all of which cater for purely arabic speakers .
elyas added that german , turkish , arabian , albanian , bosnian and persian muslims all worship in germany and many have different language requirements .
call for islamic holiday the row over schaven 's proposal comes at a time when germany seems desperate to define its integration policy and avoid copycat violence spreading across the border from the neighboring netherlands .
just a day after schaven 's proposal was revealed , a member of the green party in germany called for the government to install an official islamic holiday in the german calendar .

the most controversial was italian conservative rocco buttiglione , who came up against strong resistance for his views on homosexuality and marriage .
but he is not the only one . on tuesday , the hungarian candidate , sixty-five year old laszlo kovacs has the chance to prove his worth for the customs and taxation portfolio .
he was originally nominated as energy commissioner , but performed disastrously at this first hearing in front of the parliament last month , astounding members of the parliament with his lack of knowledge on even basic matters . " from the academic point of view , i was probably wrong when i tried to define what i think of hydrogen , but i 'm to say i 'm not an academic , and not even an energy expert , " kovacs said after the hearing . should he stay or should he go although kovacs has managed to avoid the fate of buttiglione , janis emmanouilidis , an expert in european affairs at the centre for applied policy research in munich , said he believes hungary should have replaced kovacs . " there was a strong pressure to have him withdrawn , but the government in hungary strongly supported his nomination and did n't withdraw him , " he told dw-radio .
" i believe that because many parliamentarians , not only from the christian democrats but also from the socialist group , criticized him concerning his knowledge of the matter , it might have been a wise decision to have him withdrawn . " kovacs , who is the former hungarian minister for foreign affairs , is expected to face difficult questions on economics and currency , as well as domestic market and consumer protection matters .
the hearing is likely to be gruelling as parliamentarians feel that eu member states are n't take the nomination process seriously . " the european parliament is looking at its rights and exploiting its rights , " emmanouilidis said .
" it is looking for new areas to show the two other institutions in the eu that the parliament has a strong say . " the voice of experience however , he also said he believes that kovacs will bring some political know-how to the commission . " he 's one of a few politicians in the new member states with significant experience , " he said .
" he has a lot to offer from a political point of view , but concerning his technical knowledge in certain policy areas , he might be less strong . " the parliament ca n't refuse individual commissioners , only the entire commission , which means that kovac 's nomination is probably in the bag .

they said the announcement would come on tuesday . bush plans to turn to deputy national security adviser stephen hadley to replace rice , who is one of the president 's closest advisers and confidants , said the officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity . rice , who was 50 on sunday , has been tipped for months as a leading contender to succeed powell .

just as the murder in sarajevo once began wwi , so has the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh been depicted by self-described terrorism or islam experts -lrb- the two fit together so wonderfully nowadays -rrb- as the first shot in the so-called " clash of civilizations " .
it is a clash that will no longer be waged with words , but with weapons , and where the future power structures in europe are at stake . a writer in the conservative daily , die welt , writes that fundamental muslims " strive for the reestablishment of an islamic order in accordance with the original islam of the 7th century which , according to them , is the only legitimate state and society .
this should replace other systems . " in the same newspaper , the islam critic hans-peter raddatz writes that " the state allows extremists to create networks under the protection of the so-called dialogue , the beneficiaries of which have only one goal : to live in accordance to their own rules and cancel out the constitutional state . " fanatics are everywhere just as bad , if less so , was the opinion of other " experts " , who have been calling for tolerance and liberalism since the amsterdam murder while at the same time saying that a reason for the violence is that holland let in too many muslims - with a little less than a million , still a higher per capita count than in germany . can you declare liberalism and tolerance for dead just because one fanatic committed a ghastly murder and because he became a fanatic in a radical muslim community ? as unsatisfying as this sounds : things like that can happen - in every country .
there are fanatics everywhere ; especially in these times , where religion is increasingly being misused for political purposes . differences should be respected in opposition to the rhetoric since the van gogh murder the only solution can be the continued integration of those of other faiths - and not just muslims .
integration also should not mean giving up one 's identity . differences should be respected .
but they should align themselves under the still-generous european constitutional system .
those that want to live here need to obey the societal and democratic system otherwise they will continually be out of place . but this system needs to deal with " the others " with as much freedom , liberality and tolerance for which the pessimists are criticizing holland . art has its borders these critics do n't address the fact that the director , through a well-intended but visually provocative film , deeply hurt the feelings of faithful muslims .
it is no justification for violence , but as the worldwide debate over the jesus film -lrb- mel gibson 's " the passion " -rrb- and other cases showed , art can and is n't borderless , because it always finds its border with the other person 's freedom . if liberalism and tolerance have failed anywhere , then it is here . peter philipp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe faces new integration challenges the current wave of violence against muslims in the netherlands has forced all of europe to stop and examine the problems of integration .

" fanatics are everywhere just as bad , if less so , was the opinion of other " experts " , who have been calling for tolerance and liberalism since the amsterdam murder while at the same time saying that a reason for the violence is that holland let in too many muslims - with a little less than a million , still a higher per capita count than in germany . can you declare liberalism and tolerance for dead just because one fanatic committed a ghastly murder and because he became a fanatic in a radical muslim community ? as unsatisfying as this sounds : things like that can happen - in every country .
there are fanatics everywhere ; especially in these times , where religion is increasingly being misused for political purposes . differences should be respected in opposition to the rhetoric since the van gogh murder the only solution can be the continued integration of those of other faiths - and not just muslims .
integration also should not mean giving up one 's identity . differences should be respected .
but they should align themselves under the still-generous european constitutional system .
those that want to live here need to obey the societal and democratic system otherwise they will continually be out of place . but this system needs to deal with " the others " with as much freedom , liberality and tolerance for which the pessimists are criticizing holland . art has its borders these critics do n't address the fact that the director , through a well-intended but visually provocative film , deeply hurt the feelings of faithful muslims .
it is no justification for violence , but as the worldwide debate over the jesus film -lrb- mel gibson 's " the passion " -rrb- and other cases showed , art can and is n't borderless , because it always finds its border with the other person 's freedom . if liberalism and tolerance have failed anywhere , then it is here . peter philipp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe faces new integration challenges the current wave of violence against muslims in the netherlands has forced all of europe to stop and examine the problems of integration .

with new threats emerging , they 're meeting in germany on tuesday to plan for the future . next year , the alpine convention , a regional agreement for the protection and sustainable development of the alps , will celebrate its 10th anniversary .
but in the decade since european countries with part of their territory in the alps made a great leap forward and agreed to work together to find common solutions for common problems , critics say preservation efforts have not gone far enough .
meanwhile , a host of emerging threats demand urgent attention .
environment ministers meet in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch-partenkirchen sits right near the german alps in southern bavaria on tuesday , the environmental ministers of the seven permanent members of the convention , led by germany , the current chair , will meet in garmisch-partenkirchen , germany for the eighth alpine conference .
they 'll assess their successes and set out an ambitious plan for the region , a rich and diverse area encompassing 190,287 square kilometres with a population of more than 13 million .
but with the alpine convention remaining a non-binding framework with , until now , no permanent secretariat , it remains to be seen if it has the political muscle to get the job done .
regional thinking a good start with the growth of the environmental movement in the 1960 's and 1970 's an increased awareness of the threats facing the alps developed , and preservationists lobbied hard for a collective approach .
after years of wrangling , the alpine convention went into force in march of 1995 .
a framework agreement between seven european countries , it set out to limit environmental degradation by harmonizing economic and environmental policies in the region .
thus , with 13 protocols , including ones related to air and water pollution , the convention 's greatest initial achievement was that it promoted a regional way of thinking where highly territorial national policies once prevailed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morteratsch glacier in switzerland has been melting at a rapid pace .
" the alpine convention increased the realization that the alps need to be treated as a region and the participants need to develop a regional way of thinking , " martin price , director of the center for mountain studies at perth college in great britain and the former chairman of the european mountain forum told dw-world .
andreas götz , the director of the international commission for the protection of the alps -lrb- cipra -rrb- agreed .
" the main thing is that a regional consciousness developed , " he told dw-world .
initial success gives way to stalled agenda in the years since it went into force , the alpine convention has not been without its successes .
a network of protected areas was created , as well as an international scientific commission for alpine research , based in bern , to study environmental threats and possible solutions .
what 's more , related initiatives , such as the alliance in the alps , founded by cipra , encouraged individual regions to share information and best practices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a paraglider is flying in front of the alps down from the brauneck mountain near bad tölz in southern germany .
but after an initial flutter of activity , some say efforts have stalled .
though lots of data was collected and inter-regional relationships were forged , the tough issues - inter-state transportation , the effects of global warming , the impactof depopulation - have not been directly tackled .
" the easier issues have been solved first and the more difficult ones left until later , " price said .
meeting to jumpstart agenda ?
at the meeting in germany on tuesday , the ministers are expected to announce a six-year plan to breath new life into the convention , and the creation of a permanent secretariat based in innsbruck to oversee the revised agenda and the establishment of a monitoring mechanism to chart progress will be announced .
likewise , cipra has launched a " future of the alps " initiative , which it hopes will - on a grass roots basis - help speed up the adaptation of the individual protocols .
" we do not have a lack of knowledge , " wolfgang pfefforkorn , the director of the future of the alps initiative , told dw-world .
" we have a lack of the implementation . "
a more results-oriented agenda , with a regular " state of the alps " report would be a good start , werner baetzing , an expert in alpine research at the university of erlangen in germany told dw-world .
new ski resorts threaten highest peaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steeple of the church in the liechtenstein village of triesenberg is seen in front of the alvierkette mountain chain in the swiss alps .
a renewed commitment to alpine preservation could not come at a better time .
new threats are emerging , illustrating the alps delicate state .
chief among them : global warming , which will affect the region in a number of different ways , including , possibly precipitating the end of ski-related tourism .
according to a report released last year by the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , up to half of all alpine ski resorts in france , austria and switzerland may be forced to close over the next fifty years if current global warming trends continue and the snowline rises another 300 meters to 1800 meters above sea level .
in response , the owners of the threatened resorts are looking to build so-called " second generation ski resorts " above the revised snowline among the alps ' highest peeks and glaciers despite strict laws preventing further development .
in may , in the tirol , they succeeded .
the local government ruled to relax the law , paving the way for two major projects .
michel revaz , the deputy director of cipra told dw-world that he is worried the move will spark a dangerous game one upmanship among european ski resorts .
" now that it 's happened in austria , all the others will want to do the same , " he told dw-world .
he would prefer to see the affected regions look for an alternatives to ski tourism , rather than colonizing the alps remaining pristine peaks .
convention a model to learn from bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ski jumper sven hannawald soars in front of the zugspitze mountain ridge in the case of global warming and ski tourism , and a number of other areas , the benefits of a regional approach are many .
on tuesday , the members of the alpine convention will be looking to build on past successes and put bite into a decade-old agreement .
the future of a region representative of many people 's picture of europe hangs in the balance .
on the plus side , experts say that when it comes to the preservation of mountain regions , europe is leading the way and setting an excellent example for other mountain areas around the world struggling with similar issues .
" maybe it 's not the model to follow , " price said .
" but it 's the model to learn from .

but in the decade since european countries with part of their territory in the alps made a great leap forward and agreed to work together to find common solutions for common problems , critics say preservation efforts have not gone far enough .
meanwhile , a host of emerging threats demand urgent attention .
environment ministers meet in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch-partenkirchen sits right near the german alps in southern bavaria on tuesday , the environmental ministers of the seven permanent members of the convention , led by germany , the current chair , will meet in garmisch-partenkirchen , germany for the eighth alpine conference .
they 'll assess their successes and set out an ambitious plan for the region , a rich and diverse area encompassing 190,287 square kilometres with a population of more than 13 million .
but with the alpine convention remaining a non-binding framework with , until now , no permanent secretariat , it remains to be seen if it has the political muscle to get the job done .
regional thinking a good start with the growth of the environmental movement in the 1960 's and 1970 's an increased awareness of the threats facing the alps developed , and preservationists lobbied hard for a collective approach .
after years of wrangling , the alpine convention went into force in march of 1995 .
a framework agreement between seven european countries , it set out to limit environmental degradation by harmonizing economic and environmental policies in the region .
thus , with 13 protocols , including ones related to air and water pollution , the convention 's greatest initial achievement was that it promoted a regional way of thinking where highly territorial national policies once prevailed .

" the alpine convention increased the realization that the alps need to be treated as a region and the participants need to develop a regional way of thinking , " martin price , director of the center for mountain studies at perth college in great britain and the former chairman of the european mountain forum told dw-world .
andreas götz , the director of the international commission for the protection of the alps -lrb- cipra -rrb- agreed .
" the main thing is that a regional consciousness developed , " he told dw-world .
initial success gives way to stalled agenda in the years since it went into force , the alpine convention has not been without its successes .
a network of protected areas was created , as well as an international scientific commission for alpine research , based in bern , to study environmental threats and possible solutions .
what 's more , related initiatives , such as the alliance in the alps , founded by cipra , encouraged individual regions to share information and best practices .

though lots of data was collected and inter-regional relationships were forged , the tough issues - inter-state transportation , the effects of global warming , the impactof depopulation - have not been directly tackled .
" the easier issues have been solved first and the more difficult ones left until later , " price said .
meeting to jumpstart agenda ?
at the meeting in germany on tuesday , the ministers are expected to announce a six-year plan to breath new life into the convention , and the creation of a permanent secretariat based in innsbruck to oversee the revised agenda and the establishment of a monitoring mechanism to chart progress will be announced .
likewise , cipra has launched a " future of the alps " initiative , which it hopes will - on a grass roots basis - help speed up the adaptation of the individual protocols .
" we do not have a lack of knowledge , " wolfgang pfefforkorn , the director of the future of the alps initiative , told dw-world .
" we have a lack of the implementation . "
a more results-oriented agenda , with a regular " state of the alps " report would be a good start , werner baetzing , an expert in alpine research at the university of erlangen in germany told dw-world .

a renewed commitment to alpine preservation could not come at a better time .
new threats are emerging , illustrating the alps delicate state .
chief among them : global warming , which will affect the region in a number of different ways , including , possibly precipitating the end of ski-related tourism .
according to a report released last year by the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , up to half of all alpine ski resorts in france , austria and switzerland may be forced to close over the next fifty years if current global warming trends continue and the snowline rises another 300 meters to 1800 meters above sea level .
in response , the owners of the threatened resorts are looking to build so-called " second generation ski resorts " above the revised snowline among the alps ' highest peeks and glaciers despite strict laws preventing further development .
in may , in the tirol , they succeeded .
the local government ruled to relax the law , paving the way for two major projects .
michel revaz , the deputy director of cipra told dw-world that he is worried the move will spark a dangerous game one upmanship among european ski resorts .
" now that it 's happened in austria , all the others will want to do the same , " he told dw-world .
he would prefer to see the affected regions look for an alternatives to ski tourism , rather than colonizing the alps remaining pristine peaks .

the future of a region representative of many people 's picture of europe hangs in the balance .
on the plus side , experts say that when it comes to the preservation of mountain regions , europe is leading the way and setting an excellent example for other mountain areas around the world struggling with similar issues .

with new threats emerging , they 're meeting in germany on tuesday to plan for the future . next year , the alpine convention , a regional agreement for the protection and sustainable development of the alps , will celebrate its 10th anniversary .
but in the decade since european countries with part of their territory in the alps made a great leap forward and agreed to work together to find common solutions for common problems , critics say preservation efforts have not gone far enough .
meanwhile , a host of emerging threats demand urgent attention .
environment ministers meet in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch-partenkirchen sits right near the german alps in southern bavaria on tuesday , the environmental ministers of the seven permanent members of the convention , led by germany , the current chair , will meet in garmisch-partenkirchen , germany for the eighth alpine conference .
they 'll assess their successes and set out an ambitious plan for the region , a rich and diverse area encompassing 190,287 square kilometres with a population of more than 13 million .
but with the alpine convention remaining a non-binding framework with , until now , no permanent secretariat , it remains to be seen if it has the political muscle to get the job done .
regional thinking a good start with the growth of the environmental movement in the 1960 's and 1970 's an increased awareness of the threats facing the alps developed , and preservationists lobbied hard for a collective approach .
after years of wrangling , the alpine convention went into force in march of 1995 .
a framework agreement between seven european countries , it set out to limit environmental degradation by harmonizing economic and environmental policies in the region .
thus , with 13 protocols , including ones related to air and water pollution , the convention 's greatest initial achievement was that it promoted a regional way of thinking where highly territorial national policies once prevailed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morteratsch glacier in switzerland has been melting at a rapid pace .
" the alpine convention increased the realization that the alps need to be treated as a region and the participants need to develop a regional way of thinking , " martin price , director of the center for mountain studies at perth college in great britain and the former chairman of the european mountain forum told dw-world .
andreas götz , the director of the international commission for the protection of the alps -lrb- cipra -rrb- agreed .
" the main thing is that a regional consciousness developed , " he told dw-world .
initial success gives way to stalled agenda in the years since it went into force , the alpine convention has not been without its successes .
a network of protected areas was created , as well as an international scientific commission for alpine research , based in bern , to study environmental threats and possible solutions .
what 's more , related initiatives , such as the alliance in the alps , founded by cipra , encouraged individual regions to share information and best practices .

goleo the lion was revealed as the official mascot for the 2006 world cup this weekend .
while fame and fortune beckons for the face of the soccer spectacular , goleo will find out it 's not all furry handshakes and waving . with great power comes great responsibility , something goleo - the newly revealed official mascot of the 2006 world cup - will soon learn .
the tall and imposing , although very approachable looking , lion becomes the latest in a long line of fake animals to become the figurehead of a major sporting event .
goleo will spend the next 18 months preparing for the global soccer showcase in germany , where he will stir the crowded stadiums and inspire millions of spectators around the world .
during that time , goleo 's face will become synonymous with the world cup in germany and the harmonious message of fair play that will no doubt be promoted throughout the entirety of the month-long tournament .
global superstardom and worldwide recognition awaits him .
he looks happy enough , but is he ready ?
such a high profile position comes with its own set of intense pressures .
goleo will not even be able to enjoy a quiet gazelle without a pack of paparazzi snappers being on hand to record his every bite and maul .
so what can the mascot of the 2006 world cup expect ?
if everything goes right , goleo could be the next misha the bear .
the mascot of the olympic games of 1980 went on to become one of the best loved and most marketable figureheads in sporting history , so much so that many people forget the us boycott of the moscow games - in protest of the december 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan - and remember them for the cute little teddy bear who even cried at the closing ceremony .
memorable misha endures misha 's tale should give the german lion some hope .
regardless of how well his countrymen perform at the world cup , goleo could still come out of the tournament smelling of roses .
a successful stint as the face of the 2006 tournament could bode well for a future career away from the sporting spotlight .
goleo may want to look to the example set by english soccer team hartlepool united 's h 'angus the monkey .
the all-singing , all-dancing mascot of the yorkshire club enjoyed a long career aping around for the hartlepool faithful and made such an impression on the town that in may 2002 , he was elected town mayor .
but while the world may be an oyster - or in goleo 's case , a wildebeest - for the successful mascot , there are pitfalls .
as with any celebrity , there are temptations for the sporting mascot , such as unscrupulous types waiting to accelerate their downfall for their own gains by exploiting any furry foot put wrong .
the seedier side of the mascot life is just a flip of the coin away .

in front of a television audience of millions , wolfie lost his cool in the pre-match contest and ended up battling all three pigs in a pitch-side punch-up .
needless to say , he never worked in that town again .
as the only official mascot of the world cup , goleo may not have any rivals to face and so potential fisticuffs should be avoided .
but even if he keeps his cold , wet nose clean , goleo must go into this new phase with his eyes open to the realities .

goleo the lion was revealed as the official mascot for the 2006 world cup this weekend .
while fame and fortune beckons for the face of the soccer spectacular , goleo will find out it 's not all furry handshakes and waving . with great power comes great responsibility , something goleo - the newly revealed official mascot of the 2006 world cup - will soon learn .
the tall and imposing , although very approachable looking , lion becomes the latest in a long line of fake animals to become the figurehead of a major sporting event .
goleo will spend the next 18 months preparing for the global soccer showcase in germany , where he will stir the crowded stadiums and inspire millions of spectators around the world .
during that time , goleo 's face will become synonymous with the world cup in germany and the harmonious message of fair play that will no doubt be promoted throughout the entirety of the month-long tournament .
global superstardom and worldwide recognition awaits him .
he looks happy enough , but is he ready ?
such a high profile position comes with its own set of intense pressures .
goleo will not even be able to enjoy a quiet gazelle without a pack of paparazzi snappers being on hand to record his every bite and maul .
so what can the mascot of the 2006 world cup expect ?
if everything goes right , goleo could be the next misha the bear .
the mascot of the olympic games of 1980 went on to become one of the best loved and most marketable figureheads in sporting history , so much so that many people forget the us boycott of the moscow games - in protest of the december 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan - and remember them for the cute little teddy bear who even cried at the closing ceremony .
memorable misha endures misha 's tale should give the german lion some hope .
regardless of how well his countrymen perform at the world cup , goleo could still come out of the tournament smelling of roses .
a successful stint as the face of the 2006 tournament could bode well for a future career away from the sporting spotlight .
goleo may want to look to the example set by english soccer team hartlepool united 's h 'angus the monkey .
the all-singing , all-dancing mascot of the yorkshire club enjoyed a long career aping around for the hartlepool faithful and made such an impression on the town that in may 2002 , he was elected town mayor .
but while the world may be an oyster - or in goleo 's case , a wildebeest - for the successful mascot , there are pitfalls .
as with any celebrity , there are temptations for the sporting mascot , such as unscrupulous types waiting to accelerate their downfall for their own gains by exploiting any furry foot put wrong .
the seedier side of the mascot life is just a flip of the coin away .

in front of a television audience of millions , wolfie lost his cool in the pre-match contest and ended up battling all three pigs in a pitch-side punch-up .
needless to say , he never worked in that town again .

" our small genius is ... at the moon , " a delighted southwood declared . the probe achieved lunar orbit at 17:53 gmt on monday , and on tuesday was looping the moon at a height of 5,000-6000 kilometers -lrb- 3,000-3,500 miles -rrb- , smart-1 project manager giuseppe racca said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart-1 will gently spiral closer to the lunar surface , eventually stabilizing in an egg-shaped polar orbit that will vary from 300 kilometers -lrb- 187 miles -rrb- at the south pole to 3,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,870 miles -rrb- at the north pole . the 370-kilo -lrb- 814-pound -rrb- probe has been using a slow but revolutionary form of propulsion , taking it in ever-widening circles around the earth and using terrestrial gravity as a slingshot , to get to the moon . it is powered by an ion engine , which converts solar power into electricity that then charges atoms of the heavy gas xenon . these charged atoms , known as ions , are then disgorged from the back of the probe to give it thrust . slow , but persistent the motor is initially slow - launched on sept .
27 , 2003 , smart-1 took more than 13 months to make a trip achieved in three days by the chemical rockets of the apollo era - but speed gradually builds up in the frictionless environment of space , making ion power ideal for trips into the depths of the solar system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this artist 's rendition released by the european space agency , the european-made smart-1 solar-powered satellite is seen nearing the moon on its way to make the first comprehensive inventory of key chemical elements in the lunar surface .
smart-1 -lrb- photo -rrb- clocked up 332 orbits around earth and travelled more than 84 million kilometers -lrb- 52.5 million miles -rrb- , " a distance comparable to an interplanetary cruise , " esa pointed out in a press statement . it fired its engines 289 times , operating them for a total of about 3,700 hours , and sipped just 59 kilos -lrb- 129.8 pounds -rrb- of its 80 kilos -lrb- 176 pounds -rrb- of xenon gas .
space rockets typically carry tonnes of chemical fuel , which thus crimps the size of the payload . so much fuel has been saved that smart-1 will be placed in a closer approach to the moon for the scientific phase of the mission . " the performance -lsb- of the motor -rsb- has been better than we expected , " said giorgio saccoccia , head of esa propulsion division .
" we would certainly want to have it onboard in the future . " it is only the second time that ion propulsion has been used as a space mission 's primary propulsion system .
the first was nasa 's deep space 1 probe , launched in october 1998 . scanning the moon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after achieving its final orbit on jan .
13 , 2005 , smart-1 will start a six-month scan of the moon , using a big payload of sensors that are also a test bench of miniaturization . one of the spacecraft 's tasks is to check out hopes that deep craters near the moon 's poles may harbour water ice , a discovery that would be a huge boost for setting up a human settlement . and it will also explore theories as to the origin of the moon . the prevailing notion is that the moon was born from the earth - a mass of terrestrial mantle that was smashed away when earth was hit by a mars-sized object in the infancy of the solar system . this mass of rock and debris then re-condensed to become earth 's satellite , according to this theory . " with our x-ray eyes , we want to trace the moon 's beginnings , " said bernard foing , smart-1 project scientist . much is already known about the moon , thanks to robot craft and the manned us missions of the early sixties and seventies , but scientists say there are also many unknowns . smart-1 is the first in a flotilla of unmanned probes to earth 's companion .

" our small genius is ... at the moon , " a delighted southwood declared . the probe achieved lunar orbit at 17:53 gmt on monday , and on tuesday was looping the moon at a height of 5,000-6000 kilometers -lrb- 3,000-3,500 miles -rrb- , smart-1 project manager giuseppe racca said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart-1 will gently spiral closer to the lunar surface , eventually stabilizing in an egg-shaped polar orbit that will vary from 300 kilometers -lrb- 187 miles -rrb- at the south pole to 3,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,870 miles -rrb- at the north pole . the 370-kilo -lrb- 814-pound -rrb- probe has been using a slow but revolutionary form of propulsion , taking it in ever-widening circles around the earth and using terrestrial gravity as a slingshot , to get to the moon . it is powered by an ion engine , which converts solar power into electricity that then charges atoms of the heavy gas xenon . these charged atoms , known as ions , are then disgorged from the back of the probe to give it thrust . slow , but persistent the motor is initially slow - launched on sept .
27 , 2003 , smart-1 took more than 13 months to make a trip achieved in three days by the chemical rockets of the apollo era - but speed gradually builds up in the frictionless environment of space , making ion power ideal for trips into the depths of the solar system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this artist 's rendition released by the european space agency , the european-made smart-1 solar-powered satellite is seen nearing the moon on its way to make the first comprehensive inventory of key chemical elements in the lunar surface .
smart-1 -lrb- photo -rrb- clocked up 332 orbits around earth and travelled more than 84 million kilometers -lrb- 52.5 million miles -rrb- , " a distance comparable to an interplanetary cruise , " esa pointed out in a press statement . it fired its engines 289 times , operating them for a total of about 3,700 hours , and sipped just 59 kilos -lrb- 129.8 pounds -rrb- of its 80 kilos -lrb- 176 pounds -rrb- of xenon gas .
space rockets typically carry tonnes of chemical fuel , which thus crimps the size of the payload . so much fuel has been saved that smart-1 will be placed in a closer approach to the moon for the scientific phase of the mission . " the performance -lsb- of the motor -rsb- has been better than we expected , " said giorgio saccoccia , head of esa propulsion division .
" we would certainly want to have it onboard in the future . " it is only the second time that ion propulsion has been used as a space mission 's primary propulsion system .
the first was nasa 's deep space 1 probe , launched in october 1998 . scanning the moon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after achieving its final orbit on jan .
13 , 2005 , smart-1 will start a six-month scan of the moon , using a big payload of sensors that are also a test bench of miniaturization . one of the spacecraft 's tasks is to check out hopes that deep craters near the moon 's poles may harbour water ice , a discovery that would be a huge boost for setting up a human settlement . and it will also explore theories as to the origin of the moon . the prevailing notion is that the moon was born from the earth - a mass of terrestrial mantle that was smashed away when earth was hit by a mars-sized object in the infancy of the solar system . this mass of rock and debris then re-condensed to become earth 's satellite , according to this theory . " with our x-ray eyes , we want to trace the moon 's beginnings , " said bernard foing , smart-1 project scientist . much is already known about the moon , thanks to robot craft and the manned us missions of the early sixties and seventies , but scientists say there are also many unknowns . smart-1 is the first in a flotilla of unmanned probes to earth 's companion .
missions have been planned in the coming years by china , india , japan and the united states . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new clues to life on mars concentrations of water vapor and methane gas in certain regions of the red planet strengthen speculation that mars could be a haven for microbial life .

" holland is everywhere , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the social democratic party 's domestic expert over the weekend . it was an oft-quoted line in newspaper editorials this week as the country once again re-examined its often troubled relationship to the 2 million muslims that call germany home . the country 's top policeman , interior minister otto schily , warned others not to overreact to news of mosque burnings and tensions in holland .
he said germany 's new immigration law , which offers integration measures such as language classes to earlier as well as current generations of immigrants , was an important step towards cultural understanding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily " there is , of course , also a danger for us , although we have significant integration successes to show , " schily -lrb- photo -rrb- told the german public broadcaster zdf .
" we should n't minimize those . "
" clash of civilizations " feared conservative politicians used the opportunity to warn of an impending " clash of civilizations " that could very well take place on german soil .
the head of bavaria 's christian scocial union , markus soeder , said the events in the netherlands showed the need for a leitkultur in germany .
the politically-loaded word can be translated as a " leading " or " guiding " culture . " when we look at the recent events in the netherlands , we see a clash of civilizations in full , and we must prevent anything similar from evolving here , " said soeder .
" we need a change in our integration policy which ought to be based strictly on the values and notion of a modern christian society . " terrorism investigators have estimated that there are about 1,000 radical members of the country 's muslim community that are prone to violence .
like their counterparts in holland , they are members of radical mosques where imams rail against israel and western society . misusing democracy bavarian interior minister günter beckstein said the imams must no longer be allowed to preach hate under the protection of the laws of german society .
" the enemies of freedom must not be allowed to use our liberties in order to harm us , " said beckstein .
" and there has to be a policy of zero tolerance towards them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan -lrb- middle -rrb- germany 's efforts to root out muslim fundamentalists have shown mixed success .
after years of trying , the country was finally able early this fall to deport fundamentalist metin kaplan , convicted of calling for the death of a rival imam in berlin , to turkey , where he is wanted for calling for the overthrow of the country 's government . bringing young muslims into the fold but two trials against suspected accomplices of the band of hamburg terrorists that carried out the sept .

27 , 2003 , smart-1 took more than 13 months to make a trip achieved in three days by the chemical rockets of the apollo era - but speed gradually builds up in the frictionless environment of space , making ion power ideal for trips into the depths of the solar system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this artist 's rendition released by the european space agency , the european-made smart-1 solar-powered satellite is seen nearing the moon on its way to make the first comprehensive inventory of key chemical elements in the lunar surface .

space rockets typically carry tonnes of chemical fuel , which thus crimps the size of the payload . so much fuel has been saved that smart-1 will be placed in a closer approach to the moon for the scientific phase of the mission .

" our small genius is ... at the moon , " a delighted southwood declared . the probe achieved lunar orbit at 17:53 gmt on monday , and on tuesday was looping the moon at a height of 5,000-6000 kilometers -lrb- 3,000-3,500 miles -rrb- , smart-1 project manager giuseppe racca said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart-1 will gently spiral closer to the lunar surface , eventually stabilizing in an egg-shaped polar orbit that will vary from 300 kilometers -lrb- 187 miles -rrb- at the south pole to 3,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,870 miles -rrb- at the north pole . the 370-kilo -lrb- 814-pound -rrb- probe has been using a slow but revolutionary form of propulsion , taking it in ever-widening circles around the earth and using terrestrial gravity as a slingshot , to get to the moon . it is powered by an ion engine , which converts solar power into electricity that then charges atoms of the heavy gas xenon . these charged atoms , known as ions , are then disgorged from the back of the probe to give it thrust . slow , but persistent the motor is initially slow - launched on sept .
27 , 2003 , smart-1 took more than 13 months to make a trip achieved in three days by the chemical rockets of the apollo era - but speed gradually builds up in the frictionless environment of space , making ion power ideal for trips into the depths of the solar system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this artist 's rendition released by the european space agency , the european-made smart-1 solar-powered satellite is seen nearing the moon on its way to make the first comprehensive inventory of key chemical elements in the lunar surface .

its job is made harder by the lack of cohesion between many european institutions and organizations . human trafficking , computer crime and terrorism are just some of the crimes dealt with by eurojust , the eu authority charged with the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border and organized crime .
in addition to the specific crime areas , there are also the individual cases which flood in from all 25 member states in the european union to be dealt with .
as a body established as recently as 2002 to enhance the effectiveness of collective crime fighting , and one which has more than 1000 live cases on its books , eurojust could well claim to be one of the busiest and overwhelmed departments in the eu .

" there has been a case where the italians and the germans were pursuing the same criminal at the same time in drug trafficking case , " german eurojust representative hermann von langsdorff told deutsche welle .
" in this instance , the germans were about to make an arrest and the italians came to us and asked if we could persuade the germans to hold off .
they waited for one week only and as a result the whole drug ring was smashed and many arrests made . "
despite such successes , not everything works as smoothly .
von langsdorff , who works with 24 other national representatives in mediating between public prosecutor 's offices all across europe , admitted that sometimes the influx of cases is too much .

" holland is everywhere , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the social democratic party 's domestic expert over the weekend . it was an oft-quoted line in newspaper editorials this week as the country once again re-examined its often troubled relationship to the 2 million muslims that call germany home . the country 's top policeman , interior minister otto schily , warned others not to overreact to news of mosque burnings and tensions in holland .
he said germany 's new immigration law , which offers integration measures such as language classes to earlier as well as current generations of immigrants , was an important step towards cultural understanding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily " there is , of course , also a danger for us , although we have significant integration successes to show , " schily -lrb- photo -rrb- told the german public broadcaster zdf .
" we should n't minimize those . "
" clash of civilizations " feared conservative politicians used the opportunity to warn of an impending " clash of civilizations " that could very well take place on german soil .
the head of bavaria 's christian scocial union , markus soeder , said the events in the netherlands showed the need for a leitkultur in germany .
the politically-loaded word can be translated as a " leading " or " guiding " culture . " when we look at the recent events in the netherlands , we see a clash of civilizations in full , and we must prevent anything similar from evolving here , " said soeder .
" we need a change in our integration policy which ought to be based strictly on the values and notion of a modern christian society . " terrorism investigators have estimated that there are about 1,000 radical members of the country 's muslim community that are prone to violence .
like their counterparts in holland , they are members of radical mosques where imams rail against israel and western society . misusing democracy bavarian interior minister günter beckstein said the imams must no longer be allowed to preach hate under the protection of the laws of german society .
" the enemies of freedom must not be allowed to use our liberties in order to harm us , " said beckstein .
" and there has to be a policy of zero tolerance towards them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan -lrb- middle -rrb- germany 's efforts to root out muslim fundamentalists have shown mixed success .
after years of trying , the country was finally able early this fall to deport fundamentalist metin kaplan , convicted of calling for the death of a rival imam in berlin , to turkey , where he is wanted for calling for the overthrow of the country 's government . bringing young muslims into the fold but two trials against suspected accomplices of the band of hamburg terrorists that carried out the sept .
11 terrorist attacks have ended in acquittals .
and the appeals do n't look to swing in the government 's favor . though a hard line against potential fundamentalists is preferable , politicians like the green party 's volker beck said the opposite should be done for moderate , young muslims .
" social exclusion and disintegration make young muslims vulnerable to radical ideologies and hatred , " beck said .
" the way out of this dilemma is not to brand them as outlaws , but rather to let them participate in german social life .

top designer says world cup design " just embarrassing " when baring it all is not enough could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ? current affairs -pipe- 16.11.2004 a mascot for all seasons ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo enjoys his time in the sun but how will history remember him ?
goleo the lion was revealed as the official mascot for the 2006 world cup this weekend .
while fame and fortune beckons for the face of the soccer spectacular , goleo will find out it 's not all furry handshakes and waving . with great power comes great responsibility , something goleo - the newly revealed official mascot of the 2006 world cup - will soon learn .
the tall and imposing , although very approachable looking , lion becomes the latest in a long line of fake animals to become the figurehead of a major sporting event .
goleo will spend the next 18 months preparing for the global soccer showcase in germany , where he will stir the crowded stadiums and inspire millions of spectators around the world .
during that time , goleo 's face will become synonymous with the world cup in germany and the harmonious message of fair play that will no doubt be promoted throughout the entirety of the month-long tournament .
global superstardom and worldwide recognition awaits him .
he looks happy enough , but is he ready ?
such a high profile position comes with its own set of intense pressures .
goleo will not even be able to enjoy a quiet gazelle without a pack of paparazzi snappers being on hand to record his every bite and maul .
so what can the mascot of the 2006 world cup expect ?
if everything goes right , goleo could be the next misha the bear .
the mascot of the olympic games of 1980 went on to become one of the best loved and most marketable figureheads in sporting history , so much so that many people forget the us boycott of the moscow games - in protest of the december 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan - and remember them for the cute little teddy bear who even cried at the closing ceremony .
memorable misha endures misha 's tale should give the german lion some hope .
regardless of how well his countrymen perform at the world cup , goleo could still come out of the tournament smelling of roses .
a successful stint as the face of the 2006 tournament could bode well for a future career away from the sporting spotlight .
goleo may want to look to the example set by english soccer team hartlepool united 's h 'angus the monkey .
the all-singing , all-dancing mascot of the yorkshire club enjoyed a long career aping around for the hartlepool faithful and made such an impression on the town that in may 2002 , he was elected town mayor .
but while the world may be an oyster - or in goleo 's case , a wildebeest - for the successful mascot , there are pitfalls .
as with any celebrity , there are temptations for the sporting mascot , such as unscrupulous types waiting to accelerate their downfall for their own gains by exploiting any furry foot put wrong .
the seedier side of the mascot life is just a flip of the coin away .
when fake animals attack take wolfie , the mascot of another english soccer team , wolverhampton wanderers .
wolfie used to rally the crowds with playful and endearing kick-arounds with the opposing mascots before his team took to the pitch .
that is until the arrival of bristol city 's three little pigs .
in front of a television audience of millions , wolfie lost his cool in the pre-match contest and ended up battling all three pigs in a pitch-side punch-up .
needless to say , he never worked in that town again .
as the only official mascot of the world cup , goleo may not have any rivals to face and so potential fisticuffs should be avoided .
but even if he keeps his cold , wet nose clean , goleo must go into this new phase with his eyes open to the realities .
a mascot 's shelf life is a tangible one .

just as the murder in sarajevo once began wwi , so has the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh been depicted by self-described terrorism or islam experts -lrb- the two fit together so wonderfully nowadays -rrb- as the first shot in the so-called " clash of civilizations " .
it is a clash that will no longer be waged with words , but with weapons , and where the future power structures in europe are at stake . a writer in the conservative daily , die welt , writes that fundamental muslims " strive for the reestablishment of an islamic order in accordance with the original islam of the 7th century which , according to them , is the only legitimate state and society .
this should replace other systems . " in the same newspaper , the islam critic hans-peter raddatz writes that " the state allows extremists to create networks under the protection of the so-called dialogue , the beneficiaries of which have only one goal : to live in accordance to their own rules and cancel out the constitutional state . " fanatics are everywhere just as bad , if less so , was the opinion of other " experts " , who have been calling for tolerance and liberalism since the amsterdam murder while at the same time saying that a reason for the violence is that holland let in too many muslims - with a little less than a million , still a higher per capita count than in germany . can you declare liberalism and tolerance for dead just because one fanatic committed a ghastly murder and because he became a fanatic in a radical muslim community ? as unsatisfying as this sounds : things like that can happen - in every country .
there are fanatics everywhere ; especially in these times , where religion is increasingly being misused for political purposes . differences should be respected in opposition to the rhetoric since the van gogh murder the only solution can be the continued integration of those of other faiths - and not just muslims .
integration also should not mean giving up one 's identity . differences should be respected .
but they should align themselves under the still-generous european constitutional system .
those that want to live here need to obey the societal and democratic system otherwise they will continually be out of place . but this system needs to deal with " the others " with as much freedom , liberality and tolerance for which the pessimists are criticizing holland . art has its borders these critics do n't address the fact that the director , through a well-intended but visually provocative film , deeply hurt the feelings of faithful muslims .
it is no justification for violence , but as the worldwide debate over the jesus film -lrb- mel gibson 's " the passion " -rrb- and other cases showed , art can and is n't borderless , because it always finds its border with the other person 's freedom . if liberalism and tolerance have failed anywhere , then it is here . peter philipp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe faces new integration challenges the current wave of violence against muslims in the netherlands has forced all of europe to stop and examine the problems of integration .
many worry that what the dutch are now facing could soon be an eu-wide reality .

" we need a change in our integration policy which ought to be based strictly on the values and notion of a modern christian society . " terrorism investigators have estimated that there are about 1,000 radical members of the country 's muslim community that are prone to violence .
like their counterparts in holland , they are members of radical mosques where imams rail against israel and western society . misusing democracy bavarian interior minister günter beckstein said the imams must no longer be allowed to preach hate under the protection of the laws of german society .

with new threats emerging , they 're meeting in germany on tuesday to plan for the future . next year , the alpine convention , a regional agreement for the protection and sustainable development of the alps , will celebrate its 10th anniversary .
but in the decade since european countries with part of their territory in the alps made a great leap forward and agreed to work together to find common solutions for common problems , critics say preservation efforts have not gone far enough .
meanwhile , a host of emerging threats demand urgent attention .
environment ministers meet in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch-partenkirchen sits right near the german alps in southern bavaria on tuesday , the environmental ministers of the seven permanent members of the convention , led by germany , the current chair , will meet in garmisch-partenkirchen , germany for the eighth alpine conference .
they 'll assess their successes and set out an ambitious plan for the region , a rich and diverse area encompassing 190,287 square kilometres with a population of more than 13 million .
but with the alpine convention remaining a non-binding framework with , until now , no permanent secretariat , it remains to be seen if it has the political muscle to get the job done .
regional thinking a good start with the growth of the environmental movement in the 1960 's and 1970 's an increased awareness of the threats facing the alps developed , and preservationists lobbied hard for a collective approach .
after years of wrangling , the alpine convention went into force in march of 1995 .
a framework agreement between seven european countries , it set out to limit environmental degradation by harmonizing economic and environmental policies in the region .
thus , with 13 protocols , including ones related to air and water pollution , the convention 's greatest initial achievement was that it promoted a regional way of thinking where highly territorial national policies once prevailed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morteratsch glacier in switzerland has been melting at a rapid pace .
" the alpine convention increased the realization that the alps need to be treated as a region and the participants need to develop a regional way of thinking , " martin price , director of the center for mountain studies at perth college in great britain and the former chairman of the european mountain forum told dw-world .
andreas götz , the director of the international commission for the protection of the alps -lrb- cipra -rrb- agreed .
" the main thing is that a regional consciousness developed , " he told dw-world .
initial success gives way to stalled agenda in the years since it went into force , the alpine convention has not been without its successes .
a network of protected areas was created , as well as an international scientific commission for alpine research , based in bern , to study environmental threats and possible solutions .
what 's more , related initiatives , such as the alliance in the alps , founded by cipra , encouraged individual regions to share information and best practices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a paraglider is flying in front of the alps down from the brauneck mountain near bad tölz in southern germany .
but after an initial flutter of activity , some say efforts have stalled .
though lots of data was collected and inter-regional relationships were forged , the tough issues - inter-state transportation , the effects of global warming , the impactof depopulation - have not been directly tackled .
" the easier issues have been solved first and the more difficult ones left until later , " price said .
meeting to jumpstart agenda ?
at the meeting in germany on tuesday , the ministers are expected to announce a six-year plan to breath new life into the convention , and the creation of a permanent secretariat based in innsbruck to oversee the revised agenda and the establishment of a monitoring mechanism to chart progress will be announced .
likewise , cipra has launched a " future of the alps " initiative , which it hopes will - on a grass roots basis - help speed up the adaptation of the individual protocols .
" we do not have a lack of knowledge , " wolfgang pfefforkorn , the director of the future of the alps initiative , told dw-world .
" we have a lack of the implementation . "
a more results-oriented agenda , with a regular " state of the alps " report would be a good start , werner baetzing , an expert in alpine research at the university of erlangen in germany told dw-world .
new ski resorts threaten highest peaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steeple of the church in the liechtenstein village of triesenberg is seen in front of the alvierkette mountain chain in the swiss alps .
a renewed commitment to alpine preservation could not come at a better time .
new threats are emerging , illustrating the alps delicate state .
chief among them : global warming , which will affect the region in a number of different ways , including , possibly precipitating the end of ski-related tourism .
according to a report released last year by the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , up to half of all alpine ski resorts in france , austria and switzerland may be forced to close over the next fifty years if current global warming trends continue and the snowline rises another 300 meters to 1800 meters above sea level .
in response , the owners of the threatened resorts are looking to build so-called " second generation ski resorts " above the revised snowline among the alps ' highest peeks and glaciers despite strict laws preventing further development .
in may , in the tirol , they succeeded .
the local government ruled to relax the law , paving the way for two major projects .
michel revaz , the deputy director of cipra told dw-world that he is worried the move will spark a dangerous game one upmanship among european ski resorts .
" now that it 's happened in austria , all the others will want to do the same , " he told dw-world .
he would prefer to see the affected regions look for an alternatives to ski tourism , rather than colonizing the alps remaining pristine peaks .
convention a model to learn from bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ski jumper sven hannawald soars in front of the zugspitze mountain ridge in the case of global warming and ski tourism , and a number of other areas , the benefits of a regional approach are many .
on tuesday , the members of the alpine convention will be looking to build on past successes and put bite into a decade-old agreement .
the future of a region representative of many people 's picture of europe hangs in the balance .
on the plus side , experts say that when it comes to the preservation of mountain regions , europe is leading the way and setting an excellent example for other mountain areas around the world struggling with similar issues .
" maybe it 's not the model to follow , " price said .
" but it 's the model to learn from .

they 'll assess their successes and set out an ambitious plan for the region , a rich and diverse area encompassing 190,287 square kilometres with a population of more than 13 million .
but with the alpine convention remaining a non-binding framework with , until now , no permanent secretariat , it remains to be seen if it has the political muscle to get the job done .
regional thinking a good start with the growth of the environmental movement in the 1960 's and 1970 's an increased awareness of the threats facing the alps developed , and preservationists lobbied hard for a collective approach .
after years of wrangling , the alpine convention went into force in march of 1995 .
a framework agreement between seven european countries , it set out to limit environmental degradation by harmonizing economic and environmental policies in the region .
thus , with 13 protocols , including ones related to air and water pollution , the convention 's greatest initial achievement was that it promoted a regional way of thinking where highly territorial national policies once prevailed .

a network of protected areas was created , as well as an international scientific commission for alpine research , based in bern , to study environmental threats and possible solutions .

meeting to jumpstart agenda ?
at the meeting in germany on tuesday , the ministers are expected to announce a six-year plan to breath new life into the convention , and the creation of a permanent secretariat based in innsbruck to oversee the revised agenda and the establishment of a monitoring mechanism to chart progress will be announced .
likewise , cipra has launched a " future of the alps " initiative , which it hopes will - on a grass roots basis - help speed up the adaptation of the individual protocols .
" we do not have a lack of knowledge , " wolfgang pfefforkorn , the director of the future of the alps initiative , told dw-world .

in response , the owners of the threatened resorts are looking to build so-called " second generation ski resorts " above the revised snowline among the alps ' highest peeks and glaciers despite strict laws preventing further development .
in may , in the tirol , they succeeded .
the local government ruled to relax the law , paving the way for two major projects .
michel revaz , the deputy director of cipra told dw-world that he is worried the move will spark a dangerous game one upmanship among european ski resorts .
" now that it 's happened in austria , all the others will want to do the same , " he told dw-world .

with new threats emerging , they 're meeting in germany on tuesday to plan for the future . next year , the alpine convention , a regional agreement for the protection and sustainable development of the alps , will celebrate its 10th anniversary .
but in the decade since european countries with part of their territory in the alps made a great leap forward and agreed to work together to find common solutions for common problems , critics say preservation efforts have not gone far enough .
meanwhile , a host of emerging threats demand urgent attention .
environment ministers meet in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch-partenkirchen sits right near the german alps in southern bavaria on tuesday , the environmental ministers of the seven permanent members of the convention , led by germany , the current chair , will meet in garmisch-partenkirchen , germany for the eighth alpine conference .
they 'll assess their successes and set out an ambitious plan for the region , a rich and diverse area encompassing 190,287 square kilometres with a population of more than 13 million .
but with the alpine convention remaining a non-binding framework with , until now , no permanent secretariat , it remains to be seen if it has the political muscle to get the job done .
regional thinking a good start with the growth of the environmental movement in the 1960 's and 1970 's an increased awareness of the threats facing the alps developed , and preservationists lobbied hard for a collective approach .
after years of wrangling , the alpine convention went into force in march of 1995 .
a framework agreement between seven european countries , it set out to limit environmental degradation by harmonizing economic and environmental policies in the region .
thus , with 13 protocols , including ones related to air and water pollution , the convention 's greatest initial achievement was that it promoted a regional way of thinking where highly territorial national policies once prevailed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morteratsch glacier in switzerland has been melting at a rapid pace .
" the alpine convention increased the realization that the alps need to be treated as a region and the participants need to develop a regional way of thinking , " martin price , director of the center for mountain studies at perth college in great britain and the former chairman of the european mountain forum told dw-world .
andreas götz , the director of the international commission for the protection of the alps -lrb- cipra -rrb- agreed .
" the main thing is that a regional consciousness developed , " he told dw-world .
initial success gives way to stalled agenda in the years since it went into force , the alpine convention has not been without its successes .
a network of protected areas was created , as well as an international scientific commission for alpine research , based in bern , to study environmental threats and possible solutions .
what 's more , related initiatives , such as the alliance in the alps , founded by cipra , encouraged individual regions to share information and best practices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a paraglider is flying in front of the alps down from the brauneck mountain near bad tölz in southern germany .
but after an initial flutter of activity , some say efforts have stalled .
though lots of data was collected and inter-regional relationships were forged , the tough issues - inter-state transportation , the effects of global warming , the impactof depopulation - have not been directly tackled .
" the easier issues have been solved first and the more difficult ones left until later , " price said .
meeting to jumpstart agenda ?
at the meeting in germany on tuesday , the ministers are expected to announce a six-year plan to breath new life into the convention , and the creation of a permanent secretariat based in innsbruck to oversee the revised agenda and the establishment of a monitoring mechanism to chart progress will be announced .
likewise , cipra has launched a " future of the alps " initiative , which it hopes will - on a grass roots basis - help speed up the adaptation of the individual protocols .
" we do not have a lack of knowledge , " wolfgang pfefforkorn , the director of the future of the alps initiative , told dw-world .
" we have a lack of the implementation . "
a more results-oriented agenda , with a regular " state of the alps " report would be a good start , werner baetzing , an expert in alpine research at the university of erlangen in germany told dw-world .

the most controversial was italian conservative rocco buttiglione , who came up against strong resistance for his views on homosexuality and marriage .
but he is not the only one . on tuesday , the hungarian candidate , sixty-five year old laszlo kovacs has the chance to prove his worth for the customs and taxation portfolio .
he was originally nominated as energy commissioner , but performed disastrously at this first hearing in front of the parliament last month , astounding members of the parliament with his lack of knowledge on even basic matters . " from the academic point of view , i was probably wrong when i tried to define what i think of hydrogen , but i 'm to say i 'm not an academic , and not even an energy expert , " kovacs said after the hearing . should he stay or should he go although kovacs has managed to avoid the fate of buttiglione , janis emmanouilidis , an expert in european affairs at the centre for applied policy research in munich , said he believes hungary should have replaced kovacs . " there was a strong pressure to have him withdrawn , but the government in hungary strongly supported his nomination and did n't withdraw him , " he told dw-radio .
" i believe that because many parliamentarians , not only from the christian democrats but also from the socialist group , criticized him concerning his knowledge of the matter , it might have been a wise decision to have him withdrawn . " kovacs , who is the former hungarian minister for foreign affairs , is expected to face difficult questions on economics and currency , as well as domestic market and consumer protection matters .
the hearing is likely to be gruelling as parliamentarians feel that eu member states are n't take the nomination process seriously . " the european parliament is looking at its rights and exploiting its rights , " emmanouilidis said .
" it is looking for new areas to show the two other institutions in the eu that the parliament has a strong say . " the voice of experience however , he also said he believes that kovacs will bring some political know-how to the commission . " he 's one of a few politicians in the new member states with significant experience , " he said .
" he has a lot to offer from a political point of view , but concerning his technical knowledge in certain policy areas , he might be less strong . " the parliament ca n't refuse individual commissioners , only the entire commission , which means that kovac 's nomination is probably in the bag .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.11.2004 row over plan for german in mosques großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would have moslems pray in german a proposal for the enforcement of german as a spoken language in mosques has erupted in germany as politicians look for ways to reform the country 's integration policy in the wake of violence in the netherlands . a regional politician 's proposal that prayers in german mosques should be said in german was greeted with dismay on monday amid fears that anti-muslim attacks may spread over the border from the netherlands .
annette schavan , the christian democratic education minister for the state of baden-württemberg and a contender for the state 's premiership , made her radical proposal at the weekend because , she said , " we can no longer accept that prayers in mosques should be said in languages that can not be understood outside the muslim community . "
schavan 's proposal comes in the wake of the torching of mosques , schools and churches in the netherlands following the killing of film director theo van gogh , whose work was strongly critical of muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her suggestion drew a sharp reaction from the leaders of the more than two and a half million turks who live in germany .
" this is nonsense - terror can be spread in any language , " said kenan kolat , the co-president of the turkish community in germany .
cornelie sonntag-wolgast , a representative of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on the national parliamentary committee for domestic affairs also criticized the proposal .
" we can not suspect each and every person ... of violence just because they say their prayers in arabic , " said sonntag-wolgast .
volker beck , a spokesman for the greens , the junior partner in the governing coalition , said schavan 's proposal was " completely exaggerated " while liberal fdp interior minister max stadler criticized schavan , saying her proposal for the state to enforce the german language in mosques was " an offense against basic law . "

volker beck , a spokesman for the greens , the junior partner in the governing coalition , said schavan 's proposal was " completely exaggerated " while liberal fdp interior minister max stadler criticized schavan , saying her proposal for the state to enforce the german language in mosques was " an offense against basic law . "
werner schiffauer , a cultural professor said , schavan 's plan was " out-of-touch and impractical " , a view supported by jürgen micksch , the chairperson of the intercultural council in germany .
professor schiffauer stated that there was little money available to provide language training for the large numbers of islamic preachers in germany and that , in addition , many foreigners living in germany stayed for only a short time and were dependent on mother-tongue services while they were there .
some support idea however , nadeem elyas , the chairman for the central council of muslims in germany , agreed with the proposal .
elyas explained that a lot of mosques already translate their prayers and sermons and offer simultaneous audio feeds in both arabic and german .

the council , he said , is made up of 19 organizations and about 500 mosque municipalities in germany , not all of which cater for purely arabic speakers .
elyas added that german , turkish , arabian , albanian , bosnian and persian muslims all worship in germany and many have different language requirements .
call for islamic holiday the row over schaven 's proposal comes at a time when germany seems desperate to define its integration policy and avoid copycat violence spreading across the border from the neighboring netherlands .
just a day after schaven 's proposal was revealed , a member of the green party in germany called for the government to install an official islamic holiday in the german calendar .

hans-christian ströbele was quoted in the die welt newspaper on tuesday saying that a holiday directly after the fasting period of ramadan could be one possibility , an idea supported by environment minister jürgen trittin . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de holland prompts soul-searching in germany as is the case in other parts of europe , the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh has prompted some serious soul-searching in germany , where politicians of every stripe are mulling integration .

its job is made harder by the lack of cohesion between many european institutions and organizations . human trafficking , computer crime and terrorism are just some of the crimes dealt with by eurojust , the eu authority charged with the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border and organized crime .
in addition to the specific crime areas , there are also the individual cases which flood in from all 25 member states in the european union to be dealt with .
as a body established as recently as 2002 to enhance the effectiveness of collective crime fighting , and one which has more than 1000 live cases on its books , eurojust could well claim to be one of the busiest and overwhelmed departments in the eu .
behind kilometers of razor wire , security checks and armored doors , the headquarters of eurojust in the hague is one of the most secure places in the eu .
in contrast to the heavily guarded surroundings , it also one of the most open ; welcoming magistrates , public prosecutors and secret service agents from around the bloc every month for discussions and consultations .

everything from organized crime to international terrorism comes to the conference table in a sign that this type collaboration has become the single most important factor in the fight against crime .
and on the surface , it appears to be working .
" there has been a case where the italians and the germans were pursuing the same criminal at the same time in drug trafficking case , " german eurojust representative hermann von langsdorff told deutsche welle .
" in this instance , the germans were about to make an arrest and the italians came to us and asked if we could persuade the germans to hold off .
they waited for one week only and as a result the whole drug ring was smashed and many arrests made . "
despite such successes , not everything works as smoothly .
von langsdorff , who works with 24 other national representatives in mediating between public prosecutor 's offices all across europe , admitted that sometimes the influx of cases is too much .
" the big problem is that eurojust can only reasonably cope with one institution at a time , " he said .
lack of recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is one of the worst offenders for not offering or accepting help .

european public prosecutors continue to sit on vital information regarding terror suspects and some do not even know that eurojust exists and can help in the passing on of vital information , according to von langsdorff .
in the increasingly important fight against international terrorism , more collaboration is needed .
borders closed to exchange of information europe 's borders are open but not always in the eyes of the public prosecutors .
to obtain the right to make searches with foreign colleagues in a bordering country and even to make phone calls to other member states in relation to investigations require special approval .
even von langsdorff and his colleagues at eurojust have their hands tied to a certain extent .
without permission from the member states involved in a case , no results or information can be exchanged without permission .
von langsdorff believes a central data bank could change all this .
" the perfect scenario would be that a phone number discovered during a search in italy could immediately be put in the system and its origin ascertained , whether this number has been linked to terrorists in germany or france , " he said .

its job is made harder by the lack of cohesion between many european institutions and organizations . human trafficking , computer crime and terrorism are just some of the crimes dealt with by eurojust , the eu authority charged with the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border and organized crime .
in addition to the specific crime areas , there are also the individual cases which flood in from all 25 member states in the european union to be dealt with .
as a body established as recently as 2002 to enhance the effectiveness of collective crime fighting , and one which has more than 1000 live cases on its books , eurojust could well claim to be one of the busiest and overwhelmed departments in the eu .
behind kilometers of razor wire , security checks and armored doors , the headquarters of eurojust in the hague is one of the most secure places in the eu .
in contrast to the heavily guarded surroundings , it also one of the most open ; welcoming magistrates , public prosecutors and secret service agents from around the bloc every month for discussions and consultations .
a forum for investigation and prosecution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurojust brings security institutions and legal teams together in an attempt to open up dialogue and create a wider network of collaborative crime prevention across the eu .
everything from organized crime to international terrorism comes to the conference table in a sign that this type collaboration has become the single most important factor in the fight against crime .
and on the surface , it appears to be working .
" there has been a case where the italians and the germans were pursuing the same criminal at the same time in drug trafficking case , " german eurojust representative hermann von langsdorff told deutsche welle .
" in this instance , the germans were about to make an arrest and the italians came to us and asked if we could persuade the germans to hold off .
they waited for one week only and as a result the whole drug ring was smashed and many arrests made . "
despite such successes , not everything works as smoothly .
von langsdorff , who works with 24 other national representatives in mediating between public prosecutor 's offices all across europe , admitted that sometimes the influx of cases is too much .
" the big problem is that eurojust can only reasonably cope with one institution at a time , " he said .
lack of recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is one of the worst offenders for not offering or accepting help .
but there are also bigger problems .
contradictorily , few member states recognize the work of eurojust .
" for example , we have barely had any coordination requests from germany , " von langsdorff said .
" in 2003 , we received only one and in 2004 , up until now , just three .
in the overall scheme of things , this is too little . "
it is as if sept .

european public prosecutors continue to sit on vital information regarding terror suspects and some do not even know that eurojust exists and can help in the passing on of vital information , according to von langsdorff .
in the increasingly important fight against international terrorism , more collaboration is needed .
borders closed to exchange of information europe 's borders are open but not always in the eyes of the public prosecutors .
to obtain the right to make searches with foreign colleagues in a bordering country and even to make phone calls to other member states in relation to investigations require special approval .
even von langsdorff and his colleagues at eurojust have their hands tied to a certain extent .
without permission from the member states involved in a case , no results or information can be exchanged without permission .
von langsdorff believes a central data bank could change all this .
" the perfect scenario would be that a phone number discovered during a search in italy could immediately be put in the system and its origin ascertained , whether this number has been linked to terrorists in germany or france , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.11.2004 hungarian faces commission hearing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a controversial candidate : laszlo kovacs new european commission president jose barroso is due to present his commissioners on thursday , but not before the hungarian candidate proves he is the right man for the job . the new commission should have started work at the beginning of november , but was held up by disagreements over a number of commissioner candidates .
the most controversial was italian conservative rocco buttiglione , who came up against strong resistance for his views on homosexuality and marriage .
but he is not the only one . on tuesday , the hungarian candidate , sixty-five year old laszlo kovacs has the chance to prove his worth for the customs and taxation portfolio .
he was originally nominated as energy commissioner , but performed disastrously at this first hearing in front of the parliament last month , astounding members of the parliament with his lack of knowledge on even basic matters . " from the academic point of view , i was probably wrong when i tried to define what i think of hydrogen , but i 'm to say i 'm not an academic , and not even an energy expert , " kovacs said after the hearing . should he stay or should he go although kovacs has managed to avoid the fate of buttiglione , janis emmanouilidis , an expert in european affairs at the centre for applied policy research in munich , said he believes hungary should have replaced kovacs . " there was a strong pressure to have him withdrawn , but the government in hungary strongly supported his nomination and did n't withdraw him , " he told dw-radio .
" i believe that because many parliamentarians , not only from the christian democrats but also from the socialist group , criticized him concerning his knowledge of the matter , it might have been a wise decision to have him withdrawn . " kovacs , who is the former hungarian minister for foreign affairs , is expected to face difficult questions on economics and currency , as well as domestic market and consumer protection matters .
the hearing is likely to be gruelling as parliamentarians feel that eu member states are n't take the nomination process seriously . " the european parliament is looking at its rights and exploiting its rights , " emmanouilidis said .
" it is looking for new areas to show the two other institutions in the eu that the parliament has a strong say . " the voice of experience however , he also said he believes that kovacs will bring some political know-how to the commission . " he 's one of a few politicians in the new member states with significant experience , " he said .
" he has a lot to offer from a political point of view , but concerning his technical knowledge in certain policy areas , he might be less strong . " the parliament ca n't refuse individual commissioners , only the entire commission , which means that kovac 's nomination is probably in the bag .
so , barring interview disasters , the new commission president jose manuel barroso should be able to formally present his new team for approval on thursday . kate hairsine -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso 's commission faces new confidence vote incoming eu executive head jose manuel barroso said friday he hopes for " clear " approval when eu lawmakers finally vote on his new team later this month , to end an unprecedented state of limbo in brussels .

" our small genius is ... at the moon , " a delighted southwood declared . the probe achieved lunar orbit at 17:53 gmt on monday , and on tuesday was looping the moon at a height of 5,000-6000 kilometers -lrb- 3,000-3,500 miles -rrb- , smart-1 project manager giuseppe racca said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart-1 will gently spiral closer to the lunar surface , eventually stabilizing in an egg-shaped polar orbit that will vary from 300 kilometers -lrb- 187 miles -rrb- at the south pole to 3,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,870 miles -rrb- at the north pole . the 370-kilo -lrb- 814-pound -rrb- probe has been using a slow but revolutionary form of propulsion , taking it in ever-widening circles around the earth and using terrestrial gravity as a slingshot , to get to the moon . it is powered by an ion engine , which converts solar power into electricity that then charges atoms of the heavy gas xenon . these charged atoms , known as ions , are then disgorged from the back of the probe to give it thrust . slow , but persistent the motor is initially slow - launched on sept .
27 , 2003 , smart-1 took more than 13 months to make a trip achieved in three days by the chemical rockets of the apollo era - but speed gradually builds up in the frictionless environment of space , making ion power ideal for trips into the depths of the solar system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this artist 's rendition released by the european space agency , the european-made smart-1 solar-powered satellite is seen nearing the moon on its way to make the first comprehensive inventory of key chemical elements in the lunar surface .
smart-1 -lrb- photo -rrb- clocked up 332 orbits around earth and travelled more than 84 million kilometers -lrb- 52.5 million miles -rrb- , " a distance comparable to an interplanetary cruise , " esa pointed out in a press statement . it fired its engines 289 times , operating them for a total of about 3,700 hours , and sipped just 59 kilos -lrb- 129.8 pounds -rrb- of its 80 kilos -lrb- 176 pounds -rrb- of xenon gas .
space rockets typically carry tonnes of chemical fuel , which thus crimps the size of the payload . so much fuel has been saved that smart-1 will be placed in a closer approach to the moon for the scientific phase of the mission . " the performance -lsb- of the motor -rsb- has been better than we expected , " said giorgio saccoccia , head of esa propulsion division .
" we would certainly want to have it onboard in the future . " it is only the second time that ion propulsion has been used as a space mission 's primary propulsion system .

13 , 2005 , smart-1 will start a six-month scan of the moon , using a big payload of sensors that are also a test bench of miniaturization . one of the spacecraft 's tasks is to check out hopes that deep craters near the moon 's poles may harbour water ice , a discovery that would be a huge boost for setting up a human settlement . and it will also explore theories as to the origin of the moon . the prevailing notion is that the moon was born from the earth - a mass of terrestrial mantle that was smashed away when earth was hit by a mars-sized object in the infancy of the solar system . this mass of rock and debris then re-condensed to become earth 's satellite , according to this theory . " with our x-ray eyes , we want to trace the moon 's beginnings , " said bernard foing , smart-1 project scientist . much is already known about the moon , thanks to robot craft and the manned us missions of the early sixties and seventies , but scientists say there are also many unknowns . smart-1 is the first in a flotilla of unmanned probes to earth 's companion .

" with our x-ray eyes , we want to trace the moon 's beginnings , " said bernard foing , smart-1 project scientist . much is already known about the moon , thanks to robot craft and the manned us missions of the early sixties and seventies , but scientists say there are also many unknowns . smart-1 is the first in a flotilla of unmanned probes to earth 's companion .

goleo the lion was revealed as the official mascot for the 2006 world cup this weekend .
while fame and fortune beckons for the face of the soccer spectacular , goleo will find out it 's not all furry handshakes and waving . with great power comes great responsibility , something goleo - the newly revealed official mascot of the 2006 world cup - will soon learn .
the tall and imposing , although very approachable looking , lion becomes the latest in a long line of fake animals to become the figurehead of a major sporting event .
goleo will spend the next 18 months preparing for the global soccer showcase in germany , where he will stir the crowded stadiums and inspire millions of spectators around the world .
during that time , goleo 's face will become synonymous with the world cup in germany and the harmonious message of fair play that will no doubt be promoted throughout the entirety of the month-long tournament .
global superstardom and worldwide recognition awaits him .
he looks happy enough , but is he ready ?
such a high profile position comes with its own set of intense pressures .
goleo will not even be able to enjoy a quiet gazelle without a pack of paparazzi snappers being on hand to record his every bite and maul .
so what can the mascot of the 2006 world cup expect ?
if everything goes right , goleo could be the next misha the bear .
the mascot of the olympic games of 1980 went on to become one of the best loved and most marketable figureheads in sporting history , so much so that many people forget the us boycott of the moscow games - in protest of the december 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan - and remember them for the cute little teddy bear who even cried at the closing ceremony .
memorable misha endures misha 's tale should give the german lion some hope .
regardless of how well his countrymen perform at the world cup , goleo could still come out of the tournament smelling of roses .
a successful stint as the face of the 2006 tournament could bode well for a future career away from the sporting spotlight .
goleo may want to look to the example set by english soccer team hartlepool united 's h 'angus the monkey .
the all-singing , all-dancing mascot of the yorkshire club enjoyed a long career aping around for the hartlepool faithful and made such an impression on the town that in may 2002 , he was elected town mayor .
but while the world may be an oyster - or in goleo 's case , a wildebeest - for the successful mascot , there are pitfalls .
as with any celebrity , there are temptations for the sporting mascot , such as unscrupulous types waiting to accelerate their downfall for their own gains by exploiting any furry foot put wrong .
the seedier side of the mascot life is just a flip of the coin away .

in front of a television audience of millions , wolfie lost his cool in the pre-match contest and ended up battling all three pigs in a pitch-side punch-up .
needless to say , he never worked in that town again .
as the only official mascot of the world cup , goleo may not have any rivals to face and so potential fisticuffs should be avoided .
but even if he keeps his cold , wet nose clean , goleo must go into this new phase with his eyes open to the realities .

goleo the lion was revealed as the official mascot for the 2006 world cup this weekend .
while fame and fortune beckons for the face of the soccer spectacular , goleo will find out it 's not all furry handshakes and waving . with great power comes great responsibility , something goleo - the newly revealed official mascot of the 2006 world cup - will soon learn .
the tall and imposing , although very approachable looking , lion becomes the latest in a long line of fake animals to become the figurehead of a major sporting event .
goleo will spend the next 18 months preparing for the global soccer showcase in germany , where he will stir the crowded stadiums and inspire millions of spectators around the world .
during that time , goleo 's face will become synonymous with the world cup in germany and the harmonious message of fair play that will no doubt be promoted throughout the entirety of the month-long tournament .
global superstardom and worldwide recognition awaits him .
he looks happy enough , but is he ready ?
such a high profile position comes with its own set of intense pressures .
goleo will not even be able to enjoy a quiet gazelle without a pack of paparazzi snappers being on hand to record his every bite and maul .
so what can the mascot of the 2006 world cup expect ?
if everything goes right , goleo could be the next misha the bear .
the mascot of the olympic games of 1980 went on to become one of the best loved and most marketable figureheads in sporting history , so much so that many people forget the us boycott of the moscow games - in protest of the december 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan - and remember them for the cute little teddy bear who even cried at the closing ceremony .
memorable misha endures misha 's tale should give the german lion some hope .
regardless of how well his countrymen perform at the world cup , goleo could still come out of the tournament smelling of roses .
a successful stint as the face of the 2006 tournament could bode well for a future career away from the sporting spotlight .
goleo may want to look to the example set by english soccer team hartlepool united 's h 'angus the monkey .
the all-singing , all-dancing mascot of the yorkshire club enjoyed a long career aping around for the hartlepool faithful and made such an impression on the town that in may 2002 , he was elected town mayor .
but while the world may be an oyster - or in goleo 's case , a wildebeest - for the successful mascot , there are pitfalls .
as with any celebrity , there are temptations for the sporting mascot , such as unscrupulous types waiting to accelerate their downfall for their own gains by exploiting any furry foot put wrong .
the seedier side of the mascot life is just a flip of the coin away .
when fake animals attack take wolfie , the mascot of another english soccer team , wolverhampton wanderers .

" holland is everywhere , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the social democratic party 's domestic expert over the weekend . it was an oft-quoted line in newspaper editorials this week as the country once again re-examined its often troubled relationship to the 2 million muslims that call germany home . the country 's top policeman , interior minister otto schily , warned others not to overreact to news of mosque burnings and tensions in holland .
he said germany 's new immigration law , which offers integration measures such as language classes to earlier as well as current generations of immigrants , was an important step towards cultural understanding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily " there is , of course , also a danger for us , although we have significant integration successes to show , " schily -lrb- photo -rrb- told the german public broadcaster zdf .
" we should n't minimize those . "
" clash of civilizations " feared conservative politicians used the opportunity to warn of an impending " clash of civilizations " that could very well take place on german soil .
the head of bavaria 's christian scocial union , markus soeder , said the events in the netherlands showed the need for a leitkultur in germany .
the politically-loaded word can be translated as a " leading " or " guiding " culture . " when we look at the recent events in the netherlands , we see a clash of civilizations in full , and we must prevent anything similar from evolving here , " said soeder .
" we need a change in our integration policy which ought to be based strictly on the values and notion of a modern christian society . " terrorism investigators have estimated that there are about 1,000 radical members of the country 's muslim community that are prone to violence .
like their counterparts in holland , they are members of radical mosques where imams rail against israel and western society . misusing democracy bavarian interior minister günter beckstein said the imams must no longer be allowed to preach hate under the protection of the laws of german society .
" the enemies of freedom must not be allowed to use our liberties in order to harm us , " said beckstein .
" and there has to be a policy of zero tolerance towards them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan -lrb- middle -rrb- germany 's efforts to root out muslim fundamentalists have shown mixed success .
after years of trying , the country was finally able early this fall to deport fundamentalist metin kaplan , convicted of calling for the death of a rival imam in berlin , to turkey , where he is wanted for calling for the overthrow of the country 's government . bringing young muslims into the fold but two trials against suspected accomplices of the band of hamburg terrorists that carried out the sept .
11 terrorist attacks have ended in acquittals .
and the appeals do n't look to swing in the government 's favor . though a hard line against potential fundamentalists is preferable , politicians like the green party 's volker beck said the opposite should be done for moderate , young muslims .
" social exclusion and disintegration make young muslims vulnerable to radical ideologies and hatred , " beck said .
" the way out of this dilemma is not to brand them as outlaws , but rather to let them participate in german social life .

the most controversial was italian conservative rocco buttiglione , who came up against strong resistance for his views on homosexuality and marriage .
but he is not the only one . on tuesday , the hungarian candidate , sixty-five year old laszlo kovacs has the chance to prove his worth for the customs and taxation portfolio .
he was originally nominated as energy commissioner , but performed disastrously at this first hearing in front of the parliament last month , astounding members of the parliament with his lack of knowledge on even basic matters . " from the academic point of view , i was probably wrong when i tried to define what i think of hydrogen , but i 'm to say i 'm not an academic , and not even an energy expert , " kovacs said after the hearing . should he stay or should he go although kovacs has managed to avoid the fate of buttiglione , janis emmanouilidis , an expert in european affairs at the centre for applied policy research in munich , said he believes hungary should have replaced kovacs . " there was a strong pressure to have him withdrawn , but the government in hungary strongly supported his nomination and did n't withdraw him , " he told dw-radio .
" i believe that because many parliamentarians , not only from the christian democrats but also from the socialist group , criticized him concerning his knowledge of the matter , it might have been a wise decision to have him withdrawn . " kovacs , who is the former hungarian minister for foreign affairs , is expected to face difficult questions on economics and currency , as well as domestic market and consumer protection matters .
the hearing is likely to be gruelling as parliamentarians feel that eu member states are n't take the nomination process seriously . " the european parliament is looking at its rights and exploiting its rights , " emmanouilidis said .
" it is looking for new areas to show the two other institutions in the eu that the parliament has a strong say . " the voice of experience however , he also said he believes that kovacs will bring some political know-how to the commission . " he 's one of a few politicians in the new member states with significant experience , " he said .
" he has a lot to offer from a political point of view , but concerning his technical knowledge in certain policy areas , he might be less strong . " the parliament ca n't refuse individual commissioners , only the entire commission , which means that kovac 's nomination is probably in the bag .
so , barring interview disasters , the new commission president jose manuel barroso should be able to formally present his new team for approval on thursday . kate hairsine -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso 's commission faces new confidence vote incoming eu executive head jose manuel barroso said friday he hopes for " clear " approval when eu lawmakers finally vote on his new team later this month , to end an unprecedented state of limbo in brussels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.11.2004 fighting crime and bureaucracy in the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cooperation between eu forces is an achievable , but complicated , dream eurojust , the eu body set up to investigate serious cross-border crime in the member states , faces a mountain of work .
its job is made harder by the lack of cohesion between many european institutions and organizations . human trafficking , computer crime and terrorism are just some of the crimes dealt with by eurojust , the eu authority charged with the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border and organized crime .
in addition to the specific crime areas , there are also the individual cases which flood in from all 25 member states in the european union to be dealt with .
as a body established as recently as 2002 to enhance the effectiveness of collective crime fighting , and one which has more than 1000 live cases on its books , eurojust could well claim to be one of the busiest and overwhelmed departments in the eu .
behind kilometers of razor wire , security checks and armored doors , the headquarters of eurojust in the hague is one of the most secure places in the eu .
in contrast to the heavily guarded surroundings , it also one of the most open ; welcoming magistrates , public prosecutors and secret service agents from around the bloc every month for discussions and consultations .
a forum for investigation and prosecution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurojust brings security institutions and legal teams together in an attempt to open up dialogue and create a wider network of collaborative crime prevention across the eu .
everything from organized crime to international terrorism comes to the conference table in a sign that this type collaboration has become the single most important factor in the fight against crime .
and on the surface , it appears to be working .
" there has been a case where the italians and the germans were pursuing the same criminal at the same time in drug trafficking case , " german eurojust representative hermann von langsdorff told deutsche welle .
" in this instance , the germans were about to make an arrest and the italians came to us and asked if we could persuade the germans to hold off .
they waited for one week only and as a result the whole drug ring was smashed and many arrests made . "
despite such successes , not everything works as smoothly .
von langsdorff , who works with 24 other national representatives in mediating between public prosecutor 's offices all across europe , admitted that sometimes the influx of cases is too much .
" the big problem is that eurojust can only reasonably cope with one institution at a time , " he said .
lack of recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is one of the worst offenders for not offering or accepting help .
but there are also bigger problems .
contradictorily , few member states recognize the work of eurojust .
" for example , we have barely had any coordination requests from germany , " von langsdorff said .
" in 2003 , we received only one and in 2004 , up until now , just three .
in the overall scheme of things , this is too little . "
it is as if sept .
11 , 2001 never happened in most cases .
european public prosecutors continue to sit on vital information regarding terror suspects and some do not even know that eurojust exists and can help in the passing on of vital information , according to von langsdorff .
in the increasingly important fight against international terrorism , more collaboration is needed .
borders closed to exchange of information europe 's borders are open but not always in the eyes of the public prosecutors .
to obtain the right to make searches with foreign colleagues in a bordering country and even to make phone calls to other member states in relation to investigations require special approval .
even von langsdorff and his colleagues at eurojust have their hands tied to a certain extent .
without permission from the member states involved in a case , no results or information can be exchanged without permission .
von langsdorff believes a central data bank could change all this .
" the perfect scenario would be that a phone number discovered during a search in italy could immediately be put in the system and its origin ascertained , whether this number has been linked to terrorists in germany or france , " he said .
however , von langsdorff said he believes the eu is still a long way from that level of cooperation . georg matthes -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .
but conflicts of interests and privacy issues , especially in germany , are undermining investigations .

its job is made harder by the lack of cohesion between many european institutions and organizations . human trafficking , computer crime and terrorism are just some of the crimes dealt with by eurojust , the eu authority charged with the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border and organized crime .
in addition to the specific crime areas , there are also the individual cases which flood in from all 25 member states in the european union to be dealt with .
as a body established as recently as 2002 to enhance the effectiveness of collective crime fighting , and one which has more than 1000 live cases on its books , eurojust could well claim to be one of the busiest and overwhelmed departments in the eu .
behind kilometers of razor wire , security checks and armored doors , the headquarters of eurojust in the hague is one of the most secure places in the eu .
in contrast to the heavily guarded surroundings , it also one of the most open ; welcoming magistrates , public prosecutors and secret service agents from around the bloc every month for discussions and consultations .
a forum for investigation and prosecution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurojust brings security institutions and legal teams together in an attempt to open up dialogue and create a wider network of collaborative crime prevention across the eu .
everything from organized crime to international terrorism comes to the conference table in a sign that this type collaboration has become the single most important factor in the fight against crime .
and on the surface , it appears to be working .
" there has been a case where the italians and the germans were pursuing the same criminal at the same time in drug trafficking case , " german eurojust representative hermann von langsdorff told deutsche welle .
" in this instance , the germans were about to make an arrest and the italians came to us and asked if we could persuade the germans to hold off .
they waited for one week only and as a result the whole drug ring was smashed and many arrests made . "
despite such successes , not everything works as smoothly .
von langsdorff , who works with 24 other national representatives in mediating between public prosecutor 's offices all across europe , admitted that sometimes the influx of cases is too much .
" the big problem is that eurojust can only reasonably cope with one institution at a time , " he said .
lack of recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is one of the worst offenders for not offering or accepting help .
but there are also bigger problems .
contradictorily , few member states recognize the work of eurojust .

in the overall scheme of things , this is too little . "
it is as if sept .

european public prosecutors continue to sit on vital information regarding terror suspects and some do not even know that eurojust exists and can help in the passing on of vital information , according to von langsdorff .
in the increasingly important fight against international terrorism , more collaboration is needed .
borders closed to exchange of information europe 's borders are open but not always in the eyes of the public prosecutors .
to obtain the right to make searches with foreign colleagues in a bordering country and even to make phone calls to other member states in relation to investigations require special approval .
even von langsdorff and his colleagues at eurojust have their hands tied to a certain extent .
without permission from the member states involved in a case , no results or information can be exchanged without permission .
von langsdorff believes a central data bank could change all this .
" the perfect scenario would be that a phone number discovered during a search in italy could immediately be put in the system and its origin ascertained , whether this number has been linked to terrorists in germany or france , " he said .

with new threats emerging , they 're meeting in germany on tuesday to plan for the future . next year , the alpine convention , a regional agreement for the protection and sustainable development of the alps , will celebrate its 10th anniversary .
but in the decade since european countries with part of their territory in the alps made a great leap forward and agreed to work together to find common solutions for common problems , critics say preservation efforts have not gone far enough .
meanwhile , a host of emerging threats demand urgent attention .
environment ministers meet in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch-partenkirchen sits right near the german alps in southern bavaria on tuesday , the environmental ministers of the seven permanent members of the convention , led by germany , the current chair , will meet in garmisch-partenkirchen , germany for the eighth alpine conference .
they 'll assess their successes and set out an ambitious plan for the region , a rich and diverse area encompassing 190,287 square kilometres with a population of more than 13 million .
but with the alpine convention remaining a non-binding framework with , until now , no permanent secretariat , it remains to be seen if it has the political muscle to get the job done .
regional thinking a good start with the growth of the environmental movement in the 1960 's and 1970 's an increased awareness of the threats facing the alps developed , and preservationists lobbied hard for a collective approach .
after years of wrangling , the alpine convention went into force in march of 1995 .
a framework agreement between seven european countries , it set out to limit environmental degradation by harmonizing economic and environmental policies in the region .
thus , with 13 protocols , including ones related to air and water pollution , the convention 's greatest initial achievement was that it promoted a regional way of thinking where highly territorial national policies once prevailed .

" the alpine convention increased the realization that the alps need to be treated as a region and the participants need to develop a regional way of thinking , " martin price , director of the center for mountain studies at perth college in great britain and the former chairman of the european mountain forum told dw-world .
andreas götz , the director of the international commission for the protection of the alps -lrb- cipra -rrb- agreed .
" the main thing is that a regional consciousness developed , " he told dw-world .
initial success gives way to stalled agenda in the years since it went into force , the alpine convention has not been without its successes .
a network of protected areas was created , as well as an international scientific commission for alpine research , based in bern , to study environmental threats and possible solutions .
what 's more , related initiatives , such as the alliance in the alps , founded by cipra , encouraged individual regions to share information and best practices .

" the easier issues have been solved first and the more difficult ones left until later , " price said .
meeting to jumpstart agenda ?
at the meeting in germany on tuesday , the ministers are expected to announce a six-year plan to breath new life into the convention , and the creation of a permanent secretariat based in innsbruck to oversee the revised agenda and the establishment of a monitoring mechanism to chart progress will be announced .
likewise , cipra has launched a " future of the alps " initiative , which it hopes will - on a grass roots basis - help speed up the adaptation of the individual protocols .
" we do not have a lack of knowledge , " wolfgang pfefforkorn , the director of the future of the alps initiative , told dw-world .
" we have a lack of the implementation . "
a more results-oriented agenda , with a regular " state of the alps " report would be a good start , werner baetzing , an expert in alpine research at the university of erlangen in germany told dw-world .

chief among them : global warming , which will affect the region in a number of different ways , including , possibly precipitating the end of ski-related tourism .
according to a report released last year by the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , up to half of all alpine ski resorts in france , austria and switzerland may be forced to close over the next fifty years if current global warming trends continue and the snowline rises another 300 meters to 1800 meters above sea level .
in response , the owners of the threatened resorts are looking to build so-called " second generation ski resorts " above the revised snowline among the alps ' highest peeks and glaciers despite strict laws preventing further development .
in may , in the tirol , they succeeded .
the local government ruled to relax the law , paving the way for two major projects .
michel revaz , the deputy director of cipra told dw-world that he is worried the move will spark a dangerous game one upmanship among european ski resorts .
" now that it 's happened in austria , all the others will want to do the same , " he told dw-world .
he would prefer to see the affected regions look for an alternatives to ski tourism , rather than colonizing the alps remaining pristine peaks .

a network of protected areas was created , as well as an international scientific commission for alpine research , based in bern , to study environmental threats and possible solutions .

meeting to jumpstart agenda ?
at the meeting in germany on tuesday , the ministers are expected to announce a six-year plan to breath new life into the convention , and the creation of a permanent secretariat based in innsbruck to oversee the revised agenda and the establishment of a monitoring mechanism to chart progress will be announced .
likewise , cipra has launched a " future of the alps " initiative , which it hopes will - on a grass roots basis - help speed up the adaptation of the individual protocols .
" we do not have a lack of knowledge , " wolfgang pfefforkorn , the director of the future of the alps initiative , told dw-world .

chief among them : global warming , which will affect the region in a number of different ways , including , possibly precipitating the end of ski-related tourism .
according to a report released last year by the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , up to half of all alpine ski resorts in france , austria and switzerland may be forced to close over the next fifty years if current global warming trends continue and the snowline rises another 300 meters to 1800 meters above sea level .
in response , the owners of the threatened resorts are looking to build so-called " second generation ski resorts " above the revised snowline among the alps ' highest peeks and glaciers despite strict laws preventing further development .
in may , in the tirol , they succeeded .
the local government ruled to relax the law , paving the way for two major projects .
michel revaz , the deputy director of cipra told dw-world that he is worried the move will spark a dangerous game one upmanship among european ski resorts .

" our small genius is ... at the moon , " a delighted southwood declared . the probe achieved lunar orbit at 17:53 gmt on monday , and on tuesday was looping the moon at a height of 5,000-6000 kilometers -lrb- 3,000-3,500 miles -rrb- , smart-1 project manager giuseppe racca said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart-1 will gently spiral closer to the lunar surface , eventually stabilizing in an egg-shaped polar orbit that will vary from 300 kilometers -lrb- 187 miles -rrb- at the south pole to 3,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,870 miles -rrb- at the north pole . the 370-kilo -lrb- 814-pound -rrb- probe has been using a slow but revolutionary form of propulsion , taking it in ever-widening circles around the earth and using terrestrial gravity as a slingshot , to get to the moon . it is powered by an ion engine , which converts solar power into electricity that then charges atoms of the heavy gas xenon . these charged atoms , known as ions , are then disgorged from the back of the probe to give it thrust . slow , but persistent the motor is initially slow - launched on sept .
27 , 2003 , smart-1 took more than 13 months to make a trip achieved in three days by the chemical rockets of the apollo era - but speed gradually builds up in the frictionless environment of space , making ion power ideal for trips into the depths of the solar system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this artist 's rendition released by the european space agency , the european-made smart-1 solar-powered satellite is seen nearing the moon on its way to make the first comprehensive inventory of key chemical elements in the lunar surface .
smart-1 -lrb- photo -rrb- clocked up 332 orbits around earth and travelled more than 84 million kilometers -lrb- 52.5 million miles -rrb- , " a distance comparable to an interplanetary cruise , " esa pointed out in a press statement . it fired its engines 289 times , operating them for a total of about 3,700 hours , and sipped just 59 kilos -lrb- 129.8 pounds -rrb- of its 80 kilos -lrb- 176 pounds -rrb- of xenon gas .
space rockets typically carry tonnes of chemical fuel , which thus crimps the size of the payload . so much fuel has been saved that smart-1 will be placed in a closer approach to the moon for the scientific phase of the mission . " the performance -lsb- of the motor -rsb- has been better than we expected , " said giorgio saccoccia , head of esa propulsion division .
" we would certainly want to have it onboard in the future . " it is only the second time that ion propulsion has been used as a space mission 's primary propulsion system .
the first was nasa 's deep space 1 probe , launched in october 1998 . scanning the moon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after achieving its final orbit on jan .
13 , 2005 , smart-1 will start a six-month scan of the moon , using a big payload of sensors that are also a test bench of miniaturization . one of the spacecraft 's tasks is to check out hopes that deep craters near the moon 's poles may harbour water ice , a discovery that would be a huge boost for setting up a human settlement . and it will also explore theories as to the origin of the moon . the prevailing notion is that the moon was born from the earth - a mass of terrestrial mantle that was smashed away when earth was hit by a mars-sized object in the infancy of the solar system . this mass of rock and debris then re-condensed to become earth 's satellite , according to this theory . " with our x-ray eyes , we want to trace the moon 's beginnings , " said bernard foing , smart-1 project scientist . much is already known about the moon , thanks to robot craft and the manned us missions of the early sixties and seventies , but scientists say there are also many unknowns . smart-1 is the first in a flotilla of unmanned probes to earth 's companion .
missions have been planned in the coming years by china , india , japan and the united states . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new clues to life on mars concentrations of water vapor and methane gas in certain regions of the red planet strengthen speculation that mars could be a haven for microbial life .

" our small genius is ... at the moon , " a delighted southwood declared . the probe achieved lunar orbit at 17:53 gmt on monday , and on tuesday was looping the moon at a height of 5,000-6000 kilometers -lrb- 3,000-3,500 miles -rrb- , smart-1 project manager giuseppe racca said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart-1 will gently spiral closer to the lunar surface , eventually stabilizing in an egg-shaped polar orbit that will vary from 300 kilometers -lrb- 187 miles -rrb- at the south pole to 3,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,870 miles -rrb- at the north pole . the 370-kilo -lrb- 814-pound -rrb- probe has been using a slow but revolutionary form of propulsion , taking it in ever-widening circles around the earth and using terrestrial gravity as a slingshot , to get to the moon . it is powered by an ion engine , which converts solar power into electricity that then charges atoms of the heavy gas xenon . these charged atoms , known as ions , are then disgorged from the back of the probe to give it thrust . slow , but persistent the motor is initially slow - launched on sept .
27 , 2003 , smart-1 took more than 13 months to make a trip achieved in three days by the chemical rockets of the apollo era - but speed gradually builds up in the frictionless environment of space , making ion power ideal for trips into the depths of the solar system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this artist 's rendition released by the european space agency , the european-made smart-1 solar-powered satellite is seen nearing the moon on its way to make the first comprehensive inventory of key chemical elements in the lunar surface .

space rockets typically carry tonnes of chemical fuel , which thus crimps the size of the payload . so much fuel has been saved that smart-1 will be placed in a closer approach to the moon for the scientific phase of the mission . " the performance -lsb- of the motor -rsb- has been better than we expected , " said giorgio saccoccia , head of esa propulsion division .

there are fanatics everywhere ; especially in these times , where religion is increasingly being misused for political purposes . differences should be respected in opposition to the rhetoric since the van gogh murder the only solution can be the continued integration of those of other faiths - and not just muslims .
integration also should not mean giving up one 's identity . differences should be respected .
but they should align themselves under the still-generous european constitutional system .
those that want to live here need to obey the societal and democratic system otherwise they will continually be out of place . but this system needs to deal with " the others " with as much freedom , liberality and tolerance for which the pessimists are criticizing holland . art has its borders these critics do n't address the fact that the director , through a well-intended but visually provocative film , deeply hurt the feelings of faithful muslims .
it is no justification for violence , but as the worldwide debate over the jesus film -lrb- mel gibson 's " the passion " -rrb- and other cases showed , art can and is n't borderless , because it always finds its border with the other person 's freedom . if liberalism and tolerance have failed anywhere , then it is here . peter philipp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe faces new integration challenges the current wave of violence against muslims in the netherlands has forced all of europe to stop and examine the problems of integration .

goleo the lion was revealed as the official mascot for the 2006 world cup this weekend .
while fame and fortune beckons for the face of the soccer spectacular , goleo will find out it 's not all furry handshakes and waving . with great power comes great responsibility , something goleo - the newly revealed official mascot of the 2006 world cup - will soon learn .
the tall and imposing , although very approachable looking , lion becomes the latest in a long line of fake animals to become the figurehead of a major sporting event .
goleo will spend the next 18 months preparing for the global soccer showcase in germany , where he will stir the crowded stadiums and inspire millions of spectators around the world .
during that time , goleo 's face will become synonymous with the world cup in germany and the harmonious message of fair play that will no doubt be promoted throughout the entirety of the month-long tournament .
global superstardom and worldwide recognition awaits him .
he looks happy enough , but is he ready ?
such a high profile position comes with its own set of intense pressures .
goleo will not even be able to enjoy a quiet gazelle without a pack of paparazzi snappers being on hand to record his every bite and maul .
so what can the mascot of the 2006 world cup expect ?
if everything goes right , goleo could be the next misha the bear .
the mascot of the olympic games of 1980 went on to become one of the best loved and most marketable figureheads in sporting history , so much so that many people forget the us boycott of the moscow games - in protest of the december 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan - and remember them for the cute little teddy bear who even cried at the closing ceremony .
memorable misha endures misha 's tale should give the german lion some hope .
regardless of how well his countrymen perform at the world cup , goleo could still come out of the tournament smelling of roses .
a successful stint as the face of the 2006 tournament could bode well for a future career away from the sporting spotlight .
goleo may want to look to the example set by english soccer team hartlepool united 's h 'angus the monkey .
the all-singing , all-dancing mascot of the yorkshire club enjoyed a long career aping around for the hartlepool faithful and made such an impression on the town that in may 2002 , he was elected town mayor .
but while the world may be an oyster - or in goleo 's case , a wildebeest - for the successful mascot , there are pitfalls .
as with any celebrity , there are temptations for the sporting mascot , such as unscrupulous types waiting to accelerate their downfall for their own gains by exploiting any furry foot put wrong .
the seedier side of the mascot life is just a flip of the coin away .
when fake animals attack take wolfie , the mascot of another english soccer team , wolverhampton wanderers .
wolfie used to rally the crowds with playful and endearing kick-arounds with the opposing mascots before his team took to the pitch .
that is until the arrival of bristol city 's three little pigs .
in front of a television audience of millions , wolfie lost his cool in the pre-match contest and ended up battling all three pigs in a pitch-side punch-up .
needless to say , he never worked in that town again .
as the only official mascot of the world cup , goleo may not have any rivals to face and so potential fisticuffs should be avoided .
but even if he keeps his cold , wet nose clean , goleo must go into this new phase with his eyes open to the realities .

the most controversial was italian conservative rocco buttiglione , who came up against strong resistance for his views on homosexuality and marriage .
but he is not the only one . on tuesday , the hungarian candidate , sixty-five year old laszlo kovacs has the chance to prove his worth for the customs and taxation portfolio .
he was originally nominated as energy commissioner , but performed disastrously at this first hearing in front of the parliament last month , astounding members of the parliament with his lack of knowledge on even basic matters . " from the academic point of view , i was probably wrong when i tried to define what i think of hydrogen , but i 'm to say i 'm not an academic , and not even an energy expert , " kovacs said after the hearing . should he stay or should he go although kovacs has managed to avoid the fate of buttiglione , janis emmanouilidis , an expert in european affairs at the centre for applied policy research in munich , said he believes hungary should have replaced kovacs . " there was a strong pressure to have him withdrawn , but the government in hungary strongly supported his nomination and did n't withdraw him , " he told dw-radio .
" i believe that because many parliamentarians , not only from the christian democrats but also from the socialist group , criticized him concerning his knowledge of the matter , it might have been a wise decision to have him withdrawn . " kovacs , who is the former hungarian minister for foreign affairs , is expected to face difficult questions on economics and currency , as well as domestic market and consumer protection matters .
the hearing is likely to be gruelling as parliamentarians feel that eu member states are n't take the nomination process seriously . " the european parliament is looking at its rights and exploiting its rights , " emmanouilidis said .
" it is looking for new areas to show the two other institutions in the eu that the parliament has a strong say . " the voice of experience however , he also said he believes that kovacs will bring some political know-how to the commission . " he 's one of a few politicians in the new member states with significant experience , " he said .
" he has a lot to offer from a political point of view , but concerning his technical knowledge in certain policy areas , he might be less strong . " the parliament ca n't refuse individual commissioners , only the entire commission , which means that kovac 's nomination is probably in the bag .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.11.2004 row over plan for german in mosques großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would have moslems pray in german a proposal for the enforcement of german as a spoken language in mosques has erupted in germany as politicians look for ways to reform the country 's integration policy in the wake of violence in the netherlands . a regional politician 's proposal that prayers in german mosques should be said in german was greeted with dismay on monday amid fears that anti-muslim attacks may spread over the border from the netherlands .
annette schavan , the christian democratic education minister for the state of baden-württemberg and a contender for the state 's premiership , made her radical proposal at the weekend because , she said , " we can no longer accept that prayers in mosques should be said in languages that can not be understood outside the muslim community . "
schavan 's proposal comes in the wake of the torching of mosques , schools and churches in the netherlands following the killing of film director theo van gogh , whose work was strongly critical of muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her suggestion drew a sharp reaction from the leaders of the more than two and a half million turks who live in germany .
" this is nonsense - terror can be spread in any language , " said kenan kolat , the co-president of the turkish community in germany .
cornelie sonntag-wolgast , a representative of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on the national parliamentary committee for domestic affairs also criticized the proposal .
" we can not suspect each and every person ... of violence just because they say their prayers in arabic , " said sonntag-wolgast .
volker beck , a spokesman for the greens , the junior partner in the governing coalition , said schavan 's proposal was " completely exaggerated " while liberal fdp interior minister max stadler criticized schavan , saying her proposal for the state to enforce the german language in mosques was " an offense against basic law . "
werner schiffauer , a cultural professor said , schavan 's plan was " out-of-touch and impractical " , a view supported by jürgen micksch , the chairperson of the intercultural council in germany .
professor schiffauer stated that there was little money available to provide language training for the large numbers of islamic preachers in germany and that , in addition , many foreigners living in germany stayed for only a short time and were dependent on mother-tongue services while they were there .
some support idea however , nadeem elyas , the chairman for the central council of muslims in germany , agreed with the proposal .
elyas explained that a lot of mosques already translate their prayers and sermons and offer simultaneous audio feeds in both arabic and german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mosque in berlin neukölln .
the council , he said , is made up of 19 organizations and about 500 mosque municipalities in germany , not all of which cater for purely arabic speakers .
elyas added that german , turkish , arabian , albanian , bosnian and persian muslims all worship in germany and many have different language requirements .
call for islamic holiday the row over schaven 's proposal comes at a time when germany seems desperate to define its integration policy and avoid copycat violence spreading across the border from the neighboring netherlands .
just a day after schaven 's proposal was revealed , a member of the green party in germany called for the government to install an official islamic holiday in the german calendar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele .
hans-christian ströbele was quoted in the die welt newspaper on tuesday saying that a holiday directly after the fasting period of ramadan could be one possibility , an idea supported by environment minister jürgen trittin . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de holland prompts soul-searching in germany as is the case in other parts of europe , the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh has prompted some serious soul-searching in germany , where politicians of every stripe are mulling integration .

annette schavan , the christian democratic education minister for the state of baden-württemberg and a contender for the state 's premiership , made her radical proposal at the weekend because , she said , " we can no longer accept that prayers in mosques should be said in languages that can not be understood outside the muslim community . "
schavan 's proposal comes in the wake of the torching of mosques , schools and churches in the netherlands following the killing of film director theo van gogh , whose work was strongly critical of muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her suggestion drew a sharp reaction from the leaders of the more than two and a half million turks who live in germany .
" this is nonsense - terror can be spread in any language , " said kenan kolat , the co-president of the turkish community in germany .
cornelie sonntag-wolgast , a representative of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on the national parliamentary committee for domestic affairs also criticized the proposal .
" we can not suspect each and every person ... of violence just because they say their prayers in arabic , " said sonntag-wolgast .
volker beck , a spokesman for the greens , the junior partner in the governing coalition , said schavan 's proposal was " completely exaggerated " while liberal fdp interior minister max stadler criticized schavan , saying her proposal for the state to enforce the german language in mosques was " an offense against basic law . "
werner schiffauer , a cultural professor said , schavan 's plan was " out-of-touch and impractical " , a view supported by jürgen micksch , the chairperson of the intercultural council in germany .
professor schiffauer stated that there was little money available to provide language training for the large numbers of islamic preachers in germany and that , in addition , many foreigners living in germany stayed for only a short time and were dependent on mother-tongue services while they were there .
some support idea however , nadeem elyas , the chairman for the central council of muslims in germany , agreed with the proposal .
elyas explained that a lot of mosques already translate their prayers and sermons and offer simultaneous audio feeds in both arabic and german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mosque in berlin neukölln .
the council , he said , is made up of 19 organizations and about 500 mosque municipalities in germany , not all of which cater for purely arabic speakers .
elyas added that german , turkish , arabian , albanian , bosnian and persian muslims all worship in germany and many have different language requirements .
call for islamic holiday the row over schaven 's proposal comes at a time when germany seems desperate to define its integration policy and avoid copycat violence spreading across the border from the neighboring netherlands .
just a day after schaven 's proposal was revealed , a member of the green party in germany called for the government to install an official islamic holiday in the german calendar .

the most controversial was italian conservative rocco buttiglione , who came up against strong resistance for his views on homosexuality and marriage .
but he is not the only one . on tuesday , the hungarian candidate , sixty-five year old laszlo kovacs has the chance to prove his worth for the customs and taxation portfolio .
he was originally nominated as energy commissioner , but performed disastrously at this first hearing in front of the parliament last month , astounding members of the parliament with his lack of knowledge on even basic matters . " from the academic point of view , i was probably wrong when i tried to define what i think of hydrogen , but i 'm to say i 'm not an academic , and not even an energy expert , " kovacs said after the hearing . should he stay or should he go although kovacs has managed to avoid the fate of buttiglione , janis emmanouilidis , an expert in european affairs at the centre for applied policy research in munich , said he believes hungary should have replaced kovacs . " there was a strong pressure to have him withdrawn , but the government in hungary strongly supported his nomination and did n't withdraw him , " he told dw-radio .
" i believe that because many parliamentarians , not only from the christian democrats but also from the socialist group , criticized him concerning his knowledge of the matter , it might have been a wise decision to have him withdrawn . " kovacs , who is the former hungarian minister for foreign affairs , is expected to face difficult questions on economics and currency , as well as domestic market and consumer protection matters .
the hearing is likely to be gruelling as parliamentarians feel that eu member states are n't take the nomination process seriously . " the european parliament is looking at its rights and exploiting its rights , " emmanouilidis said .
" it is looking for new areas to show the two other institutions in the eu that the parliament has a strong say . " the voice of experience however , he also said he believes that kovacs will bring some political know-how to the commission . " he 's one of a few politicians in the new member states with significant experience , " he said .
" he has a lot to offer from a political point of view , but concerning his technical knowledge in certain policy areas , he might be less strong . " the parliament ca n't refuse individual commissioners , only the entire commission , which means that kovac 's nomination is probably in the bag .

annette schavan , the christian democratic education minister for the state of baden-württemberg and a contender for the state 's premiership , made her radical proposal at the weekend because , she said , " we can no longer accept that prayers in mosques should be said in languages that can not be understood outside the muslim community . "
schavan 's proposal comes in the wake of the torching of mosques , schools and churches in the netherlands following the killing of film director theo van gogh , whose work was strongly critical of muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her suggestion drew a sharp reaction from the leaders of the more than two and a half million turks who live in germany .
" this is nonsense - terror can be spread in any language , " said kenan kolat , the co-president of the turkish community in germany .
cornelie sonntag-wolgast , a representative of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on the national parliamentary committee for domestic affairs also criticized the proposal .
" we can not suspect each and every person ... of violence just because they say their prayers in arabic , " said sonntag-wolgast .
volker beck , a spokesman for the greens , the junior partner in the governing coalition , said schavan 's proposal was " completely exaggerated " while liberal fdp interior minister max stadler criticized schavan , saying her proposal for the state to enforce the german language in mosques was " an offense against basic law . "
werner schiffauer , a cultural professor said , schavan 's plan was " out-of-touch and impractical " , a view supported by jürgen micksch , the chairperson of the intercultural council in germany .
professor schiffauer stated that there was little money available to provide language training for the large numbers of islamic preachers in germany and that , in addition , many foreigners living in germany stayed for only a short time and were dependent on mother-tongue services while they were there .
some support idea however , nadeem elyas , the chairman for the central council of muslims in germany , agreed with the proposal .
elyas explained that a lot of mosques already translate their prayers and sermons and offer simultaneous audio feeds in both arabic and german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mosque in berlin neukölln .
the council , he said , is made up of 19 organizations and about 500 mosque municipalities in germany , not all of which cater for purely arabic speakers .
elyas added that german , turkish , arabian , albanian , bosnian and persian muslims all worship in germany and many have different language requirements .
call for islamic holiday the row over schaven 's proposal comes at a time when germany seems desperate to define its integration policy and avoid copycat violence spreading across the border from the neighboring netherlands .
just a day after schaven 's proposal was revealed , a member of the green party in germany called for the government to install an official islamic holiday in the german calendar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele .

its job is made harder by the lack of cohesion between many european institutions and organizations . human trafficking , computer crime and terrorism are just some of the crimes dealt with by eurojust , the eu authority charged with the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border and organized crime .
in addition to the specific crime areas , there are also the individual cases which flood in from all 25 member states in the european union to be dealt with .
as a body established as recently as 2002 to enhance the effectiveness of collective crime fighting , and one which has more than 1000 live cases on its books , eurojust could well claim to be one of the busiest and overwhelmed departments in the eu .
behind kilometers of razor wire , security checks and armored doors , the headquarters of eurojust in the hague is one of the most secure places in the eu .
in contrast to the heavily guarded surroundings , it also one of the most open ; welcoming magistrates , public prosecutors and secret service agents from around the bloc every month for discussions and consultations .
a forum for investigation and prosecution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurojust brings security institutions and legal teams together in an attempt to open up dialogue and create a wider network of collaborative crime prevention across the eu .
everything from organized crime to international terrorism comes to the conference table in a sign that this type collaboration has become the single most important factor in the fight against crime .
and on the surface , it appears to be working .
" there has been a case where the italians and the germans were pursuing the same criminal at the same time in drug trafficking case , " german eurojust representative hermann von langsdorff told deutsche welle .
" in this instance , the germans were about to make an arrest and the italians came to us and asked if we could persuade the germans to hold off .
they waited for one week only and as a result the whole drug ring was smashed and many arrests made . "
despite such successes , not everything works as smoothly .
von langsdorff , who works with 24 other national representatives in mediating between public prosecutor 's offices all across europe , admitted that sometimes the influx of cases is too much .
" the big problem is that eurojust can only reasonably cope with one institution at a time , " he said .
lack of recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is one of the worst offenders for not offering or accepting help .
but there are also bigger problems .
contradictorily , few member states recognize the work of eurojust .
" for example , we have barely had any coordination requests from germany , " von langsdorff said .
" in 2003 , we received only one and in 2004 , up until now , just three .
in the overall scheme of things , this is too little . "
it is as if sept .
11 , 2001 never happened in most cases .
european public prosecutors continue to sit on vital information regarding terror suspects and some do not even know that eurojust exists and can help in the passing on of vital information , according to von langsdorff .
in the increasingly important fight against international terrorism , more collaboration is needed .
borders closed to exchange of information europe 's borders are open but not always in the eyes of the public prosecutors .
to obtain the right to make searches with foreign colleagues in a bordering country and even to make phone calls to other member states in relation to investigations require special approval .
even von langsdorff and his colleagues at eurojust have their hands tied to a certain extent .
without permission from the member states involved in a case , no results or information can be exchanged without permission .
von langsdorff believes a central data bank could change all this .
" the perfect scenario would be that a phone number discovered during a search in italy could immediately be put in the system and its origin ascertained , whether this number has been linked to terrorists in germany or france , " he said .
however , von langsdorff said he believes the eu is still a long way from that level of cooperation . georg matthes -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.11.2004 fighting crime and bureaucracy in the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cooperation between eu forces is an achievable , but complicated , dream eurojust , the eu body set up to investigate serious cross-border crime in the member states , faces a mountain of work .
its job is made harder by the lack of cohesion between many european institutions and organizations . human trafficking , computer crime and terrorism are just some of the crimes dealt with by eurojust , the eu authority charged with the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border and organized crime .
in addition to the specific crime areas , there are also the individual cases which flood in from all 25 member states in the european union to be dealt with .
as a body established as recently as 2002 to enhance the effectiveness of collective crime fighting , and one which has more than 1000 live cases on its books , eurojust could well claim to be one of the busiest and overwhelmed departments in the eu .
behind kilometers of razor wire , security checks and armored doors , the headquarters of eurojust in the hague is one of the most secure places in the eu .
in contrast to the heavily guarded surroundings , it also one of the most open ; welcoming magistrates , public prosecutors and secret service agents from around the bloc every month for discussions and consultations .
a forum for investigation and prosecution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurojust brings security institutions and legal teams together in an attempt to open up dialogue and create a wider network of collaborative crime prevention across the eu .
everything from organized crime to international terrorism comes to the conference table in a sign that this type collaboration has become the single most important factor in the fight against crime .
and on the surface , it appears to be working .
" there has been a case where the italians and the germans were pursuing the same criminal at the same time in drug trafficking case , " german eurojust representative hermann von langsdorff told deutsche welle .
" in this instance , the germans were about to make an arrest and the italians came to us and asked if we could persuade the germans to hold off .
they waited for one week only and as a result the whole drug ring was smashed and many arrests made . "
despite such successes , not everything works as smoothly .
von langsdorff , who works with 24 other national representatives in mediating between public prosecutor 's offices all across europe , admitted that sometimes the influx of cases is too much .
" the big problem is that eurojust can only reasonably cope with one institution at a time , " he said .
lack of recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is one of the worst offenders for not offering or accepting help .
but there are also bigger problems .
contradictorily , few member states recognize the work of eurojust .
" for example , we have barely had any coordination requests from germany , " von langsdorff said .
" in 2003 , we received only one and in 2004 , up until now , just three .
in the overall scheme of things , this is too little . "
it is as if sept .
11 , 2001 never happened in most cases .
european public prosecutors continue to sit on vital information regarding terror suspects and some do not even know that eurojust exists and can help in the passing on of vital information , according to von langsdorff .
in the increasingly important fight against international terrorism , more collaboration is needed .
borders closed to exchange of information europe 's borders are open but not always in the eyes of the public prosecutors .
to obtain the right to make searches with foreign colleagues in a bordering country and even to make phone calls to other member states in relation to investigations require special approval .
even von langsdorff and his colleagues at eurojust have their hands tied to a certain extent .
without permission from the member states involved in a case , no results or information can be exchanged without permission .
von langsdorff believes a central data bank could change all this .
" the perfect scenario would be that a phone number discovered during a search in italy could immediately be put in the system and its origin ascertained , whether this number has been linked to terrorists in germany or france , " he said .
however , von langsdorff said he believes the eu is still a long way from that level of cooperation . georg matthes -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .
but conflicts of interests and privacy issues , especially in germany , are undermining investigations .

the most controversial was italian conservative rocco buttiglione , who came up against strong resistance for his views on homosexuality and marriage .
but he is not the only one . on tuesday , the hungarian candidate , sixty-five year old laszlo kovacs has the chance to prove his worth for the customs and taxation portfolio .
he was originally nominated as energy commissioner , but performed disastrously at this first hearing in front of the parliament last month , astounding members of the parliament with his lack of knowledge on even basic matters . " from the academic point of view , i was probably wrong when i tried to define what i think of hydrogen , but i 'm to say i 'm not an academic , and not even an energy expert , " kovacs said after the hearing . should he stay or should he go although kovacs has managed to avoid the fate of buttiglione , janis emmanouilidis , an expert in european affairs at the centre for applied policy research in munich , said he believes hungary should have replaced kovacs . " there was a strong pressure to have him withdrawn , but the government in hungary strongly supported his nomination and did n't withdraw him , " he told dw-radio .
" i believe that because many parliamentarians , not only from the christian democrats but also from the socialist group , criticized him concerning his knowledge of the matter , it might have been a wise decision to have him withdrawn . " kovacs , who is the former hungarian minister for foreign affairs , is expected to face difficult questions on economics and currency , as well as domestic market and consumer protection matters .
the hearing is likely to be gruelling as parliamentarians feel that eu member states are n't take the nomination process seriously . " the european parliament is looking at its rights and exploiting its rights , " emmanouilidis said .
" it is looking for new areas to show the two other institutions in the eu that the parliament has a strong say . " the voice of experience however , he also said he believes that kovacs will bring some political know-how to the commission . " he 's one of a few politicians in the new member states with significant experience , " he said .
" he has a lot to offer from a political point of view , but concerning his technical knowledge in certain policy areas , he might be less strong . " the parliament ca n't refuse individual commissioners , only the entire commission , which means that kovac 's nomination is probably in the bag .

however , the greek government has pledged to halve this deficit in 2005 .

countries are not permitted to run a budget deficit above 3 percent of gdp before joining the euro or – in theory – during their membership of the euro zone .
however , despite the inaccurate data submitted by athens , their membership of the euro in 2001 is not in question , according to commission officials .
a spokesman for economics and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said there was " no possibility " of withdrawing greece from the 12 country zone although its acceptance was granted on false data .
greece ’ s budget deficit is forecast to be as high as 5.3 percent this year , following spiralling costs from the olympic games , which were recently revealed to have cost twice as much as athens had budgeted .
however , the greek government has pledged to halve this deficit in 2005 .
at a press conference , almunia confirmed that he would recommend to the incoming barroso commission to take " infringement procedures " against greece " as soon as possible . "
but the decision to admit greece into the euro zone was " made with the best available data at the time and it -lsb- the decision -rsb- is not called into question , " added the commissioner .

they said the announcement would come on tuesday . bush plans to turn to deputy national security adviser stephen hadley to replace rice , who is one of the president 's closest advisers and confidants , said the officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity . rice , who was 50 on sunday , has been tipped for months as a leading contender to succeed powell .
she is a fluent russian speaker and an expert on arms control . hadley , who advised bush on foreign policy during the 2000 election campaign and took office in january 2001 , was also the favorite to take over as national security adviser . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush , right , and secretary of state colin powell powell indicated that he has been in longstanding discussions with the president about leaving . " as we have discussed in recent months , i believe that now that the election is over , the time has come for me to step down as secretary of state and return to private life , " powell , 67 , said in a letter to bush . deputy secretary of state richard armitage , 59 , was also likely to step down , officials said . the white house also announced the departure of agriculture secretary ann veneman , energy secretary spencer abraham and education secretary rod paige .
attorney general john ashcroft and commerce secretary don evans quit last week . but powell has created the greatest stir , depriving the administration of a highly regarded voice on the international scene at a time when bush hoped to mend fences after the iraq war and revive middle east peace talks . bush described powell as " a soldier , a diplomat , a civic leader , a statesman and a great patriot , " and praised his work over the past four years . powell " is one of the great public servants of our time , " bush said in a statement . international tributes tributes also flowed in from around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell and fischer in berlin in april german foreign minister joschka fischer considered powell a close friend as well as a colleague .
speaking to reporters following powell 's resignation , fischer said the secretary was a man who understood germany very well , from his time here as a soldier .
despite policy differences between the two countries , fischer said he never found it difficult to communicate with his counterpart . " i want to thank him , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
" we worked very closely together and even in the most critical issues , always as friends ...
i wish him all the best in the future . " un secretary general kofi annan had a " very warm working relationship " with powell and especially appreciated " support for the united nations and for multilateral approaches to problem-solving , " said annan spokesman fred eckhard . british prime minister tony blair called powell " a remarkable man who has been a good friend to this country over a very long period . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer also praised his country 's cooperation with powell . japanese government spokesman hiroyuki hosodan expressed disappointment but said powell 's resignation would not affect the strong alliance between the united states and japan . " as an extremely well-balanced secretary of state , he did a great job , " he said of powell . australian foreign minister alexander downer said powell had been a great friend to australia who helped fight terrorism in asia . " we will certainly miss him , " he said . powell is the son of jamaican immigrants who rose to become a four star general and then the highest ranking african american to serve in the us government .
as rice is also a black the changeover will again be a first in us administration history . timing unexpected the timing of the resignation announcement was unexpected , as powell plans to visit the middle east after the death of palestinian patriarch yasser arafat . the palestinians ' foreign minister , nabil shaath , said powell would visit next week .
the state department said no date had been set . powell , scheduled to attend an asian economic summit in chile this week , a conference on iraq in egypt next week and perhaps a spate of european meetings in december , denied his resignation would affect his work . " i expect to act fully as secretary of state until i do leave .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.11.2004 tackling alpine preservation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under threat it 's been almost a decade since european countries decided to work together to preserve the alps .
with new threats emerging , they 're meeting in germany on tuesday to plan for the future . next year , the alpine convention , a regional agreement for the protection and sustainable development of the alps , will celebrate its 10th anniversary .
but in the decade since european countries with part of their territory in the alps made a great leap forward and agreed to work together to find common solutions for common problems , critics say preservation efforts have not gone far enough .
meanwhile , a host of emerging threats demand urgent attention .
environment ministers meet in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch-partenkirchen sits right near the german alps in southern bavaria on tuesday , the environmental ministers of the seven permanent members of the convention , led by germany , the current chair , will meet in garmisch-partenkirchen , germany for the eighth alpine conference .
they 'll assess their successes and set out an ambitious plan for the region , a rich and diverse area encompassing 190,287 square kilometres with a population of more than 13 million .
but with the alpine convention remaining a non-binding framework with , until now , no permanent secretariat , it remains to be seen if it has the political muscle to get the job done .
regional thinking a good start with the growth of the environmental movement in the 1960 's and 1970 's an increased awareness of the threats facing the alps developed , and preservationists lobbied hard for a collective approach .
after years of wrangling , the alpine convention went into force in march of 1995 .
a framework agreement between seven european countries , it set out to limit environmental degradation by harmonizing economic and environmental policies in the region .
thus , with 13 protocols , including ones related to air and water pollution , the convention 's greatest initial achievement was that it promoted a regional way of thinking where highly territorial national policies once prevailed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morteratsch glacier in switzerland has been melting at a rapid pace .
" the alpine convention increased the realization that the alps need to be treated as a region and the participants need to develop a regional way of thinking , " martin price , director of the center for mountain studies at perth college in great britain and the former chairman of the european mountain forum told dw-world .
andreas götz , the director of the international commission for the protection of the alps -lrb- cipra -rrb- agreed .
" the main thing is that a regional consciousness developed , " he told dw-world .
initial success gives way to stalled agenda in the years since it went into force , the alpine convention has not been without its successes .
a network of protected areas was created , as well as an international scientific commission for alpine research , based in bern , to study environmental threats and possible solutions .
what 's more , related initiatives , such as the alliance in the alps , founded by cipra , encouraged individual regions to share information and best practices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a paraglider is flying in front of the alps down from the brauneck mountain near bad tölz in southern germany .
but after an initial flutter of activity , some say efforts have stalled .
though lots of data was collected and inter-regional relationships were forged , the tough issues - inter-state transportation , the effects of global warming , the impactof depopulation - have not been directly tackled .
" the easier issues have been solved first and the more difficult ones left until later , " price said .
meeting to jumpstart agenda ?
at the meeting in germany on tuesday , the ministers are expected to announce a six-year plan to breath new life into the convention , and the creation of a permanent secretariat based in innsbruck to oversee the revised agenda and the establishment of a monitoring mechanism to chart progress will be announced .
likewise , cipra has launched a " future of the alps " initiative , which it hopes will - on a grass roots basis - help speed up the adaptation of the individual protocols .
" we do not have a lack of knowledge , " wolfgang pfefforkorn , the director of the future of the alps initiative , told dw-world .
" we have a lack of the implementation . "
a more results-oriented agenda , with a regular " state of the alps " report would be a good start , werner baetzing , an expert in alpine research at the university of erlangen in germany told dw-world .
new ski resorts threaten highest peaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steeple of the church in the liechtenstein village of triesenberg is seen in front of the alvierkette mountain chain in the swiss alps .
a renewed commitment to alpine preservation could not come at a better time .
new threats are emerging , illustrating the alps delicate state .
chief among them : global warming , which will affect the region in a number of different ways , including , possibly precipitating the end of ski-related tourism .
according to a report released last year by the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , up to half of all alpine ski resorts in france , austria and switzerland may be forced to close over the next fifty years if current global warming trends continue and the snowline rises another 300 meters to 1800 meters above sea level .
in response , the owners of the threatened resorts are looking to build so-called " second generation ski resorts " above the revised snowline among the alps ' highest peeks and glaciers despite strict laws preventing further development .
in may , in the tirol , they succeeded .
the local government ruled to relax the law , paving the way for two major projects .

with new threats emerging , they 're meeting in germany on tuesday to plan for the future . next year , the alpine convention , a regional agreement for the protection and sustainable development of the alps , will celebrate its 10th anniversary .
but in the decade since european countries with part of their territory in the alps made a great leap forward and agreed to work together to find common solutions for common problems , critics say preservation efforts have not gone far enough .
meanwhile , a host of emerging threats demand urgent attention .
environment ministers meet in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch-partenkirchen sits right near the german alps in southern bavaria on tuesday , the environmental ministers of the seven permanent members of the convention , led by germany , the current chair , will meet in garmisch-partenkirchen , germany for the eighth alpine conference .
they 'll assess their successes and set out an ambitious plan for the region , a rich and diverse area encompassing 190,287 square kilometres with a population of more than 13 million .
but with the alpine convention remaining a non-binding framework with , until now , no permanent secretariat , it remains to be seen if it has the political muscle to get the job done .
regional thinking a good start with the growth of the environmental movement in the 1960 's and 1970 's an increased awareness of the threats facing the alps developed , and preservationists lobbied hard for a collective approach .
after years of wrangling , the alpine convention went into force in march of 1995 .
a framework agreement between seven european countries , it set out to limit environmental degradation by harmonizing economic and environmental policies in the region .
thus , with 13 protocols , including ones related to air and water pollution , the convention 's greatest initial achievement was that it promoted a regional way of thinking where highly territorial national policies once prevailed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morteratsch glacier in switzerland has been melting at a rapid pace .
" the alpine convention increased the realization that the alps need to be treated as a region and the participants need to develop a regional way of thinking , " martin price , director of the center for mountain studies at perth college in great britain and the former chairman of the european mountain forum told dw-world .
andreas götz , the director of the international commission for the protection of the alps -lrb- cipra -rrb- agreed .
" the main thing is that a regional consciousness developed , " he told dw-world .
initial success gives way to stalled agenda in the years since it went into force , the alpine convention has not been without its successes .
a network of protected areas was created , as well as an international scientific commission for alpine research , based in bern , to study environmental threats and possible solutions .
what 's more , related initiatives , such as the alliance in the alps , founded by cipra , encouraged individual regions to share information and best practices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a paraglider is flying in front of the alps down from the brauneck mountain near bad tölz in southern germany .
but after an initial flutter of activity , some say efforts have stalled .
though lots of data was collected and inter-regional relationships were forged , the tough issues - inter-state transportation , the effects of global warming , the impactof depopulation - have not been directly tackled .
" the easier issues have been solved first and the more difficult ones left until later , " price said .
meeting to jumpstart agenda ?
at the meeting in germany on tuesday , the ministers are expected to announce a six-year plan to breath new life into the convention , and the creation of a permanent secretariat based in innsbruck to oversee the revised agenda and the establishment of a monitoring mechanism to chart progress will be announced .
likewise , cipra has launched a " future of the alps " initiative , which it hopes will - on a grass roots basis - help speed up the adaptation of the individual protocols .
" we do not have a lack of knowledge , " wolfgang pfefforkorn , the director of the future of the alps initiative , told dw-world .
" we have a lack of the implementation . "
a more results-oriented agenda , with a regular " state of the alps " report would be a good start , werner baetzing , an expert in alpine research at the university of erlangen in germany told dw-world .

a renewed commitment to alpine preservation could not come at a better time .
new threats are emerging , illustrating the alps delicate state .
chief among them : global warming , which will affect the region in a number of different ways , including , possibly precipitating the end of ski-related tourism .
according to a report released last year by the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , up to half of all alpine ski resorts in france , austria and switzerland may be forced to close over the next fifty years if current global warming trends continue and the snowline rises another 300 meters to 1800 meters above sea level .
in response , the owners of the threatened resorts are looking to build so-called " second generation ski resorts " above the revised snowline among the alps ' highest peeks and glaciers despite strict laws preventing further development .
in may , in the tirol , they succeeded .
the local government ruled to relax the law , paving the way for two major projects .
michel revaz , the deputy director of cipra told dw-world that he is worried the move will spark a dangerous game one upmanship among european ski resorts .

with new threats emerging , they 're meeting in germany on tuesday to plan for the future . next year , the alpine convention , a regional agreement for the protection and sustainable development of the alps , will celebrate its 10th anniversary .
but in the decade since european countries with part of their territory in the alps made a great leap forward and agreed to work together to find common solutions for common problems , critics say preservation efforts have not gone far enough .
meanwhile , a host of emerging threats demand urgent attention .
environment ministers meet in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch-partenkirchen sits right near the german alps in southern bavaria on tuesday , the environmental ministers of the seven permanent members of the convention , led by germany , the current chair , will meet in garmisch-partenkirchen , germany for the eighth alpine conference .
they 'll assess their successes and set out an ambitious plan for the region , a rich and diverse area encompassing 190,287 square kilometres with a population of more than 13 million .
but with the alpine convention remaining a non-binding framework with , until now , no permanent secretariat , it remains to be seen if it has the political muscle to get the job done .
regional thinking a good start with the growth of the environmental movement in the 1960 's and 1970 's an increased awareness of the threats facing the alps developed , and preservationists lobbied hard for a collective approach .
after years of wrangling , the alpine convention went into force in march of 1995 .
a framework agreement between seven european countries , it set out to limit environmental degradation by harmonizing economic and environmental policies in the region .
thus , with 13 protocols , including ones related to air and water pollution , the convention 's greatest initial achievement was that it promoted a regional way of thinking where highly territorial national policies once prevailed .

" the alpine convention increased the realization that the alps need to be treated as a region and the participants need to develop a regional way of thinking , " martin price , director of the center for mountain studies at perth college in great britain and the former chairman of the european mountain forum told dw-world .
andreas götz , the director of the international commission for the protection of the alps -lrb- cipra -rrb- agreed .
" the main thing is that a regional consciousness developed , " he told dw-world .
initial success gives way to stalled agenda in the years since it went into force , the alpine convention has not been without its successes .
a network of protected areas was created , as well as an international scientific commission for alpine research , based in bern , to study environmental threats and possible solutions .
what 's more , related initiatives , such as the alliance in the alps , founded by cipra , encouraged individual regions to share information and best practices .

but after an initial flutter of activity , some say efforts have stalled .
though lots of data was collected and inter-regional relationships were forged , the tough issues - inter-state transportation , the effects of global warming , the impactof depopulation - have not been directly tackled .
" the easier issues have been solved first and the more difficult ones left until later , " price said .
meeting to jumpstart agenda ?
at the meeting in germany on tuesday , the ministers are expected to announce a six-year plan to breath new life into the convention , and the creation of a permanent secretariat based in innsbruck to oversee the revised agenda and the establishment of a monitoring mechanism to chart progress will be announced .
likewise , cipra has launched a " future of the alps " initiative , which it hopes will - on a grass roots basis - help speed up the adaptation of the individual protocols .
" we do not have a lack of knowledge , " wolfgang pfefforkorn , the director of the future of the alps initiative , told dw-world .
" we have a lack of the implementation . "
a more results-oriented agenda , with a regular " state of the alps " report would be a good start , werner baetzing , an expert in alpine research at the university of erlangen in germany told dw-world .
new ski resorts threaten highest peaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steeple of the church in the liechtenstein village of triesenberg is seen in front of the alvierkette mountain chain in the swiss alps .
a renewed commitment to alpine preservation could not come at a better time .
new threats are emerging , illustrating the alps delicate state .
chief among them : global warming , which will affect the region in a number of different ways , including , possibly precipitating the end of ski-related tourism .
according to a report released last year by the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , up to half of all alpine ski resorts in france , austria and switzerland may be forced to close over the next fifty years if current global warming trends continue and the snowline rises another 300 meters to 1800 meters above sea level .
in response , the owners of the threatened resorts are looking to build so-called " second generation ski resorts " above the revised snowline among the alps ' highest peeks and glaciers despite strict laws preventing further development .
in may , in the tirol , they succeeded .
the local government ruled to relax the law , paving the way for two major projects .
michel revaz , the deputy director of cipra told dw-world that he is worried the move will spark a dangerous game one upmanship among european ski resorts .
" now that it 's happened in austria , all the others will want to do the same , " he told dw-world .
he would prefer to see the affected regions look for an alternatives to ski tourism , rather than colonizing the alps remaining pristine peaks .

on tuesday , the members of the alpine convention will be looking to build on past successes and put bite into a decade-old agreement .
the future of a region representative of many people 's picture of europe hangs in the balance .
on the plus side , experts say that when it comes to the preservation of mountain regions , europe is leading the way and setting an excellent example for other mountain areas around the world struggling with similar issues .

" the alpine convention increased the realization that the alps need to be treated as a region and the participants need to develop a regional way of thinking , " martin price , director of the center for mountain studies at perth college in great britain and the former chairman of the european mountain forum told dw-world .
andreas götz , the director of the international commission for the protection of the alps -lrb- cipra -rrb- agreed .
" the main thing is that a regional consciousness developed , " he told dw-world .
initial success gives way to stalled agenda in the years since it went into force , the alpine convention has not been without its successes .
a network of protected areas was created , as well as an international scientific commission for alpine research , based in bern , to study environmental threats and possible solutions .
what 's more , related initiatives , such as the alliance in the alps , founded by cipra , encouraged individual regions to share information and best practices .

but after an initial flutter of activity , some say efforts have stalled .

" the easier issues have been solved first and the more difficult ones left until later , " price said .
meeting to jumpstart agenda ?
at the meeting in germany on tuesday , the ministers are expected to announce a six-year plan to breath new life into the convention , and the creation of a permanent secretariat based in innsbruck to oversee the revised agenda and the establishment of a monitoring mechanism to chart progress will be announced .
likewise , cipra has launched a " future of the alps " initiative , which it hopes will - on a grass roots basis - help speed up the adaptation of the individual protocols .
" we do not have a lack of knowledge , " wolfgang pfefforkorn , the director of the future of the alps initiative , told dw-world .
" we have a lack of the implementation . "
a more results-oriented agenda , with a regular " state of the alps " report would be a good start , werner baetzing , an expert in alpine research at the university of erlangen in germany told dw-world .

a renewed commitment to alpine preservation could not come at a better time .
new threats are emerging , illustrating the alps delicate state .
chief among them : global warming , which will affect the region in a number of different ways , including , possibly precipitating the end of ski-related tourism .
according to a report released last year by the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- , up to half of all alpine ski resorts in france , austria and switzerland may be forced to close over the next fifty years if current global warming trends continue and the snowline rises another 300 meters to 1800 meters above sea level .
in response , the owners of the threatened resorts are looking to build so-called " second generation ski resorts " above the revised snowline among the alps ' highest peeks and glaciers despite strict laws preventing further development .
in may , in the tirol , they succeeded .
the local government ruled to relax the law , paving the way for two major projects .
michel revaz , the deputy director of cipra told dw-world that he is worried the move will spark a dangerous game one upmanship among european ski resorts .
" now that it 's happened in austria , all the others will want to do the same , " he told dw-world .
he would prefer to see the affected regions look for an alternatives to ski tourism , rather than colonizing the alps remaining pristine peaks .

" our small genius is ... at the moon , " a delighted southwood declared . the probe achieved lunar orbit at 17:53 gmt on monday , and on tuesday was looping the moon at a height of 5,000-6000 kilometers -lrb- 3,000-3,500 miles -rrb- , smart-1 project manager giuseppe racca said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart-1 will gently spiral closer to the lunar surface , eventually stabilizing in an egg-shaped polar orbit that will vary from 300 kilometers -lrb- 187 miles -rrb- at the south pole to 3,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,870 miles -rrb- at the north pole . the 370-kilo -lrb- 814-pound -rrb- probe has been using a slow but revolutionary form of propulsion , taking it in ever-widening circles around the earth and using terrestrial gravity as a slingshot , to get to the moon . it is powered by an ion engine , which converts solar power into electricity that then charges atoms of the heavy gas xenon . these charged atoms , known as ions , are then disgorged from the back of the probe to give it thrust . slow , but persistent the motor is initially slow - launched on sept .
27 , 2003 , smart-1 took more than 13 months to make a trip achieved in three days by the chemical rockets of the apollo era - but speed gradually builds up in the frictionless environment of space , making ion power ideal for trips into the depths of the solar system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this artist 's rendition released by the european space agency , the european-made smart-1 solar-powered satellite is seen nearing the moon on its way to make the first comprehensive inventory of key chemical elements in the lunar surface .
smart-1 -lrb- photo -rrb- clocked up 332 orbits around earth and travelled more than 84 million kilometers -lrb- 52.5 million miles -rrb- , " a distance comparable to an interplanetary cruise , " esa pointed out in a press statement . it fired its engines 289 times , operating them for a total of about 3,700 hours , and sipped just 59 kilos -lrb- 129.8 pounds -rrb- of its 80 kilos -lrb- 176 pounds -rrb- of xenon gas .
space rockets typically carry tonnes of chemical fuel , which thus crimps the size of the payload . so much fuel has been saved that smart-1 will be placed in a closer approach to the moon for the scientific phase of the mission . " the performance -lsb- of the motor -rsb- has been better than we expected , " said giorgio saccoccia , head of esa propulsion division .
" we would certainly want to have it onboard in the future . " it is only the second time that ion propulsion has been used as a space mission 's primary propulsion system .
the first was nasa 's deep space 1 probe , launched in october 1998 . scanning the moon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after achieving its final orbit on jan .
13 , 2005 , smart-1 will start a six-month scan of the moon , using a big payload of sensors that are also a test bench of miniaturization . one of the spacecraft 's tasks is to check out hopes that deep craters near the moon 's poles may harbour water ice , a discovery that would be a huge boost for setting up a human settlement . and it will also explore theories as to the origin of the moon . the prevailing notion is that the moon was born from the earth - a mass of terrestrial mantle that was smashed away when earth was hit by a mars-sized object in the infancy of the solar system . this mass of rock and debris then re-condensed to become earth 's satellite , according to this theory . " with our x-ray eyes , we want to trace the moon 's beginnings , " said bernard foing , smart-1 project scientist . much is already known about the moon , thanks to robot craft and the manned us missions of the early sixties and seventies , but scientists say there are also many unknowns . smart-1 is the first in a flotilla of unmanned probes to earth 's companion .
missions have been planned in the coming years by china , india , japan and the united states . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new clues to life on mars concentrations of water vapor and methane gas in certain regions of the red planet strengthen speculation that mars could be a haven for microbial life .

" our small genius is ... at the moon , " a delighted southwood declared . the probe achieved lunar orbit at 17:53 gmt on monday , and on tuesday was looping the moon at a height of 5,000-6000 kilometers -lrb- 3,000-3,500 miles -rrb- , smart-1 project manager giuseppe racca said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart-1 will gently spiral closer to the lunar surface , eventually stabilizing in an egg-shaped polar orbit that will vary from 300 kilometers -lrb- 187 miles -rrb- at the south pole to 3,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,870 miles -rrb- at the north pole . the 370-kilo -lrb- 814-pound -rrb- probe has been using a slow but revolutionary form of propulsion , taking it in ever-widening circles around the earth and using terrestrial gravity as a slingshot , to get to the moon . it is powered by an ion engine , which converts solar power into electricity that then charges atoms of the heavy gas xenon . these charged atoms , known as ions , are then disgorged from the back of the probe to give it thrust . slow , but persistent the motor is initially slow - launched on sept .
27 , 2003 , smart-1 took more than 13 months to make a trip achieved in three days by the chemical rockets of the apollo era - but speed gradually builds up in the frictionless environment of space , making ion power ideal for trips into the depths of the solar system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this artist 's rendition released by the european space agency , the european-made smart-1 solar-powered satellite is seen nearing the moon on its way to make the first comprehensive inventory of key chemical elements in the lunar surface .

space rockets typically carry tonnes of chemical fuel , which thus crimps the size of the payload . so much fuel has been saved that smart-1 will be placed in a closer approach to the moon for the scientific phase of the mission . " the performance -lsb- of the motor -rsb- has been better than we expected , " said giorgio saccoccia , head of esa propulsion division .

" with our x-ray eyes , we want to trace the moon 's beginnings , " said bernard foing , smart-1 project scientist . much is already known about the moon , thanks to robot craft and the manned us missions of the early sixties and seventies , but scientists say there are also many unknowns . smart-1 is the first in a flotilla of unmanned probes to earth 's companion .

goleo the lion was revealed as the official mascot for the 2006 world cup this weekend .
while fame and fortune beckons for the face of the soccer spectacular , goleo will find out it 's not all furry handshakes and waving . with great power comes great responsibility , something goleo - the newly revealed official mascot of the 2006 world cup - will soon learn .
the tall and imposing , although very approachable looking , lion becomes the latest in a long line of fake animals to become the figurehead of a major sporting event .
goleo will spend the next 18 months preparing for the global soccer showcase in germany , where he will stir the crowded stadiums and inspire millions of spectators around the world .
during that time , goleo 's face will become synonymous with the world cup in germany and the harmonious message of fair play that will no doubt be promoted throughout the entirety of the month-long tournament .
global superstardom and worldwide recognition awaits him .
he looks happy enough , but is he ready ?
such a high profile position comes with its own set of intense pressures .
goleo will not even be able to enjoy a quiet gazelle without a pack of paparazzi snappers being on hand to record his every bite and maul .
so what can the mascot of the 2006 world cup expect ?
if everything goes right , goleo could be the next misha the bear .
the mascot of the olympic games of 1980 went on to become one of the best loved and most marketable figureheads in sporting history , so much so that many people forget the us boycott of the moscow games - in protest of the december 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan - and remember them for the cute little teddy bear who even cried at the closing ceremony .
memorable misha endures misha 's tale should give the german lion some hope .
regardless of how well his countrymen perform at the world cup , goleo could still come out of the tournament smelling of roses .
a successful stint as the face of the 2006 tournament could bode well for a future career away from the sporting spotlight .
goleo may want to look to the example set by english soccer team hartlepool united 's h 'angus the monkey .
the all-singing , all-dancing mascot of the yorkshire club enjoyed a long career aping around for the hartlepool faithful and made such an impression on the town that in may 2002 , he was elected town mayor .
but while the world may be an oyster - or in goleo 's case , a wildebeest - for the successful mascot , there are pitfalls .
as with any celebrity , there are temptations for the sporting mascot , such as unscrupulous types waiting to accelerate their downfall for their own gains by exploiting any furry foot put wrong .
the seedier side of the mascot life is just a flip of the coin away .

in front of a television audience of millions , wolfie lost his cool in the pre-match contest and ended up battling all three pigs in a pitch-side punch-up .
needless to say , he never worked in that town again .
as the only official mascot of the world cup , goleo may not have any rivals to face and so potential fisticuffs should be avoided .
but even if he keeps his cold , wet nose clean , goleo must go into this new phase with his eyes open to the realities .

top designer says world cup design " just embarrassing " when baring it all is not enough could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ? current affairs -pipe- 16.11.2004 a mascot for all seasons ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo enjoys his time in the sun but how will history remember him ?
goleo the lion was revealed as the official mascot for the 2006 world cup this weekend .
while fame and fortune beckons for the face of the soccer spectacular , goleo will find out it 's not all furry handshakes and waving . with great power comes great responsibility , something goleo - the newly revealed official mascot of the 2006 world cup - will soon learn .
the tall and imposing , although very approachable looking , lion becomes the latest in a long line of fake animals to become the figurehead of a major sporting event .
goleo will spend the next 18 months preparing for the global soccer showcase in germany , where he will stir the crowded stadiums and inspire millions of spectators around the world .
during that time , goleo 's face will become synonymous with the world cup in germany and the harmonious message of fair play that will no doubt be promoted throughout the entirety of the month-long tournament .
global superstardom and worldwide recognition awaits him .
he looks happy enough , but is he ready ?
such a high profile position comes with its own set of intense pressures .
goleo will not even be able to enjoy a quiet gazelle without a pack of paparazzi snappers being on hand to record his every bite and maul .
so what can the mascot of the 2006 world cup expect ?
if everything goes right , goleo could be the next misha the bear .
the mascot of the olympic games of 1980 went on to become one of the best loved and most marketable figureheads in sporting history , so much so that many people forget the us boycott of the moscow games - in protest of the december 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan - and remember them for the cute little teddy bear who even cried at the closing ceremony .
memorable misha endures misha 's tale should give the german lion some hope .
regardless of how well his countrymen perform at the world cup , goleo could still come out of the tournament smelling of roses .
a successful stint as the face of the 2006 tournament could bode well for a future career away from the sporting spotlight .
goleo may want to look to the example set by english soccer team hartlepool united 's h 'angus the monkey .
the all-singing , all-dancing mascot of the yorkshire club enjoyed a long career aping around for the hartlepool faithful and made such an impression on the town that in may 2002 , he was elected town mayor .
but while the world may be an oyster - or in goleo 's case , a wildebeest - for the successful mascot , there are pitfalls .
as with any celebrity , there are temptations for the sporting mascot , such as unscrupulous types waiting to accelerate their downfall for their own gains by exploiting any furry foot put wrong .
the seedier side of the mascot life is just a flip of the coin away .
when fake animals attack take wolfie , the mascot of another english soccer team , wolverhampton wanderers .
wolfie used to rally the crowds with playful and endearing kick-arounds with the opposing mascots before his team took to the pitch .
that is until the arrival of bristol city 's three little pigs .
in front of a television audience of millions , wolfie lost his cool in the pre-match contest and ended up battling all three pigs in a pitch-side punch-up .
needless to say , he never worked in that town again .
as the only official mascot of the world cup , goleo may not have any rivals to face and so potential fisticuffs should be avoided .
but even if he keeps his cold , wet nose clean , goleo must go into this new phase with his eyes open to the realities .
a mascot 's shelf life is a tangible one .
fame and fortune are assured in the run-up to the event and during it , but only the most endearing mascots linger in the memory when the glory fades .

the cumbersome and non-cuddly icons drew more baffled looks and questions than adoration this summer .

countries are not permitted to run a budget deficit above 3 percent of gdp before joining the euro or – in theory – during their membership of the euro zone .
however , despite the inaccurate data submitted by athens , their membership of the euro in 2001 is not in question , according to commission officials .
a spokesman for economics and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said there was " no possibility " of withdrawing greece from the 12 country zone although its acceptance was granted on false data .
greece ’ s budget deficit is forecast to be as high as 5.3 percent this year , following spiralling costs from the olympic games , which were recently revealed to have cost twice as much as athens had budgeted .
however , the greek government has pledged to halve this deficit in 2005 .
at a press conference , almunia confirmed that he would recommend to the incoming barroso commission to take " infringement procedures " against greece " as soon as possible . "
but the decision to admit greece into the euro zone was " made with the best available data at the time and it -lsb- the decision -rsb- is not called into question , " added the commissioner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.11.2004 hungarian faces commission hearing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a controversial candidate : laszlo kovacs new european commission president jose barroso is due to present his commissioners on thursday , but not before the hungarian candidate proves he is the right man for the job . the new commission should have started work at the beginning of november , but was held up by disagreements over a number of commissioner candidates .
the most controversial was italian conservative rocco buttiglione , who came up against strong resistance for his views on homosexuality and marriage .
but he is not the only one . on tuesday , the hungarian candidate , sixty-five year old laszlo kovacs has the chance to prove his worth for the customs and taxation portfolio .
he was originally nominated as energy commissioner , but performed disastrously at this first hearing in front of the parliament last month , astounding members of the parliament with his lack of knowledge on even basic matters . " from the academic point of view , i was probably wrong when i tried to define what i think of hydrogen , but i 'm to say i 'm not an academic , and not even an energy expert , " kovacs said after the hearing . should he stay or should he go although kovacs has managed to avoid the fate of buttiglione , janis emmanouilidis , an expert in european affairs at the centre for applied policy research in munich , said he believes hungary should have replaced kovacs . " there was a strong pressure to have him withdrawn , but the government in hungary strongly supported his nomination and did n't withdraw him , " he told dw-radio .
" i believe that because many parliamentarians , not only from the christian democrats but also from the socialist group , criticized him concerning his knowledge of the matter , it might have been a wise decision to have him withdrawn . " kovacs , who is the former hungarian minister for foreign affairs , is expected to face difficult questions on economics and currency , as well as domestic market and consumer protection matters .
the hearing is likely to be gruelling as parliamentarians feel that eu member states are n't take the nomination process seriously . " the european parliament is looking at its rights and exploiting its rights , " emmanouilidis said .
" it is looking for new areas to show the two other institutions in the eu that the parliament has a strong say . " the voice of experience however , he also said he believes that kovacs will bring some political know-how to the commission . " he 's one of a few politicians in the new member states with significant experience , " he said .
" he has a lot to offer from a political point of view , but concerning his technical knowledge in certain policy areas , he might be less strong . " the parliament ca n't refuse individual commissioners , only the entire commission , which means that kovac 's nomination is probably in the bag .
so , barring interview disasters , the new commission president jose manuel barroso should be able to formally present his new team for approval on thursday . kate hairsine -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso 's commission faces new confidence vote incoming eu executive head jose manuel barroso said friday he hopes for " clear " approval when eu lawmakers finally vote on his new team later this month , to end an unprecedented state of limbo in brussels .

the most controversial was italian conservative rocco buttiglione , who came up against strong resistance for his views on homosexuality and marriage .
but he is not the only one . on tuesday , the hungarian candidate , sixty-five year old laszlo kovacs has the chance to prove his worth for the customs and taxation portfolio .
he was originally nominated as energy commissioner , but performed disastrously at this first hearing in front of the parliament last month , astounding members of the parliament with his lack of knowledge on even basic matters . " from the academic point of view , i was probably wrong when i tried to define what i think of hydrogen , but i 'm to say i 'm not an academic , and not even an energy expert , " kovacs said after the hearing . should he stay or should he go although kovacs has managed to avoid the fate of buttiglione , janis emmanouilidis , an expert in european affairs at the centre for applied policy research in munich , said he believes hungary should have replaced kovacs . " there was a strong pressure to have him withdrawn , but the government in hungary strongly supported his nomination and did n't withdraw him , " he told dw-radio .
" i believe that because many parliamentarians , not only from the christian democrats but also from the socialist group , criticized him concerning his knowledge of the matter , it might have been a wise decision to have him withdrawn . " kovacs , who is the former hungarian minister for foreign affairs , is expected to face difficult questions on economics and currency , as well as domestic market and consumer protection matters .
the hearing is likely to be gruelling as parliamentarians feel that eu member states are n't take the nomination process seriously . " the european parliament is looking at its rights and exploiting its rights , " emmanouilidis said .
" it is looking for new areas to show the two other institutions in the eu that the parliament has a strong say . " the voice of experience however , he also said he believes that kovacs will bring some political know-how to the commission . " he 's one of a few politicians in the new member states with significant experience , " he said .
" he has a lot to offer from a political point of view , but concerning his technical knowledge in certain policy areas , he might be less strong . " the parliament ca n't refuse individual commissioners , only the entire commission , which means that kovac 's nomination is probably in the bag .

the most controversial was italian conservative rocco buttiglione , who came up against strong resistance for his views on homosexuality and marriage .
but he is not the only one . on tuesday , the hungarian candidate , sixty-five year old laszlo kovacs has the chance to prove his worth for the customs and taxation portfolio .
he was originally nominated as energy commissioner , but performed disastrously at this first hearing in front of the parliament last month , astounding members of the parliament with his lack of knowledge on even basic matters . " from the academic point of view , i was probably wrong when i tried to define what i think of hydrogen , but i 'm to say i 'm not an academic , and not even an energy expert , " kovacs said after the hearing . should he stay or should he go although kovacs has managed to avoid the fate of buttiglione , janis emmanouilidis , an expert in european affairs at the centre for applied policy research in munich , said he believes hungary should have replaced kovacs . " there was a strong pressure to have him withdrawn , but the government in hungary strongly supported his nomination and did n't withdraw him , " he told dw-radio .
" i believe that because many parliamentarians , not only from the christian democrats but also from the socialist group , criticized him concerning his knowledge of the matter , it might have been a wise decision to have him withdrawn . " kovacs , who is the former hungarian minister for foreign affairs , is expected to face difficult questions on economics and currency , as well as domestic market and consumer protection matters .
the hearing is likely to be gruelling as parliamentarians feel that eu member states are n't take the nomination process seriously . " the european parliament is looking at its rights and exploiting its rights , " emmanouilidis said .
" it is looking for new areas to show the two other institutions in the eu that the parliament has a strong say . " the voice of experience however , he also said he believes that kovacs will bring some political know-how to the commission . " he 's one of a few politicians in the new member states with significant experience , " he said .
" he has a lot to offer from a political point of view , but concerning his technical knowledge in certain policy areas , he might be less strong . " the parliament ca n't refuse individual commissioners , only the entire commission , which means that kovac 's nomination is probably in the bag .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.11.2004 row over plan for german in mosques großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would have moslems pray in german a proposal for the enforcement of german as a spoken language in mosques has erupted in germany as politicians look for ways to reform the country 's integration policy in the wake of violence in the netherlands . a regional politician 's proposal that prayers in german mosques should be said in german was greeted with dismay on monday amid fears that anti-muslim attacks may spread over the border from the netherlands .
annette schavan , the christian democratic education minister for the state of baden-württemberg and a contender for the state 's premiership , made her radical proposal at the weekend because , she said , " we can no longer accept that prayers in mosques should be said in languages that can not be understood outside the muslim community . "
schavan 's proposal comes in the wake of the torching of mosques , schools and churches in the netherlands following the killing of film director theo van gogh , whose work was strongly critical of muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her suggestion drew a sharp reaction from the leaders of the more than two and a half million turks who live in germany .
" this is nonsense - terror can be spread in any language , " said kenan kolat , the co-president of the turkish community in germany .
cornelie sonntag-wolgast , a representative of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on the national parliamentary committee for domestic affairs also criticized the proposal .
" we can not suspect each and every person ... of violence just because they say their prayers in arabic , " said sonntag-wolgast .
volker beck , a spokesman for the greens , the junior partner in the governing coalition , said schavan 's proposal was " completely exaggerated " while liberal fdp interior minister max stadler criticized schavan , saying her proposal for the state to enforce the german language in mosques was " an offense against basic law . "
werner schiffauer , a cultural professor said , schavan 's plan was " out-of-touch and impractical " , a view supported by jürgen micksch , the chairperson of the intercultural council in germany .
professor schiffauer stated that there was little money available to provide language training for the large numbers of islamic preachers in germany and that , in addition , many foreigners living in germany stayed for only a short time and were dependent on mother-tongue services while they were there .
some support idea however , nadeem elyas , the chairman for the central council of muslims in germany , agreed with the proposal .
elyas explained that a lot of mosques already translate their prayers and sermons and offer simultaneous audio feeds in both arabic and german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mosque in berlin neukölln .
the council , he said , is made up of 19 organizations and about 500 mosque municipalities in germany , not all of which cater for purely arabic speakers .
elyas added that german , turkish , arabian , albanian , bosnian and persian muslims all worship in germany and many have different language requirements .
call for islamic holiday the row over schaven 's proposal comes at a time when germany seems desperate to define its integration policy and avoid copycat violence spreading across the border from the neighboring netherlands .
just a day after schaven 's proposal was revealed , a member of the green party in germany called for the government to install an official islamic holiday in the german calendar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele .

cornelie sonntag-wolgast , a representative of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on the national parliamentary committee for domestic affairs also criticized the proposal .
" we can not suspect each and every person ... of violence just because they say their prayers in arabic , " said sonntag-wolgast .
volker beck , a spokesman for the greens , the junior partner in the governing coalition , said schavan 's proposal was " completely exaggerated " while liberal fdp interior minister max stadler criticized schavan , saying her proposal for the state to enforce the german language in mosques was " an offense against basic law . "
werner schiffauer , a cultural professor said , schavan 's plan was " out-of-touch and impractical " , a view supported by jürgen micksch , the chairperson of the intercultural council in germany .
professor schiffauer stated that there was little money available to provide language training for the large numbers of islamic preachers in germany and that , in addition , many foreigners living in germany stayed for only a short time and were dependent on mother-tongue services while they were there .
some support idea however , nadeem elyas , the chairman for the central council of muslims in germany , agreed with the proposal .
elyas explained that a lot of mosques already translate their prayers and sermons and offer simultaneous audio feeds in both arabic and german .

annette schavan , the christian democratic education minister for the state of baden-württemberg and a contender for the state 's premiership , made her radical proposal at the weekend because , she said , " we can no longer accept that prayers in mosques should be said in languages that can not be understood outside the muslim community . "
schavan 's proposal comes in the wake of the torching of mosques , schools and churches in the netherlands following the killing of film director theo van gogh , whose work was strongly critical of muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her suggestion drew a sharp reaction from the leaders of the more than two and a half million turks who live in germany .
" this is nonsense - terror can be spread in any language , " said kenan kolat , the co-president of the turkish community in germany .
cornelie sonntag-wolgast , a representative of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on the national parliamentary committee for domestic affairs also criticized the proposal .
" we can not suspect each and every person ... of violence just because they say their prayers in arabic , " said sonntag-wolgast .
volker beck , a spokesman for the greens , the junior partner in the governing coalition , said schavan 's proposal was " completely exaggerated " while liberal fdp interior minister max stadler criticized schavan , saying her proposal for the state to enforce the german language in mosques was " an offense against basic law . "
werner schiffauer , a cultural professor said , schavan 's plan was " out-of-touch and impractical " , a view supported by jürgen micksch , the chairperson of the intercultural council in germany .
professor schiffauer stated that there was little money available to provide language training for the large numbers of islamic preachers in germany and that , in addition , many foreigners living in germany stayed for only a short time and were dependent on mother-tongue services while they were there .
some support idea however , nadeem elyas , the chairman for the central council of muslims in germany , agreed with the proposal .
elyas explained that a lot of mosques already translate their prayers and sermons and offer simultaneous audio feeds in both arabic and german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mosque in berlin neukölln .
the council , he said , is made up of 19 organizations and about 500 mosque municipalities in germany , not all of which cater for purely arabic speakers .
elyas added that german , turkish , arabian , albanian , bosnian and persian muslims all worship in germany and many have different language requirements .
call for islamic holiday the row over schaven 's proposal comes at a time when germany seems desperate to define its integration policy and avoid copycat violence spreading across the border from the neighboring netherlands .
just a day after schaven 's proposal was revealed , a member of the green party in germany called for the government to install an official islamic holiday in the german calendar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele .
hans-christian ströbele was quoted in the die welt newspaper on tuesday saying that a holiday directly after the fasting period of ramadan could be one possibility , an idea supported by environment minister jürgen trittin . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de holland prompts soul-searching in germany as is the case in other parts of europe , the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh has prompted some serious soul-searching in germany , where politicians of every stripe are mulling integration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the year of the lion what 's to become of the lion-hearted ?
top designer says world cup design " just embarrassing " when baring it all is not enough could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ? current affairs -pipe- 16.11.2004 a mascot for all seasons ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo enjoys his time in the sun but how will history remember him ?
goleo the lion was revealed as the official mascot for the 2006 world cup this weekend .
while fame and fortune beckons for the face of the soccer spectacular , goleo will find out it 's not all furry handshakes and waving . with great power comes great responsibility , something goleo - the newly revealed official mascot of the 2006 world cup - will soon learn .
the tall and imposing , although very approachable looking , lion becomes the latest in a long line of fake animals to become the figurehead of a major sporting event .
goleo will spend the next 18 months preparing for the global soccer showcase in germany , where he will stir the crowded stadiums and inspire millions of spectators around the world .
during that time , goleo 's face will become synonymous with the world cup in germany and the harmonious message of fair play that will no doubt be promoted throughout the entirety of the month-long tournament .
global superstardom and worldwide recognition awaits him .
he looks happy enough , but is he ready ?
such a high profile position comes with its own set of intense pressures .
goleo will not even be able to enjoy a quiet gazelle without a pack of paparazzi snappers being on hand to record his every bite and maul .
so what can the mascot of the 2006 world cup expect ?
if everything goes right , goleo could be the next misha the bear .
the mascot of the olympic games of 1980 went on to become one of the best loved and most marketable figureheads in sporting history , so much so that many people forget the us boycott of the moscow games - in protest of the december 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan - and remember them for the cute little teddy bear who even cried at the closing ceremony .
memorable misha endures misha 's tale should give the german lion some hope .
regardless of how well his countrymen perform at the world cup , goleo could still come out of the tournament smelling of roses .
a successful stint as the face of the 2006 tournament could bode well for a future career away from the sporting spotlight .
goleo may want to look to the example set by english soccer team hartlepool united 's h 'angus the monkey .
the all-singing , all-dancing mascot of the yorkshire club enjoyed a long career aping around for the hartlepool faithful and made such an impression on the town that in may 2002 , he was elected town mayor .
but while the world may be an oyster - or in goleo 's case , a wildebeest - for the successful mascot , there are pitfalls .
as with any celebrity , there are temptations for the sporting mascot , such as unscrupulous types waiting to accelerate their downfall for their own gains by exploiting any furry foot put wrong .
the seedier side of the mascot life is just a flip of the coin away .
when fake animals attack take wolfie , the mascot of another english soccer team , wolverhampton wanderers .
wolfie used to rally the crowds with playful and endearing kick-arounds with the opposing mascots before his team took to the pitch .
that is until the arrival of bristol city 's three little pigs .
in front of a television audience of millions , wolfie lost his cool in the pre-match contest and ended up battling all three pigs in a pitch-side punch-up .
needless to say , he never worked in that town again .
as the only official mascot of the world cup , goleo may not have any rivals to face and so potential fisticuffs should be avoided .
but even if he keeps his cold , wet nose clean , goleo must go into this new phase with his eyes open to the realities .
a mascot 's shelf life is a tangible one .
fame and fortune are assured in the run-up to the event and during it , but only the most endearing mascots linger in the memory when the glory fades .
the " aah " factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take the recent athens summer olympic games .
can anyone name the two asexual triangles that passed as the event 's co-mascots ?
well , they were phevos and athena , the siblings named after greek gods who represented the link between greek history and the modern olympic games .
the cumbersome and non-cuddly icons drew more baffled looks and questions than adoration this summer .
however , they contributed to the $ 81 million -lrb- € 63 million -rrb- or so that athens merchandising generated .
their success was assured mainly due to the usual ploy of covering everything from baby bonnets to thongs in their images .
if you wanted anything olympic , you had to have phevos and athena on it .
but despite this , it is unlikely that they will be the enduring memory of the games .
they did n't have that cute " aah " factor that mascots who want to live on need .
in portugal , the super-human wunderkind kinas , the mascot for the european soccer championships this summer , has also sunk without a trace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kinas , " the euro 2004 european soccer championship mascot .
the boy who was supposed to " embody the enthusiasm , skill , determination and sense of fun that make football the greatest sport on earth " has rarely been seen since and must be cursing his luck that he was chosen to front a tournament which would provide one of the greatest shocks in soccer history .
germany 's goleo may have an advantage .
he is a cuddly , eight-foot -lrb- 2.4 meter -rrb- tall lion with a touch of " sesame street " about him and not some cartoon child or a geometric shape with big feet .
but even a moth-eaten , threadbare misha will tell him to enjoy the good times when they come because the light of the mascot burns fast and bright but can fade just as quickly . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing the world cup into the schools in the run-up to the 2006 world cup in germany , a new project headed by national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann aims to teach kids how to think globally and about the importance of good sportsmanship .

countries are not permitted to run a budget deficit above 3 percent of gdp before joining the euro or – in theory – during their membership of the euro zone .
however , despite the inaccurate data submitted by athens , their membership of the euro in 2001 is not in question , according to commission officials .
a spokesman for economics and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said there was " no possibility " of withdrawing greece from the 12 country zone although its acceptance was granted on false data .
greece ’ s budget deficit is forecast to be as high as 5.3 percent this year , following spiralling costs from the olympic games , which were recently revealed to have cost twice as much as athens had budgeted .
however , the greek government has pledged to halve this deficit in 2005 .
at a press conference , almunia confirmed that he would recommend to the incoming barroso commission to take " infringement procedures " against greece " as soon as possible . "
but the decision to admit greece into the euro zone was " made with the best available data at the time and it -lsb- the decision -rsb- is not called into question , " added the commissioner .

its job is made harder by the lack of cohesion between many european institutions and organizations . human trafficking , computer crime and terrorism are just some of the crimes dealt with by eurojust , the eu authority charged with the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border and organized crime .
in addition to the specific crime areas , there are also the individual cases which flood in from all 25 member states in the european union to be dealt with .
as a body established as recently as 2002 to enhance the effectiveness of collective crime fighting , and one which has more than 1000 live cases on its books , eurojust could well claim to be one of the busiest and overwhelmed departments in the eu .
behind kilometers of razor wire , security checks and armored doors , the headquarters of eurojust in the hague is one of the most secure places in the eu .
in contrast to the heavily guarded surroundings , it also one of the most open ; welcoming magistrates , public prosecutors and secret service agents from around the bloc every month for discussions and consultations .

" there has been a case where the italians and the germans were pursuing the same criminal at the same time in drug trafficking case , " german eurojust representative hermann von langsdorff told deutsche welle .
" in this instance , the germans were about to make an arrest and the italians came to us and asked if we could persuade the germans to hold off .
they waited for one week only and as a result the whole drug ring was smashed and many arrests made . "
despite such successes , not everything works as smoothly .
von langsdorff , who works with 24 other national representatives in mediating between public prosecutor 's offices all across europe , admitted that sometimes the influx of cases is too much .
" the big problem is that eurojust can only reasonably cope with one institution at a time , " he said .
lack of recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is one of the worst offenders for not offering or accepting help .

european public prosecutors continue to sit on vital information regarding terror suspects and some do not even know that eurojust exists and can help in the passing on of vital information , according to von langsdorff .
in the increasingly important fight against international terrorism , more collaboration is needed .
borders closed to exchange of information europe 's borders are open but not always in the eyes of the public prosecutors .
to obtain the right to make searches with foreign colleagues in a bordering country and even to make phone calls to other member states in relation to investigations require special approval .
even von langsdorff and his colleagues at eurojust have their hands tied to a certain extent .
without permission from the member states involved in a case , no results or information can be exchanged without permission .
von langsdorff believes a central data bank could change all this .
" the perfect scenario would be that a phone number discovered during a search in italy could immediately be put in the system and its origin ascertained , whether this number has been linked to terrorists in germany or france , " he said .

its job is made harder by the lack of cohesion between many european institutions and organizations . human trafficking , computer crime and terrorism are just some of the crimes dealt with by eurojust , the eu authority charged with the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border and organized crime .
in addition to the specific crime areas , there are also the individual cases which flood in from all 25 member states in the european union to be dealt with .
as a body established as recently as 2002 to enhance the effectiveness of collective crime fighting , and one which has more than 1000 live cases on its books , eurojust could well claim to be one of the busiest and overwhelmed departments in the eu .
behind kilometers of razor wire , security checks and armored doors , the headquarters of eurojust in the hague is one of the most secure places in the eu .
in contrast to the heavily guarded surroundings , it also one of the most open ; welcoming magistrates , public prosecutors and secret service agents from around the bloc every month for discussions and consultations .
a forum for investigation and prosecution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurojust brings security institutions and legal teams together in an attempt to open up dialogue and create a wider network of collaborative crime prevention across the eu .

" there has been a case where the italians and the germans were pursuing the same criminal at the same time in drug trafficking case , " german eurojust representative hermann von langsdorff told deutsche welle .
" in this instance , the germans were about to make an arrest and the italians came to us and asked if we could persuade the germans to hold off .
they waited for one week only and as a result the whole drug ring was smashed and many arrests made . "
despite such successes , not everything works as smoothly .
von langsdorff , who works with 24 other national representatives in mediating between public prosecutor 's offices all across europe , admitted that sometimes the influx of cases is too much .
" the big problem is that eurojust can only reasonably cope with one institution at a time , " he said .

european public prosecutors continue to sit on vital information regarding terror suspects and some do not even know that eurojust exists and can help in the passing on of vital information , according to von langsdorff .
in the increasingly important fight against international terrorism , more collaboration is needed .
borders closed to exchange of information europe 's borders are open but not always in the eyes of the public prosecutors .
to obtain the right to make searches with foreign colleagues in a bordering country and even to make phone calls to other member states in relation to investigations require special approval .
even von langsdorff and his colleagues at eurojust have their hands tied to a certain extent .
without permission from the member states involved in a case , no results or information can be exchanged without permission .
von langsdorff believes a central data bank could change all this .
" the perfect scenario would be that a phone number discovered during a search in italy could immediately be put in the system and its origin ascertained , whether this number has been linked to terrorists in germany or france , " he said .

the 43-year-old man , who was not named by the paper , is accused of breaking german law by having the vehicles shipped to the british government in 2003 .
from britain , the armored cars were sent on to iraq and afghanistan , frank tiemann , a spokesman for a court in the eastern city of potsdam , told bild .
" the accused broke the law on exports because the deal was apparently done without the necessary authorization , " tiemann said .
the accused argues that he would have lost the € 1.8 million -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- contract to a non-german firm if he had waited for the authorization , bild said .
" if our suspicions are confirmed , the accused faces a prison sentence of up to five years , " the spokesman added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the year of the lion what 's to become of the lion-hearted ?
top designer says world cup design " just embarrassing " when baring it all is not enough could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ? current affairs -pipe- 16.11.2004 a mascot for all seasons ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goleo enjoys his time in the sun but how will history remember him ?
goleo the lion was revealed as the official mascot for the 2006 world cup this weekend .
while fame and fortune beckons for the face of the soccer spectacular , goleo will find out it 's not all furry handshakes and waving . with great power comes great responsibility , something goleo - the newly revealed official mascot of the 2006 world cup - will soon learn .
the tall and imposing , although very approachable looking , lion becomes the latest in a long line of fake animals to become the figurehead of a major sporting event .
goleo will spend the next 18 months preparing for the global soccer showcase in germany , where he will stir the crowded stadiums and inspire millions of spectators around the world .
during that time , goleo 's face will become synonymous with the world cup in germany and the harmonious message of fair play that will no doubt be promoted throughout the entirety of the month-long tournament .
global superstardom and worldwide recognition awaits him .
he looks happy enough , but is he ready ?
such a high profile position comes with its own set of intense pressures .
goleo will not even be able to enjoy a quiet gazelle without a pack of paparazzi snappers being on hand to record his every bite and maul .
so what can the mascot of the 2006 world cup expect ?
if everything goes right , goleo could be the next misha the bear .
the mascot of the olympic games of 1980 went on to become one of the best loved and most marketable figureheads in sporting history , so much so that many people forget the us boycott of the moscow games - in protest of the december 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan - and remember them for the cute little teddy bear who even cried at the closing ceremony .
memorable misha endures misha 's tale should give the german lion some hope .
regardless of how well his countrymen perform at the world cup , goleo could still come out of the tournament smelling of roses .
a successful stint as the face of the 2006 tournament could bode well for a future career away from the sporting spotlight .
goleo may want to look to the example set by english soccer team hartlepool united 's h 'angus the monkey .
the all-singing , all-dancing mascot of the yorkshire club enjoyed a long career aping around for the hartlepool faithful and made such an impression on the town that in may 2002 , he was elected town mayor .
but while the world may be an oyster - or in goleo 's case , a wildebeest - for the successful mascot , there are pitfalls .
as with any celebrity , there are temptations for the sporting mascot , such as unscrupulous types waiting to accelerate their downfall for their own gains by exploiting any furry foot put wrong .
the seedier side of the mascot life is just a flip of the coin away .
when fake animals attack take wolfie , the mascot of another english soccer team , wolverhampton wanderers .
wolfie used to rally the crowds with playful and endearing kick-arounds with the opposing mascots before his team took to the pitch .
that is until the arrival of bristol city 's three little pigs .
in front of a television audience of millions , wolfie lost his cool in the pre-match contest and ended up battling all three pigs in a pitch-side punch-up .
needless to say , he never worked in that town again .
as the only official mascot of the world cup , goleo may not have any rivals to face and so potential fisticuffs should be avoided .
but even if he keeps his cold , wet nose clean , goleo must go into this new phase with his eyes open to the realities .
a mascot 's shelf life is a tangible one .
fame and fortune are assured in the run-up to the event and during it , but only the most endearing mascots linger in the memory when the glory fades .
the " aah " factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take the recent athens summer olympic games .
can anyone name the two asexual triangles that passed as the event 's co-mascots ?
well , they were phevos and athena , the siblings named after greek gods who represented the link between greek history and the modern olympic games .
the cumbersome and non-cuddly icons drew more baffled looks and questions than adoration this summer .
however , they contributed to the $ 81 million -lrb- € 63 million -rrb- or so that athens merchandising generated .
their success was assured mainly due to the usual ploy of covering everything from baby bonnets to thongs in their images .
if you wanted anything olympic , you had to have phevos and athena on it .
but despite this , it is unlikely that they will be the enduring memory of the games .

goleo the lion was revealed as the official mascot for the 2006 world cup this weekend .
while fame and fortune beckons for the face of the soccer spectacular , goleo will find out it 's not all furry handshakes and waving . with great power comes great responsibility , something goleo - the newly revealed official mascot of the 2006 world cup - will soon learn .
the tall and imposing , although very approachable looking , lion becomes the latest in a long line of fake animals to become the figurehead of a major sporting event .
goleo will spend the next 18 months preparing for the global soccer showcase in germany , where he will stir the crowded stadiums and inspire millions of spectators around the world .
during that time , goleo 's face will become synonymous with the world cup in germany and the harmonious message of fair play that will no doubt be promoted throughout the entirety of the month-long tournament .
global superstardom and worldwide recognition awaits him .
he looks happy enough , but is he ready ?
such a high profile position comes with its own set of intense pressures .
goleo will not even be able to enjoy a quiet gazelle without a pack of paparazzi snappers being on hand to record his every bite and maul .
so what can the mascot of the 2006 world cup expect ?
if everything goes right , goleo could be the next misha the bear .
the mascot of the olympic games of 1980 went on to become one of the best loved and most marketable figureheads in sporting history , so much so that many people forget the us boycott of the moscow games - in protest of the december 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan - and remember them for the cute little teddy bear who even cried at the closing ceremony .
memorable misha endures misha 's tale should give the german lion some hope .
regardless of how well his countrymen perform at the world cup , goleo could still come out of the tournament smelling of roses .
a successful stint as the face of the 2006 tournament could bode well for a future career away from the sporting spotlight .
goleo may want to look to the example set by english soccer team hartlepool united 's h 'angus the monkey .
the all-singing , all-dancing mascot of the yorkshire club enjoyed a long career aping around for the hartlepool faithful and made such an impression on the town that in may 2002 , he was elected town mayor .
but while the world may be an oyster - or in goleo 's case , a wildebeest - for the successful mascot , there are pitfalls .
as with any celebrity , there are temptations for the sporting mascot , such as unscrupulous types waiting to accelerate their downfall for their own gains by exploiting any furry foot put wrong .
the seedier side of the mascot life is just a flip of the coin away .

wolfie used to rally the crowds with playful and endearing kick-arounds with the opposing mascots before his team took to the pitch .
that is until the arrival of bristol city 's three little pigs .
in front of a television audience of millions , wolfie lost his cool in the pre-match contest and ended up battling all three pigs in a pitch-side punch-up .
needless to say , he never worked in that town again .
as the only official mascot of the world cup , goleo may not have any rivals to face and so potential fisticuffs should be avoided .
but even if he keeps his cold , wet nose clean , goleo must go into this new phase with his eyes open to the realities .

countries are not permitted to run a budget deficit above 3 percent of gdp before joining the euro or – in theory – during their membership of the euro zone .
however , despite the inaccurate data submitted by athens , their membership of the euro in 2001 is not in question , according to commission officials .
a spokesman for economics and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said there was " no possibility " of withdrawing greece from the 12 country zone although its acceptance was granted on false data .
greece ’ s budget deficit is forecast to be as high as 5.3 percent this year , following spiralling costs from the olympic games , which were recently revealed to have cost twice as much as athens had budgeted .
however , the greek government has pledged to halve this deficit in 2005 .
at a press conference , almunia confirmed that he would recommend to the incoming barroso commission to take " infringement procedures " against greece " as soon as possible . "
but the decision to admit greece into the euro zone was " made with the best available data at the time and it -lsb- the decision -rsb- is not called into question , " added the commissioner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.11.2004 fighting crime and bureaucracy in the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cooperation between eu forces is an achievable , but complicated , dream eurojust , the eu body set up to investigate serious cross-border crime in the member states , faces a mountain of work .
its job is made harder by the lack of cohesion between many european institutions and organizations . human trafficking , computer crime and terrorism are just some of the crimes dealt with by eurojust , the eu authority charged with the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border and organized crime .
in addition to the specific crime areas , there are also the individual cases which flood in from all 25 member states in the european union to be dealt with .
as a body established as recently as 2002 to enhance the effectiveness of collective crime fighting , and one which has more than 1000 live cases on its books , eurojust could well claim to be one of the busiest and overwhelmed departments in the eu .
behind kilometers of razor wire , security checks and armored doors , the headquarters of eurojust in the hague is one of the most secure places in the eu .
in contrast to the heavily guarded surroundings , it also one of the most open ; welcoming magistrates , public prosecutors and secret service agents from around the bloc every month for discussions and consultations .
a forum for investigation and prosecution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurojust brings security institutions and legal teams together in an attempt to open up dialogue and create a wider network of collaborative crime prevention across the eu .
everything from organized crime to international terrorism comes to the conference table in a sign that this type collaboration has become the single most important factor in the fight against crime .
and on the surface , it appears to be working .
" there has been a case where the italians and the germans were pursuing the same criminal at the same time in drug trafficking case , " german eurojust representative hermann von langsdorff told deutsche welle .
" in this instance , the germans were about to make an arrest and the italians came to us and asked if we could persuade the germans to hold off .
they waited for one week only and as a result the whole drug ring was smashed and many arrests made . "
despite such successes , not everything works as smoothly .
von langsdorff , who works with 24 other national representatives in mediating between public prosecutor 's offices all across europe , admitted that sometimes the influx of cases is too much .
" the big problem is that eurojust can only reasonably cope with one institution at a time , " he said .
lack of recognition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is one of the worst offenders for not offering or accepting help .
but there are also bigger problems .
contradictorily , few member states recognize the work of eurojust .
" for example , we have barely had any coordination requests from germany , " von langsdorff said .
" in 2003 , we received only one and in 2004 , up until now , just three .
in the overall scheme of things , this is too little . "
it is as if sept .
11 , 2001 never happened in most cases .
european public prosecutors continue to sit on vital information regarding terror suspects and some do not even know that eurojust exists and can help in the passing on of vital information , according to von langsdorff .
in the increasingly important fight against international terrorism , more collaboration is needed .
borders closed to exchange of information europe 's borders are open but not always in the eyes of the public prosecutors .
to obtain the right to make searches with foreign colleagues in a bordering country and even to make phone calls to other member states in relation to investigations require special approval .
even von langsdorff and his colleagues at eurojust have their hands tied to a certain extent .
without permission from the member states involved in a case , no results or information can be exchanged without permission .
von langsdorff believes a central data bank could change all this .
" the perfect scenario would be that a phone number discovered during a search in italy could immediately be put in the system and its origin ascertained , whether this number has been linked to terrorists in germany or france , " he said .
however , von langsdorff said he believes the eu is still a long way from that level of cooperation . georg matthes -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.11.2004 row over plan for german in mosques großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would have moslems pray in german a proposal for the enforcement of german as a spoken language in mosques has erupted in germany as politicians look for ways to reform the country 's integration policy in the wake of violence in the netherlands . a regional politician 's proposal that prayers in german mosques should be said in german was greeted with dismay on monday amid fears that anti-muslim attacks may spread over the border from the netherlands .
annette schavan , the christian democratic education minister for the state of baden-württemberg and a contender for the state 's premiership , made her radical proposal at the weekend because , she said , " we can no longer accept that prayers in mosques should be said in languages that can not be understood outside the muslim community . "
schavan 's proposal comes in the wake of the torching of mosques , schools and churches in the netherlands following the killing of film director theo van gogh , whose work was strongly critical of muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her suggestion drew a sharp reaction from the leaders of the more than two and a half million turks who live in germany .
" this is nonsense - terror can be spread in any language , " said kenan kolat , the co-president of the turkish community in germany .
cornelie sonntag-wolgast , a representative of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on the national parliamentary committee for domestic affairs also criticized the proposal .
" we can not suspect each and every person ... of violence just because they say their prayers in arabic , " said sonntag-wolgast .
volker beck , a spokesman for the greens , the junior partner in the governing coalition , said schavan 's proposal was " completely exaggerated " while liberal fdp interior minister max stadler criticized schavan , saying her proposal for the state to enforce the german language in mosques was " an offense against basic law . "
werner schiffauer , a cultural professor said , schavan 's plan was " out-of-touch and impractical " , a view supported by jürgen micksch , the chairperson of the intercultural council in germany .
professor schiffauer stated that there was little money available to provide language training for the large numbers of islamic preachers in germany and that , in addition , many foreigners living in germany stayed for only a short time and were dependent on mother-tongue services while they were there .
some support idea however , nadeem elyas , the chairman for the central council of muslims in germany , agreed with the proposal .
elyas explained that a lot of mosques already translate their prayers and sermons and offer simultaneous audio feeds in both arabic and german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mosque in berlin neukölln .
the council , he said , is made up of 19 organizations and about 500 mosque municipalities in germany , not all of which cater for purely arabic speakers .
elyas added that german , turkish , arabian , albanian , bosnian and persian muslims all worship in germany and many have different language requirements .
call for islamic holiday the row over schaven 's proposal comes at a time when germany seems desperate to define its integration policy and avoid copycat violence spreading across the border from the neighboring netherlands .
just a day after schaven 's proposal was revealed , a member of the green party in germany called for the government to install an official islamic holiday in the german calendar .

" holland is everywhere , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the social democratic party 's domestic expert over the weekend . it was an oft-quoted line in newspaper editorials this week as the country once again re-examined its often troubled relationship to the 2 million muslims that call germany home . the country 's top policeman , interior minister otto schily , warned others not to overreact to news of mosque burnings and tensions in holland .
he said germany 's new immigration law , which offers integration measures such as language classes to earlier as well as current generations of immigrants , was an important step towards cultural understanding . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily " there is , of course , also a danger for us , although we have significant integration successes to show , " schily -lrb- photo -rrb- told the german public broadcaster zdf .
" we should n't minimize those . "
" clash of civilizations " feared conservative politicians used the opportunity to warn of an impending " clash of civilizations " that could very well take place on german soil .
the head of bavaria 's christian scocial union , markus soeder , said the events in the netherlands showed the need for a leitkultur in germany .
the politically-loaded word can be translated as a " leading " or " guiding " culture . " when we look at the recent events in the netherlands , we see a clash of civilizations in full , and we must prevent anything similar from evolving here , " said soeder .
" we need a change in our integration policy which ought to be based strictly on the values and notion of a modern christian society . " terrorism investigators have estimated that there are about 1,000 radical members of the country 's muslim community that are prone to violence .
like their counterparts in holland , they are members of radical mosques where imams rail against israel and western society . misusing democracy bavarian interior minister günter beckstein said the imams must no longer be allowed to preach hate under the protection of the laws of german society .
" the enemies of freedom must not be allowed to use our liberties in order to harm us , " said beckstein .
" and there has to be a policy of zero tolerance towards them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan -lrb- middle -rrb- germany 's efforts to root out muslim fundamentalists have shown mixed success .
after years of trying , the country was finally able early this fall to deport fundamentalist metin kaplan , convicted of calling for the death of a rival imam in berlin , to turkey , where he is wanted for calling for the overthrow of the country 's government . bringing young muslims into the fold but two trials against suspected accomplices of the band of hamburg terrorists that carried out the sept .
11 terrorist attacks have ended in acquittals .
and the appeals do n't look to swing in the government 's favor . though a hard line against potential fundamentalists is preferable , politicians like the green party 's volker beck said the opposite should be done for moderate , young muslims .
" social exclusion and disintegration make young muslims vulnerable to radical ideologies and hatred , " beck said .
" the way out of this dilemma is not to brand them as outlaws , but rather to let them participate in german social life . " dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : europe faces new integration challenges the current wave of violence against muslims in the netherlands has forced all of europe to stop and examine the problems of integration .

a study by keele university researchers suggested that between 1993 and 1998 , the numbers rose from 23,624 to 37,361 - an increase of 62 % .
they looked at figures from doctors on the general practice research database .
the link between drugs and depression , psychosis and schizophrenia has been highlighted by anti-drugs campaigners .
illegal drugs researchers writing in the journal of epidemiology and community health found the rate of mental illness and substance abuse was up by 62 % at 230 general practices between 1993 and 1998 .
men were much more likely to be affected , with their rates up 79 % , compared with 44 % in women .

a study by keele university researchers suggested that between 1993 and 1998 , the numbers rose from 23,624 to 37,361 - an increase of 62 % .
they looked at figures from doctors on the general practice research database .
the link between drugs and depression , psychosis and schizophrenia has been highlighted by anti-drugs campaigners .
illegal drugs researchers writing in the journal of epidemiology and community health found the rate of mental illness and substance abuse was up by 62 % at 230 general practices between 1993 and 1998 .
men were much more likely to be affected , with their rates up 79 % , compared with 44 % in women .
patients aged 16-84 were included in the study , which looked at the abuse of prescription and illegal drugs , but not alcohol and tobacco .
the study looked at about 3 per cent of people in england and wales .
the average age of someone affected fell from 38 to 34 , and the number of cases in the 25-34 age group more than doubled , from 6,874 to 13,240 .
certain types of mental illness saw a bigger growth .
psychosis and drug abuse was up 147 % , paranoia 144 % and schizophrenia 128 % .
cliff prior , chief executive of the mental health charity rethink said : " there is a rapidly growing body of evidence showing that drug use can trigger mental illness in people already at risk .
" however the mental health risks associated with drugs are not widely understood by most young people and more resources need to be put into mental health warnings on the use of drugs .
" a long-term , well-funded , innovative campaign aimed at publicising the real mental health risks associated with drugs including cannabis needs to be in place as soon as possible . "

'
from the outside the fens pub in hartlepool may look like any other village pub .
as you approach the door you 're greeted by the usual sounds of people enjoying themselves and the aroma of alcohol mixed with tobacco smoke .
rather than banning its clientele from smoking , the pub is offering ways to help them quit their habit while still enjoying their regular tipple .
paula , 30 , told me how her local helped her kick a 50 cigarette a day habit .
pints and patches " it 's been six weeks now - six weeks on wednesday , " she says .
" i 'd been smoking since i was 14 , so for 16 years now .
i was smoking 40 to 50 a day , so i was a heavy smoker .
the first thing i would do in the morning when i woke up was light up .
" my husband had a scare with his heart recently so we both decided to stop .
" the people at the hospital told us about the scheme at the pub . "
the smell of smoke hits you when you walk in ... it makes me not want one .
ex-smoker paula the scheme started three years ago when staff at the pub who wanted to quit smoking were finding it hard to access the local smoking cessation services in hartlepool during daytime hours .
one of the local health visitors , jenny jones , decided to set up an evening drop in clinic within the pub to make it more convenient for people .
from there it snowballed .
the sessions run every wednesday evening in the pub , where people can turn up for advice , a prescription and a pint .
jenny said : " it 's grown and grown .
we now have two or three health visitors who can prescribe nicotine replacement therapies and a smoking cessation advisor who do about three hours every wednesday night at the pub .
" we do a full assessment and then decide with the clients what will suit them best and then we support them through every week for the next three months and give them a prescription every fortnight if they need it . "
last orders she said the demand had been so high that they had n't even needed to advertise the service .
in 2003 the department of health set a target for hartlepool to achieve 1,680 four-week quitters by 2006 .
the three-year target has almost been met within two years .
over 60 % of those setting a quit date are smoke free at four weeks in hartlepool .
jenny said the projects success was down to the friendly , supportive atmosphere of the pub and the timing of the sessions so that they fall outside regular working hours .
" ladies always come in in twos or threes and it is a bit of a treat for them .
it 's social .
" some men will use it as an excuse to go to the pub for a drink .
" we have a laugh and a chat and support each other . "
ex-smoker paula agreed .
she said although people still smoked in the pub she did n't mind .
" it stinks in there .
the smell of smoke hits you when you walk in .
" but it does not make me want to have a cigarette .
if anything , it makes me not want one .
" i 'll never smoke again - no chance .
i feel a lot better in my self . "

'
from the outside the fens pub in hartlepool may look like any other village pub .
as you approach the door you 're greeted by the usual sounds of people enjoying themselves and the aroma of alcohol mixed with tobacco smoke .
rather than banning its clientele from smoking , the pub is offering ways to help them quit their habit while still enjoying their regular tipple .
paula , 30 , told me how her local helped her kick a 50 cigarette a day habit .
pints and patches " it 's been six weeks now - six weeks on wednesday , " she says .
" i 'd been smoking since i was 14 , so for 16 years now .

the smell of smoke hits you when you walk in ... it makes me not want one .
ex-smoker paula the scheme started three years ago when staff at the pub who wanted to quit smoking were finding it hard to access the local smoking cessation services in hartlepool during daytime hours .
one of the local health visitors , jenny jones , decided to set up an evening drop in clinic within the pub to make it more convenient for people .

he says smoking in any public place should be banned to prevent others suffering in a similar way .

michael dunn in 1998 he was diagnosed with asthma after he was admitted to hospital for a severe attack of breathlessness .
mr dunn says he is convinced his health problems were caused by other people 's cigarette smoke .
" i used to walk in and see clouds of smoke hovering over the tables .
" the air conditioning was totally inadequate so the room filled up with smoke .
" they gave away free cigarettes to encourage people to stay and bet more .
" i would be in that atmosphere for seven hours a day and of course i could not leave the casino for security reasons .

" when i used to come home my wife used to think i had been by a bonfire .

he said that the casino had introduced a designated smoking area for staff during the last two years that he had worked there , but said that had made little difference because the main room where they all worked was still smoky .
" smoking in public places should be banned .
it 's very harmful to everyone 's health .
" my consultant said working in that sort of environment will take 10 years off your life .
it 's got to be banned . "
dr maureen baker of the royal college of gps also believes a total ban is needed .
she said : " pub and restaurants workers along with non-smoking customers need legislation to protect them from the dangers of passive smoking . "
mr dunn 's ex-employer napoleon casino declined to comment .
simon clark of pro-smoking group forest said : " there is no justification for a ban on smoking in all public places .
" the public is in favour of more restrictions on smoking , but wants choice not a total ban , especially in pubs .

dr maureen baker of the royal college of gps also believes a total ban is needed .
she said : " pub and restaurants workers along with non-smoking customers need legislation to protect them from the dangers of passive smoking . "
mr dunn 's ex-employer napoleon casino declined to comment .
simon clark of pro-smoking group forest said : " there is no justification for a ban on smoking in all public places .
" the public is in favour of more restrictions on smoking , but wants choice not a total ban , especially in pubs .
" smoke-free is already the norm in most public places but in pubs , clubs and bars , which are private businesses , people want a choice of smoking and non-smoking areas with improved ventilation . "

it 's a far cry from the old fashioned ' clap clinic ' located down a dark alley at the back of a hospital , shrouded in secrecy and taboo .
outside the bus there is already a group of teenagers forming a disorderly queue .
pushing and shoving each other and generally mucking around , they look like they are waiting for a lift to school rather than queuing for free condoms .
some people would take the piss or say are you gay or you ca n't get a girlfriend .
a boy explaining why he chose 4yp to get confidential advice the 4yp bus is a service for all young people in enfield and haringey aged between 11 and 18 who want guidance or simply someone to talk to about sex and relationship issues .
on board , the staff adopt an informal approach .
some have been teen mums themselves , others are youth workers or midwives from the local community .
the emphasis is on the youngsters to set the agenda for discussions .
meeting needs as well as the settee lined reception , where group sessions take place , there is a private consultation room where youngsters can talk to a worker in confidence .
the children can get information and advice on sexual health and relationships , free condoms and a demonstration of how to use them .
from january , they will also be able to have a urine test for chlamydia - the ' pee in a pot ' service .
as briton 's first and only sex education bus , it is hoped it will help reach the government 's targets on teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections .
by 2010 the government wants pregnancy rates among under 18s to have halved .
users can chat in groups or individually and by 2007 it wants a 25 % reduction in the number of newly acquired hiv and gonorrhoea infections .
haringey and enfield have particularly high teen pregnancy rates - around 73 per 1,000 compared to 50 , per 1,000 elsewhere in london and 43 per 1,000 in england and wales as a whole .
similarly , these boroughs have seen higher rates of stis than the rest of the country .
in enfield between 1998 and 2002 , there was a 580 % increase in the prevalence of gonorrhoea compared to an average 98 % increase for the rest of england .
during the same period , chlamydia increased by 130 % in enfield compared to 77 % elsewhere in england .
about 100 children visit the bus each month , peaking to about 200 in the summer months .
it 's about making sure at least one peer in the group has the right information .
worker telsa walker , describing one of the challenges the staff face most of these are boys and many are from black and ethnic minority communities , figures since the project began in 2001 show .
" i come here to get these , " said one 16-year-old boy waving the purple packet filled with condoms he is holding in his hand .
" i 've come with him to find out what it 's about and get information and stuff , " says his friend , who then grins and giggles .
they tell me they found out about the service from a flyer at school .
" i 've told some of my mates about this place and told them to come here , " says the first boy .
" but i would n't tell everyone .
some people would take the piss or say are you gay or you ca n't get a girlfriend , " he adds .
his friend tells me they received sex education at school , but that it was awkward to talk about it with teachers .
" it 's embarrassing though innit .
i think it 's easier to ask close friends .
or to come here .
" one thing i 'd never do is ask my mum . "
the challenge telsa walker , one of the trained staff working on the bus , said many of the children they see come in with questions that they have been too embarrassed to ask friends , parents or teachers .
" most have got their information on sex from their friends and often it 's completely incorrect .
" so it 's about making sure at least one peer in the group has the right information .
" some come on the bus not knowing that vaginal discharge is normal or are confused about why their body is changing .
" others just want to know that what they are feeling and experiencing is normal .
" we do have young people who may feel that they are pregnant or know that they are pregnant .
" sometimes they do not like going into mainstream services .
it can be really intimidating .
they are scared or embarrassed .
" they know they can talk to us in confidence in a relaxed , informal and non-judgemental way . "
she said one of the biggest challenges was getting the information to stick .
" with some , they will know what stis are , but when you quiz them they wo n't know what the signs or symptoms are .
" some get a bit giggly , and you have to go back over the same points , but you make allowances for that .
" we get them to set ground rules themselves before the start of discussions .
then it 's easier for them to stick to .
it could be ' talk one at a time ' or ' no personal experiences ' .
" it 's completely confidential and that 's one of the biggest reasons why people use 4yg . "
she said rarely parents had turned up to the bus expressing concern that their children had been given free condoms .
" but as soon as they understand exactly what we are doing they calm down .
" some come on the bus themselves to get information to give to their children about safe sex . "

changing the tv channels and reaching for his beers used to be the most active thing the 41-year-old engineer attempted .
his health was starting to suffer , even tying his shoe laces left him panting for breath .
but three months ago gary , from braunstone , leicester , discovered beer belly busters and it has transformed his life .
beer the men-only weight loss programme and a subsidised gym funded by his local community association have enabled him to shed nearly four stone and he feels much better for it .
" before this i did no exercise at all .
i came home and watched the television , drank my beer and then watched more television .
i was puffing and panting just tying my shoelaces gary buncher " i would have about 30 cans of beer in a week and i would not do anything .
" i was breathless and had no energy .
i was puffing and panting just tying my shoelaces .
" at the time i was not worried about it , but it had got to the stage where i could not do anything without it taking it out of me and leaving me breathless . "
" the hardest thing was finding the time to do something about it .
i always used to put dieting off saying that i had no time , but you have got to make time . "
now the whole family benefits from gary 's new active life .
he plays badminton and scales the local climbing wall with his sons and he has got his wife interested in joining the gym .
he says he feels 100 times better .
" this gave me the kick-start i needed .
now i feel a lot more content and relaxed and a hell of a lot fitter . "
slimmer fellow slimmer neil chapman , a hospital administrator , has been going to beer belly busters for just over a month and has already managed to drop nine pounds in weight .
he says that without the incentive of the group and its camaraderie he might never have had the strength to slim and get fit .
" i wanted to do it , but i put it off .
then my brother started to go and i thought i would too .
we all help and support each other .
" i used to eat chips and a lot of packet meals , burgers and sausages and now i eat baked potatoes .
i try to vary my diet with fresh food and meat .
i also try to go to the gym about three times a week . "
health worker and local resident andy vincent explained that because braunstone is a deprived council estate on the outskirts of leicester it has been given a funding package of £ 49.5 million for projects to tackle unemployment and crime , improving health , housing , the physical environment and raising educational achievement .
it has also been granted sports action zone status to enable it to access funding for residents .
this means they can offer the slimmers subsidised membership of the gym and slimming club .
when andy took up his post two years ago he quizzed the local men about their concerns .
" i went out into the streets and clubs and talked to men and got their thoughts on the issues and various things came out .
" i found that the level of smoking was high .
55 % of them admitted that smoking affected their health and that they were worried about their weight and fitness .
" it was partly to do with diet and what was available in the local area .
there is a low car ownership so they are reliant on public transport for where they can go and there are a lot of chip shops and chinese take-aways and burger shops .
" the men recognised there was a problem with their weight and even though more admitted smoking was a problem the percentage which wanted to do something about it was very low .
" but the number of people who wanted to do something about their weight was very high .
and at the end of the day people only give up if they want to . "
health andy said the men had a variety of health problems such as arthritis and high blood pressure .
all the men are given advice on exercise as well as membership to a men-only slimming club run by weightcare and local consultant michael beardow .
michael started running the men-only classes after losing about four and a half stone himself at a predominantly female class .
he said the single-sex classes encouraged more men to start slimming and since the group opened in braunstone just over three months ago .
he said the atmosphere at the weekly meeting was good and that people were already starting to see the health benefits .
" it is a bit of a man 's night out and they can enjoy themselves and have a bit of fun we are getting some fantastic results .
" they were guys who had not looked after themselves very well . "

i was puffing and panting just tying my shoelaces .
" at the time i was not worried about it , but it had got to the stage where i could not do anything without it taking it out of me and leaving me breathless . "
" the hardest thing was finding the time to do something about it .
i always used to put dieting off saying that i had no time , but you have got to make time . "
now the whole family benefits from gary 's new active life .
he plays badminton and scales the local climbing wall with his sons and he has got his wife interested in joining the gym .
he says he feels 100 times better .
" this gave me the kick-start i needed .
now i feel a lot more content and relaxed and a hell of a lot fitter . "
slimmer fellow slimmer neil chapman , a hospital administrator , has been going to beer belly busters for just over a month and has already managed to drop nine pounds in weight .
he says that without the incentive of the group and its camaraderie he might never have had the strength to slim and get fit .
" i wanted to do it , but i put it off .
then my brother started to go and i thought i would too .
we all help and support each other .
" i used to eat chips and a lot of packet meals , burgers and sausages and now i eat baked potatoes .
i try to vary my diet with fresh food and meat .
i also try to go to the gym about three times a week . "
health worker and local resident andy vincent explained that because braunstone is a deprived council estate on the outskirts of leicester it has been given a funding package of £ 49.5 million for projects to tackle unemployment and crime , improving health , housing , the physical environment and raising educational achievement .
it has also been granted sports action zone status to enable it to access funding for residents .
this means they can offer the slimmers subsidised membership of the gym and slimming club .
when andy took up his post two years ago he quizzed the local men about their concerns .
" i went out into the streets and clubs and talked to men and got their thoughts on the issues and various things came out .
" i found that the level of smoking was high .
55 % of them admitted that smoking affected their health and that they were worried about their weight and fitness .
" it was partly to do with diet and what was available in the local area .
there is a low car ownership so they are reliant on public transport for where they can go and there are a lot of chip shops and chinese take-aways and burger shops .
" the men recognised there was a problem with their weight and even though more admitted smoking was a problem the percentage which wanted to do something about it was very low .
" but the number of people who wanted to do something about their weight was very high .
and at the end of the day people only give up if they want to . "
health andy said the men had a variety of health problems such as arthritis and high blood pressure .
all the men are given advice on exercise as well as membership to a men-only slimming club run by weightcare and local consultant michael beardow .
michael started running the men-only classes after losing about four and a half stone himself at a predominantly female class .
he said the single-sex classes encouraged more men to start slimming and since the group opened in braunstone just over three months ago .
he said the atmosphere at the weekly meeting was good and that people were already starting to see the health benefits .
" it is a bit of a man 's night out and they can enjoy themselves and have a bit of fun we are getting some fantastic results .
" they were guys who had not looked after themselves very well . "

it 's a far cry from the old fashioned ' clap clinic ' located down a dark alley at the back of a hospital , shrouded in secrecy and taboo .
outside the bus there is already a group of teenagers forming a disorderly queue .
pushing and shoving each other and generally mucking around , they look like they are waiting for a lift to school rather than queuing for free condoms .
some people would take the piss or say are you gay or you ca n't get a girlfriend .
a boy explaining why he chose 4yp to get confidential advice the 4yp bus is a service for all young people in enfield and haringey aged between 11 and 18 who want guidance or simply someone to talk to about sex and relationship issues .
on board , the staff adopt an informal approach .
some have been teen mums themselves , others are youth workers or midwives from the local community .
the emphasis is on the youngsters to set the agenda for discussions .
meeting needs as well as the settee lined reception , where group sessions take place , there is a private consultation room where youngsters can talk to a worker in confidence .
the children can get information and advice on sexual health and relationships , free condoms and a demonstration of how to use them .
from january , they will also be able to have a urine test for chlamydia - the ' pee in a pot ' service .
as briton 's first and only sex education bus , it is hoped it will help reach the government 's targets on teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections .
by 2010 the government wants pregnancy rates among under 18s to have halved .
users can chat in groups or individually and by 2007 it wants a 25 % reduction in the number of newly acquired hiv and gonorrhoea infections .
haringey and enfield have particularly high teen pregnancy rates - around 73 per 1,000 compared to 50 , per 1,000 elsewhere in london and 43 per 1,000 in england and wales as a whole .
similarly , these boroughs have seen higher rates of stis than the rest of the country .
in enfield between 1998 and 2002 , there was a 580 % increase in the prevalence of gonorrhoea compared to an average 98 % increase for the rest of england .
during the same period , chlamydia increased by 130 % in enfield compared to 77 % elsewhere in england .
about 100 children visit the bus each month , peaking to about 200 in the summer months .
it 's about making sure at least one peer in the group has the right information .
worker telsa walker , describing one of the challenges the staff face most of these are boys and many are from black and ethnic minority communities , figures since the project began in 2001 show .
" i come here to get these , " said one 16-year-old boy waving the purple packet filled with condoms he is holding in his hand .
" i 've come with him to find out what it 's about and get information and stuff , " says his friend , who then grins and giggles .
they tell me they found out about the service from a flyer at school .
" i 've told some of my mates about this place and told them to come here , " says the first boy .
" but i would n't tell everyone .
some people would take the piss or say are you gay or you ca n't get a girlfriend , " he adds .
his friend tells me they received sex education at school , but that it was awkward to talk about it with teachers .
" it 's embarrassing though innit .
i think it 's easier to ask close friends .
or to come here .
" one thing i 'd never do is ask my mum . "
the challenge telsa walker , one of the trained staff working on the bus , said many of the children they see come in with questions that they have been too embarrassed to ask friends , parents or teachers .
" most have got their information on sex from their friends and often it 's completely incorrect .
" so it 's about making sure at least one peer in the group has the right information .
" some come on the bus not knowing that vaginal discharge is normal or are confused about why their body is changing .
" others just want to know that what they are feeling and experiencing is normal .
" we do have young people who may feel that they are pregnant or know that they are pregnant .
" sometimes they do not like going into mainstream services .
it can be really intimidating .
they are scared or embarrassed .
" they know they can talk to us in confidence in a relaxed , informal and non-judgemental way . "
she said one of the biggest challenges was getting the information to stick .
" with some , they will know what stis are , but when you quiz them they wo n't know what the signs or symptoms are .
" some get a bit giggly , and you have to go back over the same points , but you make allowances for that .
" we get them to set ground rules themselves before the start of discussions .
then it 's easier for them to stick to .
it could be ' talk one at a time ' or ' no personal experiences ' .
" it 's completely confidential and that 's one of the biggest reasons why people use 4yg . "
she said rarely parents had turned up to the bus expressing concern that their children had been given free condoms .
" but as soon as they understand exactly what we are doing they calm down .

it 's a far cry from the old fashioned ' clap clinic ' located down a dark alley at the back of a hospital , shrouded in secrecy and taboo .
outside the bus there is already a group of teenagers forming a disorderly queue .
pushing and shoving each other and generally mucking around , they look like they are waiting for a lift to school rather than queuing for free condoms .
some people would take the piss or say are you gay or you ca n't get a girlfriend .
a boy explaining why he chose 4yp to get confidential advice the 4yp bus is a service for all young people in enfield and haringey aged between 11 and 18 who want guidance or simply someone to talk to about sex and relationship issues .
on board , the staff adopt an informal approach .
some have been teen mums themselves , others are youth workers or midwives from the local community .
the emphasis is on the youngsters to set the agenda for discussions .
meeting needs as well as the settee lined reception , where group sessions take place , there is a private consultation room where youngsters can talk to a worker in confidence .
the children can get information and advice on sexual health and relationships , free condoms and a demonstration of how to use them .
from january , they will also be able to have a urine test for chlamydia - the ' pee in a pot ' service .
as briton 's first and only sex education bus , it is hoped it will help reach the government 's targets on teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections .
by 2010 the government wants pregnancy rates among under 18s to have halved .
users can chat in groups or individually and by 2007 it wants a 25 % reduction in the number of newly acquired hiv and gonorrhoea infections .
haringey and enfield have particularly high teen pregnancy rates - around 73 per 1,000 compared to 50 , per 1,000 elsewhere in london and 43 per 1,000 in england and wales as a whole .
similarly , these boroughs have seen higher rates of stis than the rest of the country .
in enfield between 1998 and 2002 , there was a 580 % increase in the prevalence of gonorrhoea compared to an average 98 % increase for the rest of england .
during the same period , chlamydia increased by 130 % in enfield compared to 77 % elsewhere in england .
about 100 children visit the bus each month , peaking to about 200 in the summer months .
it 's about making sure at least one peer in the group has the right information .
worker telsa walker , describing one of the challenges the staff face most of these are boys and many are from black and ethnic minority communities , figures since the project began in 2001 show .
" i come here to get these , " said one 16-year-old boy waving the purple packet filled with condoms he is holding in his hand .
" i 've come with him to find out what it 's about and get information and stuff , " says his friend , who then grins and giggles .
they tell me they found out about the service from a flyer at school .
" i 've told some of my mates about this place and told them to come here , " says the first boy .
" but i would n't tell everyone .
some people would take the piss or say are you gay or you ca n't get a girlfriend , " he adds .
his friend tells me they received sex education at school , but that it was awkward to talk about it with teachers .
" it 's embarrassing though innit .
i think it 's easier to ask close friends .
or to come here .
" one thing i 'd never do is ask my mum . "
the challenge telsa walker , one of the trained staff working on the bus , said many of the children they see come in with questions that they have been too embarrassed to ask friends , parents or teachers .
" most have got their information on sex from their friends and often it 's completely incorrect .
" so it 's about making sure at least one peer in the group has the right information .
" some come on the bus not knowing that vaginal discharge is normal or are confused about why their body is changing .
" others just want to know that what they are feeling and experiencing is normal .
" we do have young people who may feel that they are pregnant or know that they are pregnant .
" sometimes they do not like going into mainstream services .
it can be really intimidating .
they are scared or embarrassed .
" they know they can talk to us in confidence in a relaxed , informal and non-judgemental way . "
she said one of the biggest challenges was getting the information to stick .
" with some , they will know what stis are , but when you quiz them they wo n't know what the signs or symptoms are .
" some get a bit giggly , and you have to go back over the same points , but you make allowances for that .
" we get them to set ground rules themselves before the start of discussions .
then it 's easier for them to stick to .
it could be ' talk one at a time ' or ' no personal experiences ' .
" it 's completely confidential and that 's one of the biggest reasons why people use 4yg . "
she said rarely parents had turned up to the bus expressing concern that their children had been given free condoms .
" but as soon as they understand exactly what we are doing they calm down .
" some come on the bus themselves to get information to give to their children about safe sex . "

pushing and shoving each other and generally mucking around , they look like they are waiting for a lift to school rather than queuing for free condoms .
some people would take the piss or say are you gay or you ca n't get a girlfriend .
a boy explaining why he chose 4yp to get confidential advice the 4yp bus is a service for all young people in enfield and haringey aged between 11 and 18 who want guidance or simply someone to talk to about sex and relationship issues .
on board , the staff adopt an informal approach .
some have been teen mums themselves , others are youth workers or midwives from the local community .
the emphasis is on the youngsters to set the agenda for discussions .
meeting needs as well as the settee lined reception , where group sessions take place , there is a private consultation room where youngsters can talk to a worker in confidence .
the children can get information and advice on sexual health and relationships , free condoms and a demonstration of how to use them .
from january , they will also be able to have a urine test for chlamydia - the ' pee in a pot ' service .
as briton 's first and only sex education bus , it is hoped it will help reach the government 's targets on teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections .
by 2010 the government wants pregnancy rates among under 18s to have halved .
users can chat in groups or individually and by 2007 it wants a 25 % reduction in the number of newly acquired hiv and gonorrhoea infections .
haringey and enfield have particularly high teen pregnancy rates - around 73 per 1,000 compared to 50 , per 1,000 elsewhere in london and 43 per 1,000 in england and wales as a whole .
similarly , these boroughs have seen higher rates of stis than the rest of the country .
in enfield between 1998 and 2002 , there was a 580 % increase in the prevalence of gonorrhoea compared to an average 98 % increase for the rest of england .
during the same period , chlamydia increased by 130 % in enfield compared to 77 % elsewhere in england .
about 100 children visit the bus each month , peaking to about 200 in the summer months .
it 's about making sure at least one peer in the group has the right information .
worker telsa walker , describing one of the challenges the staff face most of these are boys and many are from black and ethnic minority communities , figures since the project began in 2001 show .
" i come here to get these , " said one 16-year-old boy waving the purple packet filled with condoms he is holding in his hand .
" i 've come with him to find out what it 's about and get information and stuff , " says his friend , who then grins and giggles .
they tell me they found out about the service from a flyer at school .
" i 've told some of my mates about this place and told them to come here , " says the first boy .
" but i would n't tell everyone .
some people would take the piss or say are you gay or you ca n't get a girlfriend , " he adds .
his friend tells me they received sex education at school , but that it was awkward to talk about it with teachers .
" it 's embarrassing though innit .
i think it 's easier to ask close friends .
or to come here .
" one thing i 'd never do is ask my mum . "
the challenge telsa walker , one of the trained staff working on the bus , said many of the children they see come in with questions that they have been too embarrassed to ask friends , parents or teachers .
" most have got their information on sex from their friends and often it 's completely incorrect .
" so it 's about making sure at least one peer in the group has the right information .
" some come on the bus not knowing that vaginal discharge is normal or are confused about why their body is changing .
" others just want to know that what they are feeling and experiencing is normal .
" we do have young people who may feel that they are pregnant or know that they are pregnant .
" sometimes they do not like going into mainstream services .
it can be really intimidating .
they are scared or embarrassed .
" they know they can talk to us in confidence in a relaxed , informal and non-judgemental way . "
she said one of the biggest challenges was getting the information to stick .
" with some , they will know what stis are , but when you quiz them they wo n't know what the signs or symptoms are .
" some get a bit giggly , and you have to go back over the same points , but you make allowances for that .
" we get them to set ground rules themselves before the start of discussions .
then it 's easier for them to stick to .
it could be ' talk one at a time ' or ' no personal experiences ' .
" it 's completely confidential and that 's one of the biggest reasons why people use 4yg . "
she said rarely parents had turned up to the bus expressing concern that their children had been given free condoms .
" but as soon as they understand exactly what we are doing they calm down .
" some come on the bus themselves to get information to give to their children about safe sex . "

changing the tv channels and reaching for his beers used to be the most active thing the 41-year-old engineer attempted .
his health was starting to suffer , even tying his shoe laces left him panting for breath .
but three months ago gary , from braunstone , leicester , discovered beer belly busters and it has transformed his life .
beer the men-only weight loss programme and a subsidised gym funded by his local community association have enabled him to shed nearly four stone and he feels much better for it .
" before this i did no exercise at all .
i came home and watched the television , drank my beer and then watched more television . "
i was puffing and panting just tying my shoelaces " gary buncher " i would have about 30 cans of beer in a week and i would not do anything .
" i was breathless and had no energy .
i was puffing and panting just tying my shoelaces .
" at the time i was not worried about it , but it had got to the stage where i could not do anything without it taking it out of me and leaving me breathless . "
" the hardest thing was finding the time to do something about it .
i always used to put dieting off saying that i had no time , but you have got to make time . "
now the whole family benefits from gary 's new active life .
he plays badminton and scales the local climbing wall with his sons and he has got his wife interested in joining the gym .
he says he feels 100 times better .
" this gave me the kick-start i needed .
now i feel a lot more content and relaxed and a hell of a lot fitter . "
slimmer fellow slimmer neil chapman , a hospital administrator , has been going to beer belly busters for just over a month and has already managed to drop nine pounds in weight .
he says that without the incentive of the group and its camaraderie he might never have had the strength to slim and get fit .
" i wanted to do it , but i put it off .
then my brother started to go and i thought i would too .
we all help and support each other .
" i used to eat chips and a lot of packet meals , burgers and sausages and now i eat baked potatoes .
i try to vary my diet with fresh food and meat .
i also try to go to the gym about three times a week . "
health worker and local resident andy vincent explained that because braunstone is a deprived council estate on the outskirts of leicester it has been given a funding package of £ 49.5 million for projects to tackle unemployment and crime , improving health , housing , the physical environment and raising educational achievement .
it has also been granted sports action zone status to enable it to access funding for residents .
this means they can offer the slimmers subsidised membership of the gym and slimming club .
when andy took up his post two years ago he quizzed the local men about their concerns .
" i went out into the streets and clubs and talked to men and got their thoughts on the issues and various things came out .
" i found that the level of smoking was high .
55 % of them admitted that smoking affected their health and that they were worried about their weight and fitness .
" it was partly to do with diet and what was available in the local area .
there is a low car ownership so they are reliant on public transport for where they can go and there are a lot of chip shops and chinese take-aways and burger shops .
" the men recognised there was a problem with their weight and even though more admitted smoking was a problem the percentage which wanted to do something about it was very low .
" but the number of people who wanted to do something about their weight was very high .
and at the end of the day people only give up if they want to . "
health andy said the men had a variety of health problems such as arthritis and high blood pressure .
all the men are given advice on exercise as well as membership to a men-only slimming club run by weightcare and local consultant michael beardow .
michael started running the men-only classes after losing about four and a half stone himself at a predominantly female class .
he said the single-sex classes encouraged more men to start slimming and since the group opened in braunstone just over three months ago .
he said the atmosphere at the weekly meeting was good and that people were already starting to see the health benefits .
" it is a bit of a man 's night out and they can enjoy themselves and have a bit of fun we are getting some fantastic results .
" they were guys who had not looked after themselves very well . "

a teetotaller for the last six years , malcolm has had time to reflects on his lost years and admits he is full of regrets .
he worries that he has left it too late to follow his dream of going to the us , that at 56 he will not get another job and that the damage done to his body is permanent .
malcolm had his first taste of alcohol as a toddler , when his mother and father slipped him sips of brown ale on trips to the pub .
drinking by the age of nine he was drinking quite regularly , and by his teens it had become a way of life as he mixed with celebrities in the vibrant social scene of london in the sixties and seventies .
he used to drink eight to 12 pints of beer a day and would often get through half a bottle of whiskey as well . "
i would probably have become a respected member of society , but instead i became an embarrassment " malcolm allworthy malcolm started his career in advertising but , as was to become a pattern in his life , he dropped out and started to work in bars and restaurants .
over the years he was to start and fail to finish a number of careers , including art college and teacher training .
eventually he got work in a hospital as a porter but continued to drink .
hospital after hospital dispensed with his services and his life started to take a downward spiral .
" it got to the point where i was warned about being too mouthy and giving my opinion too freely .
i was drinking very heavily and at one point one of the hospitals had someone watching me when i went out at lunchtime to make sure i did not drink too much .
" i ended up working in casualty and i was on my own working a lot of the time .
i found i was working under the influence of drink .
it was the thing that kept me going throughout the night .
" once i injured myself by falling into an x-ray machine and i twisted my body .
i was carrying a lot of drink related injuries .
i was a real problem .
i could have hurt the patients .
" i was in quite a few fights and i had broken ribs .
help " i am a big guy and quite friendly and cuddly , but when i had been drinking i could become quite naughty and i would run down the street kicking cars and smashing windows and going into people 's gardens and using them as toilets . "
eventually it all got to much for malcolm and he asked for help .
" i was referred to the alcohol recovery project -lrb- arp -rrb- and after a few months there i started to admit that i was an alcoholic and stopped drinking . "
but malcolm said that years of abuse had left a terrible mark on his health .
" when i first stopped drinking i seemed ok , but i was not .
i have had recurring problems with my immunity and i catch every cold and flu that is going .
" my body does not heal properly either .
i have a blister on my foot because i was wearing ill-fitting shoes and that will just not heal .
my circulation is very poor .
" i have had problems with leg cramps and therapists have told me that my spleen and small intestine are not working properly .
" i was a borderline diabetic and i have had problem kidneys and prostate problems .
at one stage my liver functions were not too good . "
" because i was drinking it also sidelined me career wise and it has been difficult for me to find employment . , almost impossible .
" although i do courses i ca n't get a job because when i have to write out my cv 's there are about 10 years when there is nothing i can put on it , although i do voluntary work helping people with mental health problems .
" i could have done something with my life .
i was told i was very good at art .
" but i have had a bit of a miserable life , staying here when i would have liked to go to america and having lots of miserable jobs .
" i feel that drinking has ruined my life and i have lost all my life .
" i now get panic attacks about what i have done and what i have not done with my life .
i have the horrors that i will kill myself with drink all over again .
" when i see young people binge drinking i want to say to them ' look at the damage it has done to me ' .
" i have lost 10 years of my life , and those are years i could have been successful .
i would probably have become a respected member of society , but instead i became an embarrassment . "
sally scriminger , chief executive of arp , a london-based charity and special needs housing association , said : " we believe that everyone with an alcohol problem has the potential to achieve positive change and make a contribution to society . "
" alcohol plays an enormous social and cultural role in our society .
excessive or problem drinking can , as well as ruining individuals ' physical health and exacerbating or causing psychological conditions such as depression , also trigger accidents , crime , violence and disorder .
problem drinking is strongly associated with domestic violence , child abuse and neglect . "
" it is important to ensure that health and social care professionals understand the risks associated with problem drinking and support is readily available to assist those who want to tackle their problem drinking . "

a teetotaller for the last six years , malcolm has had time to reflects on his lost years and admits he is full of regrets .
he worries that he has left it too late to follow his dream of going to the us , that at 56 he will not get another job and that the damage done to his body is permanent .
malcolm had his first taste of alcohol as a toddler , when his mother and father slipped him sips of brown ale on trips to the pub .
drinking by the age of nine he was drinking quite regularly , and by his teens it had become a way of life as he mixed with celebrities in the vibrant social scene of london in the sixties and seventies .
he used to drink eight to 12 pints of beer a day and would often get through half a bottle of whiskey as well .
i would probably have become a respected member of society , but instead i became an embarrassment malcolm allworthy malcolm started his career in advertising but , as was to become a pattern in his life , he dropped out and started to work in bars and restaurants .
over the years he was to start and fail to finish a number of careers , including art college and teacher training .
eventually he got work in a hospital as a porter but continued to drink .
hospital after hospital dispensed with his services and his life started to take a downward spiral .
" it got to the point where i was warned about being too mouthy and giving my opinion too freely .
i was drinking very heavily and at one point one of the hospitals had someone watching me when i went out at lunchtime to make sure i did not drink too much .
" i ended up working in casualty and i was on my own working a lot of the time .
i found i was working under the influence of drink .
it was the thing that kept me going throughout the night .
" once i injured myself by falling into an x-ray machine and i twisted my body .
i was carrying a lot of drink related injuries .
i was a real problem .
i could have hurt the patients .
" i was in quite a few fights and i had broken ribs .
help " i am a big guy and quite friendly and cuddly , but when i had been drinking i could become quite naughty and i would run down the street kicking cars and smashing windows and going into people 's gardens and using them as toilets . "
eventually it all got to much for malcolm and he asked for help .
" i was referred to the alcohol recovery project -lrb- arp -rrb- and after a few months there i started to admit that i was an alcoholic and stopped drinking . "
but malcolm said that years of abuse had left a terrible mark on his health .
" when i first stopped drinking i seemed ok , but i was not .
i have had recurring problems with my immunity and i catch every cold and flu that is going .
" my body does not heal properly either .
i have a blister on my foot because i was wearing ill-fitting shoes and that will just not heal .
my circulation is very poor .
" i have had problems with leg cramps and therapists have told me that my spleen and small intestine are not working properly .
" i was a borderline diabetic and i have had problem kidneys and prostate problems .

" i could have done something with my life .
i was told i was very good at art .
" but i have had a bit of a miserable life , staying here when i would have liked to go to america and having lots of miserable jobs .

" i have lost 10 years of my life , and those are years i could have been successful .

sally scriminger , chief executive of arp , a london-based charity and special needs housing association , said : " we believe that everyone with an alcohol problem has the potential to achieve positive change and make a contribution to society . "
" alcohol plays an enormous social and cultural role in our society .
excessive or problem drinking can , as well as ruining individuals ' physical health and exacerbating or causing psychological conditions such as depression , also trigger accidents , crime , violence and disorder .
problem drinking is strongly associated with domestic violence , child abuse and neglect . "

he worries that he has left it too late to follow his dream of going to the us , that at 56 he will not get another job and that the damage done to his body is permanent .
malcolm had his first taste of alcohol as a toddler , when his mother and father slipped him sips of brown ale on trips to the pub .
drinking by the age of nine he was drinking quite regularly , and by his teens it had become a way of life as he mixed with celebrities in the vibrant social scene of london in the sixties and seventies .
