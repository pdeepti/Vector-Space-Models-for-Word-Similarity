speculation is growing that the once top-flight team is preparing to sell some of its best players to come up with some cash . long plagued by poor results on the pitch and money problems in the boardroom , the once mighty borussia appears these day to be limping like a dying wildebeest , being shadowed by hyenas behind and vultures above . in an efforts to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion is ready to initiate a fire sale to cash in its best assets .

but for a club in dortmund ’ s position - this season alone it faces an estimated € 25 million loss - a rival club offering to pay the asking price of € 30 million for a player that cost almost half that three years ago would present the former german title holders with an offer perhaps too alluring to refuse . such a deal would be difficult for the debt-laden club to ignore after losing out on the estimated € 12 million financial windfall in champions league revenue .

the release of millions of royal air force world war ii reconnaissance photos , including aerial shots of auschwitz , has drawn criticism from those wondering why the allies did n't act sooner to stop the nazi genocide . the photos show a massive cloud of smoke created by the burning of thousands of corpses at auschwitz .
they show images of the " d-day " allied landing on the beaches of normandy so rich in detail that you can recognize the bodies of american gis .
they show the city of cologne in rubble after months of heavy british bombing .
and with their release this week , the british aerial reconnaissance archives at keele university have again raised painful memories and questions about the war .
who knew what and when ?
and why did n't anyone take action sooner to stop the nazi atrocities ?
on monday , britain 's keele university released more than 5 million royal air force aerial reconnaissance photos on a special web site .
for decades , the photos were available only to researchers and unknown to the broader public .
but now , indexed and searchable online to anyone , the images provide viewers with entirely new perspectives of the most bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the bridge at arnhem , the netherlands horrific and dramatic events of world war ii .
the most historically important images on the site are shots from auschwitz taken in august 1944 , d-day shots taken in june of the same year and images of the german battleship bismarck , which the germans kept hidden in a norwegian fjord for five days in may 1941 until the british forces sank it .
" these images allow us to see the real war at first hand , " project head allan william said . "
i was really moved by the photographs of the nazi concentration camps and the d-day landings .
it 's like a live action replay . "
images anger some but the shocking auschwitz images have also raised serious questions amongst critics about the actions of the allies during the war and why they did n't move to stop the gassings sooner by bombing the rail lines into the camps .
writing in britain ’ s guardian newspaper , journalist john ezard lamented : " you can view ‘ as though in a time machine ’ a 3d photograph which could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives had it been publicized when it was taken at 11 a.m. on august 23 , 1944 , at a time when hungarian jews were being murdered below . "
the photo was taken by an raf pilot aboard a reconnaissance plane over poland at a time when the germans , aware their days were numbered , had massively increased the amount of killing at auschwitz .
the detail is so clear in one photo that you can even see two columns of prisoners lining up for roll call at the concentration camp .
here in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday published a story under the headline " why weren ’ t the concentration camp thugs bombed ? "
the newspaper quoted german historian hans-ulrich wheler , a guest professor at harvard university , saying that london became aware , at the latest , of the nazi ’ s death camps in 1943 .
information on the web site of the united states holocaust memorial , which serves more or less as the official american historical authority , appears to backup wehler 's claim .
it notes that " in 1943 , polish courier jan karski informed president franklin d. roosevelt of reports of mass murder received from jewish leaders in the warsaw ghetto .
no immediate executive action was taken . "
by the autumn of 1944 , the museum claims , the allies knew of the gassings at auschwitz .
" why therefore were the extermination camps not destroyed after the reconnaissance planes of the britons and americans photographed them in such detail , " bild asked ?
" at the very least , the railway tracks on which the jews were transported into the extermination camp ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial shot of the beaches of normandy during d-day the archive ’ s caretaker , williams , said the spies took the photos in rapid-succession , like machine gun fire and that it was possible , given the sheer volume of photos , that they were never given the scrutiny they deserved .
" it is a fascinating issue as to why the photo operators did not know what was going on , " williams said .
" i think the answer is that their orders were to look single-mindedly for military data .
they did not have time to think what else was happening .

on monday , britain 's keele university released more than 5 million royal air force aerial reconnaissance photos on a special web site .
for decades , the photos were available only to researchers and unknown to the broader public .
but now , indexed and searchable online to anyone , the images provide viewers with entirely new perspectives of the most bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the bridge at arnhem , the netherlands horrific and dramatic events of world war ii .
the most historically important images on the site are shots from auschwitz taken in august 1944 , d-day shots taken in june of the same year and images of the german battleship bismarck , which the germans kept hidden in a norwegian fjord for five days in may 1941 until the british forces sank it .
" these images allow us to see the real war at first hand , " project head allan william said . "
i was really moved by the photographs of the nazi concentration camps and the d-day landings .
it 's like a live action replay . "
images anger some but the shocking auschwitz images have also raised serious questions amongst critics about the actions of the allies during the war and why they did n't move to stop the gassings sooner by bombing the rail lines into the camps .
writing in britain ’ s guardian newspaper , journalist john ezard lamented : " you can view ‘ as though in a time machine ’ a 3d photograph which could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives had it been publicized when it was taken at 11 a.m. on august 23 , 1944 , at a time when hungarian jews were being murdered below . "
the photo was taken by an raf pilot aboard a reconnaissance plane over poland at a time when the germans , aware their days were numbered , had massively increased the amount of killing at auschwitz .
the detail is so clear in one photo that you can even see two columns of prisoners lining up for roll call at the concentration camp .
here in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday published a story under the headline " why weren ’ t the concentration camp thugs bombed ? "
the newspaper quoted german historian hans-ulrich wheler , a guest professor at harvard university , saying that london became aware , at the latest , of the nazi ’ s death camps in 1943 .
information on the web site of the united states holocaust memorial , which serves more or less as the official american historical authority , appears to backup wehler 's claim .
it notes that " in 1943 , polish courier jan karski informed president franklin d. roosevelt of reports of mass murder received from jewish leaders in the warsaw ghetto .
no immediate executive action was taken . "
by the autumn of 1944 , the museum claims , the allies knew of the gassings at auschwitz .
" why therefore were the extermination camps not destroyed after the reconnaissance planes of the britons and americans photographed them in such detail , " bild asked ?
" at the very least , the railway tracks on which the jews were transported into the extermination camp ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial shot of the beaches of normandy during d-day the archive ’ s caretaker , williams , said the spies took the photos in rapid-succession , like machine gun fire and that it was possible , given the sheer volume of photos , that they were never given the scrutiny they deserved .

tomas rosicky may be headed to the english premiership .
are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?
speculation is growing that the once top-flight team is preparing to sell some of its best players to come up with some cash . long plagued by poor results on the pitch and money problems in the boardroom , the once mighty borussia appears these day to be limping like a dying wildebeest , being shadowed by hyenas behind and vultures above . in an efforts to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion is ready to initiate a fire sale to cash in its best assets .
comments from czech star midfielder tomas rosicky stoked speculation he was on the verge of leaving borussia dortmund , with a decision coming perhaps as early as this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's roman abramovich .
first in the queue of eager shoppers outside the gates of the westfalen stadium is russian billionaire and fc chelsea chairman roman abramovich .
the man who has bankrolled the so-called chelski revolution in the english premier league appears to have an insatiable appetite for the world ’ s best players and the deep pockets to match .
the london club is reported prepared to pay upwards of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.1 million -rrb- for rosicky . player fuels rumors rosicky has been doing little to dampen the russian 's ardor .
" i 've known about chelsea 's interest for eight or nine days , " the midfielder recently admitted when questioned by reporters .
" it is now down to the clubs to see what happens , but if i were borussia i would not refuse the offer . " rosicky , the current dortmund captain and integral free-flowing cog in the czech machinery at the heart of the team , is valued at around € 14.8 million but would likely cost fc chelsea much more than that , given the player ’ s rising stock and his current agreement with the german team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosicky joined the bundesliga side from sparta prague in 2001 , and is under contract with them until 2008 .
a majority of the inflated price would go on paying compensation to the club for the loss of a contracted player . dortmund looking for profit on sale gerd niebaum , borussia ’ s president , on tuesday said dortmund did not have an offer for rosicky on the table and he refused to comment on the reports .
but for a club in dortmund ’ s position - this season alone it faces an estimated € 25 million loss - a rival club offering to pay the asking price of € 30 million for a player that cost almost half that three years ago would present the former german title holders with an offer perhaps too alluring to refuse . such a deal would be difficult for the debt-laden club to ignore after losing out on the estimated € 12 million financial windfall in champions league revenue .
the club ’ s misery was made complete when they were unceremoniously dumped out of the uefa cup by french side sochaux , losing 6-2 on aggregate . over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was also looking into borrow around € 100 million euros by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . top stars to be sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon of borussia dortmund , right , leaves the field under a pouring rain after his uefa cup , second round , second leg soccer match against sochaux , thursday , nov .
27 , 2003 in sochaux , eastern france .
sochaux defeated borussia 4-0 and advances to the next round of the competition .
teammate at left is unidentified .
-lrb- ap photo / patrick gardin -rrb- the sad reality of the situation at dortmund is that , with a number of underperforming and overpaid players on the books - many are currently injured - only the top stars at borussia are going to be worth anything to interested parties .
that means the sale of rosicky , compatriot jan koller and the brazilian youngster ewerthon -lrb- picture -rrb- represent the best chance of generating cash . the vicious circle would then be set in motion once more ; top players sold to pay off debts , leading to the team being undermined by a reduction in quality and the possibility of poor results which in turn could mean loss of revenue and yet more debts . despite the pen being far from poised over a deal between borussia and chelsea on the rosicky deal - dortmund coach matthias sammer has angrily called for the saga to be concluded one way or the other by the weekend - it looks to be only a matter of time before more check books are waved in the general direction of an increasingly desperate westfalen stadium . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dortmund faces cash crunch borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .

the release of millions of royal air force world war ii reconnaissance photos , including aerial shots of auschwitz , has drawn criticism from those wondering why the allies did n't act sooner to stop the nazi genocide . the photos show a massive cloud of smoke created by the burning of thousands of corpses at auschwitz .
they show images of the " d-day " allied landing on the beaches of normandy so rich in detail that you can recognize the bodies of american gis .
they show the city of cologne in rubble after months of heavy british bombing .
and with their release this week , the british aerial reconnaissance archives at keele university have again raised painful memories and questions about the war .
who knew what and when ?
and why did n't anyone take action sooner to stop the nazi atrocities ?
on monday , britain 's keele university released more than 5 million royal air force aerial reconnaissance photos on a special web site .
for decades , the photos were available only to researchers and unknown to the broader public .
but now , indexed and searchable online to anyone , the images provide viewers with entirely new perspectives of the most bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the bridge at arnhem , the netherlands horrific and dramatic events of world war ii .
the most historically important images on the site are shots from auschwitz taken in august 1944 , d-day shots taken in june of the same year and images of the german battleship bismarck , which the germans kept hidden in a norwegian fjord for five days in may 1941 until the british forces sank it .
" these images allow us to see the real war at first hand , " project head allan william said . "
i was really moved by the photographs of the nazi concentration camps and the d-day landings .
it 's like a live action replay . "
images anger some but the shocking auschwitz images have also raised serious questions amongst critics about the actions of the allies during the war and why they did n't move to stop the gassings sooner by bombing the rail lines into the camps .
writing in britain ’ s guardian newspaper , journalist john ezard lamented : " you can view ‘ as though in a time machine ’ a 3d photograph which could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives had it been publicized when it was taken at 11 a.m. on august 23 , 1944 , at a time when hungarian jews were being murdered below . "
the photo was taken by an raf pilot aboard a reconnaissance plane over poland at a time when the germans , aware their days were numbered , had massively increased the amount of killing at auschwitz .
the detail is so clear in one photo that you can even see two columns of prisoners lining up for roll call at the concentration camp .
here in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday published a story under the headline " why weren ’ t the concentration camp thugs bombed ? "
the newspaper quoted german historian hans-ulrich wheler , a guest professor at harvard university , saying that london became aware , at the latest , of the nazi ’ s death camps in 1943 .
information on the web site of the united states holocaust memorial , which serves more or less as the official american historical authority , appears to backup wehler 's claim .
it notes that " in 1943 , polish courier jan karski informed president franklin d. roosevelt of reports of mass murder received from jewish leaders in the warsaw ghetto .
no immediate executive action was taken . "
by the autumn of 1944 , the museum claims , the allies knew of the gassings at auschwitz .
" why therefore were the extermination camps not destroyed after the reconnaissance planes of the britons and americans photographed them in such detail , " bild asked ?
" at the very least , the railway tracks on which the jews were transported into the extermination camp ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial shot of the beaches of normandy during d-day the archive ’ s caretaker , williams , said the spies took the photos in rapid-succession , like machine gun fire and that it was possible , given the sheer volume of photos , that they were never given the scrutiny they deserved .
" it is a fascinating issue as to why the photo operators did not know what was going on , " williams said .
" i think the answer is that their orders were to look single-mindedly for military data .
they did not have time to think what else was happening .

butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality . with two patent applications before the german patent office , signature drives and even a report by the bavarian ministry of agriculture on the issue , the munich sausage controversy has reached boiling point , something that should never happen to the water in which the mushy specialty is heated to perfection . but that ’ s beside the point for a group of munich mass-production butchers and restaurateurs , who are trying to secure exclusive rights to produce “ munich white sausages . ” they claim that only the city ’ s butchers can produce edible versions of the delicacy , and as evidence they claim that some of their bavarian competitors substitute cheaper pork for the sausage ’ s signature veal base . munich by name , munich by origin karl-heinz wildmoser , who runs a beer tent at oktoberfest and serves as president of munich ’ s tsv 1860 soccer club , said he ’ s had to suffer through sausage ordeals during games away from home .
“ we ’ re often treated to white sausages by other clubs - that ’ s a nice gesture , but sometimes they ’ re gruesome , ” wildmoser recently told münchner merkur newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo for the association for the protection of the white sausage includes a drawing of the twin tower of munich 's cathedral , the city 's landmark .
wildmoser , himself a munich original , is an adamant supporter of the association for the protection of the munich white sausage .
the group has filed a copyright application with the patent office , saying that calling sausages produced beyond munich county borders amounted to defrauding consumers . the association has received the backing of munich mayor christian ude as well as other politicians .
“ the white sausage belongs to munich like no other food and that ’ s why we think it ’ s our duty to protect it from abuse , ” said helmut schmid , the leader of the social democrats in the city ’ s parliament . other bavarians make good sausage , too it ’ s a sentiment shared by the trade association of bavarian butchers , which has also filed a copyright application trying to patent the sausage ’ s original recipe .
unlike the munich-centric sausage supporters , this group believes that butchers south of the so-called “ white sausage equator , ” which roughly corresponds to the course of bavaria 's portion of the danube river , can also craft excellent products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a butcher in a restaurant on munich 's st. mary 's square allegedly created the weißwurst in 1857 .
“ we believe that a quality munich white sausage can also be made in old bavaria and swabia , not just munich itself , ” georg schlagbauer , himself a munich butcher , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , adding that it shouldn ’ t be geography but rather sausage ingredients that matter . in his opinion , the other side was simply trying to secure its market share , he added .
“ munich ’ s largest white sausage producer is part of the group , ” schlagbauer told the agence france presse news service .
“ there is a financial motivation behind this patriotism . ” following nuremberg ’ s and dresden ’ s lead ? patent office officials will likely take several months to decide on the issue , according to a spokesperson .
they can rely on a survey commissioned by the bavarian ministry of agriculture , in which 48 percent of germans believed munich white sausage came from the city and its surrounding areas .
should the patent office decide in favor of one of the applications , the german ministry of justice and the european commission still have to sign off on them . similar protection of local delicacies has already been approved in the past : nuremberg ’ s bratwurst has to come from the city .
dresdner stollen , a popular christmas bread , must be made in that eastern german city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner siegert with his book on white sausages .
“ what ’ s happening now in munich is pretty much the same , ” werner siegert -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has written a book on the etiquette rules of white sausage , told dw-world .
he believes stagnating sausage sales at munich ’ s restaurants , where the weisswurst and a beer have been a traditional mid-morning snack , had provoked the campaign .
“ i think people should rely on marketing and not on the legal system , however , ” siegert said , adding that he ’ s working on a collection of short stories on leaflets restaurants could hand out to their customers to bridge the five to eight minutes it takes to serve the perfect weisswurst . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more many of the tourists who travel to bavaria 's bustling capital city never make it past the hofbräuhaus tent at oktoberfest .

butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality . with two patent applications before the german patent office , signature drives and even a report by the bavarian ministry of agriculture on the issue , the munich sausage controversy has reached boiling point , something that should never happen to the water in which the mushy specialty is heated to perfection . but that ’ s beside the point for a group of munich mass-production butchers and restaurateurs , who are trying to secure exclusive rights to produce “ munich white sausages . ” they claim that only the city ’ s butchers can produce edible versions of the delicacy , and as evidence they claim that some of their bavarian competitors substitute cheaper pork for the sausage ’ s signature veal base . munich by name , munich by origin karl-heinz wildmoser , who runs a beer tent at oktoberfest and serves as president of munich ’ s tsv 1860 soccer club , said he ’ s had to suffer through sausage ordeals during games away from home .

wildmoser , himself a munich original , is an adamant supporter of the association for the protection of the munich white sausage .
the group has filed a copyright application with the patent office , saying that calling sausages produced beyond munich county borders amounted to defrauding consumers . the association has received the backing of munich mayor christian ude as well as other politicians .

“ we believe that a quality munich white sausage can also be made in old bavaria and swabia , not just munich itself , ” georg schlagbauer , himself a munich butcher , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , adding that it shouldn ’ t be geography but rather sausage ingredients that matter . in his opinion , the other side was simply trying to secure its market share , he added .

in november , the finance ministers on the european council effectively suspended the stability pact in order to prevent the commission from imposing stiff penalties on france and germany .
the move prompted solbes ' suit at the luxembourg high court .
in his consultations with the so-called euro group , which includes the finance ministers of all 12 euro zone countries , solbes once again repeated his grounds for the unprecedented lawsuit .
but solbes was met with frosty resistance .
' little support ' " there was little support among the ministers for the commission ’ s decision to seek a ruling from the european court of justice , " said irish finance minister charlie mccreevy .
austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who in the past has sided with solbes , rejected the commission ’ s suit .
even if the commission were to win it ’ s case , he said , nothing would change because it wouldn ’ t have any way of making sure the judgement was enforced .
on the other hand , " if the commission loses , " grasser said , " it could create the impression that germany and france acted properly , which certainly isn ’ t the case .
in our opinion , it ’ s a misguided deficit policy that ’ s certainly damaging for growth and employment .
in that regard , we ’ ve fought side by side with the commission and for that reason i regret that the commission is now sending out a false political signal instead of increasing the political pressure on germany and france to continue with their -lrb- budget -rrb- consolidation . "
this year , germany and france will breach the budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product established in the stability and growth pact for the third year in a row .
but german finance minister hans eichel said monday he still found solbes ’ decision to sue to be " incomprehensible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel speaking at the meeting , he said : " because the economy is doing better , the mood is , in general , good .
i don ’ t think there ’ s anything else to say really . "
despite the refusal of the council to accept his decision to sue , solbes on monday seemed unmoved .
" first , i don ’ t feel attacked , " he said .
" second , i have acted consistently with my position , which is that the pact that was agreed to must be respected . "
germany 's eichel , meanwhile , also rejected solbes ’ plan to call for changes to the stability pact next month .
the new regulations would force member states to adhere to more disciplined budgets during periods of economic upswings .
concern over weak dollar in a separate area of discussion monday , the ministers also broached the issue of the euro ’ s high exchange rate against the dollar .
" in the present circumstances , we ’ ve stressed stability and we ’ re concerned about excessive exchange rate moves , " the ministers said in a statement .
" we will continue to monitor the situation very closely and conduct policies supporting economic recovery in a stable macroeconomic environment . "
the european finance ministers are also seeking to develop a common position for their g7 meeting with the united states in florida early next month .
several finance experts as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , have expressed concern about the weakness of the dollar – even though the dollar appeared to recover against the euro slightly during the past week .
another point of contention between the european commission and the finance ministers is a call by the commission to increase the eu ’ s budget by 1.24 percent of gross domestic product after 2007 .
germany and five other eu net payers have rejected the proposal , which would require them to pay billions more to brussels .
german finance minister eichel has said he would like to cap the eu budget at 1 percent of gross domestic product , which would create an overall budget of about € 100 billion . berndt riegert -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission budget plan likely to irk member states the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money .

in november , the finance ministers on the european council effectively suspended the stability pact in order to prevent the commission from imposing stiff penalties on france and germany .
the move prompted solbes ' suit at the luxembourg high court .
in his consultations with the so-called euro group , which includes the finance ministers of all 12 euro zone countries , solbes once again repeated his grounds for the unprecedented lawsuit .
but solbes was met with frosty resistance .
' little support ' " there was little support among the ministers for the commission ’ s decision to seek a ruling from the european court of justice , " said irish finance minister charlie mccreevy .
austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who in the past has sided with solbes , rejected the commission ’ s suit .
even if the commission were to win it ’ s case , he said , nothing would change because it wouldn ’ t have any way of making sure the judgement was enforced .
on the other hand , " if the commission loses , " grasser said , " it could create the impression that germany and france acted properly , which certainly isn ’ t the case .
in our opinion , it ’ s a misguided deficit policy that ’ s certainly damaging for growth and employment .
in that regard , we ’ ve fought side by side with the commission and for that reason i regret that the commission is now sending out a false political signal instead of increasing the political pressure on germany and france to continue with their -lrb- budget -rrb- consolidation . "
this year , germany and france will breach the budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product established in the stability and growth pact for the third year in a row .
but german finance minister hans eichel said monday he still found solbes ’ decision to sue to be " incomprehensible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel speaking at the meeting , he said : " because the economy is doing better , the mood is , in general , good .
i don ’ t think there ’ s anything else to say really . "
despite the refusal of the council to accept his decision to sue , solbes on monday seemed unmoved .
" first , i don ’ t feel attacked , " he said .
" second , i have acted consistently with my position , which is that the pact that was agreed to must be respected . "
germany 's eichel , meanwhile , also rejected solbes ’ plan to call for changes to the stability pact next month .
the new regulations would force member states to adhere to more disciplined budgets during periods of economic upswings .
concern over weak dollar in a separate area of discussion monday , the ministers also broached the issue of the euro ’ s high exchange rate against the dollar .
" in the present circumstances , we ’ ve stressed stability and we ’ re concerned about excessive exchange rate moves , " the ministers said in a statement .
" we will continue to monitor the situation very closely and conduct policies supporting economic recovery in a stable macroeconomic environment . "
the european finance ministers are also seeking to develop a common position for their g7 meeting with the united states in florida early next month .
several finance experts as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , have expressed concern about the weakness of the dollar – even though the dollar appeared to recover against the euro slightly during the past week .

tomas rosicky may be headed to the english premiership .
are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?
speculation is growing that the once top-flight team is preparing to sell some of its best players to come up with some cash . long plagued by poor results on the pitch and money problems in the boardroom , the once mighty borussia appears these day to be limping like a dying wildebeest , being shadowed by hyenas behind and vultures above . in an efforts to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion is ready to initiate a fire sale to cash in its best assets .
comments from czech star midfielder tomas rosicky stoked speculation he was on the verge of leaving borussia dortmund , with a decision coming perhaps as early as this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's roman abramovich .
first in the queue of eager shoppers outside the gates of the westfalen stadium is russian billionaire and fc chelsea chairman roman abramovich .
the man who has bankrolled the so-called chelski revolution in the english premier league appears to have an insatiable appetite for the world ’ s best players and the deep pockets to match .
the london club is reported prepared to pay upwards of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.1 million -rrb- for rosicky . player fuels rumors rosicky has been doing little to dampen the russian 's ardor .
" i 've known about chelsea 's interest for eight or nine days , " the midfielder recently admitted when questioned by reporters .
" it is now down to the clubs to see what happens , but if i were borussia i would not refuse the offer . " rosicky , the current dortmund captain and integral free-flowing cog in the czech machinery at the heart of the team , is valued at around € 14.8 million but would likely cost fc chelsea much more than that , given the player ’ s rising stock and his current agreement with the german team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosicky joined the bundesliga side from sparta prague in 2001 , and is under contract with them until 2008 .
a majority of the inflated price would go on paying compensation to the club for the loss of a contracted player . dortmund looking for profit on sale gerd niebaum , borussia ’ s president , on tuesday said dortmund did not have an offer for rosicky on the table and he refused to comment on the reports .
but for a club in dortmund ’ s position - this season alone it faces an estimated € 25 million loss - a rival club offering to pay the asking price of € 30 million for a player that cost almost half that three years ago would present the former german title holders with an offer perhaps too alluring to refuse . such a deal would be difficult for the debt-laden club to ignore after losing out on the estimated € 12 million financial windfall in champions league revenue .
the club ’ s misery was made complete when they were unceremoniously dumped out of the uefa cup by french side sochaux , losing 6-2 on aggregate . over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was also looking into borrow around € 100 million euros by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . top stars to be sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon of borussia dortmund , right , leaves the field under a pouring rain after his uefa cup , second round , second leg soccer match against sochaux , thursday , nov .
27 , 2003 in sochaux , eastern france .
sochaux defeated borussia 4-0 and advances to the next round of the competition .
teammate at left is unidentified .
-lrb- ap photo / patrick gardin -rrb- the sad reality of the situation at dortmund is that , with a number of underperforming and overpaid players on the books - many are currently injured - only the top stars at borussia are going to be worth anything to interested parties .
that means the sale of rosicky , compatriot jan koller and the brazilian youngster ewerthon -lrb- picture -rrb- represent the best chance of generating cash . the vicious circle would then be set in motion once more ; top players sold to pay off debts , leading to the team being undermined by a reduction in quality and the possibility of poor results which in turn could mean loss of revenue and yet more debts . despite the pen being far from poised over a deal between borussia and chelsea on the rosicky deal - dortmund coach matthias sammer has angrily called for the saga to be concluded one way or the other by the weekend - it looks to be only a matter of time before more check books are waved in the general direction of an increasingly desperate westfalen stadium . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dortmund faces cash crunch borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .

tomas rosicky may be headed to the english premiership .
are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?
speculation is growing that the once top-flight team is preparing to sell some of its best players to come up with some cash . long plagued by poor results on the pitch and money problems in the boardroom , the once mighty borussia appears these day to be limping like a dying wildebeest , being shadowed by hyenas behind and vultures above . in an efforts to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion is ready to initiate a fire sale to cash in its best assets .
comments from czech star midfielder tomas rosicky stoked speculation he was on the verge of leaving borussia dortmund , with a decision coming perhaps as early as this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's roman abramovich .
first in the queue of eager shoppers outside the gates of the westfalen stadium is russian billionaire and fc chelsea chairman roman abramovich .
the man who has bankrolled the so-called chelski revolution in the english premier league appears to have an insatiable appetite for the world ’ s best players and the deep pockets to match .
the london club is reported prepared to pay upwards of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.1 million -rrb- for rosicky . player fuels rumors rosicky has been doing little to dampen the russian 's ardor .
" i 've known about chelsea 's interest for eight or nine days , " the midfielder recently admitted when questioned by reporters .
" it is now down to the clubs to see what happens , but if i were borussia i would not refuse the offer . " rosicky , the current dortmund captain and integral free-flowing cog in the czech machinery at the heart of the team , is valued at around € 14.8 million but would likely cost fc chelsea much more than that , given the player ’ s rising stock and his current agreement with the german team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosicky joined the bundesliga side from sparta prague in 2001 , and is under contract with them until 2008 .
a majority of the inflated price would go on paying compensation to the club for the loss of a contracted player . dortmund looking for profit on sale gerd niebaum , borussia ’ s president , on tuesday said dortmund did not have an offer for rosicky on the table and he refused to comment on the reports .
but for a club in dortmund ’ s position - this season alone it faces an estimated € 25 million loss - a rival club offering to pay the asking price of € 30 million for a player that cost almost half that three years ago would present the former german title holders with an offer perhaps too alluring to refuse . such a deal would be difficult for the debt-laden club to ignore after losing out on the estimated € 12 million financial windfall in champions league revenue .
the club ’ s misery was made complete when they were unceremoniously dumped out of the uefa cup by french side sochaux , losing 6-2 on aggregate . over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was also looking into borrow around € 100 million euros by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . top stars to be sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon of borussia dortmund , right , leaves the field under a pouring rain after his uefa cup , second round , second leg soccer match against sochaux , thursday , nov .

butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality . with two patent applications before the german patent office , signature drives and even a report by the bavarian ministry of agriculture on the issue , the munich sausage controversy has reached boiling point , something that should never happen to the water in which the mushy specialty is heated to perfection . but that ’ s beside the point for a group of munich mass-production butchers and restaurateurs , who are trying to secure exclusive rights to produce “ munich white sausages . ” they claim that only the city ’ s butchers can produce edible versions of the delicacy , and as evidence they claim that some of their bavarian competitors substitute cheaper pork for the sausage ’ s signature veal base . munich by name , munich by origin karl-heinz wildmoser , who runs a beer tent at oktoberfest and serves as president of munich ’ s tsv 1860 soccer club , said he ’ s had to suffer through sausage ordeals during games away from home .
“ we ’ re often treated to white sausages by other clubs - that ’ s a nice gesture , but sometimes they ’ re gruesome , ” wildmoser recently told münchner merkur newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo for the association for the protection of the white sausage includes a drawing of the twin tower of munich 's cathedral , the city 's landmark .
wildmoser , himself a munich original , is an adamant supporter of the association for the protection of the munich white sausage .
the group has filed a copyright application with the patent office , saying that calling sausages produced beyond munich county borders amounted to defrauding consumers . the association has received the backing of munich mayor christian ude as well as other politicians .
“ the white sausage belongs to munich like no other food and that ’ s why we think it ’ s our duty to protect it from abuse , ” said helmut schmid , the leader of the social democrats in the city ’ s parliament . other bavarians make good sausage , too it ’ s a sentiment shared by the trade association of bavarian butchers , which has also filed a copyright application trying to patent the sausage ’ s original recipe .
unlike the munich-centric sausage supporters , this group believes that butchers south of the so-called “ white sausage equator , ” which roughly corresponds to the course of bavaria 's portion of the danube river , can also craft excellent products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a butcher in a restaurant on munich 's st. mary 's square allegedly created the weißwurst in 1857 .
“ we believe that a quality munich white sausage can also be made in old bavaria and swabia , not just munich itself , ” georg schlagbauer , himself a munich butcher , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , adding that it shouldn ’ t be geography but rather sausage ingredients that matter . in his opinion , the other side was simply trying to secure its market share , he added .
“ munich ’ s largest white sausage producer is part of the group , ” schlagbauer told the agence france presse news service .
“ there is a financial motivation behind this patriotism . ” following nuremberg ’ s and dresden ’ s lead ? patent office officials will likely take several months to decide on the issue , according to a spokesperson .
they can rely on a survey commissioned by the bavarian ministry of agriculture , in which 48 percent of germans believed munich white sausage came from the city and its surrounding areas .

the release of millions of royal air force world war ii reconnaissance photos , including aerial shots of auschwitz , has drawn criticism from those wondering why the allies did n't act sooner to stop the nazi genocide . the photos show a massive cloud of smoke created by the burning of thousands of corpses at auschwitz .
they show images of the " d-day " allied landing on the beaches of normandy so rich in detail that you can recognize the bodies of american gis .
they show the city of cologne in rubble after months of heavy british bombing .
and with their release this week , the british aerial reconnaissance archives at keele university have again raised painful memories and questions about the war .
who knew what and when ?
and why did n't anyone take action sooner to stop the nazi atrocities ?
on monday , britain 's keele university released more than 5 million royal air force aerial reconnaissance photos on a special web site .
for decades , the photos were available only to researchers and unknown to the broader public .
but now , indexed and searchable online to anyone , the images provide viewers with entirely new perspectives of the most bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the bridge at arnhem , the netherlands horrific and dramatic events of world war ii .
the most historically important images on the site are shots from auschwitz taken in august 1944 , d-day shots taken in june of the same year and images of the german battleship bismarck , which the germans kept hidden in a norwegian fjord for five days in may 1941 until the british forces sank it .
" these images allow us to see the real war at first hand , " project head allan william said . "
i was really moved by the photographs of the nazi concentration camps and the d-day landings .
it 's like a live action replay . "
images anger some but the shocking auschwitz images have also raised serious questions amongst critics about the actions of the allies during the war and why they did n't move to stop the gassings sooner by bombing the rail lines into the camps .
writing in britain ’ s guardian newspaper , journalist john ezard lamented : " you can view ‘ as though in a time machine ’ a 3d photograph which could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives had it been publicized when it was taken at 11 a.m. on august 23 , 1944 , at a time when hungarian jews were being murdered below . "
the photo was taken by an raf pilot aboard a reconnaissance plane over poland at a time when the germans , aware their days were numbered , had massively increased the amount of killing at auschwitz .
the detail is so clear in one photo that you can even see two columns of prisoners lining up for roll call at the concentration camp .
here in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday published a story under the headline " why weren ’ t the concentration camp thugs bombed ? "
the newspaper quoted german historian hans-ulrich wheler , a guest professor at harvard university , saying that london became aware , at the latest , of the nazi ’ s death camps in 1943 .
information on the web site of the united states holocaust memorial , which serves more or less as the official american historical authority , appears to backup wehler 's claim .
it notes that " in 1943 , polish courier jan karski informed president franklin d. roosevelt of reports of mass murder received from jewish leaders in the warsaw ghetto .
no immediate executive action was taken . "
by the autumn of 1944 , the museum claims , the allies knew of the gassings at auschwitz .
" why therefore were the extermination camps not destroyed after the reconnaissance planes of the britons and americans photographed them in such detail , " bild asked ?
" at the very least , the railway tracks on which the jews were transported into the extermination camp ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial shot of the beaches of normandy during d-day the archive ’ s caretaker , williams , said the spies took the photos in rapid-succession , like machine gun fire and that it was possible , given the sheer volume of photos , that they were never given the scrutiny they deserved .
" it is a fascinating issue as to why the photo operators did not know what was going on , " williams said .

the release of millions of royal air force world war ii reconnaissance photos , including aerial shots of auschwitz , has drawn criticism from those wondering why the allies did n't act sooner to stop the nazi genocide . the photos show a massive cloud of smoke created by the burning of thousands of corpses at auschwitz .
they show images of the " d-day " allied landing on the beaches of normandy so rich in detail that you can recognize the bodies of american gis .
they show the city of cologne in rubble after months of heavy british bombing .
and with their release this week , the british aerial reconnaissance archives at keele university have again raised painful memories and questions about the war .
who knew what and when ?
and why did n't anyone take action sooner to stop the nazi atrocities ?
on monday , britain 's keele university released more than 5 million royal air force aerial reconnaissance photos on a special web site .
for decades , the photos were available only to researchers and unknown to the broader public .
but now , indexed and searchable online to anyone , the images provide viewers with entirely new perspectives of the most bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the bridge at arnhem , the netherlands horrific and dramatic events of world war ii .
the most historically important images on the site are shots from auschwitz taken in august 1944 , d-day shots taken in june of the same year and images of the german battleship bismarck , which the germans kept hidden in a norwegian fjord for five days in may 1941 until the british forces sank it .
" these images allow us to see the real war at first hand , " project head allan william said . "
i was really moved by the photographs of the nazi concentration camps and the d-day landings .
it 's like a live action replay . "
images anger some but the shocking auschwitz images have also raised serious questions amongst critics about the actions of the allies during the war and why they did n't move to stop the gassings sooner by bombing the rail lines into the camps .
writing in britain ’ s guardian newspaper , journalist john ezard lamented : " you can view ‘ as though in a time machine ’ a 3d photograph which could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives had it been publicized when it was taken at 11 a.m. on august 23 , 1944 , at a time when hungarian jews were being murdered below . "
the photo was taken by an raf pilot aboard a reconnaissance plane over poland at a time when the germans , aware their days were numbered , had massively increased the amount of killing at auschwitz .
the detail is so clear in one photo that you can even see two columns of prisoners lining up for roll call at the concentration camp .
here in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday published a story under the headline " why weren ’ t the concentration camp thugs bombed ? "
the newspaper quoted german historian hans-ulrich wheler , a guest professor at harvard university , saying that london became aware , at the latest , of the nazi ’ s death camps in 1943 .
information on the web site of the united states holocaust memorial , which serves more or less as the official american historical authority , appears to backup wehler 's claim .
it notes that " in 1943 , polish courier jan karski informed president franklin d. roosevelt of reports of mass murder received from jewish leaders in the warsaw ghetto .
no immediate executive action was taken . "
by the autumn of 1944 , the museum claims , the allies knew of the gassings at auschwitz .
" why therefore were the extermination camps not destroyed after the reconnaissance planes of the britons and americans photographed them in such detail , " bild asked ?
" at the very least , the railway tracks on which the jews were transported into the extermination camp ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial shot of the beaches of normandy during d-day the archive ’ s caretaker , williams , said the spies took the photos in rapid-succession , like machine gun fire and that it was possible , given the sheer volume of photos , that they were never given the scrutiny they deserved .

in november , the finance ministers on the european council effectively suspended the stability pact in order to prevent the commission from imposing stiff penalties on france and germany .
the move prompted solbes ' suit at the luxembourg high court .
in his consultations with the so-called euro group , which includes the finance ministers of all 12 euro zone countries , solbes once again repeated his grounds for the unprecedented lawsuit .
but solbes was met with frosty resistance .
' little support ' " there was little support among the ministers for the commission ’ s decision to seek a ruling from the european court of justice , " said irish finance minister charlie mccreevy .
austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who in the past has sided with solbes , rejected the commission ’ s suit .
even if the commission were to win it ’ s case , he said , nothing would change because it wouldn ’ t have any way of making sure the judgement was enforced .
on the other hand , " if the commission loses , " grasser said , " it could create the impression that germany and france acted properly , which certainly isn ’ t the case .
in our opinion , it ’ s a misguided deficit policy that ’ s certainly damaging for growth and employment .
in that regard , we ’ ve fought side by side with the commission and for that reason i regret that the commission is now sending out a false political signal instead of increasing the political pressure on germany and france to continue with their -lrb- budget -rrb- consolidation . "
this year , germany and france will breach the budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product established in the stability and growth pact for the third year in a row .
but german finance minister hans eichel said monday he still found solbes ’ decision to sue to be " incomprehensible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel speaking at the meeting , he said : " because the economy is doing better , the mood is , in general , good .
i don ’ t think there ’ s anything else to say really . "
despite the refusal of the council to accept his decision to sue , solbes on monday seemed unmoved .
" first , i don ’ t feel attacked , " he said .
" second , i have acted consistently with my position , which is that the pact that was agreed to must be respected . "
germany 's eichel , meanwhile , also rejected solbes ’ plan to call for changes to the stability pact next month .
the new regulations would force member states to adhere to more disciplined budgets during periods of economic upswings .
concern over weak dollar in a separate area of discussion monday , the ministers also broached the issue of the euro ’ s high exchange rate against the dollar .
" in the present circumstances , we ’ ve stressed stability and we ’ re concerned about excessive exchange rate moves , " the ministers said in a statement .
" we will continue to monitor the situation very closely and conduct policies supporting economic recovery in a stable macroeconomic environment . "
the european finance ministers are also seeking to develop a common position for their g7 meeting with the united states in florida early next month .
several finance experts as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , have expressed concern about the weakness of the dollar – even though the dollar appeared to recover against the euro slightly during the past week .
another point of contention between the european commission and the finance ministers is a call by the commission to increase the eu ’ s budget by 1.24 percent of gross domestic product after 2007 .
germany and five other eu net payers have rejected the proposal , which would require them to pay billions more to brussels .
german finance minister eichel has said he would like to cap the eu budget at 1 percent of gross domestic product , which would create an overall budget of about € 100 billion . berndt riegert -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission budget plan likely to irk member states the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money .

tomas rosicky may be headed to the english premiership .
are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?
speculation is growing that the once top-flight team is preparing to sell some of its best players to come up with some cash . long plagued by poor results on the pitch and money problems in the boardroom , the once mighty borussia appears these day to be limping like a dying wildebeest , being shadowed by hyenas behind and vultures above . in an efforts to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion is ready to initiate a fire sale to cash in its best assets .
comments from czech star midfielder tomas rosicky stoked speculation he was on the verge of leaving borussia dortmund , with a decision coming perhaps as early as this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's roman abramovich .
first in the queue of eager shoppers outside the gates of the westfalen stadium is russian billionaire and fc chelsea chairman roman abramovich .
the man who has bankrolled the so-called chelski revolution in the english premier league appears to have an insatiable appetite for the world ’ s best players and the deep pockets to match .
the london club is reported prepared to pay upwards of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.1 million -rrb- for rosicky . player fuels rumors rosicky has been doing little to dampen the russian 's ardor .
" i 've known about chelsea 's interest for eight or nine days , " the midfielder recently admitted when questioned by reporters .
" it is now down to the clubs to see what happens , but if i were borussia i would not refuse the offer . " rosicky , the current dortmund captain and integral free-flowing cog in the czech machinery at the heart of the team , is valued at around € 14.8 million but would likely cost fc chelsea much more than that , given the player ’ s rising stock and his current agreement with the german team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosicky joined the bundesliga side from sparta prague in 2001 , and is under contract with them until 2008 .
a majority of the inflated price would go on paying compensation to the club for the loss of a contracted player . dortmund looking for profit on sale gerd niebaum , borussia ’ s president , on tuesday said dortmund did not have an offer for rosicky on the table and he refused to comment on the reports .
but for a club in dortmund ’ s position - this season alone it faces an estimated € 25 million loss - a rival club offering to pay the asking price of € 30 million for a player that cost almost half that three years ago would present the former german title holders with an offer perhaps too alluring to refuse . such a deal would be difficult for the debt-laden club to ignore after losing out on the estimated € 12 million financial windfall in champions league revenue .
the club ’ s misery was made complete when they were unceremoniously dumped out of the uefa cup by french side sochaux , losing 6-2 on aggregate . over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was also looking into borrow around € 100 million euros by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . top stars to be sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon of borussia dortmund , right , leaves the field under a pouring rain after his uefa cup , second round , second leg soccer match against sochaux , thursday , nov .
27 , 2003 in sochaux , eastern france .
sochaux defeated borussia 4-0 and advances to the next round of the competition .
teammate at left is unidentified .
-lrb- ap photo / patrick gardin -rrb- the sad reality of the situation at dortmund is that , with a number of underperforming and overpaid players on the books - many are currently injured - only the top stars at borussia are going to be worth anything to interested parties .
that means the sale of rosicky , compatriot jan koller and the brazilian youngster ewerthon -lrb- picture -rrb- represent the best chance of generating cash . the vicious circle would then be set in motion once more ; top players sold to pay off debts , leading to the team being undermined by a reduction in quality and the possibility of poor results which in turn could mean loss of revenue and yet more debts . despite the pen being far from poised over a deal between borussia and chelsea on the rosicky deal - dortmund coach matthias sammer has angrily called for the saga to be concluded one way or the other by the weekend - it looks to be only a matter of time before more check books are waved in the general direction of an increasingly desperate westfalen stadium . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dortmund faces cash crunch borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .

in that regard , we ’ ve fought side by side with the commission and for that reason i regret that the commission is now sending out a false political signal instead of increasing the political pressure on germany and france to continue with their -lrb- budget -rrb- consolidation . "
this year , germany and france will breach the budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product established in the stability and growth pact for the third year in a row .
but german finance minister hans eichel said monday he still found solbes ’ decision to sue to be " incomprehensible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel speaking at the meeting , he said : " because the economy is doing better , the mood is , in general , good .
i don ’ t think there ’ s anything else to say really . "
despite the refusal of the council to accept his decision to sue , solbes on monday seemed unmoved .
" first , i don ’ t feel attacked , " he said .
" second , i have acted consistently with my position , which is that the pact that was agreed to must be respected . "
germany 's eichel , meanwhile , also rejected solbes ’ plan to call for changes to the stability pact next month .
the new regulations would force member states to adhere to more disciplined budgets during periods of economic upswings .
concern over weak dollar in a separate area of discussion monday , the ministers also broached the issue of the euro ’ s high exchange rate against the dollar .
" in the present circumstances , we ’ ve stressed stability and we ’ re concerned about excessive exchange rate moves , " the ministers said in a statement .
" we will continue to monitor the situation very closely and conduct policies supporting economic recovery in a stable macroeconomic environment . "
the european finance ministers are also seeking to develop a common position for their g7 meeting with the united states in florida early next month .
several finance experts as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , have expressed concern about the weakness of the dollar – even though the dollar appeared to recover against the euro slightly during the past week .
another point of contention between the european commission and the finance ministers is a call by the commission to increase the eu ’ s budget by 1.24 percent of gross domestic product after 2007 .
germany and five other eu net payers have rejected the proposal , which would require them to pay billions more to brussels .
german finance minister eichel has said he would like to cap the eu budget at 1 percent of gross domestic product , which would create an overall budget of about € 100 billion . berndt riegert -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission budget plan likely to irk member states the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money .

the release of millions of royal air force world war ii reconnaissance photos , including aerial shots of auschwitz , has drawn criticism from those wondering why the allies did n't act sooner to stop the nazi genocide . the photos show a massive cloud of smoke created by the burning of thousands of corpses at auschwitz .
they show images of the " d-day " allied landing on the beaches of normandy so rich in detail that you can recognize the bodies of american gis .
they show the city of cologne in rubble after months of heavy british bombing .
and with their release this week , the british aerial reconnaissance archives at keele university have again raised painful memories and questions about the war .
who knew what and when ?
and why did n't anyone take action sooner to stop the nazi atrocities ?
on monday , britain 's keele university released more than 5 million royal air force aerial reconnaissance photos on a special web site .
for decades , the photos were available only to researchers and unknown to the broader public .
but now , indexed and searchable online to anyone , the images provide viewers with entirely new perspectives of the most bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the bridge at arnhem , the netherlands horrific and dramatic events of world war ii .
the most historically important images on the site are shots from auschwitz taken in august 1944 , d-day shots taken in june of the same year and images of the german battleship bismarck , which the germans kept hidden in a norwegian fjord for five days in may 1941 until the british forces sank it .
" these images allow us to see the real war at first hand , " project head allan william said . "
i was really moved by the photographs of the nazi concentration camps and the d-day landings .
it 's like a live action replay . "
images anger some but the shocking auschwitz images have also raised serious questions amongst critics about the actions of the allies during the war and why they did n't move to stop the gassings sooner by bombing the rail lines into the camps .
writing in britain ’ s guardian newspaper , journalist john ezard lamented : " you can view ‘ as though in a time machine ’ a 3d photograph which could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives had it been publicized when it was taken at 11 a.m. on august 23 , 1944 , at a time when hungarian jews were being murdered below . "
the photo was taken by an raf pilot aboard a reconnaissance plane over poland at a time when the germans , aware their days were numbered , had massively increased the amount of killing at auschwitz .
the detail is so clear in one photo that you can even see two columns of prisoners lining up for roll call at the concentration camp .
here in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday published a story under the headline " why weren ’ t the concentration camp thugs bombed ? "
the newspaper quoted german historian hans-ulrich wheler , a guest professor at harvard university , saying that london became aware , at the latest , of the nazi ’ s death camps in 1943 .
information on the web site of the united states holocaust memorial , which serves more or less as the official american historical authority , appears to backup wehler 's claim .
it notes that " in 1943 , polish courier jan karski informed president franklin d. roosevelt of reports of mass murder received from jewish leaders in the warsaw ghetto .
no immediate executive action was taken . "
by the autumn of 1944 , the museum claims , the allies knew of the gassings at auschwitz .
" why therefore were the extermination camps not destroyed after the reconnaissance planes of the britons and americans photographed them in such detail , " bild asked ?
" at the very least , the railway tracks on which the jews were transported into the extermination camp ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial shot of the beaches of normandy during d-day the archive ’ s caretaker , williams , said the spies took the photos in rapid-succession , like machine gun fire and that it was possible , given the sheer volume of photos , that they were never given the scrutiny they deserved .
" it is a fascinating issue as to why the photo operators did not know what was going on , " williams said .
" i think the answer is that their orders were to look single-mindedly for military data .
they did not have time to think what else was happening .

speculation is growing that the once top-flight team is preparing to sell some of its best players to come up with some cash . long plagued by poor results on the pitch and money problems in the boardroom , the once mighty borussia appears these day to be limping like a dying wildebeest , being shadowed by hyenas behind and vultures above . in an efforts to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion is ready to initiate a fire sale to cash in its best assets .

" i 've known about chelsea 's interest for eight or nine days , " the midfielder recently admitted when questioned by reporters .

tomas rosicky may be headed to the english premiership .
are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?
speculation is growing that the once top-flight team is preparing to sell some of its best players to come up with some cash . long plagued by poor results on the pitch and money problems in the boardroom , the once mighty borussia appears these day to be limping like a dying wildebeest , being shadowed by hyenas behind and vultures above . in an efforts to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion is ready to initiate a fire sale to cash in its best assets .
comments from czech star midfielder tomas rosicky stoked speculation he was on the verge of leaving borussia dortmund , with a decision coming perhaps as early as this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's roman abramovich .
first in the queue of eager shoppers outside the gates of the westfalen stadium is russian billionaire and fc chelsea chairman roman abramovich .
the man who has bankrolled the so-called chelski revolution in the english premier league appears to have an insatiable appetite for the world ’ s best players and the deep pockets to match .
the london club is reported prepared to pay upwards of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.1 million -rrb- for rosicky . player fuels rumors rosicky has been doing little to dampen the russian 's ardor .
" i 've known about chelsea 's interest for eight or nine days , " the midfielder recently admitted when questioned by reporters .
" it is now down to the clubs to see what happens , but if i were borussia i would not refuse the offer . " rosicky , the current dortmund captain and integral free-flowing cog in the czech machinery at the heart of the team , is valued at around € 14.8 million but would likely cost fc chelsea much more than that , given the player ’ s rising stock and his current agreement with the german team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosicky joined the bundesliga side from sparta prague in 2001 , and is under contract with them until 2008 .
a majority of the inflated price would go on paying compensation to the club for the loss of a contracted player . dortmund looking for profit on sale gerd niebaum , borussia ’ s president , on tuesday said dortmund did not have an offer for rosicky on the table and he refused to comment on the reports .
but for a club in dortmund ’ s position - this season alone it faces an estimated € 25 million loss - a rival club offering to pay the asking price of € 30 million for a player that cost almost half that three years ago would present the former german title holders with an offer perhaps too alluring to refuse . such a deal would be difficult for the debt-laden club to ignore after losing out on the estimated € 12 million financial windfall in champions league revenue .
the club ’ s misery was made complete when they were unceremoniously dumped out of the uefa cup by french side sochaux , losing 6-2 on aggregate . over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was also looking into borrow around € 100 million euros by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . top stars to be sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon of borussia dortmund , right , leaves the field under a pouring rain after his uefa cup , second round , second leg soccer match against sochaux , thursday , nov .

in november , the finance ministers on the european council effectively suspended the stability pact in order to prevent the commission from imposing stiff penalties on france and germany .
the move prompted solbes ' suit at the luxembourg high court .
in his consultations with the so-called euro group , which includes the finance ministers of all 12 euro zone countries , solbes once again repeated his grounds for the unprecedented lawsuit .
but solbes was met with frosty resistance .
' little support ' " there was little support among the ministers for the commission ’ s decision to seek a ruling from the european court of justice , " said irish finance minister charlie mccreevy .
austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who in the past has sided with solbes , rejected the commission ’ s suit .
even if the commission were to win it ’ s case , he said , nothing would change because it wouldn ’ t have any way of making sure the judgement was enforced .
on the other hand , " if the commission loses , " grasser said , " it could create the impression that germany and france acted properly , which certainly isn ’ t the case .
in our opinion , it ’ s a misguided deficit policy that ’ s certainly damaging for growth and employment .
in that regard , we ’ ve fought side by side with the commission and for that reason i regret that the commission is now sending out a false political signal instead of increasing the political pressure on germany and france to continue with their -lrb- budget -rrb- consolidation . "
this year , germany and france will breach the budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product established in the stability and growth pact for the third year in a row .
but german finance minister hans eichel said monday he still found solbes ’ decision to sue to be " incomprehensible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel speaking at the meeting , he said : " because the economy is doing better , the mood is , in general , good .
i don ’ t think there ’ s anything else to say really . "
despite the refusal of the council to accept his decision to sue , solbes on monday seemed unmoved .
" first , i don ’ t feel attacked , " he said .
" second , i have acted consistently with my position , which is that the pact that was agreed to must be respected . "
germany 's eichel , meanwhile , also rejected solbes ’ plan to call for changes to the stability pact next month .
the new regulations would force member states to adhere to more disciplined budgets during periods of economic upswings .
concern over weak dollar in a separate area of discussion monday , the ministers also broached the issue of the euro ’ s high exchange rate against the dollar .
" in the present circumstances , we ’ ve stressed stability and we ’ re concerned about excessive exchange rate moves , " the ministers said in a statement .
" we will continue to monitor the situation very closely and conduct policies supporting economic recovery in a stable macroeconomic environment . "
the european finance ministers are also seeking to develop a common position for their g7 meeting with the united states in florida early next month .
several finance experts as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , have expressed concern about the weakness of the dollar – even though the dollar appeared to recover against the euro slightly during the past week .
another point of contention between the european commission and the finance ministers is a call by the commission to increase the eu ’ s budget by 1.24 percent of gross domestic product after 2007 .
germany and five other eu net payers have rejected the proposal , which would require them to pay billions more to brussels .
german finance minister eichel has said he would like to cap the eu budget at 1 percent of gross domestic product , which would create an overall budget of about € 100 billion . berndt riegert -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission budget plan likely to irk member states the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money .

the release of millions of royal air force world war ii reconnaissance photos , including aerial shots of auschwitz , has drawn criticism from those wondering why the allies did n't act sooner to stop the nazi genocide . the photos show a massive cloud of smoke created by the burning of thousands of corpses at auschwitz .
they show images of the " d-day " allied landing on the beaches of normandy so rich in detail that you can recognize the bodies of american gis .
they show the city of cologne in rubble after months of heavy british bombing .
and with their release this week , the british aerial reconnaissance archives at keele university have again raised painful memories and questions about the war .
who knew what and when ?
and why did n't anyone take action sooner to stop the nazi atrocities ?
on monday , britain 's keele university released more than 5 million royal air force aerial reconnaissance photos on a special web site .
for decades , the photos were available only to researchers and unknown to the broader public .
but now , indexed and searchable online to anyone , the images provide viewers with entirely new perspectives of the most bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the bridge at arnhem , the netherlands horrific and dramatic events of world war ii .
the most historically important images on the site are shots from auschwitz taken in august 1944 , d-day shots taken in june of the same year and images of the german battleship bismarck , which the germans kept hidden in a norwegian fjord for five days in may 1941 until the british forces sank it .
" these images allow us to see the real war at first hand , " project head allan william said . "
i was really moved by the photographs of the nazi concentration camps and the d-day landings .
it 's like a live action replay . "
images anger some but the shocking auschwitz images have also raised serious questions amongst critics about the actions of the allies during the war and why they did n't move to stop the gassings sooner by bombing the rail lines into the camps .
writing in britain ’ s guardian newspaper , journalist john ezard lamented : " you can view ‘ as though in a time machine ’ a 3d photograph which could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives had it been publicized when it was taken at 11 a.m. on august 23 , 1944 , at a time when hungarian jews were being murdered below . "
the photo was taken by an raf pilot aboard a reconnaissance plane over poland at a time when the germans , aware their days were numbered , had massively increased the amount of killing at auschwitz .
the detail is so clear in one photo that you can even see two columns of prisoners lining up for roll call at the concentration camp .
here in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday published a story under the headline " why weren ’ t the concentration camp thugs bombed ? "
the newspaper quoted german historian hans-ulrich wheler , a guest professor at harvard university , saying that london became aware , at the latest , of the nazi ’ s death camps in 1943 .
information on the web site of the united states holocaust memorial , which serves more or less as the official american historical authority , appears to backup wehler 's claim .
it notes that " in 1943 , polish courier jan karski informed president franklin d. roosevelt of reports of mass murder received from jewish leaders in the warsaw ghetto .
no immediate executive action was taken . "
by the autumn of 1944 , the museum claims , the allies knew of the gassings at auschwitz .
" why therefore were the extermination camps not destroyed after the reconnaissance planes of the britons and americans photographed them in such detail , " bild asked ?
" at the very least , the railway tracks on which the jews were transported into the extermination camp ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial shot of the beaches of normandy during d-day the archive ’ s caretaker , williams , said the spies took the photos in rapid-succession , like machine gun fire and that it was possible , given the sheer volume of photos , that they were never given the scrutiny they deserved .
" it is a fascinating issue as to why the photo operators did not know what was going on , " williams said .
" i think the answer is that their orders were to look single-mindedly for military data .
they did not have time to think what else was happening .

in november , the finance ministers on the european council effectively suspended the stability pact in order to prevent the commission from imposing stiff penalties on france and germany .
the move prompted solbes ' suit at the luxembourg high court .
in his consultations with the so-called euro group , which includes the finance ministers of all 12 euro zone countries , solbes once again repeated his grounds for the unprecedented lawsuit .
but solbes was met with frosty resistance .
' little support ' " there was little support among the ministers for the commission ’ s decision to seek a ruling from the european court of justice , " said irish finance minister charlie mccreevy .
austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who in the past has sided with solbes , rejected the commission ’ s suit .
even if the commission were to win it ’ s case , he said , nothing would change because it wouldn ’ t have any way of making sure the judgement was enforced .
on the other hand , " if the commission loses , " grasser said , " it could create the impression that germany and france acted properly , which certainly isn ’ t the case .
in our opinion , it ’ s a misguided deficit policy that ’ s certainly damaging for growth and employment .
in that regard , we ’ ve fought side by side with the commission and for that reason i regret that the commission is now sending out a false political signal instead of increasing the political pressure on germany and france to continue with their -lrb- budget -rrb- consolidation . "
this year , germany and france will breach the budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product established in the stability and growth pact for the third year in a row .
but german finance minister hans eichel said monday he still found solbes ’ decision to sue to be " incomprehensible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel speaking at the meeting , he said : " because the economy is doing better , the mood is , in general , good .
i don ’ t think there ’ s anything else to say really . "
despite the refusal of the council to accept his decision to sue , solbes on monday seemed unmoved .
" first , i don ’ t feel attacked , " he said .
" second , i have acted consistently with my position , which is that the pact that was agreed to must be respected . "
germany 's eichel , meanwhile , also rejected solbes ’ plan to call for changes to the stability pact next month .
the new regulations would force member states to adhere to more disciplined budgets during periods of economic upswings .
concern over weak dollar in a separate area of discussion monday , the ministers also broached the issue of the euro ’ s high exchange rate against the dollar .
" in the present circumstances , we ’ ve stressed stability and we ’ re concerned about excessive exchange rate moves , " the ministers said in a statement .
" we will continue to monitor the situation very closely and conduct policies supporting economic recovery in a stable macroeconomic environment . "
the european finance ministers are also seeking to develop a common position for their g7 meeting with the united states in florida early next month .
several finance experts as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , have expressed concern about the weakness of the dollar – even though the dollar appeared to recover against the euro slightly during the past week .
another point of contention between the european commission and the finance ministers is a call by the commission to increase the eu ’ s budget by 1.24 percent of gross domestic product after 2007 .
germany and five other eu net payers have rejected the proposal , which would require them to pay billions more to brussels .
german finance minister eichel has said he would like to cap the eu budget at 1 percent of gross domestic product , which would create an overall budget of about € 100 billion . berndt riegert -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission budget plan likely to irk member states the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money .

spotlessly german ?
think again will the real modern talking please stand up ? hood vs. helmet garden gnome 's best friend goes sporty culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.01.2004 bavarian sausage wars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides agree that sweet mustard 's a must .
butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality . with two patent applications before the german patent office , signature drives and even a report by the bavarian ministry of agriculture on the issue , the munich sausage controversy has reached boiling point , something that should never happen to the water in which the mushy specialty is heated to perfection . but that ’ s beside the point for a group of munich mass-production butchers and restaurateurs , who are trying to secure exclusive rights to produce “ munich white sausages . ” they claim that only the city ’ s butchers can produce edible versions of the delicacy , and as evidence they claim that some of their bavarian competitors substitute cheaper pork for the sausage ’ s signature veal base . munich by name , munich by origin karl-heinz wildmoser , who runs a beer tent at oktoberfest and serves as president of munich ’ s tsv 1860 soccer club , said he ’ s had to suffer through sausage ordeals during games away from home .
“ we ’ re often treated to white sausages by other clubs - that ’ s a nice gesture , but sometimes they ’ re gruesome , ” wildmoser recently told münchner merkur newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo for the association for the protection of the white sausage includes a drawing of the twin tower of munich 's cathedral , the city 's landmark .
wildmoser , himself a munich original , is an adamant supporter of the association for the protection of the munich white sausage .
the group has filed a copyright application with the patent office , saying that calling sausages produced beyond munich county borders amounted to defrauding consumers . the association has received the backing of munich mayor christian ude as well as other politicians .
“ the white sausage belongs to munich like no other food and that ’ s why we think it ’ s our duty to protect it from abuse , ” said helmut schmid , the leader of the social democrats in the city ’ s parliament . other bavarians make good sausage , too it ’ s a sentiment shared by the trade association of bavarian butchers , which has also filed a copyright application trying to patent the sausage ’ s original recipe .
unlike the munich-centric sausage supporters , this group believes that butchers south of the so-called “ white sausage equator , ” which roughly corresponds to the course of bavaria 's portion of the danube river , can also craft excellent products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a butcher in a restaurant on munich 's st. mary 's square allegedly created the weißwurst in 1857 .
“ we believe that a quality munich white sausage can also be made in old bavaria and swabia , not just munich itself , ” georg schlagbauer , himself a munich butcher , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , adding that it shouldn ’ t be geography but rather sausage ingredients that matter . in his opinion , the other side was simply trying to secure its market share , he added .
“ munich ’ s largest white sausage producer is part of the group , ” schlagbauer told the agence france presse news service .
“ there is a financial motivation behind this patriotism . ” following nuremberg ’ s and dresden ’ s lead ? patent office officials will likely take several months to decide on the issue , according to a spokesperson .
they can rely on a survey commissioned by the bavarian ministry of agriculture , in which 48 percent of germans believed munich white sausage came from the city and its surrounding areas .
should the patent office decide in favor of one of the applications , the german ministry of justice and the european commission still have to sign off on them . similar protection of local delicacies has already been approved in the past : nuremberg ’ s bratwurst has to come from the city .
dresdner stollen , a popular christmas bread , must be made in that eastern german city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner siegert with his book on white sausages .
“ what ’ s happening now in munich is pretty much the same , ” werner siegert -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has written a book on the etiquette rules of white sausage , told dw-world .
he believes stagnating sausage sales at munich ’ s restaurants , where the weisswurst and a beer have been a traditional mid-morning snack , had provoked the campaign .
“ i think people should rely on marketing and not on the legal system , however , ” siegert said , adding that he ’ s working on a collection of short stories on leaflets restaurants could hand out to their customers to bridge the five to eight minutes it takes to serve the perfect weisswurst . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more many of the tourists who travel to bavaria 's bustling capital city never make it past the hofbräuhaus tent at oktoberfest .

tomas rosicky may be headed to the english premiership .
are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?
speculation is growing that the once top-flight team is preparing to sell some of its best players to come up with some cash . long plagued by poor results on the pitch and money problems in the boardroom , the once mighty borussia appears these day to be limping like a dying wildebeest , being shadowed by hyenas behind and vultures above . in an efforts to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion is ready to initiate a fire sale to cash in its best assets .
comments from czech star midfielder tomas rosicky stoked speculation he was on the verge of leaving borussia dortmund , with a decision coming perhaps as early as this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's roman abramovich .
first in the queue of eager shoppers outside the gates of the westfalen stadium is russian billionaire and fc chelsea chairman roman abramovich .
the man who has bankrolled the so-called chelski revolution in the english premier league appears to have an insatiable appetite for the world ’ s best players and the deep pockets to match .
the london club is reported prepared to pay upwards of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.1 million -rrb- for rosicky . player fuels rumors rosicky has been doing little to dampen the russian 's ardor .
" i 've known about chelsea 's interest for eight or nine days , " the midfielder recently admitted when questioned by reporters .
" it is now down to the clubs to see what happens , but if i were borussia i would not refuse the offer . " rosicky , the current dortmund captain and integral free-flowing cog in the czech machinery at the heart of the team , is valued at around € 14.8 million but would likely cost fc chelsea much more than that , given the player ’ s rising stock and his current agreement with the german team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosicky joined the bundesliga side from sparta prague in 2001 , and is under contract with them until 2008 .
a majority of the inflated price would go on paying compensation to the club for the loss of a contracted player . dortmund looking for profit on sale gerd niebaum , borussia ’ s president , on tuesday said dortmund did not have an offer for rosicky on the table and he refused to comment on the reports .
but for a club in dortmund ’ s position - this season alone it faces an estimated € 25 million loss - a rival club offering to pay the asking price of € 30 million for a player that cost almost half that three years ago would present the former german title holders with an offer perhaps too alluring to refuse . such a deal would be difficult for the debt-laden club to ignore after losing out on the estimated € 12 million financial windfall in champions league revenue .
the club ’ s misery was made complete when they were unceremoniously dumped out of the uefa cup by french side sochaux , losing 6-2 on aggregate . over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was also looking into borrow around € 100 million euros by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . top stars to be sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon of borussia dortmund , right , leaves the field under a pouring rain after his uefa cup , second round , second leg soccer match against sochaux , thursday , nov .

-lrb- ap photo / patrick gardin -rrb- the sad reality of the situation at dortmund is that , with a number of underperforming and overpaid players on the books - many are currently injured - only the top stars at borussia are going to be worth anything to interested parties .
that means the sale of rosicky , compatriot jan koller and the brazilian youngster ewerthon -lrb- picture -rrb- represent the best chance of generating cash . the vicious circle would then be set in motion once more ; top players sold to pay off debts , leading to the team being undermined by a reduction in quality and the possibility of poor results which in turn could mean loss of revenue and yet more debts . despite the pen being far from poised over a deal between borussia and chelsea on the rosicky deal - dortmund coach matthias sammer has angrily called for the saga to be concluded one way or the other by the weekend - it looks to be only a matter of time before more check books are waved in the general direction of an increasingly desperate westfalen stadium . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dortmund faces cash crunch borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .

tomas rosicky may be headed to the english premiership .
are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?
speculation is growing that the once top-flight team is preparing to sell some of its best players to come up with some cash . long plagued by poor results on the pitch and money problems in the boardroom , the once mighty borussia appears these day to be limping like a dying wildebeest , being shadowed by hyenas behind and vultures above . in an efforts to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion is ready to initiate a fire sale to cash in its best assets .
comments from czech star midfielder tomas rosicky stoked speculation he was on the verge of leaving borussia dortmund , with a decision coming perhaps as early as this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's roman abramovich .
first in the queue of eager shoppers outside the gates of the westfalen stadium is russian billionaire and fc chelsea chairman roman abramovich .
the man who has bankrolled the so-called chelski revolution in the english premier league appears to have an insatiable appetite for the world ’ s best players and the deep pockets to match .
the london club is reported prepared to pay upwards of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.1 million -rrb- for rosicky . player fuels rumors rosicky has been doing little to dampen the russian 's ardor .
" i 've known about chelsea 's interest for eight or nine days , " the midfielder recently admitted when questioned by reporters .
" it is now down to the clubs to see what happens , but if i were borussia i would not refuse the offer . " rosicky , the current dortmund captain and integral free-flowing cog in the czech machinery at the heart of the team , is valued at around € 14.8 million but would likely cost fc chelsea much more than that , given the player ’ s rising stock and his current agreement with the german team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosicky joined the bundesliga side from sparta prague in 2001 , and is under contract with them until 2008 .
a majority of the inflated price would go on paying compensation to the club for the loss of a contracted player . dortmund looking for profit on sale gerd niebaum , borussia ’ s president , on tuesday said dortmund did not have an offer for rosicky on the table and he refused to comment on the reports .
but for a club in dortmund ’ s position - this season alone it faces an estimated € 25 million loss - a rival club offering to pay the asking price of € 30 million for a player that cost almost half that three years ago would present the former german title holders with an offer perhaps too alluring to refuse . such a deal would be difficult for the debt-laden club to ignore after losing out on the estimated € 12 million financial windfall in champions league revenue .

the release of millions of royal air force world war ii reconnaissance photos , including aerial shots of auschwitz , has drawn criticism from those wondering why the allies did n't act sooner to stop the nazi genocide . the photos show a massive cloud of smoke created by the burning of thousands of corpses at auschwitz .
they show images of the " d-day " allied landing on the beaches of normandy so rich in detail that you can recognize the bodies of american gis .
they show the city of cologne in rubble after months of heavy british bombing .
and with their release this week , the british aerial reconnaissance archives at keele university have again raised painful memories and questions about the war .
who knew what and when ?
and why did n't anyone take action sooner to stop the nazi atrocities ?
on monday , britain 's keele university released more than 5 million royal air force aerial reconnaissance photos on a special web site .
for decades , the photos were available only to researchers and unknown to the broader public .
but now , indexed and searchable online to anyone , the images provide viewers with entirely new perspectives of the most bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the bridge at arnhem , the netherlands horrific and dramatic events of world war ii .
the most historically important images on the site are shots from auschwitz taken in august 1944 , d-day shots taken in june of the same year and images of the german battleship bismarck , which the germans kept hidden in a norwegian fjord for five days in may 1941 until the british forces sank it .
" these images allow us to see the real war at first hand , " project head allan william said . "
i was really moved by the photographs of the nazi concentration camps and the d-day landings .
it 's like a live action replay . "
images anger some but the shocking auschwitz images have also raised serious questions amongst critics about the actions of the allies during the war and why they did n't move to stop the gassings sooner by bombing the rail lines into the camps .
writing in britain ’ s guardian newspaper , journalist john ezard lamented : " you can view ‘ as though in a time machine ’ a 3d photograph which could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives had it been publicized when it was taken at 11 a.m. on august 23 , 1944 , at a time when hungarian jews were being murdered below . "
the photo was taken by an raf pilot aboard a reconnaissance plane over poland at a time when the germans , aware their days were numbered , had massively increased the amount of killing at auschwitz .
the detail is so clear in one photo that you can even see two columns of prisoners lining up for roll call at the concentration camp .
here in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday published a story under the headline " why weren ’ t the concentration camp thugs bombed ? "
the newspaper quoted german historian hans-ulrich wheler , a guest professor at harvard university , saying that london became aware , at the latest , of the nazi ’ s death camps in 1943 .
information on the web site of the united states holocaust memorial , which serves more or less as the official american historical authority , appears to backup wehler 's claim .
it notes that " in 1943 , polish courier jan karski informed president franklin d. roosevelt of reports of mass murder received from jewish leaders in the warsaw ghetto .
no immediate executive action was taken . "
by the autumn of 1944 , the museum claims , the allies knew of the gassings at auschwitz .
" why therefore were the extermination camps not destroyed after the reconnaissance planes of the britons and americans photographed them in such detail , " bild asked ?
" at the very least , the railway tracks on which the jews were transported into the extermination camp ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial shot of the beaches of normandy during d-day the archive ’ s caretaker , williams , said the spies took the photos in rapid-succession , like machine gun fire and that it was possible , given the sheer volume of photos , that they were never given the scrutiny they deserved .
" it is a fascinating issue as to why the photo operators did not know what was going on , " williams said .
" i think the answer is that their orders were to look single-mindedly for military data .
they did not have time to think what else was happening .

think again will the real modern talking please stand up ? hood vs. helmet garden gnome 's best friend goes sporty culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.01.2004 bavarian sausage wars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides agree that sweet mustard 's a must .
butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality . with two patent applications before the german patent office , signature drives and even a report by the bavarian ministry of agriculture on the issue , the munich sausage controversy has reached boiling point , something that should never happen to the water in which the mushy specialty is heated to perfection . but that ’ s beside the point for a group of munich mass-production butchers and restaurateurs , who are trying to secure exclusive rights to produce “ munich white sausages . ” they claim that only the city ’ s butchers can produce edible versions of the delicacy , and as evidence they claim that some of their bavarian competitors substitute cheaper pork for the sausage ’ s signature veal base . munich by name , munich by origin karl-heinz wildmoser , who runs a beer tent at oktoberfest and serves as president of munich ’ s tsv 1860 soccer club , said he ’ s had to suffer through sausage ordeals during games away from home .
“ we ’ re often treated to white sausages by other clubs - that ’ s a nice gesture , but sometimes they ’ re gruesome , ” wildmoser recently told münchner merkur newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo for the association for the protection of the white sausage includes a drawing of the twin tower of munich 's cathedral , the city 's landmark .
wildmoser , himself a munich original , is an adamant supporter of the association for the protection of the munich white sausage .
the group has filed a copyright application with the patent office , saying that calling sausages produced beyond munich county borders amounted to defrauding consumers . the association has received the backing of munich mayor christian ude as well as other politicians .
“ the white sausage belongs to munich like no other food and that ’ s why we think it ’ s our duty to protect it from abuse , ” said helmut schmid , the leader of the social democrats in the city ’ s parliament . other bavarians make good sausage , too it ’ s a sentiment shared by the trade association of bavarian butchers , which has also filed a copyright application trying to patent the sausage ’ s original recipe .
unlike the munich-centric sausage supporters , this group believes that butchers south of the so-called “ white sausage equator , ” which roughly corresponds to the course of bavaria 's portion of the danube river , can also craft excellent products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a butcher in a restaurant on munich 's st. mary 's square allegedly created the weißwurst in 1857 .
“ we believe that a quality munich white sausage can also be made in old bavaria and swabia , not just munich itself , ” georg schlagbauer , himself a munich butcher , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , adding that it shouldn ’ t be geography but rather sausage ingredients that matter . in his opinion , the other side was simply trying to secure its market share , he added .
“ munich ’ s largest white sausage producer is part of the group , ” schlagbauer told the agence france presse news service .
“ there is a financial motivation behind this patriotism . ” following nuremberg ’ s and dresden ’ s lead ? patent office officials will likely take several months to decide on the issue , according to a spokesperson .
they can rely on a survey commissioned by the bavarian ministry of agriculture , in which 48 percent of germans believed munich white sausage came from the city and its surrounding areas .
should the patent office decide in favor of one of the applications , the german ministry of justice and the european commission still have to sign off on them . similar protection of local delicacies has already been approved in the past : nuremberg ’ s bratwurst has to come from the city .
dresdner stollen , a popular christmas bread , must be made in that eastern german city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner siegert with his book on white sausages .
“ what ’ s happening now in munich is pretty much the same , ” werner siegert -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has written a book on the etiquette rules of white sausage , told dw-world .
he believes stagnating sausage sales at munich ’ s restaurants , where the weisswurst and a beer have been a traditional mid-morning snack , had provoked the campaign .
“ i think people should rely on marketing and not on the legal system , however , ” siegert said , adding that he ’ s working on a collection of short stories on leaflets restaurants could hand out to their customers to bridge the five to eight minutes it takes to serve the perfect weisswurst . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more many of the tourists who travel to bavaria 's bustling capital city never make it past the hofbräuhaus tent at oktoberfest .

butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality . with two patent applications before the german patent office , signature drives and even a report by the bavarian ministry of agriculture on the issue , the munich sausage controversy has reached boiling point , something that should never happen to the water in which the mushy specialty is heated to perfection . but that ’ s beside the point for a group of munich mass-production butchers and restaurateurs , who are trying to secure exclusive rights to produce “ munich white sausages . ” they claim that only the city ’ s butchers can produce edible versions of the delicacy , and as evidence they claim that some of their bavarian competitors substitute cheaper pork for the sausage ’ s signature veal base . munich by name , munich by origin karl-heinz wildmoser , who runs a beer tent at oktoberfest and serves as president of munich ’ s tsv 1860 soccer club , said he ’ s had to suffer through sausage ordeals during games away from home .
“ we ’ re often treated to white sausages by other clubs - that ’ s a nice gesture , but sometimes they ’ re gruesome , ” wildmoser recently told münchner merkur newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo for the association for the protection of the white sausage includes a drawing of the twin tower of munich 's cathedral , the city 's landmark .
wildmoser , himself a munich original , is an adamant supporter of the association for the protection of the munich white sausage .
the group has filed a copyright application with the patent office , saying that calling sausages produced beyond munich county borders amounted to defrauding consumers . the association has received the backing of munich mayor christian ude as well as other politicians .
“ the white sausage belongs to munich like no other food and that ’ s why we think it ’ s our duty to protect it from abuse , ” said helmut schmid , the leader of the social democrats in the city ’ s parliament . other bavarians make good sausage , too it ’ s a sentiment shared by the trade association of bavarian butchers , which has also filed a copyright application trying to patent the sausage ’ s original recipe .
unlike the munich-centric sausage supporters , this group believes that butchers south of the so-called “ white sausage equator , ” which roughly corresponds to the course of bavaria 's portion of the danube river , can also craft excellent products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a butcher in a restaurant on munich 's st. mary 's square allegedly created the weißwurst in 1857 .
“ we believe that a quality munich white sausage can also be made in old bavaria and swabia , not just munich itself , ” georg schlagbauer , himself a munich butcher , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , adding that it shouldn ’ t be geography but rather sausage ingredients that matter . in his opinion , the other side was simply trying to secure its market share , he added .
“ munich ’ s largest white sausage producer is part of the group , ” schlagbauer told the agence france presse news service .
“ there is a financial motivation behind this patriotism . ” following nuremberg ’ s and dresden ’ s lead ? patent office officials will likely take several months to decide on the issue , according to a spokesperson .
they can rely on a survey commissioned by the bavarian ministry of agriculture , in which 48 percent of germans believed munich white sausage came from the city and its surrounding areas .
should the patent office decide in favor of one of the applications , the german ministry of justice and the european commission still have to sign off on them . similar protection of local delicacies has already been approved in the past : nuremberg ’ s bratwurst has to come from the city .

“ what ’ s happening now in munich is pretty much the same , ” werner siegert -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has written a book on the etiquette rules of white sausage , told dw-world .
he believes stagnating sausage sales at munich ’ s restaurants , where the weisswurst and a beer have been a traditional mid-morning snack , had provoked the campaign .
“ i think people should rely on marketing and not on the legal system , however , ” siegert said , adding that he ’ s working on a collection of short stories on leaflets restaurants could hand out to their customers to bridge the five to eight minutes it takes to serve the perfect weisswurst . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more many of the tourists who travel to bavaria 's bustling capital city never make it past the hofbräuhaus tent at oktoberfest .

in november , the finance ministers on the european council effectively suspended the stability pact in order to prevent the commission from imposing stiff penalties on france and germany .
the move prompted solbes ' suit at the luxembourg high court .
in his consultations with the so-called euro group , which includes the finance ministers of all 12 euro zone countries , solbes once again repeated his grounds for the unprecedented lawsuit .
but solbes was met with frosty resistance .
' little support ' " there was little support among the ministers for the commission ’ s decision to seek a ruling from the european court of justice , " said irish finance minister charlie mccreevy .
austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who in the past has sided with solbes , rejected the commission ’ s suit .
even if the commission were to win it ’ s case , he said , nothing would change because it wouldn ’ t have any way of making sure the judgement was enforced .
on the other hand , " if the commission loses , " grasser said , " it could create the impression that germany and france acted properly , which certainly isn ’ t the case .
in our opinion , it ’ s a misguided deficit policy that ’ s certainly damaging for growth and employment .
in that regard , we ’ ve fought side by side with the commission and for that reason i regret that the commission is now sending out a false political signal instead of increasing the political pressure on germany and france to continue with their -lrb- budget -rrb- consolidation . "
this year , germany and france will breach the budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product established in the stability and growth pact for the third year in a row .
but german finance minister hans eichel said monday he still found solbes ’ decision to sue to be " incomprehensible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel speaking at the meeting , he said : " because the economy is doing better , the mood is , in general , good .
i don ’ t think there ’ s anything else to say really . "
despite the refusal of the council to accept his decision to sue , solbes on monday seemed unmoved .
" first , i don ’ t feel attacked , " he said .
" second , i have acted consistently with my position , which is that the pact that was agreed to must be respected . "
germany 's eichel , meanwhile , also rejected solbes ’ plan to call for changes to the stability pact next month .
the new regulations would force member states to adhere to more disciplined budgets during periods of economic upswings .
concern over weak dollar in a separate area of discussion monday , the ministers also broached the issue of the euro ’ s high exchange rate against the dollar .
" in the present circumstances , we ’ ve stressed stability and we ’ re concerned about excessive exchange rate moves , " the ministers said in a statement .
" we will continue to monitor the situation very closely and conduct policies supporting economic recovery in a stable macroeconomic environment . "
the european finance ministers are also seeking to develop a common position for their g7 meeting with the united states in florida early next month .
several finance experts as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , have expressed concern about the weakness of the dollar – even though the dollar appeared to recover against the euro slightly during the past week .
another point of contention between the european commission and the finance ministers is a call by the commission to increase the eu ’ s budget by 1.24 percent of gross domestic product after 2007 .
germany and five other eu net payers have rejected the proposal , which would require them to pay billions more to brussels .
german finance minister eichel has said he would like to cap the eu budget at 1 percent of gross domestic product , which would create an overall budget of about € 100 billion . berndt riegert -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission budget plan likely to irk member states the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money .

in november , the finance ministers on the european council effectively suspended the stability pact in order to prevent the commission from imposing stiff penalties on france and germany .
the move prompted solbes ' suit at the luxembourg high court .
in his consultations with the so-called euro group , which includes the finance ministers of all 12 euro zone countries , solbes once again repeated his grounds for the unprecedented lawsuit .
but solbes was met with frosty resistance .
' little support ' " there was little support among the ministers for the commission ’ s decision to seek a ruling from the european court of justice , " said irish finance minister charlie mccreevy .

butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality . with two patent applications before the german patent office , signature drives and even a report by the bavarian ministry of agriculture on the issue , the munich sausage controversy has reached boiling point , something that should never happen to the water in which the mushy specialty is heated to perfection . but that ’ s beside the point for a group of munich mass-production butchers and restaurateurs , who are trying to secure exclusive rights to produce “ munich white sausages . ” they claim that only the city ’ s butchers can produce edible versions of the delicacy , and as evidence they claim that some of their bavarian competitors substitute cheaper pork for the sausage ’ s signature veal base . munich by name , munich by origin karl-heinz wildmoser , who runs a beer tent at oktoberfest and serves as president of munich ’ s tsv 1860 soccer club , said he ’ s had to suffer through sausage ordeals during games away from home .
“ we ’ re often treated to white sausages by other clubs - that ’ s a nice gesture , but sometimes they ’ re gruesome , ” wildmoser recently told münchner merkur newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo for the association for the protection of the white sausage includes a drawing of the twin tower of munich 's cathedral , the city 's landmark .
wildmoser , himself a munich original , is an adamant supporter of the association for the protection of the munich white sausage .
the group has filed a copyright application with the patent office , saying that calling sausages produced beyond munich county borders amounted to defrauding consumers . the association has received the backing of munich mayor christian ude as well as other politicians .
“ the white sausage belongs to munich like no other food and that ’ s why we think it ’ s our duty to protect it from abuse , ” said helmut schmid , the leader of the social democrats in the city ’ s parliament . other bavarians make good sausage , too it ’ s a sentiment shared by the trade association of bavarian butchers , which has also filed a copyright application trying to patent the sausage ’ s original recipe .
unlike the munich-centric sausage supporters , this group believes that butchers south of the so-called “ white sausage equator , ” which roughly corresponds to the course of bavaria 's portion of the danube river , can also craft excellent products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a butcher in a restaurant on munich 's st. mary 's square allegedly created the weißwurst in 1857 .
“ we believe that a quality munich white sausage can also be made in old bavaria and swabia , not just munich itself , ” georg schlagbauer , himself a munich butcher , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , adding that it shouldn ’ t be geography but rather sausage ingredients that matter . in his opinion , the other side was simply trying to secure its market share , he added .
“ munich ’ s largest white sausage producer is part of the group , ” schlagbauer told the agence france presse news service .
“ there is a financial motivation behind this patriotism . ” following nuremberg ’ s and dresden ’ s lead ? patent office officials will likely take several months to decide on the issue , according to a spokesperson .
they can rely on a survey commissioned by the bavarian ministry of agriculture , in which 48 percent of germans believed munich white sausage came from the city and its surrounding areas .
should the patent office decide in favor of one of the applications , the german ministry of justice and the european commission still have to sign off on them . similar protection of local delicacies has already been approved in the past : nuremberg ’ s bratwurst has to come from the city .
dresdner stollen , a popular christmas bread , must be made in that eastern german city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner siegert with his book on white sausages .
“ what ’ s happening now in munich is pretty much the same , ” werner siegert -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has written a book on the etiquette rules of white sausage , told dw-world .
he believes stagnating sausage sales at munich ’ s restaurants , where the weisswurst and a beer have been a traditional mid-morning snack , had provoked the campaign .
“ i think people should rely on marketing and not on the legal system , however , ” siegert said , adding that he ’ s working on a collection of short stories on leaflets restaurants could hand out to their customers to bridge the five to eight minutes it takes to serve the perfect weisswurst . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more many of the tourists who travel to bavaria 's bustling capital city never make it past the hofbräuhaus tent at oktoberfest .

in november , the finance ministers on the european council effectively suspended the stability pact in order to prevent the commission from imposing stiff penalties on france and germany .
the move prompted solbes ' suit at the luxembourg high court .
in his consultations with the so-called euro group , which includes the finance ministers of all 12 euro zone countries , solbes once again repeated his grounds for the unprecedented lawsuit .
but solbes was met with frosty resistance .
' little support ' " there was little support among the ministers for the commission ’ s decision to seek a ruling from the european court of justice , " said irish finance minister charlie mccreevy .
austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who in the past has sided with solbes , rejected the commission ’ s suit .
even if the commission were to win it ’ s case , he said , nothing would change because it wouldn ’ t have any way of making sure the judgement was enforced .
on the other hand , " if the commission loses , " grasser said , " it could create the impression that germany and france acted properly , which certainly isn ’ t the case .
in our opinion , it ’ s a misguided deficit policy that ’ s certainly damaging for growth and employment .
in that regard , we ’ ve fought side by side with the commission and for that reason i regret that the commission is now sending out a false political signal instead of increasing the political pressure on germany and france to continue with their -lrb- budget -rrb- consolidation . "
this year , germany and france will breach the budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product established in the stability and growth pact for the third year in a row .
but german finance minister hans eichel said monday he still found solbes ’ decision to sue to be " incomprehensible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel speaking at the meeting , he said : " because the economy is doing better , the mood is , in general , good .
i don ’ t think there ’ s anything else to say really . "
despite the refusal of the council to accept his decision to sue , solbes on monday seemed unmoved .
" first , i don ’ t feel attacked , " he said .
" second , i have acted consistently with my position , which is that the pact that was agreed to must be respected . "
germany 's eichel , meanwhile , also rejected solbes ’ plan to call for changes to the stability pact next month .
the new regulations would force member states to adhere to more disciplined budgets during periods of economic upswings .
concern over weak dollar in a separate area of discussion monday , the ministers also broached the issue of the euro ’ s high exchange rate against the dollar .
" in the present circumstances , we ’ ve stressed stability and we ’ re concerned about excessive exchange rate moves , " the ministers said in a statement .
" we will continue to monitor the situation very closely and conduct policies supporting economic recovery in a stable macroeconomic environment . "
the european finance ministers are also seeking to develop a common position for their g7 meeting with the united states in florida early next month .
several finance experts as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , have expressed concern about the weakness of the dollar – even though the dollar appeared to recover against the euro slightly during the past week .
another point of contention between the european commission and the finance ministers is a call by the commission to increase the eu ’ s budget by 1.24 percent of gross domestic product after 2007 .
germany and five other eu net payers have rejected the proposal , which would require them to pay billions more to brussels .
german finance minister eichel has said he would like to cap the eu budget at 1 percent of gross domestic product , which would create an overall budget of about € 100 billion . berndt riegert -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission budget plan likely to irk member states the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money .

butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality . with two patent applications before the german patent office , signature drives and even a report by the bavarian ministry of agriculture on the issue , the munich sausage controversy has reached boiling point , something that should never happen to the water in which the mushy specialty is heated to perfection . but that ’ s beside the point for a group of munich mass-production butchers and restaurateurs , who are trying to secure exclusive rights to produce “ munich white sausages . ” they claim that only the city ’ s butchers can produce edible versions of the delicacy , and as evidence they claim that some of their bavarian competitors substitute cheaper pork for the sausage ’ s signature veal base . munich by name , munich by origin karl-heinz wildmoser , who runs a beer tent at oktoberfest and serves as president of munich ’ s tsv 1860 soccer club , said he ’ s had to suffer through sausage ordeals during games away from home .
“ we ’ re often treated to white sausages by other clubs - that ’ s a nice gesture , but sometimes they ’ re gruesome , ” wildmoser recently told münchner merkur newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo for the association for the protection of the white sausage includes a drawing of the twin tower of munich 's cathedral , the city 's landmark .
wildmoser , himself a munich original , is an adamant supporter of the association for the protection of the munich white sausage .
the group has filed a copyright application with the patent office , saying that calling sausages produced beyond munich county borders amounted to defrauding consumers . the association has received the backing of munich mayor christian ude as well as other politicians .
“ the white sausage belongs to munich like no other food and that ’ s why we think it ’ s our duty to protect it from abuse , ” said helmut schmid , the leader of the social democrats in the city ’ s parliament . other bavarians make good sausage , too it ’ s a sentiment shared by the trade association of bavarian butchers , which has also filed a copyright application trying to patent the sausage ’ s original recipe .
unlike the munich-centric sausage supporters , this group believes that butchers south of the so-called “ white sausage equator , ” which roughly corresponds to the course of bavaria 's portion of the danube river , can also craft excellent products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a butcher in a restaurant on munich 's st. mary 's square allegedly created the weißwurst in 1857 .
“ we believe that a quality munich white sausage can also be made in old bavaria and swabia , not just munich itself , ” georg schlagbauer , himself a munich butcher , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , adding that it shouldn ’ t be geography but rather sausage ingredients that matter . in his opinion , the other side was simply trying to secure its market share , he added .
“ munich ’ s largest white sausage producer is part of the group , ” schlagbauer told the agence france presse news service .
“ there is a financial motivation behind this patriotism . ” following nuremberg ’ s and dresden ’ s lead ? patent office officials will likely take several months to decide on the issue , according to a spokesperson .
they can rely on a survey commissioned by the bavarian ministry of agriculture , in which 48 percent of germans believed munich white sausage came from the city and its surrounding areas .
should the patent office decide in favor of one of the applications , the german ministry of justice and the european commission still have to sign off on them . similar protection of local delicacies has already been approved in the past : nuremberg ’ s bratwurst has to come from the city .
dresdner stollen , a popular christmas bread , must be made in that eastern german city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner siegert with his book on white sausages .
“ what ’ s happening now in munich is pretty much the same , ” werner siegert -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has written a book on the etiquette rules of white sausage , told dw-world .
he believes stagnating sausage sales at munich ’ s restaurants , where the weisswurst and a beer have been a traditional mid-morning snack , had provoked the campaign .
“ i think people should rely on marketing and not on the legal system , however , ” siegert said , adding that he ’ s working on a collection of short stories on leaflets restaurants could hand out to their customers to bridge the five to eight minutes it takes to serve the perfect weisswurst . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more many of the tourists who travel to bavaria 's bustling capital city never make it past the hofbräuhaus tent at oktoberfest .

the release of millions of royal air force world war ii reconnaissance photos , including aerial shots of auschwitz , has drawn criticism from those wondering why the allies did n't act sooner to stop the nazi genocide . the photos show a massive cloud of smoke created by the burning of thousands of corpses at auschwitz .
they show images of the " d-day " allied landing on the beaches of normandy so rich in detail that you can recognize the bodies of american gis .
they show the city of cologne in rubble after months of heavy british bombing .
and with their release this week , the british aerial reconnaissance archives at keele university have again raised painful memories and questions about the war .
who knew what and when ?
and why did n't anyone take action sooner to stop the nazi atrocities ?
on monday , britain 's keele university released more than 5 million royal air force aerial reconnaissance photos on a special web site .

the release of millions of royal air force world war ii reconnaissance photos , including aerial shots of auschwitz , has drawn criticism from those wondering why the allies did n't act sooner to stop the nazi genocide . the photos show a massive cloud of smoke created by the burning of thousands of corpses at auschwitz .

think again will the real modern talking please stand up ? hood vs. helmet garden gnome 's best friend goes sporty culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.01.2004 bavarian sausage wars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides agree that sweet mustard 's a must .
butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality . with two patent applications before the german patent office , signature drives and even a report by the bavarian ministry of agriculture on the issue , the munich sausage controversy has reached boiling point , something that should never happen to the water in which the mushy specialty is heated to perfection . but that ’ s beside the point for a group of munich mass-production butchers and restaurateurs , who are trying to secure exclusive rights to produce “ munich white sausages . ” they claim that only the city ’ s butchers can produce edible versions of the delicacy , and as evidence they claim that some of their bavarian competitors substitute cheaper pork for the sausage ’ s signature veal base . munich by name , munich by origin karl-heinz wildmoser , who runs a beer tent at oktoberfest and serves as president of munich ’ s tsv 1860 soccer club , said he ’ s had to suffer through sausage ordeals during games away from home .
“ we ’ re often treated to white sausages by other clubs - that ’ s a nice gesture , but sometimes they ’ re gruesome , ” wildmoser recently told münchner merkur newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo for the association for the protection of the white sausage includes a drawing of the twin tower of munich 's cathedral , the city 's landmark .
wildmoser , himself a munich original , is an adamant supporter of the association for the protection of the munich white sausage .
the group has filed a copyright application with the patent office , saying that calling sausages produced beyond munich county borders amounted to defrauding consumers . the association has received the backing of munich mayor christian ude as well as other politicians .
“ the white sausage belongs to munich like no other food and that ’ s why we think it ’ s our duty to protect it from abuse , ” said helmut schmid , the leader of the social democrats in the city ’ s parliament . other bavarians make good sausage , too it ’ s a sentiment shared by the trade association of bavarian butchers , which has also filed a copyright application trying to patent the sausage ’ s original recipe .
unlike the munich-centric sausage supporters , this group believes that butchers south of the so-called “ white sausage equator , ” which roughly corresponds to the course of bavaria 's portion of the danube river , can also craft excellent products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a butcher in a restaurant on munich 's st. mary 's square allegedly created the weißwurst in 1857 .
“ we believe that a quality munich white sausage can also be made in old bavaria and swabia , not just munich itself , ” georg schlagbauer , himself a munich butcher , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , adding that it shouldn ’ t be geography but rather sausage ingredients that matter . in his opinion , the other side was simply trying to secure its market share , he added .
“ munich ’ s largest white sausage producer is part of the group , ” schlagbauer told the agence france presse news service .
“ there is a financial motivation behind this patriotism . ” following nuremberg ’ s and dresden ’ s lead ? patent office officials will likely take several months to decide on the issue , according to a spokesperson .
they can rely on a survey commissioned by the bavarian ministry of agriculture , in which 48 percent of germans believed munich white sausage came from the city and its surrounding areas .
should the patent office decide in favor of one of the applications , the german ministry of justice and the european commission still have to sign off on them . similar protection of local delicacies has already been approved in the past : nuremberg ’ s bratwurst has to come from the city .
dresdner stollen , a popular christmas bread , must be made in that eastern german city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner siegert with his book on white sausages .
“ what ’ s happening now in munich is pretty much the same , ” werner siegert -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has written a book on the etiquette rules of white sausage , told dw-world .
he believes stagnating sausage sales at munich ’ s restaurants , where the weisswurst and a beer have been a traditional mid-morning snack , had provoked the campaign .
“ i think people should rely on marketing and not on the legal system , however , ” siegert said , adding that he ’ s working on a collection of short stories on leaflets restaurants could hand out to their customers to bridge the five to eight minutes it takes to serve the perfect weisswurst . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more many of the tourists who travel to bavaria 's bustling capital city never make it past the hofbräuhaus tent at oktoberfest .

the release of millions of royal air force world war ii reconnaissance photos , including aerial shots of auschwitz , has drawn criticism from those wondering why the allies did n't act sooner to stop the nazi genocide . the photos show a massive cloud of smoke created by the burning of thousands of corpses at auschwitz .
they show images of the " d-day " allied landing on the beaches of normandy so rich in detail that you can recognize the bodies of american gis .
they show the city of cologne in rubble after months of heavy british bombing .
and with their release this week , the british aerial reconnaissance archives at keele university have again raised painful memories and questions about the war .
who knew what and when ?
and why did n't anyone take action sooner to stop the nazi atrocities ?
on monday , britain 's keele university released more than 5 million royal air force aerial reconnaissance photos on a special web site .
for decades , the photos were available only to researchers and unknown to the broader public .
but now , indexed and searchable online to anyone , the images provide viewers with entirely new perspectives of the most bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the bridge at arnhem , the netherlands horrific and dramatic events of world war ii .
the most historically important images on the site are shots from auschwitz taken in august 1944 , d-day shots taken in june of the same year and images of the german battleship bismarck , which the germans kept hidden in a norwegian fjord for five days in may 1941 until the british forces sank it .
" these images allow us to see the real war at first hand , " project head allan william said . "
i was really moved by the photographs of the nazi concentration camps and the d-day landings .
it 's like a live action replay . "
images anger some but the shocking auschwitz images have also raised serious questions amongst critics about the actions of the allies during the war and why they did n't move to stop the gassings sooner by bombing the rail lines into the camps .
writing in britain ’ s guardian newspaper , journalist john ezard lamented : " you can view ‘ as though in a time machine ’ a 3d photograph which could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives had it been publicized when it was taken at 11 a.m. on august 23 , 1944 , at a time when hungarian jews were being murdered below . "
the photo was taken by an raf pilot aboard a reconnaissance plane over poland at a time when the germans , aware their days were numbered , had massively increased the amount of killing at auschwitz .
the detail is so clear in one photo that you can even see two columns of prisoners lining up for roll call at the concentration camp .
here in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday published a story under the headline " why weren ’ t the concentration camp thugs bombed ? "
the newspaper quoted german historian hans-ulrich wheler , a guest professor at harvard university , saying that london became aware , at the latest , of the nazi ’ s death camps in 1943 .
information on the web site of the united states holocaust memorial , which serves more or less as the official american historical authority , appears to backup wehler 's claim .
it notes that " in 1943 , polish courier jan karski informed president franklin d. roosevelt of reports of mass murder received from jewish leaders in the warsaw ghetto .
no immediate executive action was taken . "
by the autumn of 1944 , the museum claims , the allies knew of the gassings at auschwitz .
" why therefore were the extermination camps not destroyed after the reconnaissance planes of the britons and americans photographed them in such detail , " bild asked ?
" at the very least , the railway tracks on which the jews were transported into the extermination camp ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial shot of the beaches of normandy during d-day the archive ’ s caretaker , williams , said the spies took the photos in rapid-succession , like machine gun fire and that it was possible , given the sheer volume of photos , that they were never given the scrutiny they deserved .
" it is a fascinating issue as to why the photo operators did not know what was going on , " williams said .

tomas rosicky may be headed to the english premiership .
are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?
speculation is growing that the once top-flight team is preparing to sell some of its best players to come up with some cash . long plagued by poor results on the pitch and money problems in the boardroom , the once mighty borussia appears these day to be limping like a dying wildebeest , being shadowed by hyenas behind and vultures above . in an efforts to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion is ready to initiate a fire sale to cash in its best assets .
comments from czech star midfielder tomas rosicky stoked speculation he was on the verge of leaving borussia dortmund , with a decision coming perhaps as early as this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's roman abramovich .
first in the queue of eager shoppers outside the gates of the westfalen stadium is russian billionaire and fc chelsea chairman roman abramovich .
the man who has bankrolled the so-called chelski revolution in the english premier league appears to have an insatiable appetite for the world ’ s best players and the deep pockets to match .
the london club is reported prepared to pay upwards of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.1 million -rrb- for rosicky . player fuels rumors rosicky has been doing little to dampen the russian 's ardor .
" i 've known about chelsea 's interest for eight or nine days , " the midfielder recently admitted when questioned by reporters .
" it is now down to the clubs to see what happens , but if i were borussia i would not refuse the offer . " rosicky , the current dortmund captain and integral free-flowing cog in the czech machinery at the heart of the team , is valued at around € 14.8 million but would likely cost fc chelsea much more than that , given the player ’ s rising stock and his current agreement with the german team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosicky joined the bundesliga side from sparta prague in 2001 , and is under contract with them until 2008 .
a majority of the inflated price would go on paying compensation to the club for the loss of a contracted player . dortmund looking for profit on sale gerd niebaum , borussia ’ s president , on tuesday said dortmund did not have an offer for rosicky on the table and he refused to comment on the reports .
but for a club in dortmund ’ s position - this season alone it faces an estimated € 25 million loss - a rival club offering to pay the asking price of € 30 million for a player that cost almost half that three years ago would present the former german title holders with an offer perhaps too alluring to refuse . such a deal would be difficult for the debt-laden club to ignore after losing out on the estimated € 12 million financial windfall in champions league revenue .
the club ’ s misery was made complete when they were unceremoniously dumped out of the uefa cup by french side sochaux , losing 6-2 on aggregate . over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was also looking into borrow around € 100 million euros by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . top stars to be sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon of borussia dortmund , right , leaves the field under a pouring rain after his uefa cup , second round , second leg soccer match against sochaux , thursday , nov .
27 , 2003 in sochaux , eastern france .
sochaux defeated borussia 4-0 and advances to the next round of the competition .
teammate at left is unidentified .
-lrb- ap photo / patrick gardin -rrb- the sad reality of the situation at dortmund is that , with a number of underperforming and overpaid players on the books - many are currently injured - only the top stars at borussia are going to be worth anything to interested parties .
that means the sale of rosicky , compatriot jan koller and the brazilian youngster ewerthon -lrb- picture -rrb- represent the best chance of generating cash . the vicious circle would then be set in motion once more ; top players sold to pay off debts , leading to the team being undermined by a reduction in quality and the possibility of poor results which in turn could mean loss of revenue and yet more debts . despite the pen being far from poised over a deal between borussia and chelsea on the rosicky deal - dortmund coach matthias sammer has angrily called for the saga to be concluded one way or the other by the weekend - it looks to be only a matter of time before more check books are waved in the general direction of an increasingly desperate westfalen stadium . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dortmund faces cash crunch borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .

the berlin conference 's host , german environment minister jürgen trittin , kicked off the event by calling on the developing world to stop following in europe 's footsteps . " the resource-squandering model of the north has acted as an example for the countries of the south for too long , " the green party politician said . " access to sustainable energy is active climate policy , is active development policy , but access to renewable energy is also a policy for peace , " trittin told the 600 delegates from 45 countries .
" every country has a surplus of renewable energies .
no country has to go to war for them … wind turbines do n't tempt anyone to wage war over oil . " trittin stressed that the root causes of global climate change had to be addressed if renewable energies were to be promoted worldwide .
he pointed to the problems caused by global warming and said he hoped the trend could be reversed by a shrewd energy policy on the part of the international community .
cutting back on the use of fossil fuels and promoting renewable energies instead , he said , would reduce carbon dioxide emissions effectively . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin at the world summit on sustainable development in johannesburg in 2002 .
the minister said the main polluters , notably industrialized countries , had a particular obligation to reduce emissions .
he said he hoped most european countries would adopt the german government 's aim of increasing the share of renewable energies as a percentage of overall energy produced here by 20 percent by 2020 and by 50 percent by 2050 . too optimistic ? some doubt whether that is a realistic goal . british parliamentarian bill etherington told dw-radio the aim was too optimistic for most people .
by example , he pointed to denmark , which he said was the european leader and had succeeded in raising the amount of sustainable energy to around 15 percent over a 20 year period .
still , he said , " by the time the energy runs out , we have to have something else in place . " while trittin spoke to delegates inside , the environmental organization group greenpeace echoed his words outside the conference .
spokesman sven teske said the 20 percent share by 2020 " would be a good signal for other countries that will take part in the summit for renewable energies in bonn in july . "
he , too , emphasized that europe should set priorities .
" if the only industrial region that takes part in the summit does n't formulate reasonable targets , how should the developing countries do so ? " despite the appearance of harmony , greenpeace criticized the event , saying that important european energy policy-makers were missing .
indeed , eu commissioner for energy loyola de palacio , a conference patron along with trittin , was conspicuously absent , having cancelled her appearance just days before . an upbeat note , however , came from the fringes of the conference .
two energy companies announced they would start building the world ’ s biggest solar power station in germany in a few weeks . shell solar and geosol announced the would construct a plant south of leipzig in eastern german state of saxony and would start operation in july .
the company said the facility would supply some 1,800 households , thus sparing the environment of 3,700 -lrb- metric -rrb- tons worth of carbon-dioxide emissions yearly . dw staff with reporting from hardy graupner -lrb- ni -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts nuclear energy phase-out germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .

the berlin conference 's host , german environment minister jürgen trittin , kicked off the event by calling on the developing world to stop following in europe 's footsteps .

the berlin conference 's host , german environment minister jürgen trittin , kicked off the event by calling on the developing world to stop following in europe 's footsteps . " the resource-squandering model of the north has acted as an example for the countries of the south for too long , " the green party politician said . " access to sustainable energy is active climate policy , is active development policy , but access to renewable energy is also a policy for peace , " trittin told the 600 delegates from 45 countries .
" every country has a surplus of renewable energies .
no country has to go to war for them … wind turbines do n't tempt anyone to wage war over oil . " trittin stressed that the root causes of global climate change had to be addressed if renewable energies were to be promoted worldwide .
he pointed to the problems caused by global warming and said he hoped the trend could be reversed by a shrewd energy policy on the part of the international community .
cutting back on the use of fossil fuels and promoting renewable energies instead , he said , would reduce carbon dioxide emissions effectively . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin at the world summit on sustainable development in johannesburg in 2002 .
the minister said the main polluters , notably industrialized countries , had a particular obligation to reduce emissions .
he said he hoped most european countries would adopt the german government 's aim of increasing the share of renewable energies as a percentage of overall energy produced here by 20 percent by 2020 and by 50 percent by 2050 . too optimistic ? some doubt whether that is a realistic goal . british parliamentarian bill etherington told dw-radio the aim was too optimistic for most people .
by example , he pointed to denmark , which he said was the european leader and had succeeded in raising the amount of sustainable energy to around 15 percent over a 20 year period .
still , he said , " by the time the energy runs out , we have to have something else in place . " while trittin spoke to delegates inside , the environmental organization group greenpeace echoed his words outside the conference .
spokesman sven teske said the 20 percent share by 2020 " would be a good signal for other countries that will take part in the summit for renewable energies in bonn in july . "
he , too , emphasized that europe should set priorities .
" if the only industrial region that takes part in the summit does n't formulate reasonable targets , how should the developing countries do so ? " despite the appearance of harmony , greenpeace criticized the event , saying that important european energy policy-makers were missing .
indeed , eu commissioner for energy loyola de palacio , a conference patron along with trittin , was conspicuously absent , having cancelled her appearance just days before . an upbeat note , however , came from the fringes of the conference .

the release of millions of royal air force world war ii reconnaissance photos , including aerial shots of auschwitz , has drawn criticism from those wondering why the allies did n't act sooner to stop the nazi genocide . the photos show a massive cloud of smoke created by the burning of thousands of corpses at auschwitz .
they show images of the " d-day " allied landing on the beaches of normandy so rich in detail that you can recognize the bodies of american gis .
they show the city of cologne in rubble after months of heavy british bombing .
and with their release this week , the british aerial reconnaissance archives at keele university have again raised painful memories and questions about the war .
who knew what and when ?
and why did n't anyone take action sooner to stop the nazi atrocities ?
on monday , britain 's keele university released more than 5 million royal air force aerial reconnaissance photos on a special web site .
for decades , the photos were available only to researchers and unknown to the broader public .
but now , indexed and searchable online to anyone , the images provide viewers with entirely new perspectives of the most bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the bridge at arnhem , the netherlands horrific and dramatic events of world war ii .
the most historically important images on the site are shots from auschwitz taken in august 1944 , d-day shots taken in june of the same year and images of the german battleship bismarck , which the germans kept hidden in a norwegian fjord for five days in may 1941 until the british forces sank it .
" these images allow us to see the real war at first hand , " project head allan william said . "
i was really moved by the photographs of the nazi concentration camps and the d-day landings .
it 's like a live action replay . "
images anger some but the shocking auschwitz images have also raised serious questions amongst critics about the actions of the allies during the war and why they did n't move to stop the gassings sooner by bombing the rail lines into the camps .
writing in britain ’ s guardian newspaper , journalist john ezard lamented : " you can view ‘ as though in a time machine ’ a 3d photograph which could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives had it been publicized when it was taken at 11 a.m. on august 23 , 1944 , at a time when hungarian jews were being murdered below . "
the photo was taken by an raf pilot aboard a reconnaissance plane over poland at a time when the germans , aware their days were numbered , had massively increased the amount of killing at auschwitz .
the detail is so clear in one photo that you can even see two columns of prisoners lining up for roll call at the concentration camp .
here in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday published a story under the headline " why weren ’ t the concentration camp thugs bombed ? "
the newspaper quoted german historian hans-ulrich wheler , a guest professor at harvard university , saying that london became aware , at the latest , of the nazi ’ s death camps in 1943 .
information on the web site of the united states holocaust memorial , which serves more or less as the official american historical authority , appears to backup wehler 's claim .
it notes that " in 1943 , polish courier jan karski informed president franklin d. roosevelt of reports of mass murder received from jewish leaders in the warsaw ghetto .
no immediate executive action was taken . "
by the autumn of 1944 , the museum claims , the allies knew of the gassings at auschwitz .
" why therefore were the extermination camps not destroyed after the reconnaissance planes of the britons and americans photographed them in such detail , " bild asked ?
" at the very least , the railway tracks on which the jews were transported into the extermination camp ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial shot of the beaches of normandy during d-day the archive ’ s caretaker , williams , said the spies took the photos in rapid-succession , like machine gun fire and that it was possible , given the sheer volume of photos , that they were never given the scrutiny they deserved .
" it is a fascinating issue as to why the photo operators did not know what was going on , " williams said .
" i think the answer is that their orders were to look single-mindedly for military data .
they did not have time to think what else was happening .

butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality . with two patent applications before the german patent office , signature drives and even a report by the bavarian ministry of agriculture on the issue , the munich sausage controversy has reached boiling point , something that should never happen to the water in which the mushy specialty is heated to perfection . but that ’ s beside the point for a group of munich mass-production butchers and restaurateurs , who are trying to secure exclusive rights to produce “ munich white sausages . ” they claim that only the city ’ s butchers can produce edible versions of the delicacy , and as evidence they claim that some of their bavarian competitors substitute cheaper pork for the sausage ’ s signature veal base . munich by name , munich by origin karl-heinz wildmoser , who runs a beer tent at oktoberfest and serves as president of munich ’ s tsv 1860 soccer club , said he ’ s had to suffer through sausage ordeals during games away from home .
“ we ’ re often treated to white sausages by other clubs - that ’ s a nice gesture , but sometimes they ’ re gruesome , ” wildmoser recently told münchner merkur newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo for the association for the protection of the white sausage includes a drawing of the twin tower of munich 's cathedral , the city 's landmark .
wildmoser , himself a munich original , is an adamant supporter of the association for the protection of the munich white sausage .
the group has filed a copyright application with the patent office , saying that calling sausages produced beyond munich county borders amounted to defrauding consumers . the association has received the backing of munich mayor christian ude as well as other politicians .
“ the white sausage belongs to munich like no other food and that ’ s why we think it ’ s our duty to protect it from abuse , ” said helmut schmid , the leader of the social democrats in the city ’ s parliament . other bavarians make good sausage , too it ’ s a sentiment shared by the trade association of bavarian butchers , which has also filed a copyright application trying to patent the sausage ’ s original recipe .
unlike the munich-centric sausage supporters , this group believes that butchers south of the so-called “ white sausage equator , ” which roughly corresponds to the course of bavaria 's portion of the danube river , can also craft excellent products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a butcher in a restaurant on munich 's st. mary 's square allegedly created the weißwurst in 1857 .
“ we believe that a quality munich white sausage can also be made in old bavaria and swabia , not just munich itself , ” georg schlagbauer , himself a munich butcher , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , adding that it shouldn ’ t be geography but rather sausage ingredients that matter . in his opinion , the other side was simply trying to secure its market share , he added .
“ munich ’ s largest white sausage producer is part of the group , ” schlagbauer told the agence france presse news service .
“ there is a financial motivation behind this patriotism . ” following nuremberg ’ s and dresden ’ s lead ? patent office officials will likely take several months to decide on the issue , according to a spokesperson .
they can rely on a survey commissioned by the bavarian ministry of agriculture , in which 48 percent of germans believed munich white sausage came from the city and its surrounding areas .

butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality . with two patent applications before the german patent office , signature drives and even a report by the bavarian ministry of agriculture on the issue , the munich sausage controversy has reached boiling point , something that should never happen to the water in which the mushy specialty is heated to perfection . but that ’ s beside the point for a group of munich mass-production butchers and restaurateurs , who are trying to secure exclusive rights to produce “ munich white sausages . ” they claim that only the city ’ s butchers can produce edible versions of the delicacy , and as evidence they claim that some of their bavarian competitors substitute cheaper pork for the sausage ’ s signature veal base . munich by name , munich by origin karl-heinz wildmoser , who runs a beer tent at oktoberfest and serves as president of munich ’ s tsv 1860 soccer club , said he ’ s had to suffer through sausage ordeals during games away from home .

wildmoser , himself a munich original , is an adamant supporter of the association for the protection of the munich white sausage .
the group has filed a copyright application with the patent office , saying that calling sausages produced beyond munich county borders amounted to defrauding consumers . the association has received the backing of munich mayor christian ude as well as other politicians .

“ we believe that a quality munich white sausage can also be made in old bavaria and swabia , not just munich itself , ” georg schlagbauer , himself a munich butcher , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , adding that it shouldn ’ t be geography but rather sausage ingredients that matter . in his opinion , the other side was simply trying to secure its market share , he added .

in november , the finance ministers on the european council effectively suspended the stability pact in order to prevent the commission from imposing stiff penalties on france and germany .
the move prompted solbes ' suit at the luxembourg high court .
in his consultations with the so-called euro group , which includes the finance ministers of all 12 euro zone countries , solbes once again repeated his grounds for the unprecedented lawsuit .
but solbes was met with frosty resistance .
' little support ' " there was little support among the ministers for the commission ’ s decision to seek a ruling from the european court of justice , " said irish finance minister charlie mccreevy .
austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who in the past has sided with solbes , rejected the commission ’ s suit .
even if the commission were to win it ’ s case , he said , nothing would change because it wouldn ’ t have any way of making sure the judgement was enforced .
on the other hand , " if the commission loses , " grasser said , " it could create the impression that germany and france acted properly , which certainly isn ’ t the case .
in our opinion , it ’ s a misguided deficit policy that ’ s certainly damaging for growth and employment .
in that regard , we ’ ve fought side by side with the commission and for that reason i regret that the commission is now sending out a false political signal instead of increasing the political pressure on germany and france to continue with their -lrb- budget -rrb- consolidation . "
this year , germany and france will breach the budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product established in the stability and growth pact for the third year in a row .
but german finance minister hans eichel said monday he still found solbes ’ decision to sue to be " incomprehensible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel speaking at the meeting , he said : " because the economy is doing better , the mood is , in general , good .
i don ’ t think there ’ s anything else to say really . "
despite the refusal of the council to accept his decision to sue , solbes on monday seemed unmoved .
" first , i don ’ t feel attacked , " he said .
" second , i have acted consistently with my position , which is that the pact that was agreed to must be respected . "
germany 's eichel , meanwhile , also rejected solbes ’ plan to call for changes to the stability pact next month .
the new regulations would force member states to adhere to more disciplined budgets during periods of economic upswings .
concern over weak dollar in a separate area of discussion monday , the ministers also broached the issue of the euro ’ s high exchange rate against the dollar .
" in the present circumstances , we ’ ve stressed stability and we ’ re concerned about excessive exchange rate moves , " the ministers said in a statement .
" we will continue to monitor the situation very closely and conduct policies supporting economic recovery in a stable macroeconomic environment . "
the european finance ministers are also seeking to develop a common position for their g7 meeting with the united states in florida early next month .
several finance experts as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , have expressed concern about the weakness of the dollar – even though the dollar appeared to recover against the euro slightly during the past week .
another point of contention between the european commission and the finance ministers is a call by the commission to increase the eu ’ s budget by 1.24 percent of gross domestic product after 2007 .
germany and five other eu net payers have rejected the proposal , which would require them to pay billions more to brussels .
german finance minister eichel has said he would like to cap the eu budget at 1 percent of gross domestic product , which would create an overall budget of about € 100 billion . berndt riegert -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission budget plan likely to irk member states the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money .

in november , the finance ministers on the european council effectively suspended the stability pact in order to prevent the commission from imposing stiff penalties on france and germany .
the move prompted solbes ' suit at the luxembourg high court .
in his consultations with the so-called euro group , which includes the finance ministers of all 12 euro zone countries , solbes once again repeated his grounds for the unprecedented lawsuit .
but solbes was met with frosty resistance .
' little support ' " there was little support among the ministers for the commission ’ s decision to seek a ruling from the european court of justice , " said irish finance minister charlie mccreevy .
austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who in the past has sided with solbes , rejected the commission ’ s suit .
even if the commission were to win it ’ s case , he said , nothing would change because it wouldn ’ t have any way of making sure the judgement was enforced .
on the other hand , " if the commission loses , " grasser said , " it could create the impression that germany and france acted properly , which certainly isn ’ t the case .
in our opinion , it ’ s a misguided deficit policy that ’ s certainly damaging for growth and employment .
in that regard , we ’ ve fought side by side with the commission and for that reason i regret that the commission is now sending out a false political signal instead of increasing the political pressure on germany and france to continue with their -lrb- budget -rrb- consolidation . "
this year , germany and france will breach the budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product established in the stability and growth pact for the third year in a row .
but german finance minister hans eichel said monday he still found solbes ’ decision to sue to be " incomprehensible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel speaking at the meeting , he said : " because the economy is doing better , the mood is , in general , good .
i don ’ t think there ’ s anything else to say really . "
despite the refusal of the council to accept his decision to sue , solbes on monday seemed unmoved .
" first , i don ’ t feel attacked , " he said .
" second , i have acted consistently with my position , which is that the pact that was agreed to must be respected . "
germany 's eichel , meanwhile , also rejected solbes ’ plan to call for changes to the stability pact next month .
the new regulations would force member states to adhere to more disciplined budgets during periods of economic upswings .
concern over weak dollar in a separate area of discussion monday , the ministers also broached the issue of the euro ’ s high exchange rate against the dollar .
" in the present circumstances , we ’ ve stressed stability and we ’ re concerned about excessive exchange rate moves , " the ministers said in a statement .
" we will continue to monitor the situation very closely and conduct policies supporting economic recovery in a stable macroeconomic environment . "
the european finance ministers are also seeking to develop a common position for their g7 meeting with the united states in florida early next month .

tomas rosicky may be headed to the english premiership .
are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?
speculation is growing that the once top-flight team is preparing to sell some of its best players to come up with some cash . long plagued by poor results on the pitch and money problems in the boardroom , the once mighty borussia appears these day to be limping like a dying wildebeest , being shadowed by hyenas behind and vultures above . in an efforts to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion is ready to initiate a fire sale to cash in its best assets .
comments from czech star midfielder tomas rosicky stoked speculation he was on the verge of leaving borussia dortmund , with a decision coming perhaps as early as this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's roman abramovich .
first in the queue of eager shoppers outside the gates of the westfalen stadium is russian billionaire and fc chelsea chairman roman abramovich .
the man who has bankrolled the so-called chelski revolution in the english premier league appears to have an insatiable appetite for the world ’ s best players and the deep pockets to match .
the london club is reported prepared to pay upwards of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.1 million -rrb- for rosicky . player fuels rumors rosicky has been doing little to dampen the russian 's ardor .
" i 've known about chelsea 's interest for eight or nine days , " the midfielder recently admitted when questioned by reporters .
" it is now down to the clubs to see what happens , but if i were borussia i would not refuse the offer . " rosicky , the current dortmund captain and integral free-flowing cog in the czech machinery at the heart of the team , is valued at around € 14.8 million but would likely cost fc chelsea much more than that , given the player ’ s rising stock and his current agreement with the german team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosicky joined the bundesliga side from sparta prague in 2001 , and is under contract with them until 2008 .
a majority of the inflated price would go on paying compensation to the club for the loss of a contracted player . dortmund looking for profit on sale gerd niebaum , borussia ’ s president , on tuesday said dortmund did not have an offer for rosicky on the table and he refused to comment on the reports .
but for a club in dortmund ’ s position - this season alone it faces an estimated € 25 million loss - a rival club offering to pay the asking price of € 30 million for a player that cost almost half that three years ago would present the former german title holders with an offer perhaps too alluring to refuse . such a deal would be difficult for the debt-laden club to ignore after losing out on the estimated € 12 million financial windfall in champions league revenue .
the club ’ s misery was made complete when they were unceremoniously dumped out of the uefa cup by french side sochaux , losing 6-2 on aggregate . over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was also looking into borrow around € 100 million euros by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . top stars to be sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon of borussia dortmund , right , leaves the field under a pouring rain after his uefa cup , second round , second leg soccer match against sochaux , thursday , nov .
27 , 2003 in sochaux , eastern france .
sochaux defeated borussia 4-0 and advances to the next round of the competition .
teammate at left is unidentified .
-lrb- ap photo / patrick gardin -rrb- the sad reality of the situation at dortmund is that , with a number of underperforming and overpaid players on the books - many are currently injured - only the top stars at borussia are going to be worth anything to interested parties .
that means the sale of rosicky , compatriot jan koller and the brazilian youngster ewerthon -lrb- picture -rrb- represent the best chance of generating cash . the vicious circle would then be set in motion once more ; top players sold to pay off debts , leading to the team being undermined by a reduction in quality and the possibility of poor results which in turn could mean loss of revenue and yet more debts . despite the pen being far from poised over a deal between borussia and chelsea on the rosicky deal - dortmund coach matthias sammer has angrily called for the saga to be concluded one way or the other by the weekend - it looks to be only a matter of time before more check books are waved in the general direction of an increasingly desperate westfalen stadium . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dortmund faces cash crunch borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .

tomas rosicky may be headed to the english premiership .
are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?
speculation is growing that the once top-flight team is preparing to sell some of its best players to come up with some cash . long plagued by poor results on the pitch and money problems in the boardroom , the once mighty borussia appears these day to be limping like a dying wildebeest , being shadowed by hyenas behind and vultures above . in an efforts to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion is ready to initiate a fire sale to cash in its best assets .
comments from czech star midfielder tomas rosicky stoked speculation he was on the verge of leaving borussia dortmund , with a decision coming perhaps as early as this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's roman abramovich .
first in the queue of eager shoppers outside the gates of the westfalen stadium is russian billionaire and fc chelsea chairman roman abramovich .
the man who has bankrolled the so-called chelski revolution in the english premier league appears to have an insatiable appetite for the world ’ s best players and the deep pockets to match .
the london club is reported prepared to pay upwards of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.1 million -rrb- for rosicky . player fuels rumors rosicky has been doing little to dampen the russian 's ardor .
" i 've known about chelsea 's interest for eight or nine days , " the midfielder recently admitted when questioned by reporters .
" it is now down to the clubs to see what happens , but if i were borussia i would not refuse the offer . " rosicky , the current dortmund captain and integral free-flowing cog in the czech machinery at the heart of the team , is valued at around € 14.8 million but would likely cost fc chelsea much more than that , given the player ’ s rising stock and his current agreement with the german team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosicky joined the bundesliga side from sparta prague in 2001 , and is under contract with them until 2008 .
a majority of the inflated price would go on paying compensation to the club for the loss of a contracted player . dortmund looking for profit on sale gerd niebaum , borussia ’ s president , on tuesday said dortmund did not have an offer for rosicky on the table and he refused to comment on the reports .
but for a club in dortmund ’ s position - this season alone it faces an estimated € 25 million loss - a rival club offering to pay the asking price of € 30 million for a player that cost almost half that three years ago would present the former german title holders with an offer perhaps too alluring to refuse . such a deal would be difficult for the debt-laden club to ignore after losing out on the estimated € 12 million financial windfall in champions league revenue .
the club ’ s misery was made complete when they were unceremoniously dumped out of the uefa cup by french side sochaux , losing 6-2 on aggregate . over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was also looking into borrow around € 100 million euros by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .

in november , the finance ministers on the european council effectively suspended the stability pact in order to prevent the commission from imposing stiff penalties on france and germany .
the move prompted solbes ' suit at the luxembourg high court .
in his consultations with the so-called euro group , which includes the finance ministers of all 12 euro zone countries , solbes once again repeated his grounds for the unprecedented lawsuit .
but solbes was met with frosty resistance .
' little support ' " there was little support among the ministers for the commission ’ s decision to seek a ruling from the european court of justice , " said irish finance minister charlie mccreevy .
austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who in the past has sided with solbes , rejected the commission ’ s suit .
even if the commission were to win it ’ s case , he said , nothing would change because it wouldn ’ t have any way of making sure the judgement was enforced .
on the other hand , " if the commission loses , " grasser said , " it could create the impression that germany and france acted properly , which certainly isn ’ t the case .
in our opinion , it ’ s a misguided deficit policy that ’ s certainly damaging for growth and employment .
in that regard , we ’ ve fought side by side with the commission and for that reason i regret that the commission is now sending out a false political signal instead of increasing the political pressure on germany and france to continue with their -lrb- budget -rrb- consolidation . "
this year , germany and france will breach the budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product established in the stability and growth pact for the third year in a row .
but german finance minister hans eichel said monday he still found solbes ’ decision to sue to be " incomprehensible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel speaking at the meeting , he said : " because the economy is doing better , the mood is , in general , good .
i don ’ t think there ’ s anything else to say really . "
despite the refusal of the council to accept his decision to sue , solbes on monday seemed unmoved .
" first , i don ’ t feel attacked , " he said .
" second , i have acted consistently with my position , which is that the pact that was agreed to must be respected . "
germany 's eichel , meanwhile , also rejected solbes ’ plan to call for changes to the stability pact next month .
the new regulations would force member states to adhere to more disciplined budgets during periods of economic upswings .
concern over weak dollar in a separate area of discussion monday , the ministers also broached the issue of the euro ’ s high exchange rate against the dollar .
" in the present circumstances , we ’ ve stressed stability and we ’ re concerned about excessive exchange rate moves , " the ministers said in a statement .
" we will continue to monitor the situation very closely and conduct policies supporting economic recovery in a stable macroeconomic environment . "
the european finance ministers are also seeking to develop a common position for their g7 meeting with the united states in florida early next month .
several finance experts as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , have expressed concern about the weakness of the dollar – even though the dollar appeared to recover against the euro slightly during the past week .
another point of contention between the european commission and the finance ministers is a call by the commission to increase the eu ’ s budget by 1.24 percent of gross domestic product after 2007 .
germany and five other eu net payers have rejected the proposal , which would require them to pay billions more to brussels .
german finance minister eichel has said he would like to cap the eu budget at 1 percent of gross domestic product , which would create an overall budget of about € 100 billion . berndt riegert -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission budget plan likely to irk member states the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money .

the release of millions of royal air force world war ii reconnaissance photos , including aerial shots of auschwitz , has drawn criticism from those wondering why the allies did n't act sooner to stop the nazi genocide . the photos show a massive cloud of smoke created by the burning of thousands of corpses at auschwitz .
they show images of the " d-day " allied landing on the beaches of normandy so rich in detail that you can recognize the bodies of american gis .
they show the city of cologne in rubble after months of heavy british bombing .
and with their release this week , the british aerial reconnaissance archives at keele university have again raised painful memories and questions about the war .
who knew what and when ?
and why did n't anyone take action sooner to stop the nazi atrocities ?
on monday , britain 's keele university released more than 5 million royal air force aerial reconnaissance photos on a special web site .
for decades , the photos were available only to researchers and unknown to the broader public .
but now , indexed and searchable online to anyone , the images provide viewers with entirely new perspectives of the most bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the bridge at arnhem , the netherlands horrific and dramatic events of world war ii .
the most historically important images on the site are shots from auschwitz taken in august 1944 , d-day shots taken in june of the same year and images of the german battleship bismarck , which the germans kept hidden in a norwegian fjord for five days in may 1941 until the british forces sank it .
" these images allow us to see the real war at first hand , " project head allan william said . "
i was really moved by the photographs of the nazi concentration camps and the d-day landings .
it 's like a live action replay . "
images anger some but the shocking auschwitz images have also raised serious questions amongst critics about the actions of the allies during the war and why they did n't move to stop the gassings sooner by bombing the rail lines into the camps .
writing in britain ’ s guardian newspaper , journalist john ezard lamented : " you can view ‘ as though in a time machine ’ a 3d photograph which could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives had it been publicized when it was taken at 11 a.m. on august 23 , 1944 , at a time when hungarian jews were being murdered below . "
the photo was taken by an raf pilot aboard a reconnaissance plane over poland at a time when the germans , aware their days were numbered , had massively increased the amount of killing at auschwitz .
the detail is so clear in one photo that you can even see two columns of prisoners lining up for roll call at the concentration camp .
here in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday published a story under the headline " why weren ’ t the concentration camp thugs bombed ? "
the newspaper quoted german historian hans-ulrich wheler , a guest professor at harvard university , saying that london became aware , at the latest , of the nazi ’ s death camps in 1943 .
information on the web site of the united states holocaust memorial , which serves more or less as the official american historical authority , appears to backup wehler 's claim .
it notes that " in 1943 , polish courier jan karski informed president franklin d. roosevelt of reports of mass murder received from jewish leaders in the warsaw ghetto .
no immediate executive action was taken . "
by the autumn of 1944 , the museum claims , the allies knew of the gassings at auschwitz .
" why therefore were the extermination camps not destroyed after the reconnaissance planes of the britons and americans photographed them in such detail , " bild asked ?
" at the very least , the railway tracks on which the jews were transported into the extermination camp ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial shot of the beaches of normandy during d-day the archive ’ s caretaker , williams , said the spies took the photos in rapid-succession , like machine gun fire and that it was possible , given the sheer volume of photos , that they were never given the scrutiny they deserved .
" it is a fascinating issue as to why the photo operators did not know what was going on , " williams said .

the release of millions of royal air force world war ii reconnaissance photos , including aerial shots of auschwitz , has drawn criticism from those wondering why the allies did n't act sooner to stop the nazi genocide . the photos show a massive cloud of smoke created by the burning of thousands of corpses at auschwitz .
they show images of the " d-day " allied landing on the beaches of normandy so rich in detail that you can recognize the bodies of american gis .
they show the city of cologne in rubble after months of heavy british bombing .
and with their release this week , the british aerial reconnaissance archives at keele university have again raised painful memories and questions about the war .
who knew what and when ?
and why did n't anyone take action sooner to stop the nazi atrocities ?
on monday , britain 's keele university released more than 5 million royal air force aerial reconnaissance photos on a special web site .
for decades , the photos were available only to researchers and unknown to the broader public .
but now , indexed and searchable online to anyone , the images provide viewers with entirely new perspectives of the most bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the bridge at arnhem , the netherlands horrific and dramatic events of world war ii .
the most historically important images on the site are shots from auschwitz taken in august 1944 , d-day shots taken in june of the same year and images of the german battleship bismarck , which the germans kept hidden in a norwegian fjord for five days in may 1941 until the british forces sank it .
" these images allow us to see the real war at first hand , " project head allan william said . "
i was really moved by the photographs of the nazi concentration camps and the d-day landings .
it 's like a live action replay . "
images anger some but the shocking auschwitz images have also raised serious questions amongst critics about the actions of the allies during the war and why they did n't move to stop the gassings sooner by bombing the rail lines into the camps .
writing in britain ’ s guardian newspaper , journalist john ezard lamented : " you can view ‘ as though in a time machine ’ a 3d photograph which could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives had it been publicized when it was taken at 11 a.m. on august 23 , 1944 , at a time when hungarian jews were being murdered below . "
the photo was taken by an raf pilot aboard a reconnaissance plane over poland at a time when the germans , aware their days were numbered , had massively increased the amount of killing at auschwitz .
the detail is so clear in one photo that you can even see two columns of prisoners lining up for roll call at the concentration camp .
here in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday published a story under the headline " why weren ’ t the concentration camp thugs bombed ? "
the newspaper quoted german historian hans-ulrich wheler , a guest professor at harvard university , saying that london became aware , at the latest , of the nazi ’ s death camps in 1943 .
information on the web site of the united states holocaust memorial , which serves more or less as the official american historical authority , appears to backup wehler 's claim .
it notes that " in 1943 , polish courier jan karski informed president franklin d. roosevelt of reports of mass murder received from jewish leaders in the warsaw ghetto .
no immediate executive action was taken . "
by the autumn of 1944 , the museum claims , the allies knew of the gassings at auschwitz .
" why therefore were the extermination camps not destroyed after the reconnaissance planes of the britons and americans photographed them in such detail , " bild asked ?
" at the very least , the railway tracks on which the jews were transported into the extermination camp ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial shot of the beaches of normandy during d-day the archive ’ s caretaker , williams , said the spies took the photos in rapid-succession , like machine gun fire and that it was possible , given the sheer volume of photos , that they were never given the scrutiny they deserved .
" it is a fascinating issue as to why the photo operators did not know what was going on , " williams said .
" i think the answer is that their orders were to look single-mindedly for military data .
they did not have time to think what else was happening .

speculation is growing that the once top-flight team is preparing to sell some of its best players to come up with some cash . long plagued by poor results on the pitch and money problems in the boardroom , the once mighty borussia appears these day to be limping like a dying wildebeest , being shadowed by hyenas behind and vultures above . in an efforts to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion is ready to initiate a fire sale to cash in its best assets .

" it is now down to the clubs to see what happens , but if i were borussia i would not refuse the offer . " rosicky , the current dortmund captain and integral free-flowing cog in the czech machinery at the heart of the team , is valued at around € 14.8 million but would likely cost fc chelsea much more than that , given the player ’ s rising stock and his current agreement with the german team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosicky joined the bundesliga side from sparta prague in 2001 , and is under contract with them until 2008 .
a majority of the inflated price would go on paying compensation to the club for the loss of a contracted player . dortmund looking for profit on sale gerd niebaum , borussia ’ s president , on tuesday said dortmund did not have an offer for rosicky on the table and he refused to comment on the reports .
but for a club in dortmund ’ s position - this season alone it faces an estimated € 25 million loss - a rival club offering to pay the asking price of € 30 million for a player that cost almost half that three years ago would present the former german title holders with an offer perhaps too alluring to refuse . such a deal would be difficult for the debt-laden club to ignore after losing out on the estimated € 12 million financial windfall in champions league revenue .
the club ’ s misery was made complete when they were unceremoniously dumped out of the uefa cup by french side sochaux , losing 6-2 on aggregate . over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was also looking into borrow around € 100 million euros by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .

tomas rosicky may be headed to the english premiership .
are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?
speculation is growing that the once top-flight team is preparing to sell some of its best players to come up with some cash . long plagued by poor results on the pitch and money problems in the boardroom , the once mighty borussia appears these day to be limping like a dying wildebeest , being shadowed by hyenas behind and vultures above . in an efforts to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion is ready to initiate a fire sale to cash in its best assets .
comments from czech star midfielder tomas rosicky stoked speculation he was on the verge of leaving borussia dortmund , with a decision coming perhaps as early as this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's roman abramovich .
first in the queue of eager shoppers outside the gates of the westfalen stadium is russian billionaire and fc chelsea chairman roman abramovich .
the man who has bankrolled the so-called chelski revolution in the english premier league appears to have an insatiable appetite for the world ’ s best players and the deep pockets to match .
the london club is reported prepared to pay upwards of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.1 million -rrb- for rosicky . player fuels rumors rosicky has been doing little to dampen the russian 's ardor .
" i 've known about chelsea 's interest for eight or nine days , " the midfielder recently admitted when questioned by reporters .
" it is now down to the clubs to see what happens , but if i were borussia i would not refuse the offer . " rosicky , the current dortmund captain and integral free-flowing cog in the czech machinery at the heart of the team , is valued at around € 14.8 million but would likely cost fc chelsea much more than that , given the player ’ s rising stock and his current agreement with the german team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosicky joined the bundesliga side from sparta prague in 2001 , and is under contract with them until 2008 .
a majority of the inflated price would go on paying compensation to the club for the loss of a contracted player . dortmund looking for profit on sale gerd niebaum , borussia ’ s president , on tuesday said dortmund did not have an offer for rosicky on the table and he refused to comment on the reports .
but for a club in dortmund ’ s position - this season alone it faces an estimated € 25 million loss - a rival club offering to pay the asking price of € 30 million for a player that cost almost half that three years ago would present the former german title holders with an offer perhaps too alluring to refuse . such a deal would be difficult for the debt-laden club to ignore after losing out on the estimated € 12 million financial windfall in champions league revenue .
the club ’ s misery was made complete when they were unceremoniously dumped out of the uefa cup by french side sochaux , losing 6-2 on aggregate . over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was also looking into borrow around € 100 million euros by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .

they show the city of cologne in rubble after months of heavy british bombing .
and with their release this week , the british aerial reconnaissance archives at keele university have again raised painful memories and questions about the war .
who knew what and when ?
and why did n't anyone take action sooner to stop the nazi atrocities ?
on monday , britain 's keele university released more than 5 million royal air force aerial reconnaissance photos on a special web site .
for decades , the photos were available only to researchers and unknown to the broader public .
but now , indexed and searchable online to anyone , the images provide viewers with entirely new perspectives of the most bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the bridge at arnhem , the netherlands horrific and dramatic events of world war ii .
the most historically important images on the site are shots from auschwitz taken in august 1944 , d-day shots taken in june of the same year and images of the german battleship bismarck , which the germans kept hidden in a norwegian fjord for five days in may 1941 until the british forces sank it .
" these images allow us to see the real war at first hand , " project head allan william said . "
i was really moved by the photographs of the nazi concentration camps and the d-day landings .
it 's like a live action replay . "
images anger some but the shocking auschwitz images have also raised serious questions amongst critics about the actions of the allies during the war and why they did n't move to stop the gassings sooner by bombing the rail lines into the camps .
writing in britain ’ s guardian newspaper , journalist john ezard lamented : " you can view ‘ as though in a time machine ’ a 3d photograph which could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives had it been publicized when it was taken at 11 a.m. on august 23 , 1944 , at a time when hungarian jews were being murdered below . "
the photo was taken by an raf pilot aboard a reconnaissance plane over poland at a time when the germans , aware their days were numbered , had massively increased the amount of killing at auschwitz .
the detail is so clear in one photo that you can even see two columns of prisoners lining up for roll call at the concentration camp .
here in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday published a story under the headline " why weren ’ t the concentration camp thugs bombed ? "
the newspaper quoted german historian hans-ulrich wheler , a guest professor at harvard university , saying that london became aware , at the latest , of the nazi ’ s death camps in 1943 .
information on the web site of the united states holocaust memorial , which serves more or less as the official american historical authority , appears to backup wehler 's claim .
it notes that " in 1943 , polish courier jan karski informed president franklin d. roosevelt of reports of mass murder received from jewish leaders in the warsaw ghetto .
no immediate executive action was taken . "
by the autumn of 1944 , the museum claims , the allies knew of the gassings at auschwitz .
" why therefore were the extermination camps not destroyed after the reconnaissance planes of the britons and americans photographed them in such detail , " bild asked ?
" at the very least , the railway tracks on which the jews were transported into the extermination camp ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial shot of the beaches of normandy during d-day the archive ’ s caretaker , williams , said the spies took the photos in rapid-succession , like machine gun fire and that it was possible , given the sheer volume of photos , that they were never given the scrutiny they deserved .
" it is a fascinating issue as to why the photo operators did not know what was going on , " williams said .
" i think the answer is that their orders were to look single-mindedly for military data .
they did not have time to think what else was happening .

butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality . with two patent applications before the german patent office , signature drives and even a report by the bavarian ministry of agriculture on the issue , the munich sausage controversy has reached boiling point , something that should never happen to the water in which the mushy specialty is heated to perfection . but that ’ s beside the point for a group of munich mass-production butchers and restaurateurs , who are trying to secure exclusive rights to produce “ munich white sausages . ” they claim that only the city ’ s butchers can produce edible versions of the delicacy , and as evidence they claim that some of their bavarian competitors substitute cheaper pork for the sausage ’ s signature veal base . munich by name , munich by origin karl-heinz wildmoser , who runs a beer tent at oktoberfest and serves as president of munich ’ s tsv 1860 soccer club , said he ’ s had to suffer through sausage ordeals during games away from home .
“ we ’ re often treated to white sausages by other clubs - that ’ s a nice gesture , but sometimes they ’ re gruesome , ” wildmoser recently told münchner merkur newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo for the association for the protection of the white sausage includes a drawing of the twin tower of munich 's cathedral , the city 's landmark .
wildmoser , himself a munich original , is an adamant supporter of the association for the protection of the munich white sausage .
the group has filed a copyright application with the patent office , saying that calling sausages produced beyond munich county borders amounted to defrauding consumers . the association has received the backing of munich mayor christian ude as well as other politicians .
“ the white sausage belongs to munich like no other food and that ’ s why we think it ’ s our duty to protect it from abuse , ” said helmut schmid , the leader of the social democrats in the city ’ s parliament . other bavarians make good sausage , too it ’ s a sentiment shared by the trade association of bavarian butchers , which has also filed a copyright application trying to patent the sausage ’ s original recipe .
unlike the munich-centric sausage supporters , this group believes that butchers south of the so-called “ white sausage equator , ” which roughly corresponds to the course of bavaria 's portion of the danube river , can also craft excellent products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a butcher in a restaurant on munich 's st. mary 's square allegedly created the weißwurst in 1857 .
“ we believe that a quality munich white sausage can also be made in old bavaria and swabia , not just munich itself , ” georg schlagbauer , himself a munich butcher , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , adding that it shouldn ’ t be geography but rather sausage ingredients that matter . in his opinion , the other side was simply trying to secure its market share , he added .
“ munich ’ s largest white sausage producer is part of the group , ” schlagbauer told the agence france presse news service .
“ there is a financial motivation behind this patriotism . ” following nuremberg ’ s and dresden ’ s lead ? patent office officials will likely take several months to decide on the issue , according to a spokesperson .
they can rely on a survey commissioned by the bavarian ministry of agriculture , in which 48 percent of germans believed munich white sausage came from the city and its surrounding areas .
should the patent office decide in favor of one of the applications , the german ministry of justice and the european commission still have to sign off on them . similar protection of local delicacies has already been approved in the past : nuremberg ’ s bratwurst has to come from the city .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.01.2004 eu finance ministers spar with commission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure : eu finance ministers are taking shots at eu commissioner pedro solbes saying his lawsuit could send out a false political message , euro zone finance ministers assailed pedro solbes ' decision to sue member states for a decision to suspend the euro 's stability pact . brussels - barely a week after european monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes announced he would file a legal complaint at the european court of justice against euro zone members , both plaintiffs and defendants came together for a routine meeting on monday night .
in november , the finance ministers on the european council effectively suspended the stability pact in order to prevent the commission from imposing stiff penalties on france and germany .
the move prompted solbes ' suit at the luxembourg high court .
in his consultations with the so-called euro group , which includes the finance ministers of all 12 euro zone countries , solbes once again repeated his grounds for the unprecedented lawsuit .
but solbes was met with frosty resistance .
' little support ' " there was little support among the ministers for the commission ’ s decision to seek a ruling from the european court of justice , " said irish finance minister charlie mccreevy .
austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who in the past has sided with solbes , rejected the commission ’ s suit .
even if the commission were to win it ’ s case , he said , nothing would change because it wouldn ’ t have any way of making sure the judgement was enforced .
on the other hand , " if the commission loses , " grasser said , " it could create the impression that germany and france acted properly , which certainly isn ’ t the case .
in our opinion , it ’ s a misguided deficit policy that ’ s certainly damaging for growth and employment .
in that regard , we ’ ve fought side by side with the commission and for that reason i regret that the commission is now sending out a false political signal instead of increasing the political pressure on germany and france to continue with their -lrb- budget -rrb- consolidation . "
this year , germany and france will breach the budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product established in the stability and growth pact for the third year in a row .
but german finance minister hans eichel said monday he still found solbes ’ decision to sue to be " incomprehensible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel speaking at the meeting , he said : " because the economy is doing better , the mood is , in general , good .
i don ’ t think there ’ s anything else to say really . "
despite the refusal of the council to accept his decision to sue , solbes on monday seemed unmoved .
" first , i don ’ t feel attacked , " he said .
" second , i have acted consistently with my position , which is that the pact that was agreed to must be respected . "
germany 's eichel , meanwhile , also rejected solbes ’ plan to call for changes to the stability pact next month .
the new regulations would force member states to adhere to more disciplined budgets during periods of economic upswings .
concern over weak dollar in a separate area of discussion monday , the ministers also broached the issue of the euro ’ s high exchange rate against the dollar .
" in the present circumstances , we ’ ve stressed stability and we ’ re concerned about excessive exchange rate moves , " the ministers said in a statement .
" we will continue to monitor the situation very closely and conduct policies supporting economic recovery in a stable macroeconomic environment . "
the european finance ministers are also seeking to develop a common position for their g7 meeting with the united states in florida early next month .
several finance experts as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , have expressed concern about the weakness of the dollar – even though the dollar appeared to recover against the euro slightly during the past week .
another point of contention between the european commission and the finance ministers is a call by the commission to increase the eu ’ s budget by 1.24 percent of gross domestic product after 2007 .
germany and five other eu net payers have rejected the proposal , which would require them to pay billions more to brussels .
german finance minister eichel has said he would like to cap the eu budget at 1 percent of gross domestic product , which would create an overall budget of about € 100 billion . berndt riegert -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission budget plan likely to irk member states the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money .

the release of millions of royal air force world war ii reconnaissance photos , including aerial shots of auschwitz , has drawn criticism from those wondering why the allies did n't act sooner to stop the nazi genocide . the photos show a massive cloud of smoke created by the burning of thousands of corpses at auschwitz .
they show images of the " d-day " allied landing on the beaches of normandy so rich in detail that you can recognize the bodies of american gis .
they show the city of cologne in rubble after months of heavy british bombing .
and with their release this week , the british aerial reconnaissance archives at keele university have again raised painful memories and questions about the war .
who knew what and when ?
and why did n't anyone take action sooner to stop the nazi atrocities ?
on monday , britain 's keele university released more than 5 million royal air force aerial reconnaissance photos on a special web site .
for decades , the photos were available only to researchers and unknown to the broader public .
but now , indexed and searchable online to anyone , the images provide viewers with entirely new perspectives of the most bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the bridge at arnhem , the netherlands horrific and dramatic events of world war ii .
the most historically important images on the site are shots from auschwitz taken in august 1944 , d-day shots taken in june of the same year and images of the german battleship bismarck , which the germans kept hidden in a norwegian fjord for five days in may 1941 until the british forces sank it .
" these images allow us to see the real war at first hand , " project head allan william said . "
i was really moved by the photographs of the nazi concentration camps and the d-day landings .
it 's like a live action replay . "
images anger some but the shocking auschwitz images have also raised serious questions amongst critics about the actions of the allies during the war and why they did n't move to stop the gassings sooner by bombing the rail lines into the camps .
writing in britain ’ s guardian newspaper , journalist john ezard lamented : " you can view ‘ as though in a time machine ’ a 3d photograph which could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives had it been publicized when it was taken at 11 a.m. on august 23 , 1944 , at a time when hungarian jews were being murdered below . "
the photo was taken by an raf pilot aboard a reconnaissance plane over poland at a time when the germans , aware their days were numbered , had massively increased the amount of killing at auschwitz .
the detail is so clear in one photo that you can even see two columns of prisoners lining up for roll call at the concentration camp .
here in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday published a story under the headline " why weren ’ t the concentration camp thugs bombed ? "
the newspaper quoted german historian hans-ulrich wheler , a guest professor at harvard university , saying that london became aware , at the latest , of the nazi ’ s death camps in 1943 .
information on the web site of the united states holocaust memorial , which serves more or less as the official american historical authority , appears to backup wehler 's claim .
it notes that " in 1943 , polish courier jan karski informed president franklin d. roosevelt of reports of mass murder received from jewish leaders in the warsaw ghetto .
no immediate executive action was taken . "
by the autumn of 1944 , the museum claims , the allies knew of the gassings at auschwitz .
" why therefore were the extermination camps not destroyed after the reconnaissance planes of the britons and americans photographed them in such detail , " bild asked ?
" at the very least , the railway tracks on which the jews were transported into the extermination camp ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial shot of the beaches of normandy during d-day the archive ’ s caretaker , williams , said the spies took the photos in rapid-succession , like machine gun fire and that it was possible , given the sheer volume of photos , that they were never given the scrutiny they deserved .
" it is a fascinating issue as to why the photo operators did not know what was going on , " williams said .
" i think the answer is that their orders were to look single-mindedly for military data .

tomas rosicky may be headed to the english premiership .
are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?
speculation is growing that the once top-flight team is preparing to sell some of its best players to come up with some cash . long plagued by poor results on the pitch and money problems in the boardroom , the once mighty borussia appears these day to be limping like a dying wildebeest , being shadowed by hyenas behind and vultures above . in an efforts to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion is ready to initiate a fire sale to cash in its best assets .
comments from czech star midfielder tomas rosicky stoked speculation he was on the verge of leaving borussia dortmund , with a decision coming perhaps as early as this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's roman abramovich .
first in the queue of eager shoppers outside the gates of the westfalen stadium is russian billionaire and fc chelsea chairman roman abramovich .
the man who has bankrolled the so-called chelski revolution in the english premier league appears to have an insatiable appetite for the world ’ s best players and the deep pockets to match .
the london club is reported prepared to pay upwards of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.1 million -rrb- for rosicky . player fuels rumors rosicky has been doing little to dampen the russian 's ardor .
" i 've known about chelsea 's interest for eight or nine days , " the midfielder recently admitted when questioned by reporters .
" it is now down to the clubs to see what happens , but if i were borussia i would not refuse the offer . " rosicky , the current dortmund captain and integral free-flowing cog in the czech machinery at the heart of the team , is valued at around € 14.8 million but would likely cost fc chelsea much more than that , given the player ’ s rising stock and his current agreement with the german team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosicky joined the bundesliga side from sparta prague in 2001 , and is under contract with them until 2008 .
a majority of the inflated price would go on paying compensation to the club for the loss of a contracted player . dortmund looking for profit on sale gerd niebaum , borussia ’ s president , on tuesday said dortmund did not have an offer for rosicky on the table and he refused to comment on the reports .
but for a club in dortmund ’ s position - this season alone it faces an estimated € 25 million loss - a rival club offering to pay the asking price of € 30 million for a player that cost almost half that three years ago would present the former german title holders with an offer perhaps too alluring to refuse . such a deal would be difficult for the debt-laden club to ignore after losing out on the estimated € 12 million financial windfall in champions league revenue .
the club ’ s misery was made complete when they were unceremoniously dumped out of the uefa cup by french side sochaux , losing 6-2 on aggregate . over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was also looking into borrow around € 100 million euros by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . top stars to be sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon of borussia dortmund , right , leaves the field under a pouring rain after his uefa cup , second round , second leg soccer match against sochaux , thursday , nov .

teammate at left is unidentified .
-lrb- ap photo / patrick gardin -rrb- the sad reality of the situation at dortmund is that , with a number of underperforming and overpaid players on the books - many are currently injured - only the top stars at borussia are going to be worth anything to interested parties .
that means the sale of rosicky , compatriot jan koller and the brazilian youngster ewerthon -lrb- picture -rrb- represent the best chance of generating cash . the vicious circle would then be set in motion once more ; top players sold to pay off debts , leading to the team being undermined by a reduction in quality and the possibility of poor results which in turn could mean loss of revenue and yet more debts . despite the pen being far from poised over a deal between borussia and chelsea on the rosicky deal - dortmund coach matthias sammer has angrily called for the saga to be concluded one way or the other by the weekend - it looks to be only a matter of time before more check books are waved in the general direction of an increasingly desperate westfalen stadium . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dortmund faces cash crunch borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .

the release of millions of royal air force world war ii reconnaissance photos , including aerial shots of auschwitz , has drawn criticism from those wondering why the allies did n't act sooner to stop the nazi genocide . the photos show a massive cloud of smoke created by the burning of thousands of corpses at auschwitz .
they show images of the " d-day " allied landing on the beaches of normandy so rich in detail that you can recognize the bodies of american gis .
they show the city of cologne in rubble after months of heavy british bombing .
and with their release this week , the british aerial reconnaissance archives at keele university have again raised painful memories and questions about the war .
who knew what and when ?
and why did n't anyone take action sooner to stop the nazi atrocities ?
on monday , britain 's keele university released more than 5 million royal air force aerial reconnaissance photos on a special web site .
for decades , the photos were available only to researchers and unknown to the broader public .
but now , indexed and searchable online to anyone , the images provide viewers with entirely new perspectives of the most bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the bridge at arnhem , the netherlands horrific and dramatic events of world war ii .
the most historically important images on the site are shots from auschwitz taken in august 1944 , d-day shots taken in june of the same year and images of the german battleship bismarck , which the germans kept hidden in a norwegian fjord for five days in may 1941 until the british forces sank it .
" these images allow us to see the real war at first hand , " project head allan william said . "
i was really moved by the photographs of the nazi concentration camps and the d-day landings .
it 's like a live action replay . "
images anger some but the shocking auschwitz images have also raised serious questions amongst critics about the actions of the allies during the war and why they did n't move to stop the gassings sooner by bombing the rail lines into the camps .
writing in britain ’ s guardian newspaper , journalist john ezard lamented : " you can view ‘ as though in a time machine ’ a 3d photograph which could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives had it been publicized when it was taken at 11 a.m. on august 23 , 1944 , at a time when hungarian jews were being murdered below . "
the photo was taken by an raf pilot aboard a reconnaissance plane over poland at a time when the germans , aware their days were numbered , had massively increased the amount of killing at auschwitz .
the detail is so clear in one photo that you can even see two columns of prisoners lining up for roll call at the concentration camp .
here in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday published a story under the headline " why weren ’ t the concentration camp thugs bombed ? "
the newspaper quoted german historian hans-ulrich wheler , a guest professor at harvard university , saying that london became aware , at the latest , of the nazi ’ s death camps in 1943 .
information on the web site of the united states holocaust memorial , which serves more or less as the official american historical authority , appears to backup wehler 's claim .
it notes that " in 1943 , polish courier jan karski informed president franklin d. roosevelt of reports of mass murder received from jewish leaders in the warsaw ghetto .
no immediate executive action was taken . "
by the autumn of 1944 , the museum claims , the allies knew of the gassings at auschwitz .
" why therefore were the extermination camps not destroyed after the reconnaissance planes of the britons and americans photographed them in such detail , " bild asked ?
" at the very least , the railway tracks on which the jews were transported into the extermination camp ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial shot of the beaches of normandy during d-day the archive ’ s caretaker , williams , said the spies took the photos in rapid-succession , like machine gun fire and that it was possible , given the sheer volume of photos , that they were never given the scrutiny they deserved .
" it is a fascinating issue as to why the photo operators did not know what was going on , " williams said .

butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality . with two patent applications before the german patent office , signature drives and even a report by the bavarian ministry of agriculture on the issue , the munich sausage controversy has reached boiling point , something that should never happen to the water in which the mushy specialty is heated to perfection . but that ’ s beside the point for a group of munich mass-production butchers and restaurateurs , who are trying to secure exclusive rights to produce “ munich white sausages . ” they claim that only the city ’ s butchers can produce edible versions of the delicacy , and as evidence they claim that some of their bavarian competitors substitute cheaper pork for the sausage ’ s signature veal base . munich by name , munich by origin karl-heinz wildmoser , who runs a beer tent at oktoberfest and serves as president of munich ’ s tsv 1860 soccer club , said he ’ s had to suffer through sausage ordeals during games away from home .
“ we ’ re often treated to white sausages by other clubs - that ’ s a nice gesture , but sometimes they ’ re gruesome , ” wildmoser recently told münchner merkur newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo for the association for the protection of the white sausage includes a drawing of the twin tower of munich 's cathedral , the city 's landmark .
wildmoser , himself a munich original , is an adamant supporter of the association for the protection of the munich white sausage .
the group has filed a copyright application with the patent office , saying that calling sausages produced beyond munich county borders amounted to defrauding consumers . the association has received the backing of munich mayor christian ude as well as other politicians .
“ the white sausage belongs to munich like no other food and that ’ s why we think it ’ s our duty to protect it from abuse , ” said helmut schmid , the leader of the social democrats in the city ’ s parliament . other bavarians make good sausage , too it ’ s a sentiment shared by the trade association of bavarian butchers , which has also filed a copyright application trying to patent the sausage ’ s original recipe .
unlike the munich-centric sausage supporters , this group believes that butchers south of the so-called “ white sausage equator , ” which roughly corresponds to the course of bavaria 's portion of the danube river , can also craft excellent products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a butcher in a restaurant on munich 's st. mary 's square allegedly created the weißwurst in 1857 .
“ we believe that a quality munich white sausage can also be made in old bavaria and swabia , not just munich itself , ” georg schlagbauer , himself a munich butcher , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , adding that it shouldn ’ t be geography but rather sausage ingredients that matter . in his opinion , the other side was simply trying to secure its market share , he added .
“ munich ’ s largest white sausage producer is part of the group , ” schlagbauer told the agence france presse news service .
“ there is a financial motivation behind this patriotism . ” following nuremberg ’ s and dresden ’ s lead ? patent office officials will likely take several months to decide on the issue , according to a spokesperson .
they can rely on a survey commissioned by the bavarian ministry of agriculture , in which 48 percent of germans believed munich white sausage came from the city and its surrounding areas .
should the patent office decide in favor of one of the applications , the german ministry of justice and the european commission still have to sign off on them . similar protection of local delicacies has already been approved in the past : nuremberg ’ s bratwurst has to come from the city .
dresdner stollen , a popular christmas bread , must be made in that eastern german city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner siegert with his book on white sausages .
“ what ’ s happening now in munich is pretty much the same , ” werner siegert -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has written a book on the etiquette rules of white sausage , told dw-world .
he believes stagnating sausage sales at munich ’ s restaurants , where the weisswurst and a beer have been a traditional mid-morning snack , had provoked the campaign .
“ i think people should rely on marketing and not on the legal system , however , ” siegert said , adding that he ’ s working on a collection of short stories on leaflets restaurants could hand out to their customers to bridge the five to eight minutes it takes to serve the perfect weisswurst . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more many of the tourists who travel to bavaria 's bustling capital city never make it past the hofbräuhaus tent at oktoberfest .
but a world-class culture , shopping and nightlife beckon beyond the wiesn .

butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality . with two patent applications before the german patent office , signature drives and even a report by the bavarian ministry of agriculture on the issue , the munich sausage controversy has reached boiling point , something that should never happen to the water in which the mushy specialty is heated to perfection . but that ’ s beside the point for a group of munich mass-production butchers and restaurateurs , who are trying to secure exclusive rights to produce “ munich white sausages . ” they claim that only the city ’ s butchers can produce edible versions of the delicacy , and as evidence they claim that some of their bavarian competitors substitute cheaper pork for the sausage ’ s signature veal base . munich by name , munich by origin karl-heinz wildmoser , who runs a beer tent at oktoberfest and serves as president of munich ’ s tsv 1860 soccer club , said he ’ s had to suffer through sausage ordeals during games away from home .

wildmoser , himself a munich original , is an adamant supporter of the association for the protection of the munich white sausage .
the group has filed a copyright application with the patent office , saying that calling sausages produced beyond munich county borders amounted to defrauding consumers . the association has received the backing of munich mayor christian ude as well as other politicians .

“ we believe that a quality munich white sausage can also be made in old bavaria and swabia , not just munich itself , ” georg schlagbauer , himself a munich butcher , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , adding that it shouldn ’ t be geography but rather sausage ingredients that matter . in his opinion , the other side was simply trying to secure its market share , he added .

the release of millions of royal air force world war ii reconnaissance photos , including aerial shots of auschwitz , has drawn criticism from those wondering why the allies did n't act sooner to stop the nazi genocide . the photos show a massive cloud of smoke created by the burning of thousands of corpses at auschwitz .
they show images of the " d-day " allied landing on the beaches of normandy so rich in detail that you can recognize the bodies of american gis .
they show the city of cologne in rubble after months of heavy british bombing .
and with their release this week , the british aerial reconnaissance archives at keele university have again raised painful memories and questions about the war .
who knew what and when ?
and why did n't anyone take action sooner to stop the nazi atrocities ?
on monday , britain 's keele university released more than 5 million royal air force aerial reconnaissance photos on a special web site .
for decades , the photos were available only to researchers and unknown to the broader public .
but now , indexed and searchable online to anyone , the images provide viewers with entirely new perspectives of the most bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the bridge at arnhem , the netherlands horrific and dramatic events of world war ii .
the most historically important images on the site are shots from auschwitz taken in august 1944 , d-day shots taken in june of the same year and images of the german battleship bismarck , which the germans kept hidden in a norwegian fjord for five days in may 1941 until the british forces sank it .
" these images allow us to see the real war at first hand , " project head allan william said . "
i was really moved by the photographs of the nazi concentration camps and the d-day landings .
it 's like a live action replay . "
images anger some but the shocking auschwitz images have also raised serious questions amongst critics about the actions of the allies during the war and why they did n't move to stop the gassings sooner by bombing the rail lines into the camps .
writing in britain ’ s guardian newspaper , journalist john ezard lamented : " you can view ‘ as though in a time machine ’ a 3d photograph which could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives had it been publicized when it was taken at 11 a.m. on august 23 , 1944 , at a time when hungarian jews were being murdered below . "
the photo was taken by an raf pilot aboard a reconnaissance plane over poland at a time when the germans , aware their days were numbered , had massively increased the amount of killing at auschwitz .
the detail is so clear in one photo that you can even see two columns of prisoners lining up for roll call at the concentration camp .
here in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday published a story under the headline " why weren ’ t the concentration camp thugs bombed ? "
the newspaper quoted german historian hans-ulrich wheler , a guest professor at harvard university , saying that london became aware , at the latest , of the nazi ’ s death camps in 1943 .
information on the web site of the united states holocaust memorial , which serves more or less as the official american historical authority , appears to backup wehler 's claim .
it notes that " in 1943 , polish courier jan karski informed president franklin d. roosevelt of reports of mass murder received from jewish leaders in the warsaw ghetto .
no immediate executive action was taken . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.01.2004 eu finance ministers spar with commission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure : eu finance ministers are taking shots at eu commissioner pedro solbes saying his lawsuit could send out a false political message , euro zone finance ministers assailed pedro solbes ' decision to sue member states for a decision to suspend the euro 's stability pact . brussels - barely a week after european monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes announced he would file a legal complaint at the european court of justice against euro zone members , both plaintiffs and defendants came together for a routine meeting on monday night .
in november , the finance ministers on the european council effectively suspended the stability pact in order to prevent the commission from imposing stiff penalties on france and germany .
the move prompted solbes ' suit at the luxembourg high court .
in his consultations with the so-called euro group , which includes the finance ministers of all 12 euro zone countries , solbes once again repeated his grounds for the unprecedented lawsuit .
but solbes was met with frosty resistance .
' little support ' " there was little support among the ministers for the commission ’ s decision to seek a ruling from the european court of justice , " said irish finance minister charlie mccreevy .
austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who in the past has sided with solbes , rejected the commission ’ s suit .
even if the commission were to win it ’ s case , he said , nothing would change because it wouldn ’ t have any way of making sure the judgement was enforced .
on the other hand , " if the commission loses , " grasser said , " it could create the impression that germany and france acted properly , which certainly isn ’ t the case .
in our opinion , it ’ s a misguided deficit policy that ’ s certainly damaging for growth and employment .
in that regard , we ’ ve fought side by side with the commission and for that reason i regret that the commission is now sending out a false political signal instead of increasing the political pressure on germany and france to continue with their -lrb- budget -rrb- consolidation . "
this year , germany and france will breach the budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product established in the stability and growth pact for the third year in a row .
but german finance minister hans eichel said monday he still found solbes ’ decision to sue to be " incomprehensible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel speaking at the meeting , he said : " because the economy is doing better , the mood is , in general , good .
i don ’ t think there ’ s anything else to say really . "
despite the refusal of the council to accept his decision to sue , solbes on monday seemed unmoved .
" first , i don ’ t feel attacked , " he said .
" second , i have acted consistently with my position , which is that the pact that was agreed to must be respected . "
germany 's eichel , meanwhile , also rejected solbes ’ plan to call for changes to the stability pact next month .
the new regulations would force member states to adhere to more disciplined budgets during periods of economic upswings .
concern over weak dollar in a separate area of discussion monday , the ministers also broached the issue of the euro ’ s high exchange rate against the dollar .
" in the present circumstances , we ’ ve stressed stability and we ’ re concerned about excessive exchange rate moves , " the ministers said in a statement .
" we will continue to monitor the situation very closely and conduct policies supporting economic recovery in a stable macroeconomic environment . "
the european finance ministers are also seeking to develop a common position for their g7 meeting with the united states in florida early next month .
several finance experts as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , have expressed concern about the weakness of the dollar – even though the dollar appeared to recover against the euro slightly during the past week .
another point of contention between the european commission and the finance ministers is a call by the commission to increase the eu ’ s budget by 1.24 percent of gross domestic product after 2007 .
germany and five other eu net payers have rejected the proposal , which would require them to pay billions more to brussels .
german finance minister eichel has said he would like to cap the eu budget at 1 percent of gross domestic product , which would create an overall budget of about € 100 billion . berndt riegert -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission budget plan likely to irk member states the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money .

in november , the finance ministers on the european council effectively suspended the stability pact in order to prevent the commission from imposing stiff penalties on france and germany .
the move prompted solbes ' suit at the luxembourg high court .
in his consultations with the so-called euro group , which includes the finance ministers of all 12 euro zone countries , solbes once again repeated his grounds for the unprecedented lawsuit .
but solbes was met with frosty resistance .
' little support ' " there was little support among the ministers for the commission ’ s decision to seek a ruling from the european court of justice , " said irish finance minister charlie mccreevy .
austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who in the past has sided with solbes , rejected the commission ’ s suit .
even if the commission were to win it ’ s case , he said , nothing would change because it wouldn ’ t have any way of making sure the judgement was enforced .
on the other hand , " if the commission loses , " grasser said , " it could create the impression that germany and france acted properly , which certainly isn ’ t the case .
in our opinion , it ’ s a misguided deficit policy that ’ s certainly damaging for growth and employment .
in that regard , we ’ ve fought side by side with the commission and for that reason i regret that the commission is now sending out a false political signal instead of increasing the political pressure on germany and france to continue with their -lrb- budget -rrb- consolidation . "
this year , germany and france will breach the budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product established in the stability and growth pact for the third year in a row .
but german finance minister hans eichel said monday he still found solbes ’ decision to sue to be " incomprehensible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel speaking at the meeting , he said : " because the economy is doing better , the mood is , in general , good .
i don ’ t think there ’ s anything else to say really . "
despite the refusal of the council to accept his decision to sue , solbes on monday seemed unmoved .
" first , i don ’ t feel attacked , " he said .
" second , i have acted consistently with my position , which is that the pact that was agreed to must be respected . "
germany 's eichel , meanwhile , also rejected solbes ’ plan to call for changes to the stability pact next month .
the new regulations would force member states to adhere to more disciplined budgets during periods of economic upswings .
concern over weak dollar in a separate area of discussion monday , the ministers also broached the issue of the euro ’ s high exchange rate against the dollar .
" in the present circumstances , we ’ ve stressed stability and we ’ re concerned about excessive exchange rate moves , " the ministers said in a statement .
" we will continue to monitor the situation very closely and conduct policies supporting economic recovery in a stable macroeconomic environment . "
the european finance ministers are also seeking to develop a common position for their g7 meeting with the united states in florida early next month .
several finance experts as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , have expressed concern about the weakness of the dollar – even though the dollar appeared to recover against the euro slightly during the past week .
another point of contention between the european commission and the finance ministers is a call by the commission to increase the eu ’ s budget by 1.24 percent of gross domestic product after 2007 .
germany and five other eu net payers have rejected the proposal , which would require them to pay billions more to brussels .
german finance minister eichel has said he would like to cap the eu budget at 1 percent of gross domestic product , which would create an overall budget of about € 100 billion . berndt riegert -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission budget plan likely to irk member states the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money .

the release of millions of royal air force world war ii reconnaissance photos , including aerial shots of auschwitz , has drawn criticism from those wondering why the allies did n't act sooner to stop the nazi genocide . the photos show a massive cloud of smoke created by the burning of thousands of corpses at auschwitz .
they show images of the " d-day " allied landing on the beaches of normandy so rich in detail that you can recognize the bodies of american gis .
they show the city of cologne in rubble after months of heavy british bombing .
and with their release this week , the british aerial reconnaissance archives at keele university have again raised painful memories and questions about the war .
who knew what and when ?
and why did n't anyone take action sooner to stop the nazi atrocities ?
on monday , britain 's keele university released more than 5 million royal air force aerial reconnaissance photos on a special web site .
for decades , the photos were available only to researchers and unknown to the broader public .
but now , indexed and searchable online to anyone , the images provide viewers with entirely new perspectives of the most bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the bridge at arnhem , the netherlands horrific and dramatic events of world war ii .
the most historically important images on the site are shots from auschwitz taken in august 1944 , d-day shots taken in june of the same year and images of the german battleship bismarck , which the germans kept hidden in a norwegian fjord for five days in may 1941 until the british forces sank it .
" these images allow us to see the real war at first hand , " project head allan william said . "
i was really moved by the photographs of the nazi concentration camps and the d-day landings .
it 's like a live action replay . "
images anger some but the shocking auschwitz images have also raised serious questions amongst critics about the actions of the allies during the war and why they did n't move to stop the gassings sooner by bombing the rail lines into the camps .
writing in britain ’ s guardian newspaper , journalist john ezard lamented : " you can view ‘ as though in a time machine ’ a 3d photograph which could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives had it been publicized when it was taken at 11 a.m. on august 23 , 1944 , at a time when hungarian jews were being murdered below . "
the photo was taken by an raf pilot aboard a reconnaissance plane over poland at a time when the germans , aware their days were numbered , had massively increased the amount of killing at auschwitz .
the detail is so clear in one photo that you can even see two columns of prisoners lining up for roll call at the concentration camp .
here in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday published a story under the headline " why weren ’ t the concentration camp thugs bombed ? "
the newspaper quoted german historian hans-ulrich wheler , a guest professor at harvard university , saying that london became aware , at the latest , of the nazi ’ s death camps in 1943 .
information on the web site of the united states holocaust memorial , which serves more or less as the official american historical authority , appears to backup wehler 's claim .
it notes that " in 1943 , polish courier jan karski informed president franklin d. roosevelt of reports of mass murder received from jewish leaders in the warsaw ghetto .
no immediate executive action was taken . "
by the autumn of 1944 , the museum claims , the allies knew of the gassings at auschwitz .
" why therefore were the extermination camps not destroyed after the reconnaissance planes of the britons and americans photographed them in such detail , " bild asked ?
" at the very least , the railway tracks on which the jews were transported into the extermination camp ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial shot of the beaches of normandy during d-day the archive ’ s caretaker , williams , said the spies took the photos in rapid-succession , like machine gun fire and that it was possible , given the sheer volume of photos , that they were never given the scrutiny they deserved .
" it is a fascinating issue as to why the photo operators did not know what was going on , " williams said .
" i think the answer is that their orders were to look single-mindedly for military data .
they did not have time to think what else was happening .

spotlessly german ?
think again will the real modern talking please stand up ? hood vs. helmet garden gnome 's best friend goes sporty culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.01.2004 bavarian sausage wars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides agree that sweet mustard 's a must .
butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality . with two patent applications before the german patent office , signature drives and even a report by the bavarian ministry of agriculture on the issue , the munich sausage controversy has reached boiling point , something that should never happen to the water in which the mushy specialty is heated to perfection . but that ’ s beside the point for a group of munich mass-production butchers and restaurateurs , who are trying to secure exclusive rights to produce “ munich white sausages . ” they claim that only the city ’ s butchers can produce edible versions of the delicacy , and as evidence they claim that some of their bavarian competitors substitute cheaper pork for the sausage ’ s signature veal base . munich by name , munich by origin karl-heinz wildmoser , who runs a beer tent at oktoberfest and serves as president of munich ’ s tsv 1860 soccer club , said he ’ s had to suffer through sausage ordeals during games away from home .
“ we ’ re often treated to white sausages by other clubs - that ’ s a nice gesture , but sometimes they ’ re gruesome , ” wildmoser recently told münchner merkur newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo for the association for the protection of the white sausage includes a drawing of the twin tower of munich 's cathedral , the city 's landmark .
wildmoser , himself a munich original , is an adamant supporter of the association for the protection of the munich white sausage .
the group has filed a copyright application with the patent office , saying that calling sausages produced beyond munich county borders amounted to defrauding consumers . the association has received the backing of munich mayor christian ude as well as other politicians .
“ the white sausage belongs to munich like no other food and that ’ s why we think it ’ s our duty to protect it from abuse , ” said helmut schmid , the leader of the social democrats in the city ’ s parliament . other bavarians make good sausage , too it ’ s a sentiment shared by the trade association of bavarian butchers , which has also filed a copyright application trying to patent the sausage ’ s original recipe .
unlike the munich-centric sausage supporters , this group believes that butchers south of the so-called “ white sausage equator , ” which roughly corresponds to the course of bavaria 's portion of the danube river , can also craft excellent products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a butcher in a restaurant on munich 's st. mary 's square allegedly created the weißwurst in 1857 .
“ we believe that a quality munich white sausage can also be made in old bavaria and swabia , not just munich itself , ” georg schlagbauer , himself a munich butcher , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , adding that it shouldn ’ t be geography but rather sausage ingredients that matter . in his opinion , the other side was simply trying to secure its market share , he added .
“ munich ’ s largest white sausage producer is part of the group , ” schlagbauer told the agence france presse news service .

butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality . with two patent applications before the german patent office , signature drives and even a report by the bavarian ministry of agriculture on the issue , the munich sausage controversy has reached boiling point , something that should never happen to the water in which the mushy specialty is heated to perfection . but that ’ s beside the point for a group of munich mass-production butchers and restaurateurs , who are trying to secure exclusive rights to produce “ munich white sausages . ” they claim that only the city ’ s butchers can produce edible versions of the delicacy , and as evidence they claim that some of their bavarian competitors substitute cheaper pork for the sausage ’ s signature veal base . munich by name , munich by origin karl-heinz wildmoser , who runs a beer tent at oktoberfest and serves as president of munich ’ s tsv 1860 soccer club , said he ’ s had to suffer through sausage ordeals during games away from home .
“ we ’ re often treated to white sausages by other clubs - that ’ s a nice gesture , but sometimes they ’ re gruesome , ” wildmoser recently told münchner merkur newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo for the association for the protection of the white sausage includes a drawing of the twin tower of munich 's cathedral , the city 's landmark .
wildmoser , himself a munich original , is an adamant supporter of the association for the protection of the munich white sausage .
the group has filed a copyright application with the patent office , saying that calling sausages produced beyond munich county borders amounted to defrauding consumers . the association has received the backing of munich mayor christian ude as well as other politicians .
“ the white sausage belongs to munich like no other food and that ’ s why we think it ’ s our duty to protect it from abuse , ” said helmut schmid , the leader of the social democrats in the city ’ s parliament . other bavarians make good sausage , too it ’ s a sentiment shared by the trade association of bavarian butchers , which has also filed a copyright application trying to patent the sausage ’ s original recipe .
unlike the munich-centric sausage supporters , this group believes that butchers south of the so-called “ white sausage equator , ” which roughly corresponds to the course of bavaria 's portion of the danube river , can also craft excellent products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a butcher in a restaurant on munich 's st. mary 's square allegedly created the weißwurst in 1857 .
“ we believe that a quality munich white sausage can also be made in old bavaria and swabia , not just munich itself , ” georg schlagbauer , himself a munich butcher , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , adding that it shouldn ’ t be geography but rather sausage ingredients that matter . in his opinion , the other side was simply trying to secure its market share , he added .

are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?
speculation is growing that the once top-flight team is preparing to sell some of its best players to come up with some cash . long plagued by poor results on the pitch and money problems in the boardroom , the once mighty borussia appears these day to be limping like a dying wildebeest , being shadowed by hyenas behind and vultures above . in an efforts to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion is ready to initiate a fire sale to cash in its best assets .

" i 've known about chelsea 's interest for eight or nine days , " the midfielder recently admitted when questioned by reporters .
" it is now down to the clubs to see what happens , but if i were borussia i would not refuse the offer . " rosicky , the current dortmund captain and integral free-flowing cog in the czech machinery at the heart of the team , is valued at around € 14.8 million but would likely cost fc chelsea much more than that , given the player ’ s rising stock and his current agreement with the german team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosicky joined the bundesliga side from sparta prague in 2001 , and is under contract with them until 2008 .

but for a club in dortmund ’ s position - this season alone it faces an estimated € 25 million loss - a rival club offering to pay the asking price of € 30 million for a player that cost almost half that three years ago would present the former german title holders with an offer perhaps too alluring to refuse . such a deal would be difficult for the debt-laden club to ignore after losing out on the estimated € 12 million financial windfall in champions league revenue .
the club ’ s misery was made complete when they were unceremoniously dumped out of the uefa cup by french side sochaux , losing 6-2 on aggregate . over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was also looking into borrow around € 100 million euros by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .

tomas rosicky may be headed to the english premiership .
are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?
speculation is growing that the once top-flight team is preparing to sell some of its best players to come up with some cash . long plagued by poor results on the pitch and money problems in the boardroom , the once mighty borussia appears these day to be limping like a dying wildebeest , being shadowed by hyenas behind and vultures above . in an efforts to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion is ready to initiate a fire sale to cash in its best assets .
comments from czech star midfielder tomas rosicky stoked speculation he was on the verge of leaving borussia dortmund , with a decision coming perhaps as early as this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's roman abramovich .
first in the queue of eager shoppers outside the gates of the westfalen stadium is russian billionaire and fc chelsea chairman roman abramovich .
the man who has bankrolled the so-called chelski revolution in the english premier league appears to have an insatiable appetite for the world ’ s best players and the deep pockets to match .
the london club is reported prepared to pay upwards of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.1 million -rrb- for rosicky . player fuels rumors rosicky has been doing little to dampen the russian 's ardor .
" i 've known about chelsea 's interest for eight or nine days , " the midfielder recently admitted when questioned by reporters .
" it is now down to the clubs to see what happens , but if i were borussia i would not refuse the offer . " rosicky , the current dortmund captain and integral free-flowing cog in the czech machinery at the heart of the team , is valued at around € 14.8 million but would likely cost fc chelsea much more than that , given the player ’ s rising stock and his current agreement with the german team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosicky joined the bundesliga side from sparta prague in 2001 , and is under contract with them until 2008 .
a majority of the inflated price would go on paying compensation to the club for the loss of a contracted player . dortmund looking for profit on sale gerd niebaum , borussia ’ s president , on tuesday said dortmund did not have an offer for rosicky on the table and he refused to comment on the reports .
but for a club in dortmund ’ s position - this season alone it faces an estimated € 25 million loss - a rival club offering to pay the asking price of € 30 million for a player that cost almost half that three years ago would present the former german title holders with an offer perhaps too alluring to refuse . such a deal would be difficult for the debt-laden club to ignore after losing out on the estimated € 12 million financial windfall in champions league revenue .
the club ’ s misery was made complete when they were unceremoniously dumped out of the uefa cup by french side sochaux , losing 6-2 on aggregate . over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was also looking into borrow around € 100 million euros by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . top stars to be sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon of borussia dortmund , right , leaves the field under a pouring rain after his uefa cup , second round , second leg soccer match against sochaux , thursday , nov .
27 , 2003 in sochaux , eastern france .
sochaux defeated borussia 4-0 and advances to the next round of the competition .
teammate at left is unidentified .
-lrb- ap photo / patrick gardin -rrb- the sad reality of the situation at dortmund is that , with a number of underperforming and overpaid players on the books - many are currently injured - only the top stars at borussia are going to be worth anything to interested parties .
that means the sale of rosicky , compatriot jan koller and the brazilian youngster ewerthon -lrb- picture -rrb- represent the best chance of generating cash . the vicious circle would then be set in motion once more ; top players sold to pay off debts , leading to the team being undermined by a reduction in quality and the possibility of poor results which in turn could mean loss of revenue and yet more debts . despite the pen being far from poised over a deal between borussia and chelsea on the rosicky deal - dortmund coach matthias sammer has angrily called for the saga to be concluded one way or the other by the weekend - it looks to be only a matter of time before more check books are waved in the general direction of an increasingly desperate westfalen stadium . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dortmund faces cash crunch borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .

think again will the real modern talking please stand up ? hood vs. helmet garden gnome 's best friend goes sporty culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.01.2004 bavarian sausage wars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides agree that sweet mustard 's a must .
butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality . with two patent applications before the german patent office , signature drives and even a report by the bavarian ministry of agriculture on the issue , the munich sausage controversy has reached boiling point , something that should never happen to the water in which the mushy specialty is heated to perfection . but that ’ s beside the point for a group of munich mass-production butchers and restaurateurs , who are trying to secure exclusive rights to produce “ munich white sausages . ” they claim that only the city ’ s butchers can produce edible versions of the delicacy , and as evidence they claim that some of their bavarian competitors substitute cheaper pork for the sausage ’ s signature veal base . munich by name , munich by origin karl-heinz wildmoser , who runs a beer tent at oktoberfest and serves as president of munich ’ s tsv 1860 soccer club , said he ’ s had to suffer through sausage ordeals during games away from home .
“ we ’ re often treated to white sausages by other clubs - that ’ s a nice gesture , but sometimes they ’ re gruesome , ” wildmoser recently told münchner merkur newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo for the association for the protection of the white sausage includes a drawing of the twin tower of munich 's cathedral , the city 's landmark .
wildmoser , himself a munich original , is an adamant supporter of the association for the protection of the munich white sausage .
the group has filed a copyright application with the patent office , saying that calling sausages produced beyond munich county borders amounted to defrauding consumers . the association has received the backing of munich mayor christian ude as well as other politicians .
“ the white sausage belongs to munich like no other food and that ’ s why we think it ’ s our duty to protect it from abuse , ” said helmut schmid , the leader of the social democrats in the city ’ s parliament . other bavarians make good sausage , too it ’ s a sentiment shared by the trade association of bavarian butchers , which has also filed a copyright application trying to patent the sausage ’ s original recipe .
unlike the munich-centric sausage supporters , this group believes that butchers south of the so-called “ white sausage equator , ” which roughly corresponds to the course of bavaria 's portion of the danube river , can also craft excellent products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a butcher in a restaurant on munich 's st. mary 's square allegedly created the weißwurst in 1857 .
“ we believe that a quality munich white sausage can also be made in old bavaria and swabia , not just munich itself , ” georg schlagbauer , himself a munich butcher , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , adding that it shouldn ’ t be geography but rather sausage ingredients that matter . in his opinion , the other side was simply trying to secure its market share , he added .
“ munich ’ s largest white sausage producer is part of the group , ” schlagbauer told the agence france presse news service .
“ there is a financial motivation behind this patriotism . ” following nuremberg ’ s and dresden ’ s lead ? patent office officials will likely take several months to decide on the issue , according to a spokesperson .
they can rely on a survey commissioned by the bavarian ministry of agriculture , in which 48 percent of germans believed munich white sausage came from the city and its surrounding areas .
should the patent office decide in favor of one of the applications , the german ministry of justice and the european commission still have to sign off on them . similar protection of local delicacies has already been approved in the past : nuremberg ’ s bratwurst has to come from the city .
dresdner stollen , a popular christmas bread , must be made in that eastern german city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner siegert with his book on white sausages .
“ what ’ s happening now in munich is pretty much the same , ” werner siegert -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has written a book on the etiquette rules of white sausage , told dw-world .
he believes stagnating sausage sales at munich ’ s restaurants , where the weisswurst and a beer have been a traditional mid-morning snack , had provoked the campaign .
“ i think people should rely on marketing and not on the legal system , however , ” siegert said , adding that he ’ s working on a collection of short stories on leaflets restaurants could hand out to their customers to bridge the five to eight minutes it takes to serve the perfect weisswurst . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more many of the tourists who travel to bavaria 's bustling capital city never make it past the hofbräuhaus tent at oktoberfest .

the release of millions of royal air force world war ii reconnaissance photos , including aerial shots of auschwitz , has drawn criticism from those wondering why the allies did n't act sooner to stop the nazi genocide . the photos show a massive cloud of smoke created by the burning of thousands of corpses at auschwitz .
they show images of the " d-day " allied landing on the beaches of normandy so rich in detail that you can recognize the bodies of american gis .
they show the city of cologne in rubble after months of heavy british bombing .
and with their release this week , the british aerial reconnaissance archives at keele university have again raised painful memories and questions about the war .
who knew what and when ?
and why did n't anyone take action sooner to stop the nazi atrocities ?
on monday , britain 's keele university released more than 5 million royal air force aerial reconnaissance photos on a special web site .
for decades , the photos were available only to researchers and unknown to the broader public .
but now , indexed and searchable online to anyone , the images provide viewers with entirely new perspectives of the most bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the bridge at arnhem , the netherlands horrific and dramatic events of world war ii .
the most historically important images on the site are shots from auschwitz taken in august 1944 , d-day shots taken in june of the same year and images of the german battleship bismarck , which the germans kept hidden in a norwegian fjord for five days in may 1941 until the british forces sank it .
" these images allow us to see the real war at first hand , " project head allan william said . "
i was really moved by the photographs of the nazi concentration camps and the d-day landings .
it 's like a live action replay . "
images anger some but the shocking auschwitz images have also raised serious questions amongst critics about the actions of the allies during the war and why they did n't move to stop the gassings sooner by bombing the rail lines into the camps .
writing in britain ’ s guardian newspaper , journalist john ezard lamented : " you can view ‘ as though in a time machine ’ a 3d photograph which could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives had it been publicized when it was taken at 11 a.m. on august 23 , 1944 , at a time when hungarian jews were being murdered below . "
the photo was taken by an raf pilot aboard a reconnaissance plane over poland at a time when the germans , aware their days were numbered , had massively increased the amount of killing at auschwitz .
the detail is so clear in one photo that you can even see two columns of prisoners lining up for roll call at the concentration camp .
here in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday published a story under the headline " why weren ’ t the concentration camp thugs bombed ? "
the newspaper quoted german historian hans-ulrich wheler , a guest professor at harvard university , saying that london became aware , at the latest , of the nazi ’ s death camps in 1943 .
information on the web site of the united states holocaust memorial , which serves more or less as the official american historical authority , appears to backup wehler 's claim .
it notes that " in 1943 , polish courier jan karski informed president franklin d. roosevelt of reports of mass murder received from jewish leaders in the warsaw ghetto .
no immediate executive action was taken . "
by the autumn of 1944 , the museum claims , the allies knew of the gassings at auschwitz .
" why therefore were the extermination camps not destroyed after the reconnaissance planes of the britons and americans photographed them in such detail , " bild asked ?
" at the very least , the railway tracks on which the jews were transported into the extermination camp ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial shot of the beaches of normandy during d-day the archive ’ s caretaker , williams , said the spies took the photos in rapid-succession , like machine gun fire and that it was possible , given the sheer volume of photos , that they were never given the scrutiny they deserved .
" it is a fascinating issue as to why the photo operators did not know what was going on , " williams said .
" i think the answer is that their orders were to look single-mindedly for military data .
they did not have time to think what else was happening .

are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?
speculation is growing that the once top-flight team is preparing to sell some of its best players to come up with some cash . long plagued by poor results on the pitch and money problems in the boardroom , the once mighty borussia appears these day to be limping like a dying wildebeest , being shadowed by hyenas behind and vultures above . in an efforts to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion is ready to initiate a fire sale to cash in its best assets .

" i 've known about chelsea 's interest for eight or nine days , " the midfielder recently admitted when questioned by reporters .
" it is now down to the clubs to see what happens , but if i were borussia i would not refuse the offer . " rosicky , the current dortmund captain and integral free-flowing cog in the czech machinery at the heart of the team , is valued at around € 14.8 million but would likely cost fc chelsea much more than that , given the player ’ s rising stock and his current agreement with the german team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosicky joined the bundesliga side from sparta prague in 2001 , and is under contract with them until 2008 .
a majority of the inflated price would go on paying compensation to the club for the loss of a contracted player . dortmund looking for profit on sale gerd niebaum , borussia ’ s president , on tuesday said dortmund did not have an offer for rosicky on the table and he refused to comment on the reports .
but for a club in dortmund ’ s position - this season alone it faces an estimated € 25 million loss - a rival club offering to pay the asking price of € 30 million for a player that cost almost half that three years ago would present the former german title holders with an offer perhaps too alluring to refuse . such a deal would be difficult for the debt-laden club to ignore after losing out on the estimated € 12 million financial windfall in champions league revenue .
the club ’ s misery was made complete when they were unceremoniously dumped out of the uefa cup by french side sochaux , losing 6-2 on aggregate . over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was also looking into borrow around € 100 million euros by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .

tomas rosicky may be headed to the english premiership .
are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?
speculation is growing that the once top-flight team is preparing to sell some of its best players to come up with some cash . long plagued by poor results on the pitch and money problems in the boardroom , the once mighty borussia appears these day to be limping like a dying wildebeest , being shadowed by hyenas behind and vultures above . in an efforts to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion is ready to initiate a fire sale to cash in its best assets .
comments from czech star midfielder tomas rosicky stoked speculation he was on the verge of leaving borussia dortmund , with a decision coming perhaps as early as this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea 's roman abramovich .
first in the queue of eager shoppers outside the gates of the westfalen stadium is russian billionaire and fc chelsea chairman roman abramovich .
the man who has bankrolled the so-called chelski revolution in the english premier league appears to have an insatiable appetite for the world ’ s best players and the deep pockets to match .
the london club is reported prepared to pay upwards of € 30 million -lrb- $ 37.1 million -rrb- for rosicky . player fuels rumors rosicky has been doing little to dampen the russian 's ardor .
" i 've known about chelsea 's interest for eight or nine days , " the midfielder recently admitted when questioned by reporters .
" it is now down to the clubs to see what happens , but if i were borussia i would not refuse the offer . " rosicky , the current dortmund captain and integral free-flowing cog in the czech machinery at the heart of the team , is valued at around € 14.8 million but would likely cost fc chelsea much more than that , given the player ’ s rising stock and his current agreement with the german team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosicky joined the bundesliga side from sparta prague in 2001 , and is under contract with them until 2008 .
a majority of the inflated price would go on paying compensation to the club for the loss of a contracted player . dortmund looking for profit on sale gerd niebaum , borussia ’ s president , on tuesday said dortmund did not have an offer for rosicky on the table and he refused to comment on the reports .
but for a club in dortmund ’ s position - this season alone it faces an estimated € 25 million loss - a rival club offering to pay the asking price of € 30 million for a player that cost almost half that three years ago would present the former german title holders with an offer perhaps too alluring to refuse . such a deal would be difficult for the debt-laden club to ignore after losing out on the estimated € 12 million financial windfall in champions league revenue .
the club ’ s misery was made complete when they were unceremoniously dumped out of the uefa cup by french side sochaux , losing 6-2 on aggregate . over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was also looking into borrow around € 100 million euros by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . top stars to be sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon of borussia dortmund , right , leaves the field under a pouring rain after his uefa cup , second round , second leg soccer match against sochaux , thursday , nov .

in november , the finance ministers on the european council effectively suspended the stability pact in order to prevent the commission from imposing stiff penalties on france and germany .
the move prompted solbes ' suit at the luxembourg high court .
in his consultations with the so-called euro group , which includes the finance ministers of all 12 euro zone countries , solbes once again repeated his grounds for the unprecedented lawsuit .
but solbes was met with frosty resistance .
' little support ' " there was little support among the ministers for the commission ’ s decision to seek a ruling from the european court of justice , " said irish finance minister charlie mccreevy .
austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who in the past has sided with solbes , rejected the commission ’ s suit .
even if the commission were to win it ’ s case , he said , nothing would change because it wouldn ’ t have any way of making sure the judgement was enforced .
on the other hand , " if the commission loses , " grasser said , " it could create the impression that germany and france acted properly , which certainly isn ’ t the case .
in our opinion , it ’ s a misguided deficit policy that ’ s certainly damaging for growth and employment .
in that regard , we ’ ve fought side by side with the commission and for that reason i regret that the commission is now sending out a false political signal instead of increasing the political pressure on germany and france to continue with their -lrb- budget -rrb- consolidation . "
this year , germany and france will breach the budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product established in the stability and growth pact for the third year in a row .
but german finance minister hans eichel said monday he still found solbes ’ decision to sue to be " incomprehensible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel speaking at the meeting , he said : " because the economy is doing better , the mood is , in general , good .
i don ’ t think there ’ s anything else to say really . "
despite the refusal of the council to accept his decision to sue , solbes on monday seemed unmoved .
" first , i don ’ t feel attacked , " he said .
" second , i have acted consistently with my position , which is that the pact that was agreed to must be respected . "
germany 's eichel , meanwhile , also rejected solbes ’ plan to call for changes to the stability pact next month .
the new regulations would force member states to adhere to more disciplined budgets during periods of economic upswings .
concern over weak dollar in a separate area of discussion monday , the ministers also broached the issue of the euro ’ s high exchange rate against the dollar .
" in the present circumstances , we ’ ve stressed stability and we ’ re concerned about excessive exchange rate moves , " the ministers said in a statement .
" we will continue to monitor the situation very closely and conduct policies supporting economic recovery in a stable macroeconomic environment . "
the european finance ministers are also seeking to develop a common position for their g7 meeting with the united states in florida early next month .
several finance experts as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , have expressed concern about the weakness of the dollar – even though the dollar appeared to recover against the euro slightly during the past week .
another point of contention between the european commission and the finance ministers is a call by the commission to increase the eu ’ s budget by 1.24 percent of gross domestic product after 2007 .
germany and five other eu net payers have rejected the proposal , which would require them to pay billions more to brussels .
german finance minister eichel has said he would like to cap the eu budget at 1 percent of gross domestic product , which would create an overall budget of about € 100 billion . berndt riegert -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission budget plan likely to irk member states the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money .

in november , the finance ministers on the european council effectively suspended the stability pact in order to prevent the commission from imposing stiff penalties on france and germany .
the move prompted solbes ' suit at the luxembourg high court .
in his consultations with the so-called euro group , which includes the finance ministers of all 12 euro zone countries , solbes once again repeated his grounds for the unprecedented lawsuit .
but solbes was met with frosty resistance .
' little support ' " there was little support among the ministers for the commission ’ s decision to seek a ruling from the european court of justice , " said irish finance minister charlie mccreevy .
austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , who in the past has sided with solbes , rejected the commission ’ s suit .
even if the commission were to win it ’ s case , he said , nothing would change because it wouldn ’ t have any way of making sure the judgement was enforced .
on the other hand , " if the commission loses , " grasser said , " it could create the impression that germany and france acted properly , which certainly isn ’ t the case .
in our opinion , it ’ s a misguided deficit policy that ’ s certainly damaging for growth and employment .
in that regard , we ’ ve fought side by side with the commission and for that reason i regret that the commission is now sending out a false political signal instead of increasing the political pressure on germany and france to continue with their -lrb- budget -rrb- consolidation . "
this year , germany and france will breach the budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product established in the stability and growth pact for the third year in a row .
but german finance minister hans eichel said monday he still found solbes ’ decision to sue to be " incomprehensible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel speaking at the meeting , he said : " because the economy is doing better , the mood is , in general , good .
i don ’ t think there ’ s anything else to say really . "
despite the refusal of the council to accept his decision to sue , solbes on monday seemed unmoved .
" first , i don ’ t feel attacked , " he said .
" second , i have acted consistently with my position , which is that the pact that was agreed to must be respected . "
germany 's eichel , meanwhile , also rejected solbes ’ plan to call for changes to the stability pact next month .
the new regulations would force member states to adhere to more disciplined budgets during periods of economic upswings .
concern over weak dollar in a separate area of discussion monday , the ministers also broached the issue of the euro ’ s high exchange rate against the dollar .
" in the present circumstances , we ’ ve stressed stability and we ’ re concerned about excessive exchange rate moves , " the ministers said in a statement .
" we will continue to monitor the situation very closely and conduct policies supporting economic recovery in a stable macroeconomic environment . "
the european finance ministers are also seeking to develop a common position for their g7 meeting with the united states in florida early next month .
several finance experts as well as the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , have expressed concern about the weakness of the dollar – even though the dollar appeared to recover against the euro slightly during the past week .
another point of contention between the european commission and the finance ministers is a call by the commission to increase the eu ’ s budget by 1.24 percent of gross domestic product after 2007 .
germany and five other eu net payers have rejected the proposal , which would require them to pay billions more to brussels .
german finance minister eichel has said he would like to cap the eu budget at 1 percent of gross domestic product , which would create an overall budget of about € 100 billion . berndt riegert -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission budget plan likely to irk member states the european union 's executive branch is revving up for another round of head-butting with member states over budget spending , as brussels goes calling for more money .

spotlessly german ?
think again will the real modern talking please stand up ? hood vs. helmet garden gnome 's best friend goes sporty culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.01.2004 bavarian sausage wars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides agree that sweet mustard 's a must .
butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality . with two patent applications before the german patent office , signature drives and even a report by the bavarian ministry of agriculture on the issue , the munich sausage controversy has reached boiling point , something that should never happen to the water in which the mushy specialty is heated to perfection . but that ’ s beside the point for a group of munich mass-production butchers and restaurateurs , who are trying to secure exclusive rights to produce “ munich white sausages . ” they claim that only the city ’ s butchers can produce edible versions of the delicacy , and as evidence they claim that some of their bavarian competitors substitute cheaper pork for the sausage ’ s signature veal base . munich by name , munich by origin karl-heinz wildmoser , who runs a beer tent at oktoberfest and serves as president of munich ’ s tsv 1860 soccer club , said he ’ s had to suffer through sausage ordeals during games away from home .
“ we ’ re often treated to white sausages by other clubs - that ’ s a nice gesture , but sometimes they ’ re gruesome , ” wildmoser recently told münchner merkur newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo for the association for the protection of the white sausage includes a drawing of the twin tower of munich 's cathedral , the city 's landmark .
wildmoser , himself a munich original , is an adamant supporter of the association for the protection of the munich white sausage .
the group has filed a copyright application with the patent office , saying that calling sausages produced beyond munich county borders amounted to defrauding consumers . the association has received the backing of munich mayor christian ude as well as other politicians .
“ the white sausage belongs to munich like no other food and that ’ s why we think it ’ s our duty to protect it from abuse , ” said helmut schmid , the leader of the social democrats in the city ’ s parliament . other bavarians make good sausage , too it ’ s a sentiment shared by the trade association of bavarian butchers , which has also filed a copyright application trying to patent the sausage ’ s original recipe .

think again will the real modern talking please stand up ? hood vs. helmet garden gnome 's best friend goes sporty culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.01.2004 bavarian sausage wars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides agree that sweet mustard 's a must .
butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality . with two patent applications before the german patent office , signature drives and even a report by the bavarian ministry of agriculture on the issue , the munich sausage controversy has reached boiling point , something that should never happen to the water in which the mushy specialty is heated to perfection . but that ’ s beside the point for a group of munich mass-production butchers and restaurateurs , who are trying to secure exclusive rights to produce “ munich white sausages . ” they claim that only the city ’ s butchers can produce edible versions of the delicacy , and as evidence they claim that some of their bavarian competitors substitute cheaper pork for the sausage ’ s signature veal base . munich by name , munich by origin karl-heinz wildmoser , who runs a beer tent at oktoberfest and serves as president of munich ’ s tsv 1860 soccer club , said he ’ s had to suffer through sausage ordeals during games away from home .
“ we ’ re often treated to white sausages by other clubs - that ’ s a nice gesture , but sometimes they ’ re gruesome , ” wildmoser recently told münchner merkur newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo for the association for the protection of the white sausage includes a drawing of the twin tower of munich 's cathedral , the city 's landmark .
wildmoser , himself a munich original , is an adamant supporter of the association for the protection of the munich white sausage .
the group has filed a copyright application with the patent office , saying that calling sausages produced beyond munich county borders amounted to defrauding consumers . the association has received the backing of munich mayor christian ude as well as other politicians .
“ the white sausage belongs to munich like no other food and that ’ s why we think it ’ s our duty to protect it from abuse , ” said helmut schmid , the leader of the social democrats in the city ’ s parliament . other bavarians make good sausage , too it ’ s a sentiment shared by the trade association of bavarian butchers , which has also filed a copyright application trying to patent the sausage ’ s original recipe .
unlike the munich-centric sausage supporters , this group believes that butchers south of the so-called “ white sausage equator , ” which roughly corresponds to the course of bavaria 's portion of the danube river , can also craft excellent products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a butcher in a restaurant on munich 's st. mary 's square allegedly created the weißwurst in 1857 .
“ we believe that a quality munich white sausage can also be made in old bavaria and swabia , not just munich itself , ” georg schlagbauer , himself a munich butcher , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , adding that it shouldn ’ t be geography but rather sausage ingredients that matter . in his opinion , the other side was simply trying to secure its market share , he added .
“ munich ’ s largest white sausage producer is part of the group , ” schlagbauer told the agence france presse news service .
“ there is a financial motivation behind this patriotism . ” following nuremberg ’ s and dresden ’ s lead ? patent office officials will likely take several months to decide on the issue , according to a spokesperson .
they can rely on a survey commissioned by the bavarian ministry of agriculture , in which 48 percent of germans believed munich white sausage came from the city and its surrounding areas .
should the patent office decide in favor of one of the applications , the german ministry of justice and the european commission still have to sign off on them . similar protection of local delicacies has already been approved in the past : nuremberg ’ s bratwurst has to come from the city .
dresdner stollen , a popular christmas bread , must be made in that eastern german city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner siegert with his book on white sausages .
“ what ’ s happening now in munich is pretty much the same , ” werner siegert -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has written a book on the etiquette rules of white sausage , told dw-world .
he believes stagnating sausage sales at munich ’ s restaurants , where the weisswurst and a beer have been a traditional mid-morning snack , had provoked the campaign .
“ i think people should rely on marketing and not on the legal system , however , ” siegert said , adding that he ’ s working on a collection of short stories on leaflets restaurants could hand out to their customers to bridge the five to eight minutes it takes to serve the perfect weisswurst . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more many of the tourists who travel to bavaria 's bustling capital city never make it past the hofbräuhaus tent at oktoberfest .
but a world-class culture , shopping and nightlife beckon beyond the wiesn .

the release of millions of royal air force world war ii reconnaissance photos , including aerial shots of auschwitz , has drawn criticism from those wondering why the allies did n't act sooner to stop the nazi genocide . the photos show a massive cloud of smoke created by the burning of thousands of corpses at auschwitz .
they show images of the " d-day " allied landing on the beaches of normandy so rich in detail that you can recognize the bodies of american gis .
they show the city of cologne in rubble after months of heavy british bombing .
and with their release this week , the british aerial reconnaissance archives at keele university have again raised painful memories and questions about the war .
who knew what and when ?
and why did n't anyone take action sooner to stop the nazi atrocities ?
on monday , britain 's keele university released more than 5 million royal air force aerial reconnaissance photos on a special web site .
for decades , the photos were available only to researchers and unknown to the broader public .
but now , indexed and searchable online to anyone , the images provide viewers with entirely new perspectives of the most bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the bridge at arnhem , the netherlands horrific and dramatic events of world war ii .
the most historically important images on the site are shots from auschwitz taken in august 1944 , d-day shots taken in june of the same year and images of the german battleship bismarck , which the germans kept hidden in a norwegian fjord for five days in may 1941 until the british forces sank it .
" these images allow us to see the real war at first hand , " project head allan william said . "
i was really moved by the photographs of the nazi concentration camps and the d-day landings .
it 's like a live action replay . "
images anger some but the shocking auschwitz images have also raised serious questions amongst critics about the actions of the allies during the war and why they did n't move to stop the gassings sooner by bombing the rail lines into the camps .
writing in britain ’ s guardian newspaper , journalist john ezard lamented : " you can view ‘ as though in a time machine ’ a 3d photograph which could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives had it been publicized when it was taken at 11 a.m. on august 23 , 1944 , at a time when hungarian jews were being murdered below . "
the photo was taken by an raf pilot aboard a reconnaissance plane over poland at a time when the germans , aware their days were numbered , had massively increased the amount of killing at auschwitz .
the detail is so clear in one photo that you can even see two columns of prisoners lining up for roll call at the concentration camp .
here in germany , the mass-circulation bild newspaper on monday published a story under the headline " why weren ’ t the concentration camp thugs bombed ? "
the newspaper quoted german historian hans-ulrich wheler , a guest professor at harvard university , saying that london became aware , at the latest , of the nazi ’ s death camps in 1943 .
information on the web site of the united states holocaust memorial , which serves more or less as the official american historical authority , appears to backup wehler 's claim .
it notes that " in 1943 , polish courier jan karski informed president franklin d. roosevelt of reports of mass murder received from jewish leaders in the warsaw ghetto .
no immediate executive action was taken . "
by the autumn of 1944 , the museum claims , the allies knew of the gassings at auschwitz .
" why therefore were the extermination camps not destroyed after the reconnaissance planes of the britons and americans photographed them in such detail , " bild asked ?
" at the very least , the railway tracks on which the jews were transported into the extermination camp ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial shot of the beaches of normandy during d-day the archive ’ s caretaker , williams , said the spies took the photos in rapid-succession , like machine gun fire and that it was possible , given the sheer volume of photos , that they were never given the scrutiny they deserved .
" it is a fascinating issue as to why the photo operators did not know what was going on , " williams said .

information on the web site of the united states holocaust memorial , which serves more or less as the official american historical authority , appears to backup wehler 's claim .
it notes that " in 1943 , polish courier jan karski informed president franklin d. roosevelt of reports of mass murder received from jewish leaders in the warsaw ghetto .
no immediate executive action was taken . "
by the autumn of 1944 , the museum claims , the allies knew of the gassings at auschwitz .
" why therefore were the extermination camps not destroyed after the reconnaissance planes of the britons and americans photographed them in such detail , " bild asked ?
" at the very least , the railway tracks on which the jews were transported into the extermination camp ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aerial shot of the beaches of normandy during d-day the archive ’ s caretaker , williams , said the spies took the photos in rapid-succession , like machine gun fire and that it was possible , given the sheer volume of photos , that they were never given the scrutiny they deserved .
" it is a fascinating issue as to why the photo operators did not know what was going on , " williams said .
" i think the answer is that their orders were to look single-mindedly for military data .
they did not have time to think what else was happening .

butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality . with two patent applications before the german patent office , signature drives and even a report by the bavarian ministry of agriculture on the issue , the munich sausage controversy has reached boiling point , something that should never happen to the water in which the mushy specialty is heated to perfection . but that ’ s beside the point for a group of munich mass-production butchers and restaurateurs , who are trying to secure exclusive rights to produce “ munich white sausages . ” they claim that only the city ’ s butchers can produce edible versions of the delicacy , and as evidence they claim that some of their bavarian competitors substitute cheaper pork for the sausage ’ s signature veal base . munich by name , munich by origin karl-heinz wildmoser , who runs a beer tent at oktoberfest and serves as president of munich ’ s tsv 1860 soccer club , said he ’ s had to suffer through sausage ordeals during games away from home .
“ we ’ re often treated to white sausages by other clubs - that ’ s a nice gesture , but sometimes they ’ re gruesome , ” wildmoser recently told münchner merkur newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo for the association for the protection of the white sausage includes a drawing of the twin tower of munich 's cathedral , the city 's landmark .
wildmoser , himself a munich original , is an adamant supporter of the association for the protection of the munich white sausage .
the group has filed a copyright application with the patent office , saying that calling sausages produced beyond munich county borders amounted to defrauding consumers . the association has received the backing of munich mayor christian ude as well as other politicians .
“ the white sausage belongs to munich like no other food and that ’ s why we think it ’ s our duty to protect it from abuse , ” said helmut schmid , the leader of the social democrats in the city ’ s parliament . other bavarians make good sausage , too it ’ s a sentiment shared by the trade association of bavarian butchers , which has also filed a copyright application trying to patent the sausage ’ s original recipe .
unlike the munich-centric sausage supporters , this group believes that butchers south of the so-called “ white sausage equator , ” which roughly corresponds to the course of bavaria 's portion of the danube river , can also craft excellent products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a butcher in a restaurant on munich 's st. mary 's square allegedly created the weißwurst in 1857 .
“ we believe that a quality munich white sausage can also be made in old bavaria and swabia , not just munich itself , ” georg schlagbauer , himself a munich butcher , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , adding that it shouldn ’ t be geography but rather sausage ingredients that matter . in his opinion , the other side was simply trying to secure its market share , he added .
“ munich ’ s largest white sausage producer is part of the group , ” schlagbauer told the agence france presse news service .
“ there is a financial motivation behind this patriotism . ” following nuremberg ’ s and dresden ’ s lead ? patent office officials will likely take several months to decide on the issue , according to a spokesperson .
they can rely on a survey commissioned by the bavarian ministry of agriculture , in which 48 percent of germans believed munich white sausage came from the city and its surrounding areas .
should the patent office decide in favor of one of the applications , the german ministry of justice and the european commission still have to sign off on them . similar protection of local delicacies has already been approved in the past : nuremberg ’ s bratwurst has to come from the city .
dresdner stollen , a popular christmas bread , must be made in that eastern german city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner siegert with his book on white sausages .
“ what ’ s happening now in munich is pretty much the same , ” werner siegert -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has written a book on the etiquette rules of white sausage , told dw-world .
he believes stagnating sausage sales at munich ’ s restaurants , where the weisswurst and a beer have been a traditional mid-morning snack , had provoked the campaign .
“ i think people should rely on marketing and not on the legal system , however , ” siegert said , adding that he ’ s working on a collection of short stories on leaflets restaurants could hand out to their customers to bridge the five to eight minutes it takes to serve the perfect weisswurst . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more many of the tourists who travel to bavaria 's bustling capital city never make it past the hofbräuhaus tent at oktoberfest .

more than 20 trade ministers reportedly plan to meet at the sidelines to find ways to kick-start global trade talks .
the meeting of 2,100 business people , politicians and campaigners that starts on wednesday is an event at which to network and to discuss global issues .
but anti-globalisation protesters are expected to demonstrate on saturday .
talking about trouble " partnering for prosperity and security " is this year 's theme for the world economic forum -lrb- wef -rrb- , and it is probably more an expression of hope than a description of fact .
security is tight around meeting venues the forum 's five-day agenda is a reflection of all the world 's troubles : the aftermath of the iraq war ; the war on terror ; the shaky recovery in the global economy ; transatlantic tensions over trade and security ; global warming ; corporate governance and many others .
debating the issues will be company bosses like michael dell , bill gates , cisco 's john chambers , sony 's noguyuki idei and sir martin sorrell of advertising giant wpp .
un secretary general kofi annan , us attorney general john ashcroft , iraq administrator paul bremer , presidents like pakistan 's pervez musharraf and nigeria 's olusegun obasanjo and former us president bill clinton are among the politicians coming to davos .
campaigners come from organisations as diverse as the world wide fund for nature , poverty action group oxfam and the african women 's development fund .
dollar trouble despite the media glare , davos is also an opportunity for the powerful to meet in private .
across switzerland , anti-wef protesters have clashed with police us commerce secretary donald evans , european central bank president jean-claude trichet , and wolfgang clement and heizo takenaka - the economy ministers of germany and japan respectively - are expected to discuss the sharp decline of the us dollar over the past year .
and one of the sessions in davos will discuss " what if the dollar fell by an additional 20 % " , although none of the government officials is scheduled to speak at the event .
trade talks one fringe meeting that officials say is certain to happen in davos is a get-together of more than 20 trade and economy ministers .
they want to discuss how to revive the so-called doha negotiations on global trade .
a swiss government spokesman told news agency agence france presse that ministers would " analyse the situation , why it has been gridlocked , and -lsb- debate -rsb- how the process can be moved forward in the coming months " .
they hope , he said , to restart official global trade negotiations in hong kong later this year .
protests in store critics of the wef , however , argue that the davos get-together can not not provide a solution to the world 's dilemmas as most of its participants are part of the problem .
more than 100,000 people have come to bombay , attending the world social forum , which was set up to rival the wef .
they have drafted resolutions against us policy in iraq and elsewhere , and lambasted organisations like the world bank and international monetary fund , which they describe as " an efficient tool to prevent any local social or economic development " .
christine gent of oxfam told delegates that " to overcome poverty we must have free international trade rules ; at the moment the rules are not fair " .
back in davos , police have imposed strict security around the conference centre .

more than 20 trade ministers reportedly plan to meet at the sidelines to find ways to kick-start global trade talks .
the meeting of 2,100 business people , politicians and campaigners that starts on wednesday is an event at which to network and to discuss global issues .
but anti-globalisation protesters are expected to demonstrate on saturday .
talking about trouble " partnering for prosperity and security " is this year 's theme for the world economic forum -lrb- wef -rrb- , and it is probably more an expression of hope than a description of fact .
security is tight around meeting venues the forum 's five-day agenda is a reflection of all the world 's troubles : the aftermath of the iraq war ; the war on terror ; the shaky recovery in the global economy ; transatlantic tensions over trade and security ; global warming ; corporate governance and many others .
debating the issues will be company bosses like michael dell , bill gates , cisco 's john chambers , sony 's noguyuki idei and sir martin sorrell of advertising giant wpp .
un secretary general kofi annan , us attorney general john ashcroft , iraq administrator paul bremer , presidents like pakistan 's pervez musharraf and nigeria 's olusegun obasanjo and former us president bill clinton are among the politicians coming to davos .
campaigners come from organisations as diverse as the world wide fund for nature , poverty action group oxfam and the african women 's development fund .
dollar trouble despite the media glare , davos is also an opportunity for the powerful to meet in private .
across switzerland , anti-wef protesters have clashed with police us commerce secretary donald evans , european central bank president jean-claude trichet , and wolfgang clement and heizo takenaka - the economy ministers of germany and japan respectively - are expected to discuss the sharp decline of the us dollar over the past year .
and one of the sessions in davos will discuss " what if the dollar fell by an additional 20 % " , although none of the government officials is scheduled to speak at the event .
trade talks one fringe meeting that officials say is certain to happen in davos is a get-together of more than 20 trade and economy ministers .
they want to discuss how to revive the so-called doha negotiations on global trade .
a swiss government spokesman told news agency agence france presse that ministers would " analyse the situation , why it has been gridlocked , and -lsb- debate -rsb- how the process can be moved forward in the coming months " .
they hope , he said , to restart official global trade negotiations in hong kong later this year .
protests in store critics of the wef , however , argue that the davos get-together can not not provide a solution to the world 's dilemmas as most of its participants are part of the problem .
more than 100,000 people have come to bombay , attending the world social forum , which was set up to rival the wef .
they have drafted resolutions against us policy in iraq and elsewhere , and lambasted organisations like the world bank and international monetary fund , which they describe as " an efficient tool to prevent any local social or economic development " .
christine gent of oxfam told delegates that " to overcome poverty we must have free international trade rules ; at the moment the rules are not fair " .
back in davos , police have imposed strict security around the conference centre .
anti-globalisation activists have already clashed with police in several cities across switzerland .

the electoral reform society -lrb- ers -rrb- warned the extremist party could in future win control of the council - despite only attracting minority support .
the society said it won six seats in 12 wards last year , despite attracting just a third of the votes .
" in burnley there is a strong case for proportional representation , " said the society 's chief ken ritchie .
he added that it was not just the bnp that was benefitting from the current system .
he explained : " it happens all over the country to other parties too . "
in a report to be published later on tuesday , the ers sought to identify reasons why people voted for the bnp .
it also looked at how people in lancashire would vote differently if alternative electoral systems were in use .

carlsberg breweries said it would pay 38 euros per holsten share , a total of 522.5m euros -lrb- $ 648m ; £ 362.6m -rrb- , as well as taking on holsten 's debts .
carlsberg said the purchase would make it the biggest brewer in northern germany and it would move its german headquarters to hamburg .
rumours of a takeover have pushed up holsten shares by 40 % this year ; they ended monday at 34.50 euros .
brand expansion carlsberg said it has already won the support of several major holsten shareholders for its bid , giving it control of 51 % of holsten .
but it said it wants the backing of 75 % of the shareholders to close the deal , which is subject to regulatory approval .
carlsberg said buying holsten would help its strategic goal of building its brands , particularly the carlsberg brand .
it said holsten was a " well-invested , highly efficient company " , with a strong distribution network in germany , europe 's biggest beer market , through which to expand sales of the carlsberg and tuborg beer brands .
carlsberg said it expects the takeover will produce cost savings of 7m euros in 2004 , 14m euros in 2005 and 17m euros in 2006 .
it added that it has reached binding agreements that would allow holsten to sell its mineral water companies and two breweries to the bitburger group , off-loading assets worth 628m euros .
after that , carlsberg breweries reckons the cost of buying holsten would stack up to 437m euros including covering the german firm 's debts .
the retained parts of the holsten business had 2002 sales of 506m euros and core earnings of 48m euros , carlsberg said .

the bank of japan -lrb- boj -rrb- surprised financial markets with the move .
japan 's government has insisted it will do everything possible to prevent the falling dollar from harming exports .
japanese interest rates are already effectively zero ; instead the boj increased a key cash target for the first time since october 2003 .
the boj eased monetary policy by increasing the target for the amount of cash it keeps on deposit overnight by a 3 trillion yen at the top end of the range .
the boj set a new target of between 30 trillion yen -lrb- $ 280bn -rrb- to 35 trillion yen -lrb- $ 326bn -rrb- from an upper limit of 32 trillion previously .
the yen weakened against the dollar after the boj 's move .
the dollar was trading at 107.12 yen at 0800 gmt .
japanese stocks have been rising since the start of the year as investors take a rosier view of the economy 's prospects .
the nikkei touched a three-month high on tuesday , though it later dropped slightly to close at 11,103 points .

the key question is what makes us what we are : nature or nurture but the 12 foreigners who take up an offer from an albury fertility clinic for an all expenses paid round-trip in exchange for sperm donations must not wander too far afield nor overly exert themselves in any capacity - they will be expected to perform every two days for two weeks .
the clinic , which advertised for donors in canada , said it was forced to do so after failing to find enough australians willing to donate .
sperm donations have apparently dried up in the state of new south wales as a result of an imminent change of law which will entitle all donor offspring to discover the identity of their donor parent when they are older .
the 12 who accept the au $ 7,000 -lrb- £ 3,000 -rrb- package will not be exempt from this legislation .
they will be required to hand over all the identifying details needed along with their samples in march , and be prepared in the future to field inquisitive phone calls , emails and letters from the offspring they have produced .
people have told me that it does n't matter .
like i should pretend that my dad was my genetic father .
like all my dad 's blood relations are my blood relations .
i do n't think that they understand that they are my family but not in the same way as they are their own family - i am the odd man out karen donor conceived the uk is widely expected to announce this week that future donor offspring will be given the right to identifying information about their biological parent , bringing the country into line with other european union states such as sweden and austria .
the prospect prompts fears that sperm donors - often students interested in a little extra cash - will vanish , but the british authority which regulates assisted reproduction believes that the right of a donor conceived child to know its genetic heritage outweighs the need to maintain the number of donors .
identity crisis the existing research does indeed suggest that many of those conceived through donor insemination experience identity problems , which are exacerbated by their inability to find out anything about their genetic parent .
a foray into the international community of donor offspring produced a number of tragic tales .
karen is a 37-year-old mother of two who lives in new york .
it was in the heat of a row with her mother - shortly after the man she then believed to be her real father had died - that she found out she was donor conceived .
karen says she had long sensed that " something was not right " and that her parents were concealing something from her .
after she was told she sought in vain for her genetic parent , who had been a doctor in the mid-1960s .
like many of those who join donor conception support groups , her inability to find her father has been a source of deep disquiet in her life .
donor insemination is such a simple process , but it 's a gift - and one we should cherish dan cohn-sherbok donor conceived " people have told me that it does n't matter .
like i should pretend that my dad was my genetic father .
like all my dad 's blood relations are my blood relations .
i do n't think that they understand that they are my family but not in the same way as they are their own family .
i am the odd man out , " she says .
karen does not just want anonymity lifted .
she says she would like to see donor insemination banned outright .
" parenting is not a right , it is a privilege .
if a couple ca n't conceive , they should n't .
i love my life but if my parents could have asked me whether or not they should conceive using a donor , i would tell them the same thing .
after all , what 's wrong with non-existence ? "
but such identity issues are not inevitable : rabbi dan cohn-sherbok , for example , a donor conceived professor at the university of wales , has yet to experience the kind of malaise that has plagued karen 's life .
" i 've always known who i am , and for that reason i 've never really had any interest in trying to find my genetic father , " he says .
" it 's not that i do n't understand the quest - it 's just that for my part , i feel complete . "
" i think anonymity is crucial if we are going to maintain the number of donors .
donor insemination is such a simple process , but it 's a gift - and one we should cherish . "
best policy however much donor offspring differ on anonymity and the need to find the donor , there is widespread agreement that honesty about the circumstances of their conception is crucial .
donors in quotes it would not bother me at all if in about 20 years time a child of mine wanted to contact me and meet up i definitely do n't want children tracking me down in the future because i 'm a biological dad to them " parents should be honest with their children from the start , " says helen , who discovered she was donor conceived when she was 20 .
" it 's the lying that hurts , not the truth . "
ironically sweden 's experience with transparency has , at least in some cases , had the opposite of the desired effect .
legislation banning anonymous donations was introduced in 1985 : interviews with parents who have used donor insemination since suggest that many have not told their children they were donor conceived for fear that they will find their genetic parent .
" but that does n't mean it was the wrong thing to do , " says dr claes gottlieb , who carried out the research .
" it will take time before full transparency is achieved , but i honestly believe that the best way to avoid identity issues is for children to be fully informed . "
dr gottlieb , who heads a fertility clinic in stockholm , also stresses that banning anonymity has not had a long term impact on the number of donors , which are back at their pre-1985 levels .
nonetheless , sperm is in short supply in sweden , pushing infertile couples abroad - often to neighbouring denmark , a country whose males donate more sperm than any other and one which is home to the world 's largest sperm bank - cryos international .
" anonymity is key , " says ole schou , cryos founder and chief executive .
" if you removed that , we would n't have the donors we have . "
nature or nurture ?
there is little doubt that - at least in the short term - donations will go down in the uk if anonymity is banned , although it is hoped that in the long-term they will pick up .
" i 'm going to have to think hard about it , " says steve , who is reviewing a decision to donate .
" my gut feeling is that offspring should have the right to know .
if i decided not to donate that would be my choice - and i think the kids should have a choice too as to whether they want to find the genetic parent or not . "
but beyond the issue of rights - the right of the child to know , the right of the couple to conceive , the right of the donor to remain anonymous - is a broader issue .
at the heart of the anonymity debate is the question of what makes us what we are - whether we are made or born .
" i wonder if it 's right that we put so much store in our genetic origins , " says steve .
" i tend to think we are what we are through nurture , rather than nature .
would i really be a father to the resulting children if i did donate ?
not in the way it matters . "

identity crisis the existing research does indeed suggest that many of those conceived through donor insemination experience identity problems , which are exacerbated by their inability to find out anything about their genetic parent .
a foray into the international community of donor offspring produced a number of tragic tales .
karen is a 37-year-old mother of two who lives in new york .
it was in the heat of a row with her mother - shortly after the man she then believed to be her real father had died - that she found out she was donor conceived .
karen says she had long sensed that " something was not right " and that her parents were concealing something from her .
after she was told she sought in vain for her genetic parent , who had been a doctor in the mid-1960s .
like many of those who join donor conception support groups , her inability to find her father has been a source of deep disquiet in her life .

karen does not just want anonymity lifted .
she says she would like to see donor insemination banned outright .
" parenting is not a right , it is a privilege .
if a couple ca n't conceive , they should n't .
i love my life but if my parents could have asked me whether or not they should conceive using a donor , i would tell them the same thing .
after all , what 's wrong with non-existence ? "
but such identity issues are not inevitable : rabbi dan cohn-sherbok , for example , a donor conceived professor at the university of wales , has yet to experience the kind of malaise that has plagued karen 's life .
" i 've always known who i am , and for that reason i 've never really had any interest in trying to find my genetic father , " he says .
" it 's not that i do n't understand the quest - it 's just that for my part , i feel complete . "
" i think anonymity is crucial if we are going to maintain the number of donors .

best policy however much donor offspring differ on anonymity and the need to find the donor , there is widespread agreement that honesty about the circumstances of their conception is crucial .

" it 's the lying that hurts , not the truth . "
ironically sweden 's experience with transparency has , at least in some cases , had the opposite of the desired effect .
legislation banning anonymous donations was introduced in 1985 : interviews with parents who have used donor insemination since suggest that many have not told their children they were donor conceived for fear that they will find their genetic parent .
" but that does n't mean it was the wrong thing to do , " says dr claes gottlieb , who carried out the research .
" it will take time before full transparency is achieved , but i honestly believe that the best way to avoid identity issues is for children to be fully informed . "
dr gottlieb , who heads a fertility clinic in stockholm , also stresses that banning anonymity has not had a long term impact on the number of donors , which are back at their pre-1985 levels .
nonetheless , sperm is in short supply in sweden , pushing infertile couples abroad - often to neighbouring denmark , a country whose males donate more sperm than any other and one which is home to the world 's largest sperm bank - cryos international .
" anonymity is key , " says ole schou , cryos founder and chief executive .
" if you removed that , we would n't have the donors we have . "
nature or nurture ?
there is little doubt that - at least in the short term - donations will go down in the uk if anonymity is banned , although it is hoped that in the long-term they will pick up .
" i 'm going to have to think hard about it , " says steve , who is reviewing a decision to donate .
" my gut feeling is that offspring should have the right to know .
if i decided not to donate that would be my choice - and i think the kids should have a choice too as to whether they want to find the genetic parent or not . "
but beyond the issue of rights - the right of the child to know , the right of the couple to conceive , the right of the donor to remain anonymous - is a broader issue .
at the heart of the anonymity debate is the question of what makes us what we are - whether we are made or born .
" i wonder if it 's right that we put so much store in our genetic origins , " says steve .
" i tend to think we are what we are through nurture , rather than nature .
would i really be a father to the resulting children if i did donate ?

at the heart of the anonymity debate is the question of what makes us what we are - whether we are made or born .

but the 12 foreigners who take up an offer from an albury fertility clinic for an all expenses paid round-trip in exchange for sperm donations must not wander too far afield nor overly exert themselves in any capacity - they will be expected to perform every two days for two weeks .
the clinic , which advertised for donors in canada , said it was forced to do so after failing to find enough australians willing to donate .
sperm donations have apparently dried up in the state of new south wales as a result of an imminent change of law which will entitle all donor offspring to discover the identity of their donor parent when they are older .
the 12 who accept the au $ 7,000 -lrb- £ 3,000 -rrb- package will not be exempt from this legislation .
they will be required to hand over all the identifying details needed along with their samples in march , and be prepared in the future to field inquisitive phone calls , emails and letters from the offspring they have produced . "
people have told me that it does n't matter .
like i should pretend that my dad was my genetic father .
like all my dad 's blood relations are my blood relations .
i do n't think that they understand that they are my family but not in the same way as they are their own family - i am the odd man out " karen donor conceived the uk is widely expected to announce this week that future donor offspring will be given the right to identifying information about their biological parent , bringing the country into line with other european union states such as sweden and austria .
the prospect prompts fears that sperm donors - often students interested in a little extra cash - will vanish , but the british authority which regulates assisted reproduction believes that the right of a donor conceived child to know its genetic heritage outweighs the need to maintain the number of donors .
identity crisis the existing research does indeed suggest that many of those conceived through donor insemination experience identity problems , which are exacerbated by their inability to find out anything about their genetic parent .
a foray into the international community of donor offspring produced a number of tragic tales .
karen is a 37-year-old mother of two who lives in new york .
it was in the heat of a row with her mother - shortly after the man she then believed to be her real father had died - that she found out she was donor conceived .
karen says she had long sensed that " something was not right " and that her parents were concealing something from her .
after she was told she sought in vain for her genetic parent , who had been a doctor in the mid-1960s .
like many of those who join donor conception support groups , her inability to find her father has been a source of deep disquiet in her life . "
donor insemination is such a simple process , but it 's a gift - and one we should cherish " dan cohn-sherbok donor conceived " people have told me that it does n't matter .
like i should pretend that my dad was my genetic father .
like all my dad 's blood relations are my blood relations .
i do n't think that they understand that they are my family but not in the same way as they are their own family .
i am the odd man out , " she says .
karen does not just want anonymity lifted .
she says she would like to see donor insemination banned outright .
" parenting is not a right , it is a privilege .
if a couple ca n't conceive , they should n't .
i love my life but if my parents could have asked me whether or not they should conceive using a donor , i would tell them the same thing .
after all , what 's wrong with non-existence ? "
but such identity issues are not inevitable : rabbi dan cohn-sherbok , for example , a donor conceived professor at the university of wales , has yet to experience the kind of malaise that has plagued karen 's life .
" i 've always known who i am , and for that reason i 've never really had any interest in trying to find my genetic father , " he says .
" it 's not that i do n't understand the quest - it 's just that for my part , i feel complete . "
" i think anonymity is crucial if we are going to maintain the number of donors .
donor insemination is such a simple process , but it 's a gift - and one we should cherish . "
best policy however much donor offspring differ on anonymity and the need to find the donor , there is widespread agreement that honesty about the circumstances of their conception is crucial .
donors in quotes " it would not bother me at all if in about 20 years time a child of mine wanted to contact me and meet up " " i definitely do n't want children tracking me down in the future because i 'm a biological dad to them " " parents should be honest with their children from the start , " says helen , who discovered she was donor conceived when she was 20 .

the networks are being used to control thousands of innocent pcs that some virus programs have infected .
the tactic is being used because peer-to-peer networks are hard to disrupt , making viruses using this technique hard to stop spreading .
security experts say peer-to-peer networks are likely to become more and more popular with virus writers .
evolving threat one of the first viruses to set up a peer-to-peer network to help it spread was the slapper worm that was aimed at the linux operating system .
it 's always been an arms race in the battle between virus writers and anti-virus companies pete simpson , clearswift a windows virus called sinit appeared in late 2003 that turned every machine infected by the malicious program into a member of a peer-to-peer network .
it was expected that sinit 's creator would issue commands to infected computers via this network .
" it 's always been an arms race in the battle between virus writers and anti-virus companies , " said pete simpson of mail filtering firm clearswift .
" sinit represents a new and daunting challenge to anti-virus companies . "
there are many different ways to organise machines into peer-to-peer networks but most avoid having one central computer , or server , controlling all machines involved .
instead , each machine shares the burden of organising the system and each member lets others know the information that it holds .
the most well-known peer-to-peer networks , such as kazaa , are used by many people to find and share music , videos and other types of files .
bot nets in the past some creators of trojan programs , that open up a backdoor into an infected pc , have used net chat channels as a way to issue commands .
many people use peer-to-peer networks to swap music and movies often thousands of computers were enrolled in these remote controlled networks that have been dubbed " ' bot nets " .
finding and shutting down the chat channels would effectively cut a virus writer off from his network of slave machines .
but shutting down a distributed network would be much more difficult because no one machine is in charge .
it also is much more difficult to trace where commands were being inserted and find the network 's controller .
kevin hogan , head of symantec security response , said the good news about peer-to-peer virus networks was that they were rare .
" it 's a little bit trickier to do than just having the trojan point to a single server , " he said .
he said many peer-to-peer networks were often not very efficient at passing commands between member machines .
also many swap data via rarely used ports that most firewalls routinely block .
" i think it will become more prevalent , " he said .
" it 's an evolution rather than a revolution in bot nets . "

evolving threat one of the first viruses to set up a peer-to-peer network to help it spread was the slapper worm that was aimed at the linux operating system .
it 's always been an arms race in the battle between virus writers and anti-virus companies pete simpson , clearswift a windows virus called sinit appeared in late 2003 that turned every machine infected by the malicious program into a member of a peer-to-peer network .
it was expected that sinit 's creator would issue commands to infected computers via this network .
" it 's always been an arms race in the battle between virus writers and anti-virus companies , " said pete simpson of mail filtering firm clearswift .
" sinit represents a new and daunting challenge to anti-virus companies . "
there are many different ways to organise machines into peer-to-peer networks but most avoid having one central computer , or server , controlling all machines involved .
instead , each machine shares the burden of organising the system and each member lets others know the information that it holds .
the most well-known peer-to-peer networks , such as kazaa , are used by many people to find and share music , videos and other types of files .
bot nets in the past some creators of trojan programs , that open up a backdoor into an infected pc , have used net chat channels as a way to issue commands .
many people use peer-to-peer networks to swap music and movies often thousands of computers were enrolled in these remote controlled networks that have been dubbed " ' bot nets " .
finding and shutting down the chat channels would effectively cut a virus writer off from his network of slave machines .
but shutting down a distributed network would be much more difficult because no one machine is in charge .
it also is much more difficult to trace where commands were being inserted and find the network 's controller .
kevin hogan , head of symantec security response , said the good news about peer-to-peer virus networks was that they were rare .
" it 's a little bit trickier to do than just having the trojan point to a single server , " he said .
he said many peer-to-peer networks were often not very efficient at passing commands between member machines .
also many swap data via rarely used ports that most firewalls routinely block .
" i think it will become more prevalent , " he said .
" it 's an evolution rather than a revolution in bot nets . "

in a controversial move , the airport will now be known as nottingham east midlands airport .
this is despite the airport lying in leicestershire and the nearest major city being derby .
airport managers have been under pressure to change the name because the term east midlands is considered too vague and not recognised overseas .
one derby mp has already crticised the move for undermining attempts to give the east midlands a stronger identity .
the airport is located at castle donington in leicestershire but has a derbyshire postcode and is listed by the air transport association as being in nottingham .
time and time and time again , nottingham was the name that came up graham keddie , airport managing director notts view : have your say on the name leics view : vote or send us a comment each city had worried that it might suffer if the airport is named after one of the others .
managing director graham keddie made the announcement on tuesday , emphasising the decision came after long deliberations .
he said that exhaustive research had shown nottingham had by far the highest international profile of any east midlands city .
he added : " nottingham is the only city in the region that is widely known .
we conducted months of research , including talking to passengers from overseas .
" time and time and time again , nottingham was the name that came up .
" i 'm afraid leicester and derby just did n't register .
" maybe it 's the hollywood effect and the myth of robin hood , or perhaps it is because nottingham is the biggest city we have in terms of size . "
the mp for derby north , bob laxton , described the name change as ' daft ' and ' confusing ' .
regional rivalry east midlands split over the decision he felt the move it would undermine the work that has been carried out to ensure people further afield do know the position of the east midlands .
he said : " one of the things a number of people and organisations have been trying to do is get some identity for the east midlands .
" this is hardly going to help .
i just think the whole thing is daft . "
budget airline bmibaby , based at the airport , had campaigned for a change and had already used robin hood in its advertising .
airport staff said the change would take effect immediately but it could be a little while before passengers began to see this .
meanwhile , nottingham airport , a far smaller general aviation airport based at tollerton , says it will seek legal advice about whether ema can use the word " nottingham " .
air traffic operator at nottingham airport , dave tower , said " aviators could become confused about who to call and what radio frequencies to use " .
this concern was dismissed by a spokeswoman from east midlands airport .

in a controversial move , the airport will now be known as nottingham east midlands airport .
this is despite the airport lying in leicestershire and the nearest major city being derby .
airport managers have been under pressure to change the name because the term east midlands is considered too vague and not recognised overseas .
one derby mp has already crticised the move for undermining attempts to give the east midlands a stronger identity .
the airport is located at castle donington in leicestershire but has a derbyshire postcode and is listed by the air transport association as being in nottingham .
time and time and time again , nottingham was the name that came up graham keddie , airport managing director notts view : have your say on the name leics view : vote or send us a comment each city had worried that it might suffer if the airport is named after one of the others .
managing director graham keddie made the announcement on tuesday , emphasising the decision came after long deliberations .
he said that exhaustive research had shown nottingham had by far the highest international profile of any east midlands city .
he added : " nottingham is the only city in the region that is widely known .
we conducted months of research , including talking to passengers from overseas .
" time and time and time again , nottingham was the name that came up .
" i 'm afraid leicester and derby just did n't register .
" maybe it 's the hollywood effect and the myth of robin hood , or perhaps it is because nottingham is the biggest city we have in terms of size . "
the mp for derby north , bob laxton , described the name change as ' daft ' and ' confusing ' .
regional rivalry east midlands split over the decision he felt the move it would undermine the work that has been carried out to ensure people further afield do know the position of the east midlands .
he said : " one of the things a number of people and organisations have been trying to do is get some identity for the east midlands .
" this is hardly going to help .
i just think the whole thing is daft . "
budget airline bmibaby , based at the airport , had campaigned for a change and had already used robin hood in its advertising .
airport staff said the change would take effect immediately but it could be a little while before passengers began to see this .
meanwhile , nottingham airport , a far smaller general aviation airport based at tollerton , says it will seek legal advice about whether ema can use the word " nottingham " .
air traffic operator at nottingham airport , dave tower , said " aviators could become confused about who to call and what radio frequencies to use " .
this concern was dismissed by a spokeswoman from east midlands airport .
