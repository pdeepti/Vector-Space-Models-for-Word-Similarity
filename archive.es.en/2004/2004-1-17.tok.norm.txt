program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.01.2004 germany 's immigration law remains on drafting table großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition politicians want a law that discourages immigration .
germany 's parliamentarians met on friday to continue negotiating what could become the country 's first immigration law .
the chances of reaching compromise on the touchy subject are slim . for the past three months , a bipartisan group of 20 parliamentarians has gathered to hammer out a compromise on one of germany 's most divisive and pressing issues . on friday , the group of immigration specialists took stock of their negotiations and discussed whether to continue what has until now been a fruitless debate on fashioning a new law . germany 's conservative christian democrats want to avoid the prospect of bringing in more immigrants at a time when 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrat-green coalition government , citing the country 's low birth rate and need for qualified workers , wants to set up a point system that would match prospective immigrants to german industry 's need for certain employees . out with the old , in with the old the positions are well-established , being the same ones used when the bundestag passed the country 's first law in march 2002 to heavy protest by opposition politicians .
that law was struck down by germany 's highest court a month before it was to take effect on jan .
1 , 2003 because the way in which it passed the country 's upper house of parliament was ruled illegal . with the old law legally dead , the coalition government dusted off the draft and tried pushing it through parliament again where it landed in the hands of the working group .
missing this time is the heated rhetoric calling for a stop to all immigration that gave rise to infamous slogans like " children , not indians , " a conservative criticism of government policy to recruite high-tech workers from india . immigration actually down , call for cool heads germany 's immigration commissioner said friday she hoped negotiaters would stay calm .
a new report by her office shows that the number of immigrants to germany continues to drop .
compared to the 843,000 that immigrated last year , 623,000 left the country , according to marieluise beck . " we are not only an immigration country , we 're also an emigration country , " beck said in announcing the report .
" there is no need for an exciteable discussion on immigration . " underscoring the coalition government 's push for more qualified workers was another report from the institute for employment research that shows 15 percent of west german firms are reporting a major lack of qualified workers . need for university graduates will rise report author elmar hönekopp added that the need for highly-educated immigrants will continue to increase in the future , while the need for low-skilled workers will decrease .
both the cdu and the coalition seem to agree that germany needs more qualified workers .
but spd and green politicians want a broad system assigning points to each immigrant applicant based on their desirability for the german economy .
the cdu would prefer to review each applicant on a case-by-case basis , cdu domestic affairs parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach told german radio .
bosbach said the point system did n't show " proof of a job " before welcoming incoming immigrants . the discussion is expected to continue over the next few months until the law is again brought up before parliament .
interior minister otto schily said he is optimistic about securing a deal before the summer break . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans consider u.s. experience in immigration debate as german government and opposition officials meet on friday in an attempt to reach a compromise on proposals for a new immigration law , some say germany should look to the u.s. immigration experience for guidance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.01.2004 germany 's immigration law remains on drafting table großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition politicians want a law that discourages immigration .
germany 's parliamentarians met on friday to continue negotiating what could become the country 's first immigration law .
the chances of reaching compromise on the touchy subject are slim . for the past three months , a bipartisan group of 20 parliamentarians has gathered to hammer out a compromise on one of germany 's most divisive and pressing issues . on friday , the group of immigration specialists took stock of their negotiations and discussed whether to continue what has until now been a fruitless debate on fashioning a new law . germany 's conservative christian democrats want to avoid the prospect of bringing in more immigrants at a time when 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrat-green coalition government , citing the country 's low birth rate and need for qualified workers , wants to set up a point system that would match prospective immigrants to german industry 's need for certain employees . out with the old , in with the old the positions are well-established , being the same ones used when the bundestag passed the country 's first law in march 2002 to heavy protest by opposition politicians .
that law was struck down by germany 's highest court a month before it was to take effect on jan .
1 , 2003 because the way in which it passed the country 's upper house of parliament was ruled illegal . with the old law legally dead , the coalition government dusted off the draft and tried pushing it through parliament again where it landed in the hands of the working group .
missing this time is the heated rhetoric calling for a stop to all immigration that gave rise to infamous slogans like " children , not indians , " a conservative criticism of government policy to recruite high-tech workers from india . immigration actually down , call for cool heads germany 's immigration commissioner said friday she hoped negotiaters would stay calm .
a new report by her office shows that the number of immigrants to germany continues to drop .
compared to the 843,000 that immigrated last year , 623,000 left the country , according to marieluise beck . " we are not only an immigration country , we 're also an emigration country , " beck said in announcing the report .
" there is no need for an exciteable discussion on immigration . " underscoring the coalition government 's push for more qualified workers was another report from the institute for employment research that shows 15 percent of west german firms are reporting a major lack of qualified workers . need for university graduates will rise report author elmar hönekopp added that the need for highly-educated immigrants will continue to increase in the future , while the need for low-skilled workers will decrease .
both the cdu and the coalition seem to agree that germany needs more qualified workers .
but spd and green politicians want a broad system assigning points to each immigrant applicant based on their desirability for the german economy .
the cdu would prefer to review each applicant on a case-by-case basis , cdu domestic affairs parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach told german radio .
bosbach said the point system did n't show " proof of a job " before welcoming incoming immigrants . the discussion is expected to continue over the next few months until the law is again brought up before parliament .
interior minister otto schily said he is optimistic about securing a deal before the summer break . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans consider u.s. experience in immigration debate as german government and opposition officials meet on friday in an attempt to reach a compromise on proposals for a new immigration law , some say germany should look to the u.s. immigration experience for guidance .

the chances of reaching compromise on the touchy subject are slim . for the past three months , a bipartisan group of 20 parliamentarians has gathered to hammer out a compromise on one of germany 's most divisive and pressing issues . on friday , the group of immigration specialists took stock of their negotiations and discussed whether to continue what has until now been a fruitless debate on fashioning a new law . germany 's conservative christian democrats want to avoid the prospect of bringing in more immigrants at a time when 4.5 million germans are unemployed .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrat-green coalition government , citing the country 's low birth rate and need for qualified workers , wants to set up a point system that would match prospective immigrants to german industry 's need for certain employees . out with the old , in with the old the positions are well-established , being the same ones used when the bundestag passed the country 's first law in march 2002 to heavy protest by opposition politicians .
that law was struck down by germany 's highest court a month before it was to take effect on jan .
1 , 2003 because the way in which it passed the country 's upper house of parliament was ruled illegal . with the old law legally dead , the coalition government dusted off the draft and tried pushing it through parliament again where it landed in the hands of the working group .
missing this time is the heated rhetoric calling for a stop to all immigration that gave rise to infamous slogans like " children , not indians , " a conservative criticism of government policy to recruite high-tech workers from india . immigration actually down , call for cool heads germany 's immigration commissioner said friday she hoped negotiaters would stay calm .
a new report by her office shows that the number of immigrants to germany continues to drop .
compared to the 843,000 that immigrated last year , 623,000 left the country , according to marieluise beck . " we are not only an immigration country , we 're also an emigration country , " beck said in announcing the report .
" there is no need for an exciteable discussion on immigration . " underscoring the coalition government 's push for more qualified workers was another report from the institute for employment research that shows 15 percent of west german firms are reporting a major lack of qualified workers . need for university graduates will rise report author elmar hönekopp added that the need for highly-educated immigrants will continue to increase in the future , while the need for low-skilled workers will decrease .
both the cdu and the coalition seem to agree that germany needs more qualified workers .
but spd and green politicians want a broad system assigning points to each immigrant applicant based on their desirability for the german economy .
the cdu would prefer to review each applicant on a case-by-case basis , cdu domestic affairs parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach told german radio .
bosbach said the point system did n't show " proof of a job " before welcoming incoming immigrants . the discussion is expected to continue over the next few months until the law is again brought up before parliament .
interior minister otto schily said he is optimistic about securing a deal before the summer break . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans consider u.s. experience in immigration debate as german government and opposition officials meet on friday in an attempt to reach a compromise on proposals for a new immigration law , some say germany should look to the u.s. immigration experience for guidance .

the exhibition includes a cross-section of memorabilia , film and documents about the momentous change which emigration brought to people 's lives .

the exhibition has a variety of historical treasures the diary of michael d. jones -lrb- 1822 - 1898 -rrb- who was the inspiration behind the great venture to form a homeland where welsh would be the official language , free of the anglican church , forms part of the display .
other exhibits related to patagonia include the boarding ticket of the reverend abraham matthews of aberdare for the mimosa , the ship which sailed out of liverpool in 1865 with the first pioneers , and the original diary of the mimosa crossing by joseph seth jones , a print-worker from denbigh .

smoking in public places has been banned in new york the banning of smoking in public places in wales moved a step closer on friday .
measures to ban the practice throughout the country were backed by the house of lords after a bill which would let the welsh assembly put an end to it for good received an unopposed second reading .
sponsored by baroness finlay of llandaff , she said it was a skeleton bill " to allow the national assembly of wales to ban smoking of tobacco by any person in a public place in wales . "
" the power includes discretion for the assembly to make regulations applying different provisions for different purposes for different cases , " she added .
so should people be given the right to breathe clean air - or does this symbolise the end of our right to choose ?
this have your say is now closed - read a selection of the replies we received below .
smoking should be restricted to private premises - passive smoking is harmful to all involved .
wales should lead the way in the uk .
j.c. williams , dhahran , saudi arabia being a non smoker , i realise the dangers caused by smoking .
but , i remain uncertain about a ban .
a ban would make a nonsense of our rights to opt for the lifestyle we want , unhealthy though it might be , and could create a kind of " big brother " mentality where freedom is restricted .
surely there must be a middle way which would give all some degree of flexibility ? martin jenkins , fishguard , pembs .
yes , ban it !
smoking should be pushed into obscurity .
the addicts will never agree to it .
but , in the end it 's for their own good , and everyone elses !
rob sinistral , cardiff , s. glam i do n't feel too strongly about it either way , but taxes on tobacco are considerable source of revenue for the government -lrb- no , it is not nearly offset by the cost of medical treatment for smoking related diseases .
if cigarette sales start to sag , expect a tax increase in other products .
probably alchohol .
johnny williams , malta we are not allowed to burn piles of leaves in our gardens .
how come people can burn leaves in their mouths ?
brian messent , neath public places such as theatres and cinemas already exercise a virtual total ban and other places such as restaurants and pubs have no smoking areas so why is further legislation necessary ?
mavis griffiths , gilwern , monmouthshire i recall a time not so long ago when smoking was allowed in the work-place , in the cinema , on aircraft , buses and trains .
it did n't cause mass disruption then when there was a ban , so why now ?
i very much resent the enjoyment of my meal being ruined by both the ignorant and inconsiderate smoker and also the resterauntuer who packs tables close together and does n't have the courage to ask people to resist sparking up for a couple of hours !
smokers - do n't you dare hark on about infringement of civil liberties when your habit impacts upon those who have to work amongst the fog .
clare , swansea yes ! ! ! !
it should be banned .
i 'm fed up of not feeling comfortable when out .
i 'm fed up of smelly hair and clothes .
i 'm fed up of people making decisions for me regarding my health - i 'm being force fed smoke everywhere .
i want to enjoy my future and smell the roses ! ! ! ! !
jayne , newport , south wales oh please , will the idiotic ' ban smoking ' lobby just stop making an issue out of nothing .
i do n't smoke , but if it bothers me to breathe in other people 's smoke , which sometimes it does , then that 's my problem .
if it bothers you then it 's your problem .
get a life and stop messing with other people 's .
freedom of choice .
let 's stop becoming a second america .
if i see 2 old men smoking pipes and drinking whiskey over a game of chess in a scottish pub i 'd hate to have to call them criminals for it .
if you think they should be then you have serious issues .
all those fanatics who want to ' follow usa 's lead ' just go on and move to new york .
you 'll be at home there .
do n't try and tell me they have it right .
cigarettes illegal but guns legal !
what a dumb joke !
i suppose you would have had winston churchill behind bars , and unable to run for prime minister because of his criminal record for lighting a cigar .
i 'd much rather see whinging , interfering busy-bodies be banned from public places .
they do more damage to this society than smokers .
nima , london so i said to the smoker , " the residue of your habit is that acrid smoke , which you blow around with a generous and carefree attitude .
the residue of my habit , drinking , is wet and warm . would you mind if i used your generous and carefree attitude to share some of it with you ? " - no comment from the smoker .
yes , it should definitely be banned .
graham boon , houston & efail isaf we are not allowed to burn piles of leaves in our gardens .
how come people can burn leaves in their mouths ?
brian messent , neath , uk .
i think smoking should be banned because it does n't do good to the youngsters and the lungs .
nicholas , uk yes , ban it in all public places .
i do n't need scientific proof that passive smoking is harmful .
i feel it doing its damage to me every time i find myself in a smoky atmosphere .
no-one will convince me that passive smoking is not harmful .
for me , it means coughing fits , streaming eyes , a blocked nose , itchy skin , a blinding headache and a sore throat , all of which come on within minutes of being in a smoky environment .
how can something which has this effect be risk-free ?
smokers , if want to kill yourselves , fine - just do n't try and take me with you .
sian , swansea , wales it is not fair for anyone to inhale such a foul cancer-causing smell if they are a non smoker .
non smokers have the right to be able to inhale clean air .
smokers have the right to smoke outside or in their own homes .
maggie , aberystwyth , ceredigion i am a smoker and i wish i could give up but i have struggled , and tried many times but i ca n't .
do n't people realise that it is an addiction and it is not easy to give up .
the people who work in pubs and complain about customers smoking should not have taken a job in a pub in the first place .
alchohol is dangerous to your health and well-being - are they going to ban that aswell. what happened to choice ?
i am a smoker who does think of others and will not smoke around non smokers or where i am not suposed to but let me have that choice ! nic.m. , swansea , wales san francisco has banned smoking for many years , not only in public buildings , but also in bars -lrb- pubs -rrb- .
there was a lot of controversy at first , but everyone accepts it now .
even smokers have reported that they like the smoke-free environment .
business has not suffered , and folks like me can now frequent places that previously existed in a haze of smelly pollution .
good luck , wales ! ! ! !
kirk thomas , san francisco usa i think smoking should be banned because it does n't do good to the youngsters and the lungs .
also it 's higly addictive nicholas , u.k. london ban smoking in public ?
how about banning the use of motor vehicles because they pollute ?
while we 're at it , let 's also ban outdoor barbeques and any facility that burns fossil fuel !
marilyn , usa in 10yrs time , will we look back on this argument as we now look back on the seatbelt argument ?
if only 20 % of the population smoke why are there so few non smoking pubs ?
gary , swansea i guess that some of the people wanting to ban smoking are also people who drive stinking diesel powered cars to go to the shops or go on holiday by plane using thousands of gallons of fuel which then pollutes the atmosphere for all of us .
mike o 'shea , copenhagen , denmark i spend four months of most years in north wales .
it is such a wonderful place , however , the smoking in dining establishments is very difficult for me .
in canada smoking has been banned for quite some time and people say they really enjoy eating out .
it would be so good to have smoking banned in restaurants and pubs , plus other public places .
nita booth , newfoundland , canada smoking is recognised as a practise that leads to serious health problems and probably premature death.there 's many times more people affected and killed each year by the effects of smoking as there are by guns , drug abuse , drink driving and other such events that we have deemed socially unacceptable .
the pro-choice arguement for allowing smoking in public flawed : if only the primary user was affected , that 's fine but all the evidence suggests that second hand smoke is equally lethal and other second-hand smokers are equally affected .
so why are we even debating this ?
here we have a practise that kills the user and the people around them so why are we wasting lives when the answer is staring us in the face ?
brian , vancouver , canada ban smoking in public ?
how about banning the use of motor vehicles because they pollute ?
while we 're at it , let 's also ban outdoor barbeques and any facility that burns fossil fuel !
let 's ban alcohol !
let 's all become a big-brother society ! ! ! !
marilyn , oklahoma city , usa yes .
yes .
and thrice yes !
i am fed up of having to enter into clouds of filthy acrid smoke left by people in front of me .
why should i have to breathe in the filthy cancer -idden smoke left by others as i merely walk along a street ?
also there is the litter and legal side of things .
i see so many drivers flick their butts out of the window to end up as more detritus on the side of the road !
and you can not use a mobile phone at the wheel or eat at the wheel so why smoke ?
ban it !
michael j pope , newport , wales i think that smoking should be banned even though business will struggle , it is the right thing to do !
mark sawallich , portland , or i would be interested to know if the north american bans have changed the smoking habits of the us and canadian drinkers .
has it just been a ban for the benefit of the non smokers or have the smokers found it easier to pack it in without being surrounded by other drinkers lighting up ?
mac , wilthsire uk why should smokers be allowed to blow poisonous smoke in my direction ?
if i had the money i 'd open a non-smoking pub .
dave , pontypridd having a smoking section in a pub is like having a urination section in a swimming pool .
farris , barry , uk how exactly would it be enforced ?
people smoke everywhere now regardless of other peoples views or wishes .
the number of times i 've got the bus home only to have a few drunken idiots smoking all over it .
it 's not always safe to ask them to stop .
john kelly , cardiff , wales there is actually no reputable evidence that second hand smoke causes serious illness .
most of the claims are based on a single us study that is not mathematically credible .
if we base legislation on belief we are obviously heading down a road of persecution and suppression of freedom .
peter tabord , caernarfon , gwynedd you smoke , i choke .
it gives you cancer so stop it .
billy , wales , uk smoking in public places has been banned here for several years .
all restaurants and pubs , etc. are smoke free .
everyone complies because pub , etc. owners receive hefty fines if they do not enforce the ban .
business has not fallen off as a result .
i never go to bed and breakfasts , pubs or restaurants that allow smoking when i am in wales or other parts of the uk .
a smoke free place will get my business every time .
b. ballard , victoria canada why should smokers be allowed to blow poisonous smoke in my direction ?
if i had the money i 'd open a non-smoking pub .
dave , pontypridd i applaud the idea of completely banning smoking in all public places .
the majority of smokers are very inconsiderate towards others around them .
there is nothing that i do that effects the health and well-being of those around me in the way that breathing in other peoples smoke does to me .
the right to chose ?
i would like to exercise my right to chose to remain smoke free .
unfortunately , i do not know of many pubs and bars that will afford me this right - so i guess i will just have to suffer along with the rest of the majority of the population - the non-smokers !
julia , cardiff , wales smoking should be banned everywhere in and outside cordell jones , swansea wales here in ontario canada , smoking is banned in all public places including bars , restaurants , theatres , and workplaces .

if you ban smoking then your pub profits will go down by about 40 per cent overnight ! ! !
pubs will close and so on , it 's your decision whether you want pubs or not .
i certainly do .
nick r , uk for years smokers have n't given a damn about the rights of non-smokers to breathe clean air .
north america is rapidly becoming smoke free in public with all the whines about restriction of freedom and lack of choice .
the truth is that most businesses do very well after a smoking ban as non-smokers outnumber smokers 3:1 the biggest bonus is the health of employees who are forced to inhale for 6-8 hours per shift .
diane , edmonton , canada i feel sorry for those people who work in pubs , bars , hotels etc. who are constantly breathing secondary smoke .

smoking in public places has been banned in new york the banning of smoking in public places in wales moved a step closer on friday .
measures to ban the practice throughout the country were backed by the house of lords after a bill which would let the welsh assembly put an end to it for good received an unopposed second reading .
sponsored by baroness finlay of llandaff , she said it was a skeleton bill " to allow the national assembly of wales to ban smoking of tobacco by any person in a public place in wales . "
" the power includes discretion for the assembly to make regulations applying different provisions for different purposes for different cases , " she added .
so should people be given the right to breathe clean air - or does this symbolise the end of our right to choose ?
this have your say is now closed - read a selection of the replies we received below .
smoking should be restricted to private premises - passive smoking is harmful to all involved .
wales should lead the way in the uk .
j.c. williams , dhahran , saudi arabia being a non smoker , i realise the dangers caused by smoking .
but , i remain uncertain about a ban .
a ban would make a nonsense of our rights to opt for the lifestyle we want , unhealthy though it might be , and could create a kind of " big brother " mentality where freedom is restricted .
surely there must be a middle way which would give all some degree of flexibility ? martin jenkins , fishguard , pembs .
yes , ban it !
smoking should be pushed into obscurity .
the addicts will never agree to it .
but , in the end it 's for their own good , and everyone elses !
rob sinistral , cardiff , s. glam i do n't feel too strongly about it either way , but taxes on tobacco are considerable source of revenue for the government -lrb- no , it is not nearly offset by the cost of medical treatment for smoking related diseases .
if cigarette sales start to sag , expect a tax increase in other products .
probably alchohol .
johnny williams , malta we are not allowed to burn piles of leaves in our gardens .
how come people can burn leaves in their mouths ?
brian messent , neath public places such as theatres and cinemas already exercise a virtual total ban and other places such as restaurants and pubs have no smoking areas so why is further legislation necessary ?
mavis griffiths , gilwern , monmouthshire i recall a time not so long ago when smoking was allowed in the work-place , in the cinema , on aircraft , buses and trains .
it did n't cause mass disruption then when there was a ban , so why now ?
i very much resent the enjoyment of my meal being ruined by both the ignorant and inconsiderate smoker and also the resterauntuer who packs tables close together and does n't have the courage to ask people to resist sparking up for a couple of hours !
smokers - do n't you dare hark on about infringement of civil liberties when your habit impacts upon those who have to work amongst the fog .
clare , swansea yes ! ! ! !
it should be banned .
i 'm fed up of not feeling comfortable when out .
i 'm fed up of smelly hair and clothes .
i 'm fed up of people making decisions for me regarding my health - i 'm being force fed smoke everywhere .
i want to enjoy my future and smell the roses ! ! ! ! !

a ban would make a nonsense of our rights to opt for the lifestyle we want , unhealthy though it might be , and could create a kind of " big brother " mentality where freedom is restricted .
surely there must be a middle way which would give all some degree of flexibility ? martin jenkins , fishguard , pembs .
yes , ban it !
smoking should be pushed into obscurity .
the addicts will never agree to it .
but , in the end it 's for their own good , and everyone elses !
rob sinistral , cardiff , s. glam i do n't feel too strongly about it either way , but taxes on tobacco are considerable source of revenue for the government -lrb- no , it is not nearly offset by the cost of medical treatment for smoking related diseases .
if cigarette sales start to sag , expect a tax increase in other products .
probably alchohol .
johnny williams , malta we are not allowed to burn piles of leaves in our gardens .
how come people can burn leaves in their mouths ?
brian messent , neath public places such as theatres and cinemas already exercise a virtual total ban and other places such as restaurants and pubs have no smoking areas so why is further legislation necessary ?
mavis griffiths , gilwern , monmouthshire i recall a time not so long ago when smoking was allowed in the work-place , in the cinema , on aircraft , buses and trains .
it did n't cause mass disruption then when there was a ban , so why now ?
i very much resent the enjoyment of my meal being ruined by both the ignorant and inconsiderate smoker and also the resterauntuer who packs tables close together and does n't have the courage to ask people to resist sparking up for a couple of hours !
smokers - do n't you dare hark on about infringement of civil liberties when your habit impacts upon those who have to work amongst the fog .
clare , swansea yes ! ! ! !
it should be banned .
i 'm fed up of not feeling comfortable when out .
i 'm fed up of smelly hair and clothes .
i 'm fed up of people making decisions for me regarding my health - i 'm being force fed smoke everywhere .
i want to enjoy my future and smell the roses ! ! ! ! !
jayne , newport , south wales oh please , will the idiotic ' ban smoking ' lobby just stop making an issue out of nothing .
i do n't smoke , but if it bothers me to breathe in other people 's smoke , which sometimes it does , then that 's my problem .
if it bothers you then it 's your problem .
get a life and stop messing with other people 's .
freedom of choice .
let 's stop becoming a second america .
if i see 2 old men smoking pipes and drinking whiskey over a game of chess in a scottish pub i 'd hate to have to call them criminals for it .

i do n't need scientific proof that passive smoking is harmful .
i feel it doing its damage to me every time i find myself in a smoky atmosphere .
no-one will convince me that passive smoking is not harmful .
for me , it means coughing fits , streaming eyes , a blocked nose , itchy skin , a blinding headache and a sore throat , all of which come on within minutes of being in a smoky environment .
how can something which has this effect be risk-free ?
smokers , if want to kill yourselves , fine - just do n't try and take me with you .

smoking in public places has been banned in new york the banning of smoking in public places in wales moved a step closer on friday .
measures to ban the practice throughout the country were backed by the house of lords after a bill which would let the welsh assembly put an end to it for good received an unopposed second reading .
sponsored by baroness finlay of llandaff , she said it was a skeleton bill " to allow the national assembly of wales to ban smoking of tobacco by any person in a public place in wales . "
" the power includes discretion for the assembly to make regulations applying different provisions for different purposes for different cases , " she added .

smoking in public places has been banned in new york the banning of smoking in public places in wales moved a step closer on friday .
measures to ban the practice throughout the country were backed by the house of lords after a bill which would let the welsh assembly put an end to it for good received an unopposed second reading .
sponsored by baroness finlay of llandaff , she said it was a skeleton bill " to allow the national assembly of wales to ban smoking of tobacco by any person in a public place in wales . "
" the power includes discretion for the assembly to make regulations applying different provisions for different purposes for different cases , " she added .
so should people be given the right to breathe clean air - or does this symbolise the end of our right to choose ?
this have your say is now closed - read a selection of the replies we received below .
smoking should be restricted to private premises - passive smoking is harmful to all involved .
wales should lead the way in the uk .
j.c. williams , dhahran , saudi arabia being a non smoker , i realise the dangers caused by smoking .
but , i remain uncertain about a ban .
a ban would make a nonsense of our rights to opt for the lifestyle we want , unhealthy though it might be , and could create a kind of " big brother " mentality where freedom is restricted .
surely there must be a middle way which would give all some degree of flexibility ? martin jenkins , fishguard , pembs .
yes , ban it !
smoking should be pushed into obscurity .
the addicts will never agree to it .
but , in the end it 's for their own good , and everyone elses !
rob sinistral , cardiff , s. glam i do n't feel too strongly about it either way , but taxes on tobacco are considerable source of revenue for the government -lrb- no , it is not nearly offset by the cost of medical treatment for smoking related diseases .
if cigarette sales start to sag , expect a tax increase in other products .
probably alchohol .
johnny williams , malta we are not allowed to burn piles of leaves in our gardens .
how come people can burn leaves in their mouths ?
brian messent , neath public places such as theatres and cinemas already exercise a virtual total ban and other places such as restaurants and pubs have no smoking areas so why is further legislation necessary ?
mavis griffiths , gilwern , monmouthshire i recall a time not so long ago when smoking was allowed in the work-place , in the cinema , on aircraft , buses and trains .
it did n't cause mass disruption then when there was a ban , so why now ?
i very much resent the enjoyment of my meal being ruined by both the ignorant and inconsiderate smoker and also the resterauntuer who packs tables close together and does n't have the courage to ask people to resist sparking up for a couple of hours !
smokers - do n't you dare hark on about infringement of civil liberties when your habit impacts upon those who have to work amongst the fog .
clare , swansea yes ! ! ! !
it should be banned .
i 'm fed up of not feeling comfortable when out .
i 'm fed up of smelly hair and clothes .
i 'm fed up of people making decisions for me regarding my health - i 'm being force fed smoke everywhere .
i want to enjoy my future and smell the roses ! ! ! ! !
jayne , newport , south wales oh please , will the idiotic ' ban smoking ' lobby just stop making an issue out of nothing .
i do n't smoke , but if it bothers me to breathe in other people 's smoke , which sometimes it does , then that 's my problem .
if it bothers you then it 's your problem .
get a life and stop messing with other people 's .
freedom of choice .
let 's stop becoming a second america .
if i see 2 old men smoking pipes and drinking whiskey over a game of chess in a scottish pub i 'd hate to have to call them criminals for it .
if you think they should be then you have serious issues .
all those fanatics who want to ' follow usa 's lead ' just go on and move to new york .
you 'll be at home there .
do n't try and tell me they have it right .
cigarettes illegal but guns legal !
what a dumb joke !
i suppose you would have had winston churchill behind bars , and unable to run for prime minister because of his criminal record for lighting a cigar .

nima , london so i said to the smoker , " the residue of your habit is that acrid smoke , which you blow around with a generous and carefree attitude .

graham boon , houston & efail isaf we are not allowed to burn piles of leaves in our gardens .
how come people can burn leaves in their mouths ?
brian messent , neath , uk .
i think smoking should be banned because it does n't do good to the youngsters and the lungs .
nicholas , uk yes , ban it in all public places .
i do n't need scientific proof that passive smoking is harmful .
i feel it doing its damage to me every time i find myself in a smoky atmosphere .
no-one will convince me that passive smoking is not harmful .
for me , it means coughing fits , streaming eyes , a blocked nose , itchy skin , a blinding headache and a sore throat , all of which come on within minutes of being in a smoky environment .
how can something which has this effect be risk-free ?
smokers , if want to kill yourselves , fine - just do n't try and take me with you .
sian , swansea , wales it is not fair for anyone to inhale such a foul cancer-causing smell if they are a non smoker .
non smokers have the right to be able to inhale clean air .
smokers have the right to smoke outside or in their own homes .
maggie , aberystwyth , ceredigion i am a smoker and i wish i could give up but i have struggled , and tried many times but i ca n't .

the pro-choice arguement for allowing smoking in public flawed : if only the primary user was affected , that 's fine but all the evidence suggests that second hand smoke is equally lethal and other second-hand smokers are equally affected .
so why are we even debating this ?
here we have a practise that kills the user and the people around them so why are we wasting lives when the answer is staring us in the face ?

nick r , uk for years smokers have n't given a damn about the rights of non-smokers to breathe clean air .
north america is rapidly becoming smoke free in public with all the whines about restriction of freedom and lack of choice .

at the very least there should be special smoking rooms set aside with air extraction systems that are separate from those of the rest of the premises .
gerry duggan , uk you smoke , i choke .
it gives you cancer so stop it .
billy , wales , uk i think smoking should be banned in all public places its disgusting .
we live in california and smoking is banned in all public places and in some counties they are talking about having no smoking streets .
you go in bars in the uk and your clothes smell and god knows what it does to your health its long overdue .
david austin , uk / usa hopefully the american idea of banning peoples rights in public places will stay there richard abbot , swansea , wales expert views below a man who believes in the freedom of choice , a pub manager , and the director of campaign group ash put forward their arguments .
simon clark is the director of forest , the " voice and friend " of the smoker .
" there 's no need for a total ban .
we would like to see areas that are non-smoking but people should be left to chose .
it 's not the politicians job to dictate people 's lifestyles .
we 're becoming an intolerant country and i believe that choice is essential .
we would be creating a new criminal class - which is ludicrous . "
terry radford is the manager of the mochyn du pub in cardiff .
" it would be very difficult to ban smokers in public places as they can be very belligerent - it seems to me that lots of them ca n't read as they do n't seem to see the non-smoking signs !
you could say that it 's an infringement on people 's civil liberties but we as workers also have the right to clean air .
i would like to be in a smoke free environment but i really do n't think that it would be possible . "
naomi king is the director of ash wales , a campaigning public health charity working for a response to tobacco .
" we believe that the health of employees has to be protected and no one should be forced to work in a smoky environment if it affects their health .
" yes , the public have rights but so do employees .
we want non smoking to be the social norm .
i 've spoken to people who stay away from bars and restaurants because of the smoking .
it would be nice to see wales taking the lead - we 're just putting off the inevitable . "

but to claim the prize , you are asked to fill in a direct debit mandate , which signs you up to one of their plans .
this is what you had to say : i have held a hpis policy for many years and i thoroughly approve of their marketing tactics .
what they are doing with these prize draws is effectively paying you to view their products without obligation .
it is very easy to cancel before you pay anything if you decide you do not want the policy , and they tell you clearly how to do this , it is not buried in small print anywhere .
and they always pay up if you do cancel .
kevan shuttleworth i do not think this sort of marketing should be allowed .
however the documentation circulated by hpis is quite clear .
the period of free insurance whilst you study the policy , and the delay in the payment of the first direct debit gives plenty of time to receive the cash prize and then cancel the debit .
i have had £ 5 for the past three years .
barry biddiscombe i did not realise until some months later that i was paying out £ 2 a month for insurance i did not need or want marjorie parker please do not get this company to stop , they do pay out the prize sum .
it may only be about £ 5 , but the cost is the stamp and the phone call to cancel the direct debit .
they write to me at least once a year , and this is a lovely windfall to me .
i never take out the insurance .
also , you can return the documentation to be entered into the draw without taking out the insurance .
heather hermitage i received the hospital plan circular and received the £ 5 , but did not realise until some months later that i was paying out £ 2 a month for insurance i did not need or want .
i cancelled the direct debit as soon as i realised and was then bombarded with letters asking me why i had stopped my payments .
since then , i have received - on average - a letter every one or two months offering me a " cash prize " .
it seems a very dubious way of doing business .
they are making easy money .
it should be stopped .
marjorie parker i entered this " prize draw " once .
i think i won £ 1 , or maybe £ 3 .
i immediately cancelled the direct debit .
no problem .
bob balser i have received a couple of fivers from hospital plan .
just fill in the form , send it off , and as soon as the direct debit mandate appears in your electronic banking , delete it !
you get the price of a couple of pints for two minutes work .
not a bad return .
what is the problem ?
nick davies old people are very likely to return the form without realising what they have signed for kathryn jones i receive mailings like this at least two or three times a week .
all claim that i have won a prize .
they require you to complete direct debit forms , which i have not done .
but i feel many less aware people , older people and so on , will hand over their bank details , and i am sure they will not receive any significant prize .
it should be banned .
paul seligman , cardiff my 70 year-old mother filled in the hospital plan direct debit form , as she was sure she was going to receive a prize .
two years later she asked me to look at what she had signed up for , as she was worried about it .
i stopped the direct debits and wrote to hospital plan cancelling her account .
the method of marketing is aggravating but it is transparent stephen malcolm i think this type of advertising is appalling .
old people are very likely to return the form without realising what they have signed for .
kathryn jones i have been dealing with hpis for several years and have won several sums of money , and claimed on the insurance .
the method of marketing is aggravating but it is transparent , and i have no problem with their products .
stephen malcolm the comments we publish are not necessarily the views of the bbc but will reflect the balance of views we have received .
it is helpful if contributors state if they work for any organisation relevant to an issue discussed .
in any case readers should form their own views on whether messages published represent undeclared interests , or views prompted by a common source .
