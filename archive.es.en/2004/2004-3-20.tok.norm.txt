troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force . as the first troops from the united states and britain landed in kosovo to boost peacekeeping forces on the ground on friday , the nato k-for soldiers raided apartment blocks in flashpoint kosovo towns after another night of violence . describing the continued fighting between serbs and albanians as the closest thing to ethnic cleansing since the end of the 1999 war , nato commanders ordered troops to swoop on areas where gunfire , rioting and arson attacks had forced 1000 serbs to flee their homes . " this kind of activity actually almost amounts to ethnic cleansing and it can not go on , " u.s. commander of nato forces for southern europe , admiral gregory johnson , told reporters in kosovo 's capital pristina .
" that 's why we came here in the first place . " k-for troops , originally sent into kosovo as peacekeepers , soon found their mission compromised in the early hours of friday morning when a huge blast rocked the small town of mitrovica , shaking a high-rise apartment block and sending terrified residents screaming out into the streets .
nato soldiers moved in quickly to evacuate the building but came under sniper fire .
after exchanges , the sniper was shot dead . as an uneasy calm settled on the serb-dominated northern part of the ethnically divided town , nato troops fell back to the bridge which cuts through mitrovica , and blocked the crossing with several armored personnel carriers .
there were no reports of further exchanges or violent incidents during the afternoon but hundreds of kfor soldiers remained in the town on alert .
the fragile peace of the day remained in place across the country as more nato troops arrived . " it is tense but i am not aware of new incidents or explosions , " said a u.n. police spokesman in pristina .
" it is generally quieter . " almost 1,000 serbs have fled their homes and sought the protection of nato-led peacekeepers stationed in the province after violence flared up this week .
so far 31 people , both serbs and albanians , have been killed in kosovo 's worst outbreak of violence since the war ended five years ago . seven nato member states have rushed a total of 2000 reinforcement troops into kosovo to beef up the 18,000-strong force over the last two days .
germany announced that it was sending 600 more troops , raising the german contingent to 3800 .
france pledged to send an extra 400 and denmark promised an additional 100 .
meanwhile , the first 150 soldiers of a promised 750-strong deployment of british troops landed in pristina , following the arrival of 150 u.s. troops and 80 italian carabinieri on thursday .
the united nations security council called on albanians and serbs to put an end to the unrest in kosovo .
secretary general kofi annan warned against an escalation of a conflict that could have " unpredictable consequences . "
during a heated security council session on thursday night , germany and the majority of the council squared off against serbia-montenegro and russia , who claimed the ethnic albanians in kosovo were solely responsible for the latest wave of violence .
german foreign minister joschka fischer called on both albanian and serb political leaders to defend democratic values and for the government of serbia-montenegro to prevent acts of revenge against albanians in serbia .
" we 're calling on everyone , on all sides , to immediately cease the violence , " fischer said .
fischer 's appeal was also explicitly stated in a joint security council statement issued after the meeting .
annan also condemned the riots . in the first wave of attacks , thousands of ethnic albanians sparred with nato peacekeepers , un staff , police and serbs and serb orthodox churches .
in retaliation , serbs then attacked mosques around the country . " the deliberate targeting of religious sights such as churches , cemeteries and monasteries is shameful and inexcusable , " annan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke billows from serbian orthodox church the serbs have accused kosovo 's ethnic albanians of inciting the riots .
serbia-montenegro 's foreign minister goran svilanovic said kosovo albanians alone were to blame for the violence - a position backed by serbia 's closest ally , russia . svilanovic also criticized the joint statement adopted by the security council , saying " such statements are understood and taken by the extremists as expressions of weakness . "
the latest riots show that the underlying ethnic tensions between ethnic serbs and albanians still persist on a dangerous scale , even five years after the 1999 nato bombings .
" we have not come far enough , " annan said .
" mutual respect between different communities is still not the accepted norm that it should be . "
both annan and fischer called on leaders in the region to increase understanding and cooperation between different ethnic groups .

troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force . as the first troops from the united states and britain landed in kosovo to boost peacekeeping forces on the ground on friday , the nato k-for soldiers raided apartment blocks in flashpoint kosovo towns after another night of violence . describing the continued fighting between serbs and albanians as the closest thing to ethnic cleansing since the end of the 1999 war , nato commanders ordered troops to swoop on areas where gunfire , rioting and arson attacks had forced 1000 serbs to flee their homes . " this kind of activity actually almost amounts to ethnic cleansing and it can not go on , " u.s. commander of nato forces for southern europe , admiral gregory johnson , told reporters in kosovo 's capital pristina .
" that 's why we came here in the first place . " k-for troops , originally sent into kosovo as peacekeepers , soon found their mission compromised in the early hours of friday morning when a huge blast rocked the small town of mitrovica , shaking a high-rise apartment block and sending terrified residents screaming out into the streets .
nato soldiers moved in quickly to evacuate the building but came under sniper fire .
after exchanges , the sniper was shot dead . as an uneasy calm settled on the serb-dominated northern part of the ethnically divided town , nato troops fell back to the bridge which cuts through mitrovica , and blocked the crossing with several armored personnel carriers .
there were no reports of further exchanges or violent incidents during the afternoon but hundreds of kfor soldiers remained in the town on alert .
the fragile peace of the day remained in place across the country as more nato troops arrived . " it is tense but i am not aware of new incidents or explosions , " said a u.n. police spokesman in pristina .
" it is generally quieter . " almost 1,000 serbs have fled their homes and sought the protection of nato-led peacekeepers stationed in the province after violence flared up this week .
so far 31 people , both serbs and albanians , have been killed in kosovo 's worst outbreak of violence since the war ended five years ago . seven nato member states have rushed a total of 2000 reinforcement troops into kosovo to beef up the 18,000-strong force over the last two days .
germany announced that it was sending 600 more troops , raising the german contingent to 3800 .
france pledged to send an extra 400 and denmark promised an additional 100 .
meanwhile , the first 150 soldiers of a promised 750-strong deployment of british troops landed in pristina , following the arrival of 150 u.s. troops and 80 italian carabinieri on thursday .
the united nations security council called on albanians and serbs to put an end to the unrest in kosovo .
secretary general kofi annan warned against an escalation of a conflict that could have " unpredictable consequences . "
during a heated security council session on thursday night , germany and the majority of the council squared off against serbia-montenegro and russia , who claimed the ethnic albanians in kosovo were solely responsible for the latest wave of violence .
german foreign minister joschka fischer called on both albanian and serb political leaders to defend democratic values and for the government of serbia-montenegro to prevent acts of revenge against albanians in serbia .
" we 're calling on everyone , on all sides , to immediately cease the violence , " fischer said .
fischer 's appeal was also explicitly stated in a joint security council statement issued after the meeting .
annan also condemned the riots . in the first wave of attacks , thousands of ethnic albanians sparred with nato peacekeepers , un staff , police and serbs and serb orthodox churches .
in retaliation , serbs then attacked mosques around the country . " the deliberate targeting of religious sights such as churches , cemeteries and monasteries is shameful and inexcusable , " annan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke billows from serbian orthodox church the serbs have accused kosovo 's ethnic albanians of inciting the riots .
serbia-montenegro 's foreign minister goran svilanovic said kosovo albanians alone were to blame for the violence - a position backed by serbia 's closest ally , russia . svilanovic also criticized the joint statement adopted by the security council , saying " such statements are understood and taken by the extremists as expressions of weakness . "
the latest riots show that the underlying ethnic tensions between ethnic serbs and albanians still persist on a dangerous scale , even five years after the 1999 nato bombings .
" we have not come far enough , " annan said .
" mutual respect between different communities is still not the accepted norm that it should be . "
both annan and fischer called on leaders in the region to increase understanding and cooperation between different ethnic groups .
fischer said the people now had a choice between a " tolerant " and " democratic " society " or they live in chaos and misery .

fearing terrorist attacks , the government of poland , which heads a 9,000-troop multinational force in iraq , initially joined spain in considering an iraq pull-out . last year , italy , poland , spain and the u.k. were the united states ' closest allies in the looming invasion of iraq .
their support divided the european union , opening deep wounds in the 15 member bloc that have only recently begun to heal . looking forward , not back germany , like anti-war opponent france , has done a lot to patch up its ties with washington .
in september 2002 , chancellor gerhard schröder fell foul of the bush administration when he rode his opposition to the iraq war to campaign victory . rather than abandon his position after his re-election , schöder 's government stood by its anti- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder war stance , pleading in the u.n. security council that the united states and great britain give u.n. weapons inspectors more time to search for saddam hussein 's weapons of mass destruction . a year later , vast stores of weapons of mass destruction have yet to be found , and coalition forces in iraq are suffering heavy casualties in a guerrilla war with islamic jihadists . but schröder has gone out of his way to disperse any notions that germany feels justified in its iraq opposition . " we have to talk about the present and the future now , " he said at a joint white house press conference with president george w. bush on feb .
27 this year .
" we both have a great interest in seeing a stable and democratic iraq develop . " after iraq division , offers of help the feb .
27 marked the final stages of a return to normalcy in a german-american relationship thrown off-track by divisions over the iraq war .
on his trip to the white house , schröder mentioned several olive branches berlin had extended to the bush administration in an effort to bridge the iraq divide . german police have already begun training the first 150 iraqi police officers in the united arab emirates .
the government is also mulling ways to forgive iraq debt and increase the economic aid it wants to pour into the war-torn country . but berlin continues to rule out any deployment of german soldiers on iraqi soil , even under a nato mandate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. marine lance cpl. marcco ware , from los angeles , carries an injured iraqi soldier who was shot three times during an attempted ambush of the 3rd battalion , fifth regiment convoy tuesday morning , march 25 , 2003 in central iraq .
one marine was killed , one injured during the attack which resulted in about 40 dead iraqi soldiers and 30 pow 's .
" we have absolutely no plans to send the military , the bundeswehr into iraq , " german foreign minister joschka fischer has said . germany better off through anti-war stance the stance is one that has come under criticism from opposition politicians , who supported america 's military invasion of iraq one year ago .
the christian democratic union has said the schröder government should n't rule out sending soldiers into the war-torn country . government development minister criticized the opposition in an interview friday , saying that had they listened to the cdu " there would be german soldiers in iraq today , and they would also be victims .

troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force . as the first troops from the united states and britain landed in kosovo to boost peacekeeping forces on the ground on friday , the nato k-for soldiers raided apartment blocks in flashpoint kosovo towns after another night of violence . describing the continued fighting between serbs and albanians as the closest thing to ethnic cleansing since the end of the 1999 war , nato commanders ordered troops to swoop on areas where gunfire , rioting and arson attacks had forced 1000 serbs to flee their homes . " this kind of activity actually almost amounts to ethnic cleansing and it can not go on , " u.s. commander of nato forces for southern europe , admiral gregory johnson , told reporters in kosovo 's capital pristina .
" that 's why we came here in the first place . " k-for troops , originally sent into kosovo as peacekeepers , soon found their mission compromised in the early hours of friday morning when a huge blast rocked the small town of mitrovica , shaking a high-rise apartment block and sending terrified residents screaming out into the streets .
nato soldiers moved in quickly to evacuate the building but came under sniper fire .
after exchanges , the sniper was shot dead . as an uneasy calm settled on the serb-dominated northern part of the ethnically divided town , nato troops fell back to the bridge which cuts through mitrovica , and blocked the crossing with several armored personnel carriers .
there were no reports of further exchanges or violent incidents during the afternoon but hundreds of kfor soldiers remained in the town on alert .
the fragile peace of the day remained in place across the country as more nato troops arrived . " it is tense but i am not aware of new incidents or explosions , " said a u.n. police spokesman in pristina .
" it is generally quieter . " almost 1,000 serbs have fled their homes and sought the protection of nato-led peacekeepers stationed in the province after violence flared up this week .
so far 31 people , both serbs and albanians , have been killed in kosovo 's worst outbreak of violence since the war ended five years ago . seven nato member states have rushed a total of 2000 reinforcement troops into kosovo to beef up the 18,000-strong force over the last two days .

europe 's interior ministers have agreed in principal to appoint an anti-terror czar in the european union that would responsible for coordinating counter-terrorism efforts among the 15 member bloc . the day-long emergency meeting , called by german interior minister otto schily , took place eight days after terrorists killed more than 200 people in train bombings in madrid , sparking a debate on the continent 's counter-terrorism deficits . the ministers pledge to improve intelligence sharing among eu countries , cross-border investigation and entertained the idea of setting up a european union intelligence agency . " to have a structure exchange and an analysis of intelligence collected by the national services would be a great step forward , " belgian justice minister laurette onkelix told reporters . a spanish newspaper reported that the investigation into the train bombings had expanded from morocco to belgium and holland , where investigators believe the group that carried out the attacks made a tape claiming responsibility . wanting action on existing measures most of the talk friday focused on implementing already-existing counter-terrorism instruments , passed after the sept .
11 attacks in the united states .
an in-house report by the european commission before the bombings took place criticized member states for not enacting anti-terror measures . chief among the complaints was a europe-wide arrest warrant , which five eu countries had yet to pass through their national legislatures .
several countries are also dragging their feet when it comes to adopting eu minimum and maximum sentences for terrorists and a common definition of terrorism .
and 11 of the 15 eu members have not yet passed laws to allow police to make cross-border requests to eavesdrop on communications and monitor bank accounts . " we want action on those measures which have already been agreed upon , " british home secretary david blunkett , according to reuters .
great britain said on friday it would increase its anti-terror budget by € 22.5 million . " what i 'm interested in is hard , practical action , like sharing of communications data which roots back the activities of terrorists , which gets into the use of mobile phones and the internet , " blunkett told reporters . " still a lot of egoism involved " europol , europe 's police agency , set up an anti-terror desk following the 9/11 attacks .
the agency was supposed to be a clearing house for investigative and intelligence information , something experts say has n't happened yet . " there 's still a lot of egoism involved , " klaus jansen , a german investigator and head of a police lobbyist organization , told dw-world .
he estimated that 85 percent of the information that goes into the anti-terror data pool is from germany . jansen also criticized the lack of a unified computer system which linked national law enforcement agencies and the european union . european law enforcement is on high alert following the madrid attacks .
europol chief jürgen storbeck said the attacks reinforced the need to ramp up cooperation before the european soccer championships in portugal in june and the olympic games in athens in august . top intelligence officials from germany , spain , france , great britain and italy will meet for three-day talks beginning on monday .

germany 's steadfast opposition to the iraq war led to a division within europe and a new ice age with the bush administration in washington .
one year later , wounds have -lrb- mostly -rrb- been healed . on the day before the military invasion of iraq began last year , anti-war opponents in the united nations security council were giving speeches beseeching the bush administration to reconsider their march toward war . " to those who think that the scourge of terrorism will be eradicated through what is done in iraq , we say that they run the risk of failing in their objective , " said french foreign minister dominique de villepin on march 19 , 2003 , whose country was among the most vocal opponents of the iraq war . one year since the start of the invasion and one week after one of the worst terrorist attacks in european history , de villepin 's statement seems to bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paramedics aid a man injured by an explosion in a train , outside of the train station of atocha in madrid. hold up .
following the bombing of four trains that killed more than 200 people in madrid eight days ago , spain voted out the popular party of prime minister jose aznar , one of washington 's closest allies . in his place is a social democrat prime minister who has promised to pull spain 's 1,300 troops out of iraq .
fearing terrorist attacks , the government of poland , which heads a 9,000-troop multinational force in iraq , initially joined spain in considering an iraq pull-out . last year , italy , poland , spain and the u.k. were the united states ' closest allies in the looming invasion of iraq .
their support divided the european union , opening deep wounds in the 15 member bloc that have only recently begun to heal . looking forward , not back germany , like anti-war opponent france , has done a lot to patch up its ties with washington .
in september 2002 , chancellor gerhard schröder fell foul of the bush administration when he rode his opposition to the iraq war to campaign victory . rather than abandon his position after his re-election , schöder 's government stood by its anti- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder war stance , pleading in the u.n. security council that the united states and great britain give u.n. weapons inspectors more time to search for saddam hussein 's weapons of mass destruction . a year later , vast stores of weapons of mass destruction have yet to be found , and coalition forces in iraq are suffering heavy casualties in a guerrilla war with islamic jihadists . but schröder has gone out of his way to disperse any notions that germany feels justified in its iraq opposition . " we have to talk about the present and the future now , " he said at a joint white house press conference with president george w. bush on feb .
27 this year .
" we both have a great interest in seeing a stable and democratic iraq develop . " after iraq division , offers of help the feb .

troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force . as the first troops from the united states and britain landed in kosovo to boost peacekeeping forces on the ground on friday , the nato k-for soldiers raided apartment blocks in flashpoint kosovo towns after another night of violence . describing the continued fighting between serbs and albanians as the closest thing to ethnic cleansing since the end of the 1999 war , nato commanders ordered troops to swoop on areas where gunfire , rioting and arson attacks had forced 1000 serbs to flee their homes . " this kind of activity actually almost amounts to ethnic cleansing and it can not go on , " u.s. commander of nato forces for southern europe , admiral gregory johnson , told reporters in kosovo 's capital pristina .
" that 's why we came here in the first place . " k-for troops , originally sent into kosovo as peacekeepers , soon found their mission compromised in the early hours of friday morning when a huge blast rocked the small town of mitrovica , shaking a high-rise apartment block and sending terrified residents screaming out into the streets .
nato soldiers moved in quickly to evacuate the building but came under sniper fire .
after exchanges , the sniper was shot dead . as an uneasy calm settled on the serb-dominated northern part of the ethnically divided town , nato troops fell back to the bridge which cuts through mitrovica , and blocked the crossing with several armored personnel carriers .
there were no reports of further exchanges or violent incidents during the afternoon but hundreds of kfor soldiers remained in the town on alert .
the fragile peace of the day remained in place across the country as more nato troops arrived . " it is tense but i am not aware of new incidents or explosions , " said a u.n. police spokesman in pristina .
" it is generally quieter . " almost 1,000 serbs have fled their homes and sought the protection of nato-led peacekeepers stationed in the province after violence flared up this week .
so far 31 people , both serbs and albanians , have been killed in kosovo 's worst outbreak of violence since the war ended five years ago . seven nato member states have rushed a total of 2000 reinforcement troops into kosovo to beef up the 18,000-strong force over the last two days .
germany announced that it was sending 600 more troops , raising the german contingent to 3800 .
france pledged to send an extra 400 and denmark promised an additional 100 .
meanwhile , the first 150 soldiers of a promised 750-strong deployment of british troops landed in pristina , following the arrival of 150 u.s. troops and 80 italian carabinieri on thursday .
the united nations security council called on albanians and serbs to put an end to the unrest in kosovo .
secretary general kofi annan warned against an escalation of a conflict that could have " unpredictable consequences . "
during a heated security council session on thursday night , germany and the majority of the council squared off against serbia-montenegro and russia , who claimed the ethnic albanians in kosovo were solely responsible for the latest wave of violence .
german foreign minister joschka fischer called on both albanian and serb political leaders to defend democratic values and for the government of serbia-montenegro to prevent acts of revenge against albanians in serbia .
" we 're calling on everyone , on all sides , to immediately cease the violence , " fischer said .
fischer 's appeal was also explicitly stated in a joint security council statement issued after the meeting .
annan also condemned the riots . in the first wave of attacks , thousands of ethnic albanians sparred with nato peacekeepers , un staff , police and serbs and serb orthodox churches .
in retaliation , serbs then attacked mosques around the country . " the deliberate targeting of religious sights such as churches , cemeteries and monasteries is shameful and inexcusable , " annan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke billows from serbian orthodox church the serbs have accused kosovo 's ethnic albanians of inciting the riots .
serbia-montenegro 's foreign minister goran svilanovic said kosovo albanians alone were to blame for the violence - a position backed by serbia 's closest ally , russia . svilanovic also criticized the joint statement adopted by the security council , saying " such statements are understood and taken by the extremists as expressions of weakness . "
the latest riots show that the underlying ethnic tensions between ethnic serbs and albanians still persist on a dangerous scale , even five years after the 1999 nato bombings .
" we have not come far enough , " annan said .
" mutual respect between different communities is still not the accepted norm that it should be . "
both annan and fischer called on leaders in the region to increase understanding and cooperation between different ethnic groups .
fischer said the people now had a choice between a " tolerant " and " democratic " society " or they live in chaos and misery .

europe 's interior ministers have agreed in principal to appoint an anti-terror czar in the european union that would responsible for coordinating counter-terrorism efforts among the 15 member bloc . the day-long emergency meeting , called by german interior minister otto schily , took place eight days after terrorists killed more than 200 people in train bombings in madrid , sparking a debate on the continent 's counter-terrorism deficits . the ministers pledge to improve intelligence sharing among eu countries , cross-border investigation and entertained the idea of setting up a european union intelligence agency .

germany 's steadfast opposition to the iraq war led to a division within europe and a new ice age with the bush administration in washington .
one year later , wounds have -lrb- mostly -rrb- been healed . on the day before the military invasion of iraq began last year , anti-war opponents in the united nations security council were giving speeches beseeching the bush administration to reconsider their march toward war . " to those who think that the scourge of terrorism will be eradicated through what is done in iraq , we say that they run the risk of failing in their objective , " said french foreign minister dominique de villepin on march 19 , 2003 , whose country was among the most vocal opponents of the iraq war . one year since the start of the invasion and one week after one of the worst terrorist attacks in european history , de villepin 's statement seems to bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paramedics aid a man injured by an explosion in a train , outside of the train station of atocha in madrid. hold up .
following the bombing of four trains that killed more than 200 people in madrid eight days ago , spain voted out the popular party of prime minister jose aznar , one of washington 's closest allies . in his place is a social democrat prime minister who has promised to pull spain 's 1,300 troops out of iraq .
fearing terrorist attacks , the government of poland , which heads a 9,000-troop multinational force in iraq , initially joined spain in considering an iraq pull-out . last year , italy , poland , spain and the u.k. were the united states ' closest allies in the looming invasion of iraq .
their support divided the european union , opening deep wounds in the 15 member bloc that have only recently begun to heal . looking forward , not back germany , like anti-war opponent france , has done a lot to patch up its ties with washington .
in september 2002 , chancellor gerhard schröder fell foul of the bush administration when he rode his opposition to the iraq war to campaign victory . rather than abandon his position after his re-election , schöder 's government stood by its anti- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder war stance , pleading in the u.n. security council that the united states and great britain give u.n. weapons inspectors more time to search for saddam hussein 's weapons of mass destruction . a year later , vast stores of weapons of mass destruction have yet to be found , and coalition forces in iraq are suffering heavy casualties in a guerrilla war with islamic jihadists . but schröder has gone out of his way to disperse any notions that germany feels justified in its iraq opposition . " we have to talk about the present and the future now , " he said at a joint white house press conference with president george w. bush on feb .

germany 's steadfast opposition to the iraq war led to a division within europe and a new ice age with the bush administration in washington .
one year later , wounds have -lrb- mostly -rrb- been healed . on the day before the military invasion of iraq began last year , anti-war opponents in the united nations security council were giving speeches beseeching the bush administration to reconsider their march toward war . " to those who think that the scourge of terrorism will be eradicated through what is done in iraq , we say that they run the risk of failing in their objective , " said french foreign minister dominique de villepin on march 19 , 2003 , whose country was among the most vocal opponents of the iraq war . one year since the start of the invasion and one week after one of the worst terrorist attacks in european history , de villepin 's statement seems to bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paramedics aid a man injured by an explosion in a train , outside of the train station of atocha in madrid. hold up .
following the bombing of four trains that killed more than 200 people in madrid eight days ago , spain voted out the popular party of prime minister jose aznar , one of washington 's closest allies . in his place is a social democrat prime minister who has promised to pull spain 's 1,300 troops out of iraq .
fearing terrorist attacks , the government of poland , which heads a 9,000-troop multinational force in iraq , initially joined spain in considering an iraq pull-out . last year , italy , poland , spain and the u.k. were the united states ' closest allies in the looming invasion of iraq .
their support divided the european union , opening deep wounds in the 15 member bloc that have only recently begun to heal . looking forward , not back germany , like anti-war opponent france , has done a lot to patch up its ties with washington .
in september 2002 , chancellor gerhard schröder fell foul of the bush administration when he rode his opposition to the iraq war to campaign victory . rather than abandon his position after his re-election , schöder 's government stood by its anti- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder war stance , pleading in the u.n. security council that the united states and great britain give u.n. weapons inspectors more time to search for saddam hussein 's weapons of mass destruction . a year later , vast stores of weapons of mass destruction have yet to be found , and coalition forces in iraq are suffering heavy casualties in a guerrilla war with islamic jihadists . but schröder has gone out of his way to disperse any notions that germany feels justified in its iraq opposition . " we have to talk about the present and the future now , " he said at a joint white house press conference with president george w. bush on feb .
27 this year .
" we both have a great interest in seeing a stable and democratic iraq develop . " after iraq division , offers of help the feb .
27 marked the final stages of a return to normalcy in a german-american relationship thrown off-track by divisions over the iraq war .
on his trip to the white house , schröder mentioned several olive branches berlin had extended to the bush administration in an effort to bridge the iraq divide . german police have already begun training the first 150 iraqi police officers in the united arab emirates .
the government is also mulling ways to forgive iraq debt and increase the economic aid it wants to pour into the war-torn country . but berlin continues to rule out any deployment of german soldiers on iraqi soil , even under a nato mandate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. marine lance cpl. marcco ware , from los angeles , carries an injured iraqi soldier who was shot three times during an attempted ambush of the 3rd battalion , fifth regiment convoy tuesday morning , march 25 , 2003 in central iraq .
one marine was killed , one injured during the attack which resulted in about 40 dead iraqi soldiers and 30 pow 's .
" we have absolutely no plans to send the military , the bundeswehr into iraq , " german foreign minister joschka fischer has said . germany better off through anti-war stance the stance is one that has come under criticism from opposition politicians , who supported america 's military invasion of iraq one year ago .
the christian democratic union has said the schröder government should n't rule out sending soldiers into the war-torn country . government development minister criticized the opposition in an interview friday , saying that had they listened to the cdu " there would be german soldiers in iraq today , and they would also be victims .

troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force . as the first troops from the united states and britain landed in kosovo to boost peacekeeping forces on the ground on friday , the nato k-for soldiers raided apartment blocks in flashpoint kosovo towns after another night of violence . describing the continued fighting between serbs and albanians as the closest thing to ethnic cleansing since the end of the 1999 war , nato commanders ordered troops to swoop on areas where gunfire , rioting and arson attacks had forced 1000 serbs to flee their homes . " this kind of activity actually almost amounts to ethnic cleansing and it can not go on , " u.s. commander of nato forces for southern europe , admiral gregory johnson , told reporters in kosovo 's capital pristina .
" that 's why we came here in the first place . " k-for troops , originally sent into kosovo as peacekeepers , soon found their mission compromised in the early hours of friday morning when a huge blast rocked the small town of mitrovica , shaking a high-rise apartment block and sending terrified residents screaming out into the streets .
nato soldiers moved in quickly to evacuate the building but came under sniper fire .
after exchanges , the sniper was shot dead . as an uneasy calm settled on the serb-dominated northern part of the ethnically divided town , nato troops fell back to the bridge which cuts through mitrovica , and blocked the crossing with several armored personnel carriers .
there were no reports of further exchanges or violent incidents during the afternoon but hundreds of kfor soldiers remained in the town on alert .
the fragile peace of the day remained in place across the country as more nato troops arrived . " it is tense but i am not aware of new incidents or explosions , " said a u.n. police spokesman in pristina .
" it is generally quieter . " almost 1,000 serbs have fled their homes and sought the protection of nato-led peacekeepers stationed in the province after violence flared up this week .
so far 31 people , both serbs and albanians , have been killed in kosovo 's worst outbreak of violence since the war ended five years ago . seven nato member states have rushed a total of 2000 reinforcement troops into kosovo to beef up the 18,000-strong force over the last two days .
germany announced that it was sending 600 more troops , raising the german contingent to 3800 .
france pledged to send an extra 400 and denmark promised an additional 100 .
meanwhile , the first 150 soldiers of a promised 750-strong deployment of british troops landed in pristina , following the arrival of 150 u.s. troops and 80 italian carabinieri on thursday .
the united nations security council called on albanians and serbs to put an end to the unrest in kosovo .
secretary general kofi annan warned against an escalation of a conflict that could have " unpredictable consequences . "
during a heated security council session on thursday night , germany and the majority of the council squared off against serbia-montenegro and russia , who claimed the ethnic albanians in kosovo were solely responsible for the latest wave of violence .
german foreign minister joschka fischer called on both albanian and serb political leaders to defend democratic values and for the government of serbia-montenegro to prevent acts of revenge against albanians in serbia .
" we 're calling on everyone , on all sides , to immediately cease the violence , " fischer said .
fischer 's appeal was also explicitly stated in a joint security council statement issued after the meeting .
annan also condemned the riots . in the first wave of attacks , thousands of ethnic albanians sparred with nato peacekeepers , un staff , police and serbs and serb orthodox churches .
in retaliation , serbs then attacked mosques around the country . " the deliberate targeting of religious sights such as churches , cemeteries and monasteries is shameful and inexcusable , " annan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke billows from serbian orthodox church the serbs have accused kosovo 's ethnic albanians of inciting the riots .
serbia-montenegro 's foreign minister goran svilanovic said kosovo albanians alone were to blame for the violence - a position backed by serbia 's closest ally , russia . svilanovic also criticized the joint statement adopted by the security council , saying " such statements are understood and taken by the extremists as expressions of weakness . "
the latest riots show that the underlying ethnic tensions between ethnic serbs and albanians still persist on a dangerous scale , even five years after the 1999 nato bombings .
" we have not come far enough , " annan said .
" mutual respect between different communities is still not the accepted norm that it should be . "
both annan and fischer called on leaders in the region to increase understanding and cooperation between different ethnic groups .
fischer said the people now had a choice between a " tolerant " and " democratic " society " or they live in chaos and misery .

in retaliation , serbs then attacked mosques around the country . " the deliberate targeting of religious sights such as churches , cemeteries and monasteries is shameful and inexcusable , " annan said .

serbia-montenegro 's foreign minister goran svilanovic said kosovo albanians alone were to blame for the violence - a position backed by serbia 's closest ally , russia . svilanovic also criticized the joint statement adopted by the security council , saying " such statements are understood and taken by the extremists as expressions of weakness . "
the latest riots show that the underlying ethnic tensions between ethnic serbs and albanians still persist on a dangerous scale , even five years after the 1999 nato bombings .
" we have not come far enough , " annan said .
" mutual respect between different communities is still not the accepted norm that it should be . "
both annan and fischer called on leaders in the region to increase understanding and cooperation between different ethnic groups .

one and a half weeks before a crucial deadline , germany ’ s economics and environment ministers are still at odds over a plan to impose emissions trading certificates to industrial companies and energy producers . the emissions trading plan is to be submitted to the european commission at the end of march .
it ’ ll be part and parcel of the european union ’ s future trading in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emission certificates with the aim of achieving greenhouse gas output reductions as agreed under the 1997 kyoto protocol .
in line with kyoto , the european union remains committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent between 1990 and 2012 .
as the largest single economy within the bloc , germany is shouldering the heaviest burden .
as part of a voluntary deal struck between industry leaders and the government , it ’ ll have to reduce emissions by 21 percent .

companies in the industrial and energy sectors will be granted a certain number of certificates for co2 emissions .
if they produce more , they can buy certificates from other companies that have not exceeded their limits .
if they emit less , they can sell certificates to companies that would otherwise exceed the legal limits .

but german environment minister jürgen trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- , of the green party , and economics minister wolfgang clement , of the social democrats , do n't see eye to eye on a number of issues .
it remains unclear just how many certificates can be issued , and to whom , according to reinhard loske , the environmental spokesman for the greens .
" environment minister trittin is in favor of doling out more certificates to gas power stations and less to the coal industry , " loske said .
" this has economics minister wolfgang clement up in arms because he fears that the domestic coal industry will suffer another blow as a result . "
but clement said there is still plenty of room for talks and a possible compromise .
" an agreement has not yet been reached , but there 's some time left for further negotiations , " he said .
" but i insist on a solution which does not represent a setback for german companies ' competitiveness . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement trittin has been trying hard to play down his ongoing row with clement -lrb- photo -rrb- .

" i think it would not be in the interest of german industry to try and drag its feet on the matter , " the environment minister said .
" we should really aim to reach agreement by the end of this month , and i will make this abundantly clear in the next round of negotiations . "
environment minister : business benefits trittin reckons that german companies as a whole would be among the biggest beneficiaries of certificate trading .
according to estimates by the environment ministry , many of the 2,600 german enterprises which fall under the eu program will be able to sell certificates abroad , generating a market in certificates worth as much as € 500 million -lrb- $ 617.4 million -rrb- a year . hardy graupner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry and greens at loggerheads over emissions plan german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu .

one and a half weeks before a crucial deadline , germany ’ s economics and environment ministers are still at odds over a plan to impose emissions trading certificates to industrial companies and energy producers . the emissions trading plan is to be submitted to the european commission at the end of march .
it ’ ll be part and parcel of the european union ’ s future trading in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emission certificates with the aim of achieving greenhouse gas output reductions as agreed under the 1997 kyoto protocol .
in line with kyoto , the european union remains committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent between 1990 and 2012 .
as the largest single economy within the bloc , germany is shouldering the heaviest burden .
as part of a voluntary deal struck between industry leaders and the government , it ’ ll have to reduce emissions by 21 percent .
pollution ration cards as of jan .
1 , 2005 , eu member states will start dealing with emission certificates .

but german environment minister jürgen trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- , of the green party , and economics minister wolfgang clement , of the social democrats , do n't see eye to eye on a number of issues .
it remains unclear just how many certificates can be issued , and to whom , according to reinhard loske , the environmental spokesman for the greens .

" this has economics minister wolfgang clement up in arms because he fears that the domestic coal industry will suffer another blow as a result . "
but clement said there is still plenty of room for talks and a possible compromise .
" an agreement has not yet been reached , but there 's some time left for further negotiations , " he said .
" but i insist on a solution which does not represent a setback for german companies ' competitiveness . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement trittin has been trying hard to play down his ongoing row with clement -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he said industry leaders have insisted they get an amount of certificates so generous they would have no chance of getting approved by brussels .
" i think it would not be in the interest of german industry to try and drag its feet on the matter , " the environment minister said .
" we should really aim to reach agreement by the end of this month , and i will make this abundantly clear in the next round of negotiations . "
environment minister : business benefits trittin reckons that german companies as a whole would be among the biggest beneficiaries of certificate trading .
according to estimates by the environment ministry , many of the 2,600 german enterprises which fall under the eu program will be able to sell certificates abroad , generating a market in certificates worth as much as € 500 million -lrb- $ 617.4 million -rrb- a year . hardy graupner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry and greens at loggerheads over emissions plan german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu .

animal rights group peta will have to pay a hefty fine if it continues a controversial advertising campaign in germany comparing battery hens to holocaust victims after a jewish group won a temporary injunction . peta , which stands for people for the ethical treatment of animals , will have to pay up to € 250,000 -lrb- $ 307,000 -rrb- should it continue the campaign via posters , flyers , the internet or other means , according to the central council of jews in germany , which filed the complaint .
on peta 's web site , the pictures could still be seen on saturday .
the campaign had opened in germany on thursday to protests from the jewish community .
it likens the slaughter of animals to the murder of jews under the nazis .
the adverts , entitled " holocaust on a plate , " show pictures of battery hens packed into cages next to images of emaciated jewish inmates in nazi concentration camp bunk beds .
officials from peta have said that the posters are designed to raise public awareness of what they call the maltreatment of animals before they are slaughtered .
posters from the campaign went up in the city of stuttgart ahead of a europe-wide rollout that would take in a further 11 cities before the campaign closes on april 8 .
peta 's insistence on going ahead with the campaign in stuttgart prompted the central council of jews in germany to take the case to the courts .
paul spiegel , the council 's president , told reporters that he would ask prosecutors to charge peta with " inciting racial hatred . "
a violation of human dignity spiegel urged peta to drop the " disgusting adverts , " calling them " a violation of human dignity , especially of the holocaust victims . "
in response to the complaint by the central council of jews , campaign coordinator matt prescott , himself a jew , issued a statement saying he was aware of the council 's views , but added : " we are not willing to end the campaign . "
bildunterschrift : " auschwitz begins when someone stands in a slaughter house and says , ' it 's just animals , " ' reads the quote from german philosopher and sociologist theodor adorno on the peta poster .
stuttgart prosecutor eckhard maak told the berliner zeitung newspaper on wednesday that peta should think twice before going ahead with the campaign in germany , since federal law requires that severe punitive measures be taken against anyone who belittles or denies the holocaust , handing down large fines or sentences of up to five years in prison for anyone found guilty .
he added that if the campaign went ahead " then you can expect the police wo n't shut their eyes . "
unique crime with unique regulations " peta equates an abuse which they consider despicable with the crimes of the holocaust , " maak said in the interview .
however , he added that the trivialization of holocaust images was not included in the right of free speech in german law .
" the historical crime of the holocaust is so unique that the legislator has afforded it with special penal regulations . " the posters have already been condemned in the united states after peta ran the campaign there last year .
the anti-defamation league demanded that the posters be removed immediately .
abraham foxman , head of the league and himself a holocaust survivor , raged : " the effort by peta to compare the deliberate , systematic murder of millions of jews to the issue of animal rights is abhorrent .
abusive treatment of animals should be opposed , but can not and must not be compared to the holocaust . ” campaign continues despite local bans but peta remained firm despite having its posters banned in nearly 20 cities across the united states with four more banning the television commercials that accompanied them . however , the organization 's enthusiasm was undimmed .
" it was our second-best campaign , " peta ’ s bruce friedrich told the berliner zeitung .

animal rights group peta will have to pay a hefty fine if it continues a controversial advertising campaign in germany comparing battery hens to holocaust victims after a jewish group won a temporary injunction . peta , which stands for people for the ethical treatment of animals , will have to pay up to € 250,000 -lrb- $ 307,000 -rrb- should it continue the campaign via posters , flyers , the internet or other means , according to the central council of jews in germany , which filed the complaint .
on peta 's web site , the pictures could still be seen on saturday .
the campaign had opened in germany on thursday to protests from the jewish community .
it likens the slaughter of animals to the murder of jews under the nazis .
the adverts , entitled " holocaust on a plate , " show pictures of battery hens packed into cages next to images of emaciated jewish inmates in nazi concentration camp bunk beds .
officials from peta have said that the posters are designed to raise public awareness of what they call the maltreatment of animals before they are slaughtered .
posters from the campaign went up in the city of stuttgart ahead of a europe-wide rollout that would take in a further 11 cities before the campaign closes on april 8 .
peta 's insistence on going ahead with the campaign in stuttgart prompted the central council of jews in germany to take the case to the courts .
paul spiegel , the council 's president , told reporters that he would ask prosecutors to charge peta with " inciting racial hatred . "
a violation of human dignity spiegel urged peta to drop the " disgusting adverts , " calling them " a violation of human dignity , especially of the holocaust victims . "
in response to the complaint by the central council of jews , campaign coordinator matt prescott , himself a jew , issued a statement saying he was aware of the council 's views , but added : " we are not willing to end the campaign . "
bildunterschrift : " auschwitz begins when someone stands in a slaughter house and says , ' it 's just animals , " ' reads the quote from german philosopher and sociologist theodor adorno on the peta poster .
stuttgart prosecutor eckhard maak told the berliner zeitung newspaper on wednesday that peta should think twice before going ahead with the campaign in germany , since federal law requires that severe punitive measures be taken against anyone who belittles or denies the holocaust , handing down large fines or sentences of up to five years in prison for anyone found guilty .
he added that if the campaign went ahead " then you can expect the police wo n't shut their eyes . "
unique crime with unique regulations " peta equates an abuse which they consider despicable with the crimes of the holocaust , " maak said in the interview .
however , he added that the trivialization of holocaust images was not included in the right of free speech in german law .
" the historical crime of the holocaust is so unique that the legislator has afforded it with special penal regulations . " the posters have already been condemned in the united states after peta ran the campaign there last year .
the anti-defamation league demanded that the posters be removed immediately .
abraham foxman , head of the league and himself a holocaust survivor , raged : " the effort by peta to compare the deliberate , systematic murder of millions of jews to the issue of animal rights is abhorrent .
abusive treatment of animals should be opposed , but can not and must not be compared to the holocaust . ” campaign continues despite local bans but peta remained firm despite having its posters banned in nearly 20 cities across the united states with four more banning the television commercials that accompanied them . however , the organization 's enthusiasm was undimmed .
" it was our second-best campaign , " peta ’ s bruce friedrich told the berliner zeitung .
“ after the holocaust campaign , many americans have become vegetarians , ” he claimed .
friedrich said he saw nothing wrong with the controversial comparison between holocaust victims and battery hens .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.03.2004 berlin locks horns over emission certificates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german industrial emissions will soon be more strictly regulated .
one and a half weeks before a crucial deadline , germany ’ s economics and environment ministers are still at odds over a plan to impose emissions trading certificates to industrial companies and energy producers . the emissions trading plan is to be submitted to the european commission at the end of march .
it ’ ll be part and parcel of the european union ’ s future trading in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emission certificates with the aim of achieving greenhouse gas output reductions as agreed under the 1997 kyoto protocol .
in line with kyoto , the european union remains committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent between 1990 and 2012 .
as the largest single economy within the bloc , germany is shouldering the heaviest burden .
as part of a voluntary deal struck between industry leaders and the government , it ’ ll have to reduce emissions by 21 percent .
pollution ration cards as of jan .
1 , 2005 , eu member states will start dealing with emission certificates .
companies in the industrial and energy sectors will be granted a certain number of certificates for co2 emissions .
if they produce more , they can buy certificates from other companies that have not exceeded their limits .
if they emit less , they can sell certificates to companies that would otherwise exceed the legal limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin .
but german environment minister jürgen trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- , of the green party , and economics minister wolfgang clement , of the social democrats , do n't see eye to eye on a number of issues .
it remains unclear just how many certificates can be issued , and to whom , according to reinhard loske , the environmental spokesman for the greens .
" environment minister trittin is in favor of doling out more certificates to gas power stations and less to the coal industry , " loske said .
" this has economics minister wolfgang clement up in arms because he fears that the domestic coal industry will suffer another blow as a result . "
but clement said there is still plenty of room for talks and a possible compromise .

troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force . as the first troops from the united states and britain landed in kosovo to boost peacekeeping forces on the ground on friday , the nato k-for soldiers raided apartment blocks in flashpoint kosovo towns after another night of violence . describing the continued fighting between serbs and albanians as the closest thing to ethnic cleansing since the end of the 1999 war , nato commanders ordered troops to swoop on areas where gunfire , rioting and arson attacks had forced 1000 serbs to flee their homes . " this kind of activity actually almost amounts to ethnic cleansing and it can not go on , " u.s. commander of nato forces for southern europe , admiral gregory johnson , told reporters in kosovo 's capital pristina .
" that 's why we came here in the first place . " k-for troops , originally sent into kosovo as peacekeepers , soon found their mission compromised in the early hours of friday morning when a huge blast rocked the small town of mitrovica , shaking a high-rise apartment block and sending terrified residents screaming out into the streets .
nato soldiers moved in quickly to evacuate the building but came under sniper fire .
after exchanges , the sniper was shot dead . as an uneasy calm settled on the serb-dominated northern part of the ethnically divided town , nato troops fell back to the bridge which cuts through mitrovica , and blocked the crossing with several armored personnel carriers .
there were no reports of further exchanges or violent incidents during the afternoon but hundreds of kfor soldiers remained in the town on alert .
the fragile peace of the day remained in place across the country as more nato troops arrived . " it is tense but i am not aware of new incidents or explosions , " said a u.n. police spokesman in pristina .
" it is generally quieter . " almost 1,000 serbs have fled their homes and sought the protection of nato-led peacekeepers stationed in the province after violence flared up this week .
so far 31 people , both serbs and albanians , have been killed in kosovo 's worst outbreak of violence since the war ended five years ago . seven nato member states have rushed a total of 2000 reinforcement troops into kosovo to beef up the 18,000-strong force over the last two days .
germany announced that it was sending 600 more troops , raising the german contingent to 3800 .
france pledged to send an extra 400 and denmark promised an additional 100 .
meanwhile , the first 150 soldiers of a promised 750-strong deployment of british troops landed in pristina , following the arrival of 150 u.s. troops and 80 italian carabinieri on thursday .
the united nations security council called on albanians and serbs to put an end to the unrest in kosovo .
secretary general kofi annan warned against an escalation of a conflict that could have " unpredictable consequences . "
during a heated security council session on thursday night , germany and the majority of the council squared off against serbia-montenegro and russia , who claimed the ethnic albanians in kosovo were solely responsible for the latest wave of violence .
german foreign minister joschka fischer called on both albanian and serb political leaders to defend democratic values and for the government of serbia-montenegro to prevent acts of revenge against albanians in serbia .
" we 're calling on everyone , on all sides , to immediately cease the violence , " fischer said .
fischer 's appeal was also explicitly stated in a joint security council statement issued after the meeting .
annan also condemned the riots . in the first wave of attacks , thousands of ethnic albanians sparred with nato peacekeepers , un staff , police and serbs and serb orthodox churches .
in retaliation , serbs then attacked mosques around the country . " the deliberate targeting of religious sights such as churches , cemeteries and monasteries is shameful and inexcusable , " annan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke billows from serbian orthodox church the serbs have accused kosovo 's ethnic albanians of inciting the riots .
serbia-montenegro 's foreign minister goran svilanovic said kosovo albanians alone were to blame for the violence - a position backed by serbia 's closest ally , russia . svilanovic also criticized the joint statement adopted by the security council , saying " such statements are understood and taken by the extremists as expressions of weakness . "
the latest riots show that the underlying ethnic tensions between ethnic serbs and albanians still persist on a dangerous scale , even five years after the 1999 nato bombings .
" we have not come far enough , " annan said .
" mutual respect between different communities is still not the accepted norm that it should be . "
both annan and fischer called on leaders in the region to increase understanding and cooperation between different ethnic groups .
fischer said the people now had a choice between a " tolerant " and " democratic " society " or they live in chaos and misery .

troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force . as the first troops from the united states and britain landed in kosovo to boost peacekeeping forces on the ground on friday , the nato k-for soldiers raided apartment blocks in flashpoint kosovo towns after another night of violence . describing the continued fighting between serbs and albanians as the closest thing to ethnic cleansing since the end of the 1999 war , nato commanders ordered troops to swoop on areas where gunfire , rioting and arson attacks had forced 1000 serbs to flee their homes . " this kind of activity actually almost amounts to ethnic cleansing and it can not go on , " u.s. commander of nato forces for southern europe , admiral gregory johnson , told reporters in kosovo 's capital pristina .
" that 's why we came here in the first place . " k-for troops , originally sent into kosovo as peacekeepers , soon found their mission compromised in the early hours of friday morning when a huge blast rocked the small town of mitrovica , shaking a high-rise apartment block and sending terrified residents screaming out into the streets .
nato soldiers moved in quickly to evacuate the building but came under sniper fire .
after exchanges , the sniper was shot dead . as an uneasy calm settled on the serb-dominated northern part of the ethnically divided town , nato troops fell back to the bridge which cuts through mitrovica , and blocked the crossing with several armored personnel carriers .
there were no reports of further exchanges or violent incidents during the afternoon but hundreds of kfor soldiers remained in the town on alert .
the fragile peace of the day remained in place across the country as more nato troops arrived . " it is tense but i am not aware of new incidents or explosions , " said a u.n. police spokesman in pristina .
" it is generally quieter . " almost 1,000 serbs have fled their homes and sought the protection of nato-led peacekeepers stationed in the province after violence flared up this week .
so far 31 people , both serbs and albanians , have been killed in kosovo 's worst outbreak of violence since the war ended five years ago . seven nato member states have rushed a total of 2000 reinforcement troops into kosovo to beef up the 18,000-strong force over the last two days .
germany announced that it was sending 600 more troops , raising the german contingent to 3800 .
france pledged to send an extra 400 and denmark promised an additional 100 .
meanwhile , the first 150 soldiers of a promised 750-strong deployment of british troops landed in pristina , following the arrival of 150 u.s. troops and 80 italian carabinieri on thursday .
the united nations security council called on albanians and serbs to put an end to the unrest in kosovo .
secretary general kofi annan warned against an escalation of a conflict that could have " unpredictable consequences . "
during a heated security council session on thursday night , germany and the majority of the council squared off against serbia-montenegro and russia , who claimed the ethnic albanians in kosovo were solely responsible for the latest wave of violence .
german foreign minister joschka fischer called on both albanian and serb political leaders to defend democratic values and for the government of serbia-montenegro to prevent acts of revenge against albanians in serbia .
" we 're calling on everyone , on all sides , to immediately cease the violence , " fischer said .
fischer 's appeal was also explicitly stated in a joint security council statement issued after the meeting .
annan also condemned the riots . in the first wave of attacks , thousands of ethnic albanians sparred with nato peacekeepers , un staff , police and serbs and serb orthodox churches .
in retaliation , serbs then attacked mosques around the country . " the deliberate targeting of religious sights such as churches , cemeteries and monasteries is shameful and inexcusable , " annan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke billows from serbian orthodox church the serbs have accused kosovo 's ethnic albanians of inciting the riots .
serbia-montenegro 's foreign minister goran svilanovic said kosovo albanians alone were to blame for the violence - a position backed by serbia 's closest ally , russia . svilanovic also criticized the joint statement adopted by the security council , saying " such statements are understood and taken by the extremists as expressions of weakness . "
the latest riots show that the underlying ethnic tensions between ethnic serbs and albanians still persist on a dangerous scale , even five years after the 1999 nato bombings .
" we have not come far enough , " annan said .
" mutual respect between different communities is still not the accepted norm that it should be . "
both annan and fischer called on leaders in the region to increase understanding and cooperation between different ethnic groups .

" k-for troops , originally sent into kosovo as peacekeepers , soon found their mission compromised in the early hours of friday morning when a huge blast rocked the small town of mitrovica , shaking a high-rise apartment block and sending terrified residents screaming out into the streets .
nato soldiers moved in quickly to evacuate the building but came under sniper fire .
after exchanges , the sniper was shot dead . as an uneasy calm settled on the serb-dominated northern part of the ethnically divided town , nato troops fell back to the bridge which cuts through mitrovica , and blocked the crossing with several armored personnel carriers .
there were no reports of further exchanges or violent incidents during the afternoon but hundreds of kfor soldiers remained in the town on alert .
the fragile peace of the day remained in place across the country as more nato troops arrived . " it is tense but i am not aware of new incidents or explosions , " said a u.n. police spokesman in pristina .
" it is generally quieter . " almost 1,000 serbs have fled their homes and sought the protection of nato-led peacekeepers stationed in the province after violence flared up this week .
so far 31 people , both serbs and albanians , have been killed in kosovo 's worst outbreak of violence since the war ended five years ago . seven nato member states have rushed a total of 2000 reinforcement troops into kosovo to beef up the 18,000-strong force over the last two days .
germany announced that it was sending 600 more troops , raising the german contingent to 3800 .
france pledged to send an extra 400 and denmark promised an additional 100 .

secretary general kofi annan warned against an escalation of a conflict that could have " unpredictable consequences . "
during a heated security council session on thursday night , germany and the majority of the council squared off against serbia-montenegro and russia , who claimed the ethnic albanians in kosovo were solely responsible for the latest wave of violence .
german foreign minister joschka fischer called on both albanian and serb political leaders to defend democratic values and for the government of serbia-montenegro to prevent acts of revenge against albanians in serbia .
" we 're calling on everyone , on all sides , to immediately cease the violence , " fischer said .
fischer 's appeal was also explicitly stated in a joint security council statement issued after the meeting .
annan also condemned the riots . in the first wave of attacks , thousands of ethnic albanians sparred with nato peacekeepers , un staff , police and serbs and serb orthodox churches .
in retaliation , serbs then attacked mosques around the country . " the deliberate targeting of religious sights such as churches , cemeteries and monasteries is shameful and inexcusable , " annan said .

forget glamour , forget girl or boy bands : germans on friday chose a 22-year-old high school student with a receding hairline to compete in the eurovision song contest that will take place in istanbul in may . max , as the young man from the southwestern state of baden-württemberg is called , barely made it into friday night 's show after his song " ca n't wait until tonight , " a soul-full , quiet instrumental number , stormed the charts and qualified him to compete . a complete newcomer to the show business , he 'd been picked as the winner of a song contest on " tv total , " a late night comedy-cum-talk show hosted by stefan raab , who himself represented germany in the campy eurovision competition in 2000 . unlike his rivals in this year 's competition , who put on glitzy performances at a berlin concert hall , max offered little more than his voice , wearing jeans and a dark sweater and sitting on a bar stool on stage .
before the show , max had said he really did n't expect to win , adding that he plans to take his high school exams in four weeks . tv viewers , who chose the winner via telephone or cell phone text messages , overwhelmingly approved of max 's low-key performance .
in the end , more than 92 percent picked him over a techno band called scooter . the no-frills concept already helped germany win the contest once -lrb- and only once -rrb- before : in 1982 , a young woman called nicole delivered europe 's victorious song sitting on a chair and playing a white guitar .

troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force . as the first troops from the united states and britain landed in kosovo to boost peacekeeping forces on the ground on friday , the nato k-for soldiers raided apartment blocks in flashpoint kosovo towns after another night of violence . describing the continued fighting between serbs and albanians as the closest thing to ethnic cleansing since the end of the 1999 war , nato commanders ordered troops to swoop on areas where gunfire , rioting and arson attacks had forced 1000 serbs to flee their homes . " this kind of activity actually almost amounts to ethnic cleansing and it can not go on , " u.s. commander of nato forces for southern europe , admiral gregory johnson , told reporters in kosovo 's capital pristina .
" that 's why we came here in the first place . " k-for troops , originally sent into kosovo as peacekeepers , soon found their mission compromised in the early hours of friday morning when a huge blast rocked the small town of mitrovica , shaking a high-rise apartment block and sending terrified residents screaming out into the streets .
nato soldiers moved in quickly to evacuate the building but came under sniper fire .
after exchanges , the sniper was shot dead . as an uneasy calm settled on the serb-dominated northern part of the ethnically divided town , nato troops fell back to the bridge which cuts through mitrovica , and blocked the crossing with several armored personnel carriers .
there were no reports of further exchanges or violent incidents during the afternoon but hundreds of kfor soldiers remained in the town on alert .
the fragile peace of the day remained in place across the country as more nato troops arrived . " it is tense but i am not aware of new incidents or explosions , " said a u.n. police spokesman in pristina .
" it is generally quieter . " almost 1,000 serbs have fled their homes and sought the protection of nato-led peacekeepers stationed in the province after violence flared up this week .
so far 31 people , both serbs and albanians , have been killed in kosovo 's worst outbreak of violence since the war ended five years ago . seven nato member states have rushed a total of 2000 reinforcement troops into kosovo to beef up the 18,000-strong force over the last two days .
germany announced that it was sending 600 more troops , raising the german contingent to 3800 .
france pledged to send an extra 400 and denmark promised an additional 100 .
meanwhile , the first 150 soldiers of a promised 750-strong deployment of british troops landed in pristina , following the arrival of 150 u.s. troops and 80 italian carabinieri on thursday .
the united nations security council called on albanians and serbs to put an end to the unrest in kosovo .
secretary general kofi annan warned against an escalation of a conflict that could have " unpredictable consequences . "
during a heated security council session on thursday night , germany and the majority of the council squared off against serbia-montenegro and russia , who claimed the ethnic albanians in kosovo were solely responsible for the latest wave of violence .
german foreign minister joschka fischer called on both albanian and serb political leaders to defend democratic values and for the government of serbia-montenegro to prevent acts of revenge against albanians in serbia .
" we 're calling on everyone , on all sides , to immediately cease the violence , " fischer said .
fischer 's appeal was also explicitly stated in a joint security council statement issued after the meeting .
annan also condemned the riots . in the first wave of attacks , thousands of ethnic albanians sparred with nato peacekeepers , un staff , police and serbs and serb orthodox churches .
in retaliation , serbs then attacked mosques around the country . " the deliberate targeting of religious sights such as churches , cemeteries and monasteries is shameful and inexcusable , " annan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke billows from serbian orthodox church the serbs have accused kosovo 's ethnic albanians of inciting the riots .
serbia-montenegro 's foreign minister goran svilanovic said kosovo albanians alone were to blame for the violence - a position backed by serbia 's closest ally , russia . svilanovic also criticized the joint statement adopted by the security council , saying " such statements are understood and taken by the extremists as expressions of weakness . "
the latest riots show that the underlying ethnic tensions between ethnic serbs and albanians still persist on a dangerous scale , even five years after the 1999 nato bombings .
" we have not come far enough , " annan said .
" mutual respect between different communities is still not the accepted norm that it should be . "
both annan and fischer called on leaders in the region to increase understanding and cooperation between different ethnic groups .
fischer said the people now had a choice between a " tolerant " and " democratic " society " or they live in chaos and misery .

troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force . as the first troops from the united states and britain landed in kosovo to boost peacekeeping forces on the ground on friday , the nato k-for soldiers raided apartment blocks in flashpoint kosovo towns after another night of violence . describing the continued fighting between serbs and albanians as the closest thing to ethnic cleansing since the end of the 1999 war , nato commanders ordered troops to swoop on areas where gunfire , rioting and arson attacks had forced 1000 serbs to flee their homes . " this kind of activity actually almost amounts to ethnic cleansing and it can not go on , " u.s. commander of nato forces for southern europe , admiral gregory johnson , told reporters in kosovo 's capital pristina .
" that 's why we came here in the first place . " k-for troops , originally sent into kosovo as peacekeepers , soon found their mission compromised in the early hours of friday morning when a huge blast rocked the small town of mitrovica , shaking a high-rise apartment block and sending terrified residents screaming out into the streets .
nato soldiers moved in quickly to evacuate the building but came under sniper fire .
after exchanges , the sniper was shot dead . as an uneasy calm settled on the serb-dominated northern part of the ethnically divided town , nato troops fell back to the bridge which cuts through mitrovica , and blocked the crossing with several armored personnel carriers .
there were no reports of further exchanges or violent incidents during the afternoon but hundreds of kfor soldiers remained in the town on alert .
the fragile peace of the day remained in place across the country as more nato troops arrived . " it is tense but i am not aware of new incidents or explosions , " said a u.n. police spokesman in pristina .
" it is generally quieter . " almost 1,000 serbs have fled their homes and sought the protection of nato-led peacekeepers stationed in the province after violence flared up this week .
so far 31 people , both serbs and albanians , have been killed in kosovo 's worst outbreak of violence since the war ended five years ago . seven nato member states have rushed a total of 2000 reinforcement troops into kosovo to beef up the 18,000-strong force over the last two days .
germany announced that it was sending 600 more troops , raising the german contingent to 3800 .
france pledged to send an extra 400 and denmark promised an additional 100 .
meanwhile , the first 150 soldiers of a promised 750-strong deployment of british troops landed in pristina , following the arrival of 150 u.s. troops and 80 italian carabinieri on thursday .
the united nations security council called on albanians and serbs to put an end to the unrest in kosovo .
secretary general kofi annan warned against an escalation of a conflict that could have " unpredictable consequences . "
during a heated security council session on thursday night , germany and the majority of the council squared off against serbia-montenegro and russia , who claimed the ethnic albanians in kosovo were solely responsible for the latest wave of violence .
german foreign minister joschka fischer called on both albanian and serb political leaders to defend democratic values and for the government of serbia-montenegro to prevent acts of revenge against albanians in serbia .
" we 're calling on everyone , on all sides , to immediately cease the violence , " fischer said .
fischer 's appeal was also explicitly stated in a joint security council statement issued after the meeting .
annan also condemned the riots . in the first wave of attacks , thousands of ethnic albanians sparred with nato peacekeepers , un staff , police and serbs and serb orthodox churches .
in retaliation , serbs then attacked mosques around the country . " the deliberate targeting of religious sights such as churches , cemeteries and monasteries is shameful and inexcusable , " annan said .

an in-house report by the european commission before the bombings took place criticized member states for not enacting anti-terror measures . chief among the complaints was a europe-wide arrest warrant , which five eu countries had yet to pass through their national legislatures .

troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force . as the first troops from the united states and britain landed in kosovo to boost peacekeeping forces on the ground on friday , the nato k-for soldiers raided apartment blocks in flashpoint kosovo towns after another night of violence . describing the continued fighting between serbs and albanians as the closest thing to ethnic cleansing since the end of the 1999 war , nato commanders ordered troops to swoop on areas where gunfire , rioting and arson attacks had forced 1000 serbs to flee their homes . " this kind of activity actually almost amounts to ethnic cleansing and it can not go on , " u.s. commander of nato forces for southern europe , admiral gregory johnson , told reporters in kosovo 's capital pristina .
" that 's why we came here in the first place . " k-for troops , originally sent into kosovo as peacekeepers , soon found their mission compromised in the early hours of friday morning when a huge blast rocked the small town of mitrovica , shaking a high-rise apartment block and sending terrified residents screaming out into the streets .
nato soldiers moved in quickly to evacuate the building but came under sniper fire .
after exchanges , the sniper was shot dead . as an uneasy calm settled on the serb-dominated northern part of the ethnically divided town , nato troops fell back to the bridge which cuts through mitrovica , and blocked the crossing with several armored personnel carriers .
there were no reports of further exchanges or violent incidents during the afternoon but hundreds of kfor soldiers remained in the town on alert .
the fragile peace of the day remained in place across the country as more nato troops arrived . " it is tense but i am not aware of new incidents or explosions , " said a u.n. police spokesman in pristina .
" it is generally quieter . " almost 1,000 serbs have fled their homes and sought the protection of nato-led peacekeepers stationed in the province after violence flared up this week .
so far 31 people , both serbs and albanians , have been killed in kosovo 's worst outbreak of violence since the war ended five years ago . seven nato member states have rushed a total of 2000 reinforcement troops into kosovo to beef up the 18,000-strong force over the last two days .
germany announced that it was sending 600 more troops , raising the german contingent to 3800 .
france pledged to send an extra 400 and denmark promised an additional 100 .
meanwhile , the first 150 soldiers of a promised 750-strong deployment of british troops landed in pristina , following the arrival of 150 u.s. troops and 80 italian carabinieri on thursday .
the united nations security council called on albanians and serbs to put an end to the unrest in kosovo .
secretary general kofi annan warned against an escalation of a conflict that could have " unpredictable consequences . "
during a heated security council session on thursday night , germany and the majority of the council squared off against serbia-montenegro and russia , who claimed the ethnic albanians in kosovo were solely responsible for the latest wave of violence .
german foreign minister joschka fischer called on both albanian and serb political leaders to defend democratic values and for the government of serbia-montenegro to prevent acts of revenge against albanians in serbia .
" we 're calling on everyone , on all sides , to immediately cease the violence , " fischer said .
fischer 's appeal was also explicitly stated in a joint security council statement issued after the meeting .
annan also condemned the riots . in the first wave of attacks , thousands of ethnic albanians sparred with nato peacekeepers , un staff , police and serbs and serb orthodox churches .
in retaliation , serbs then attacked mosques around the country . " the deliberate targeting of religious sights such as churches , cemeteries and monasteries is shameful and inexcusable , " annan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke billows from serbian orthodox church the serbs have accused kosovo 's ethnic albanians of inciting the riots .

"
the latest riots show that the underlying ethnic tensions between ethnic serbs and albanians still persist on a dangerous scale , even five years after the 1999 nato bombings .
" we have not come far enough , " annan said .
" mutual respect between different communities is still not the accepted norm that it should be . "

troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force . as the first troops from the united states and britain landed in kosovo to boost peacekeeping forces on the ground on friday , the nato k-for soldiers raided apartment blocks in flashpoint kosovo towns after another night of violence . describing the continued fighting between serbs and albanians as the closest thing to ethnic cleansing since the end of the 1999 war , nato commanders ordered troops to swoop on areas where gunfire , rioting and arson attacks had forced 1000 serbs to flee their homes . " this kind of activity actually almost amounts to ethnic cleansing and it can not go on , " u.s. commander of nato forces for southern europe , admiral gregory johnson , told reporters in kosovo 's capital pristina .
" that 's why we came here in the first place . " k-for troops , originally sent into kosovo as peacekeepers , soon found their mission compromised in the early hours of friday morning when a huge blast rocked the small town of mitrovica , shaking a high-rise apartment block and sending terrified residents screaming out into the streets .
nato soldiers moved in quickly to evacuate the building but came under sniper fire .
after exchanges , the sniper was shot dead . as an uneasy calm settled on the serb-dominated northern part of the ethnically divided town , nato troops fell back to the bridge which cuts through mitrovica , and blocked the crossing with several armored personnel carriers .
there were no reports of further exchanges or violent incidents during the afternoon but hundreds of kfor soldiers remained in the town on alert .
the fragile peace of the day remained in place across the country as more nato troops arrived . " it is tense but i am not aware of new incidents or explosions , " said a u.n. police spokesman in pristina .
" it is generally quieter . " almost 1,000 serbs have fled their homes and sought the protection of nato-led peacekeepers stationed in the province after violence flared up this week .
so far 31 people , both serbs and albanians , have been killed in kosovo 's worst outbreak of violence since the war ended five years ago . seven nato member states have rushed a total of 2000 reinforcement troops into kosovo to beef up the 18,000-strong force over the last two days .
germany announced that it was sending 600 more troops , raising the german contingent to 3800 .
france pledged to send an extra 400 and denmark promised an additional 100 .
meanwhile , the first 150 soldiers of a promised 750-strong deployment of british troops landed in pristina , following the arrival of 150 u.s. troops and 80 italian carabinieri on thursday .
the united nations security council called on albanians and serbs to put an end to the unrest in kosovo .
secretary general kofi annan warned against an escalation of a conflict that could have " unpredictable consequences . "
during a heated security council session on thursday night , germany and the majority of the council squared off against serbia-montenegro and russia , who claimed the ethnic albanians in kosovo were solely responsible for the latest wave of violence .
german foreign minister joschka fischer called on both albanian and serb political leaders to defend democratic values and for the government of serbia-montenegro to prevent acts of revenge against albanians in serbia .
" we 're calling on everyone , on all sides , to immediately cease the violence , " fischer said .
fischer 's appeal was also explicitly stated in a joint security council statement issued after the meeting .
annan also condemned the riots . in the first wave of attacks , thousands of ethnic albanians sparred with nato peacekeepers , un staff , police and serbs and serb orthodox churches .
in retaliation , serbs then attacked mosques around the country . " the deliberate targeting of religious sights such as churches , cemeteries and monasteries is shameful and inexcusable , " annan said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke billows from serbian orthodox church the serbs have accused kosovo 's ethnic albanians of inciting the riots .
serbia-montenegro 's foreign minister goran svilanovic said kosovo albanians alone were to blame for the violence - a position backed by serbia 's closest ally , russia . svilanovic also criticized the joint statement adopted by the security council , saying " such statements are understood and taken by the extremists as expressions of weakness . "
the latest riots show that the underlying ethnic tensions between ethnic serbs and albanians still persist on a dangerous scale , even five years after the 1999 nato bombings .
" we have not come far enough , " annan said .
" mutual respect between different communities is still not the accepted norm that it should be . "
both annan and fischer called on leaders in the region to increase understanding and cooperation between different ethnic groups .
fischer said the people now had a choice between a " tolerant " and " democratic " society " or they live in chaos and misery .

one and a half weeks before a crucial deadline , germany ’ s economics and environment ministers are still at odds over a plan to impose emissions trading certificates to industrial companies and energy producers . the emissions trading plan is to be submitted to the european commission at the end of march .
it ’ ll be part and parcel of the european union ’ s future trading in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emission certificates with the aim of achieving greenhouse gas output reductions as agreed under the 1997 kyoto protocol .
in line with kyoto , the european union remains committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent between 1990 and 2012 .
as the largest single economy within the bloc , germany is shouldering the heaviest burden .
as part of a voluntary deal struck between industry leaders and the government , it ’ ll have to reduce emissions by 21 percent .
pollution ration cards as of jan .
1 , 2005 , eu member states will start dealing with emission certificates .
companies in the industrial and energy sectors will be granted a certain number of certificates for co2 emissions .
if they produce more , they can buy certificates from other companies that have not exceeded their limits .
if they emit less , they can sell certificates to companies that would otherwise exceed the legal limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin .
but german environment minister jürgen trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- , of the green party , and economics minister wolfgang clement , of the social democrats , do n't see eye to eye on a number of issues .
it remains unclear just how many certificates can be issued , and to whom , according to reinhard loske , the environmental spokesman for the greens .
" environment minister trittin is in favor of doling out more certificates to gas power stations and less to the coal industry , " loske said .
" this has economics minister wolfgang clement up in arms because he fears that the domestic coal industry will suffer another blow as a result . "
but clement said there is still plenty of room for talks and a possible compromise .
" an agreement has not yet been reached , but there 's some time left for further negotiations , " he said .
" but i insist on a solution which does not represent a setback for german companies ' competitiveness . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement trittin has been trying hard to play down his ongoing row with clement -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he said industry leaders have insisted they get an amount of certificates so generous they would have no chance of getting approved by brussels .
" i think it would not be in the interest of german industry to try and drag its feet on the matter , " the environment minister said .
" we should really aim to reach agreement by the end of this month , and i will make this abundantly clear in the next round of negotiations . "
environment minister : business benefits trittin reckons that german companies as a whole would be among the biggest beneficiaries of certificate trading .
according to estimates by the environment ministry , many of the 2,600 german enterprises which fall under the eu program will be able to sell certificates abroad , generating a market in certificates worth as much as € 500 million -lrb- $ 617.4 million -rrb- a year . hardy graupner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry and greens at loggerheads over emissions plan german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- wales -pipe- muslim fear over chief 's warning bbc news / wales graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- magazine saturday , 20 march , 2004 , 10:22 gmt muslim fear over chief 's warning claims by wales ' newest chief constable that the millennium stadium in cardiff could be attacked by terrorists have had a mixed reaction .
although many people have said the warning by south wales police chief barbara wilding would not stop them visiting high-profile places , others were concerned her comments could make muslims feel they were under suspicion .
miss wilding , who took over as chief constable in january , has extensive expertise in the field of terrorism .
she told bbc wales that , because of the millennium stadium 's high profile , it could be a target for terror groups .
her comments came after her force took part in a two-day event in swansea to plan a co-ordinated response to a terrorist alert .
but community leader sheikh said hassan ismail , of butetown in cardiff said he believed many muslims would feel they were being singled out for suspicion .
" we feel that , because of what has happened in the middle east , and because of what has happened in some parts of the world , that the finger is being pointed at muslims .
everybody has to be looking for a muslim , " he said .
on friday , miss wilding insisted that muslims in south wales should not feel under attack in any way .
she appealed to people to continue to go about their normal business , so that the terrorists could not win .
she said great in-roads had been made into building trust and confidence with muslim communities across britain since 11 september , and information about suspicious individuals was coming from the communities themselves .
miss wilding called for vigilance after last week 's bombing of the madrid commuter trains .
she said targets had undoubtedly changed since the attack in which 202 people died .
cardiff , as a capital , was at risk , and the stadium with all its international tv exposure was a potential target for those wanting to cause maximum damage and loss of life .
" everyone sees london as the prime target , which is totally natural , but after 9-11 , we have to accept that things have changed , " she said .
" it 's not just authority , the establishment and vips -terrorists will attack anywhere . "

although many people have said the warning by south wales police chief barbara wilding would not stop them visiting high-profile places , others were concerned her comments could make muslims feel they were under suspicion .
miss wilding , who took over as chief constable in january , has extensive expertise in the field of terrorism .
she told bbc wales that , because of the millennium stadium 's high profile , it could be a target for terror groups .
her comments came after her force took part in a two-day event in swansea to plan a co-ordinated response to a terrorist alert .
but community leader sheikh said hassan ismail , of butetown in cardiff said he believed many muslims would feel they were being singled out for suspicion .
" we feel that , because of what has happened in the middle east , and because of what has happened in some parts of the world , that the finger is being pointed at muslims .
everybody has to be looking for a muslim , " he said .
wilding : ' expect the unexpected ' on friday , miss wilding insisted that muslims in south wales should not feel under attack in any way .
she appealed to people to continue to go about their normal business , so that the terrorists could not win .
she said great in-roads had been made into building trust and confidence with muslim communities across britain since 11 september , and information about suspicious individuals was coming from the communities themselves .
miss wilding called for vigilance after last week 's bombing of the madrid commuter trains .
she said targets had undoubtedly changed since the attack in which 202 people died .
cardiff , as a capital , was at risk , and the stadium with all its international tv exposure was a potential target for those wanting to cause maximum damage and loss of life .
" everyone sees london as the prime target , which is totally natural , but after 9-11 , we have to accept that things have changed , " she said .
" it 's not just authority , the establishment and vips -terrorists will attack anywhere . "
