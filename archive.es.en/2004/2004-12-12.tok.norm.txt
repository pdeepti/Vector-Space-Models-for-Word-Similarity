sunday marks the 25th anniversary of nato ’ s “ dual track decision . ” nuclear weapons are once again a timely issue .
last month , russia announced its intention to develop new atomic weapons .
his country had “ conducted tests of the latest nuclear rocket systems , ” russian president vladimir putin declared in a cryptic comment . on the other side of the world , us president george w. bush pushed for so-called mini-nukes for use as tactical battlefield weapons .
and in europe , france revealed plans to modernize its atomic weapons arsenal . yet , these recent announcements hardly caused a stir .
but 25 years ago , such decisions would have brought hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets .
that was the case when nato ’ s revealed its infamous “ dual track ” decision on dec .

however , the highly-advanced mobile rockets were not aimed at the united states , but at western europe .
this was of no great concern to the us , but german chancellor helmut schmidt pointed out the danger of the ss-20 ’ s to europe in 1977 . schmidt urged nato to counter the soviet threat , and nato responded by deciding to deploy over 100 pershing 2 and more than 400 cruise missiles in europe .
at the same time , schmidt offered a deal to the kremlin .
“ all europeans , also those in the soviet union , would be safer , if there were n't any rockets aimed at european targets , ” schmidt said .
“ therefore , our goal is for both sides eliminate these missiles . ” 300,000 protesters flock to bonn not everyone thought nato ’ s tactic would pay off .
critics feared the move would escalate the arms race in europe .
peace activists mobilized the west german people to protest the two-track decision , launching the “ peace weeks ” in 1980-81 .
“ peace groups explained the meaning of it to the people , ” martin stenner , who joined the movement , told deutsche welle .
“ everyone became an expert in matters like forewarning times and how many cruise missiles were stationed where in germany . ” nato gave the soviet union four years to come up with a solution or it would begin deploying the pershing 2 and cruise missiles .
the peace movement mobilized to hinder nato plans .
even politicians from chancellor schmidt ’ s own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- began joining the demonstrations , which reached a high point on oct .

“ we want to stop this ongoing weapons build-up that is choking us .
and we want to stop it where it ’ s occurring : here in central europe - here in germany , ” he cried . when the first pershing missiles were deployed in 1983 , another wave of protests was unleashed .
yet , the rockets would remain in germany only four years .
in december 1987 , the us and the soviet union signed the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- , which banned all 2,600 pershing 2 and ss-20 missiles . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powell re-buffed by nato us secretary of state colin powell 's " charm offensive " in europe bore little fruit on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.12.2004 round two in romanian presidential ballot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanians take to the polls again on sunday these are important days for the future of romania .
not only has the eu agreed to conclude membership talks with bucharest , but sunday also sees the second round of presidential elections . as incumbent romanian president , ion iliescu steps down after almost 15 years in office , prime minister adrian nastase , leader of the ex-communist social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- is locked in battle with traian basescu , the mayor of bucarest and leader of an opposition centrist alliance of liberals and democrats for the highest office in the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest mayor and presidential candidate , traian basescu the first round of polls in what is the most hotly contested ballot in post-communist romania , were inconclusive with neither candidate achieving a clear majority .
nastase emerged slightly ahead of basescu , sparking the latter to accuse him of poll-rigging ukrainian style . in the first instance , nastase rejected the accusations , but later said that the " small irregularities " which had occurred did not substantially affect the outcome of the ballot .
the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .
instead , he has been waiting to see the results of the second round . low voter turnout statistics from the central election office have shown that only 11 million of the 18 million people entitled to vote actually cast a ballot , with the highest number of those who did n't coming from the characteristically pro-european western part of the country . instead of being considered a show of voter apathy , the low turnout has been generally judged as a form of silent protest at opposition party candidate basescu , whose communist background was recently exposed .
the information came as a blow to many intellectuals , who now consider him as nothing grander than the " lesser of two evils . " both candidates have been courting the hungarian party , udmr , which traditionally receives the backing of the hungarian minority .
but the courtships came to an official end when the party called on its supporters to back prime minister nastase in the ballot .
but those 8 percent wo n't necessarily tip the balance . " one should not consider the hungarian voters as one block .
sociologists have established that the hungarian minority is divided .
the hungarians from the center of rumania are more likely to listen to the hungarian party , whereas the hungarian minority in the west of the country is more self-contained and tends to support liberal , pro-western policies , " political analyst emil hurezeanu told deutsche welle .
" so it is not the decisions of the hungarian party which count , but the mobilization of that half of the population that did n't turn out to vote the first time round . " the path to european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian prime minister adrian nastase whoever wins after the sunday ballot will be focussed on leading romania into the arms of the european union in 2007 , and with that in mind , the two candidates are running with similar policies promising to tackle corruption and secure the independence of the justice system . in his campaign , nastase has claimed to be in the throes of introducing a reform process , suggesting voters should vote for him and opt for continuity . " romania genuinely does need the continuity of a pro-west integration policy , but is that really in keeping with adrain nastase 's policies ? "
hurezeanu said . there is no foregone conclusion for sunday 's elections quite simply because nobody can estimate how many first round non-voters will make use of their right to cast a ballot . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania vote marred by fraud charges exit polls in key romanian elections are showing a likely win for the ruling social democrats .

not only has the eu agreed to conclude membership talks with bucharest , but sunday also sees the second round of presidential elections . as incumbent romanian president , ion iliescu steps down after almost 15 years in office , prime minister adrian nastase , leader of the ex-communist social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- is locked in battle with traian basescu , the mayor of bucarest and leader of an opposition centrist alliance of liberals and democrats for the highest office in the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest mayor and presidential candidate , traian basescu the first round of polls in what is the most hotly contested ballot in post-communist romania , were inconclusive with neither candidate achieving a clear majority .
nastase emerged slightly ahead of basescu , sparking the latter to accuse him of poll-rigging ukrainian style . in the first instance , nastase rejected the accusations , but later said that the " small irregularities " which had occurred did not substantially affect the outcome of the ballot .
the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .
instead , he has been waiting to see the results of the second round . low voter turnout statistics from the central election office have shown that only 11 million of the 18 million people entitled to vote actually cast a ballot , with the highest number of those who did n't coming from the characteristically pro-european western part of the country . instead of being considered a show of voter apathy , the low turnout has been generally judged as a form of silent protest at opposition party candidate basescu , whose communist background was recently exposed .
the information came as a blow to many intellectuals , who now consider him as nothing grander than the " lesser of two evils . " both candidates have been courting the hungarian party , udmr , which traditionally receives the backing of the hungarian minority .
but the courtships came to an official end when the party called on its supporters to back prime minister nastase in the ballot .

" the path to european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian prime minister adrian nastase whoever wins after the sunday ballot will be focussed on leading romania into the arms of the european union in 2007 , and with that in mind , the two candidates are running with similar policies promising to tackle corruption and secure the independence of the justice system . in his campaign , nastase has claimed to be in the throes of introducing a reform process , suggesting voters should vote for him and opt for continuity . " romania genuinely does need the continuity of a pro-west integration policy , but is that really in keeping with adrain nastase 's policies ? "

the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .
instead , he has been waiting to see the results of the second round . low voter turnout statistics from the central election office have shown that only 11 million of the 18 million people entitled to vote actually cast a ballot , with the highest number of those who did n't coming from the characteristically pro-european western part of the country . instead of being considered a show of voter apathy , the low turnout has been generally judged as a form of silent protest at opposition party candidate basescu , whose communist background was recently exposed .
the information came as a blow to many intellectuals , who now consider him as nothing grander than the " lesser of two evils . " both candidates have been courting the hungarian party , udmr , which traditionally receives the backing of the hungarian minority .
but the courtships came to an official end when the party called on its supporters to back prime minister nastase in the ballot .
but those 8 percent wo n't necessarily tip the balance . " one should not consider the hungarian voters as one block .
sociologists have established that the hungarian minority is divided .
the hungarians from the center of rumania are more likely to listen to the hungarian party , whereas the hungarian minority in the west of the country is more self-contained and tends to support liberal , pro-western policies , " political analyst emil hurezeanu told deutsche welle .
" so it is not the decisions of the hungarian party which count , but the mobilization of that half of the population that did n't turn out to vote the first time round . " the path to european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian prime minister adrian nastase whoever wins after the sunday ballot will be focussed on leading romania into the arms of the european union in 2007 , and with that in mind , the two candidates are running with similar policies promising to tackle corruption and secure the independence of the justice system . in his campaign , nastase has claimed to be in the throes of introducing a reform process , suggesting voters should vote for him and opt for continuity . " romania genuinely does need the continuity of a pro-west integration policy , but is that really in keeping with adrain nastase 's policies ? "
hurezeanu said . there is no foregone conclusion for sunday 's elections quite simply because nobody can estimate how many first round non-voters will make use of their right to cast a ballot . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania vote marred by fraud charges exit polls in key romanian elections are showing a likely win for the ruling social democrats .

after three years of stagnation , the economy grew 1.8 percent .
but you 'd never know from all the complaining that 's been going on . listening to most people talking about the state of the german economy , one might think the apocalypse were fast approaching .
but in reality , 2004 was a fairly respectable year : the economy grew , not amazingly , but it finally woke up from a three-year slumber ; the german stock market index , the dax , reported slow but steady growth ; and exporters reported record surpluses , beating analysts ' expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doom and gloom so why all the glum faces ?
perhaps there 's something in germans ' genes that causes them to see the glass half empty . or perhaps it 's that despite the good news on several fronts , developments around issues that hit consumers directly were often less than encouraging .
here 's a look at several of the salient economic matters of 2004 . dax doing well , but mistrusted while the dax has performed well for at least a year and a half , there is still a reluctance by a large swath of the german public to invest money in the market .
germans tend to be more risk averse than some nationalities , and a string of well-publicized initial public offerings -lrb- ipos -rrb- in 2004 that did n't go well increased market shyness . " people were watching developments very , very carefully , " according to klaus nieding of the german association for the protection of small shareholders .
" one phrase that might apply to the stock market these days is : ' it 's cool to be stingy . " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all stocks were winners that philosophy was helped along by the experience of those holding stocks in the internet service provider t-online .
it 's parent company , deutsche telekom , now wants to bring it back into the fold and is offering shareholders just under € 9 -lrb- $ 11.86 -rrb- per share , exactly one third of that the stock cost when it was first offered in early 2000 . the consumer blues while germans are n't pouring their money into the stock market , they also are n't pouring it into retailers ' cash registers .
the retail industry was one of the biggest complainers in 2004 , but that 's nothing new .
for years , its goes on binges bemoaning germans ' tight-fisted ways .
but the dirge provided a near constant background hum throughout 2004 . " private spending remains the achilles ' heel of the german economy , " said gustav horn of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
" and the rise in household income is too weak to expect a real upturn in spending . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping - germans are n't doing it economists say the fundaments of a real economic recovery are there , it 's just the consumer is not playing along , therefore dragging the recovery down . " we 've passed through the valley of tears , " said economic minister wolfgang clement , sounding something like a preacher trying to convince a doubtful congregation .
" germany is moving , in an upward direction .
i 'm telling you , things are going well again in germany . " export explosion the reason for the rosier-than-lately economic picture in germany can basically be ascribed to one thing : exports .
exports have always been an important component of germany 's economic engine , but in 2004 , they were pretty much the sole power source . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another new porsche heading overseas exporters enjoyed a record surplus this year of € 160 billion -lrb- $ 212 billion -rrb- . " we have an very strong export-driven economy right now , better than expected , " said martin rogowski , president of the german federation of industry .
exports this year were strong enough to make up for the nation 's stagnant construction sector and poor domestic demand . but the export party can only last so long , the diw 's horn wrote in a recent report .
most analysts predict german exports will lose steam because the global economy will grow less robustly than it did this year . others worry that the strength the euro will hurt exporters if it continues its meteoric rise in value , since it makes german goods abroad more expensive .
the european common currency has hit record highs against the dollar in the last week , reaching over $ 1.34 .
the market looks determined the drive the dollar down further in the near future and exporters are starting to feel the pinch . work longer , or do n't work many germans have been grumbling due to the debate this year about extending the number of hours worked in a week in several sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : longer work , same pay employees in some branches , such as manufacturing , had contracts stipulating 35-hour work weeks .
but industry leaders have been saying that in order to stay competitive , german employers need to work longer - 40 hours or perhaps more , and often with no concomitant rise in pay . " if the normal working week were 40 hours instead of 35 , that would mean a difference of 15 percent in personnel costs , " said rogowski . low-wage countries in asia and even next door in eastern europe have put pressure on employees and their unions to agree to employers ' demands .
industry leaders have been eager to play the wage card - either make concessions regarding hours or wages , or production will be shifted from stuttgart to slovakia , from essen to estonia . now that 's something to grumble about . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cloudy skies ahead for german growth a group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for germany 's economic growth , as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy .

sunday marks the 25th anniversary of nato ’ s “ dual track decision . ” nuclear weapons are once again a timely issue .
last month , russia announced its intention to develop new atomic weapons .
his country had “ conducted tests of the latest nuclear rocket systems , ” russian president vladimir putin declared in a cryptic comment . on the other side of the world , us president george w. bush pushed for so-called mini-nukes for use as tactical battlefield weapons .
and in europe , france revealed plans to modernize its atomic weapons arsenal . yet , these recent announcements hardly caused a stir .
but 25 years ago , such decisions would have brought hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets .
that was the case when nato ’ s revealed its infamous “ dual track ” decision on dec .

however , the highly-advanced mobile rockets were not aimed at the united states , but at western europe .
this was of no great concern to the us , but german chancellor helmut schmidt pointed out the danger of the ss-20 ’ s to europe in 1977 . schmidt urged nato to counter the soviet threat , and nato responded by deciding to deploy over 100 pershing 2 and more than 400 cruise missiles in europe .
at the same time , schmidt offered a deal to the kremlin .
“ all europeans , also those in the soviet union , would be safer , if there were n't any rockets aimed at european targets , ” schmidt said .
“ therefore , our goal is for both sides eliminate these missiles . ” 300,000 protesters flock to bonn not everyone thought nato ’ s tactic would pay off .
critics feared the move would escalate the arms race in europe .
peace activists mobilized the west german people to protest the two-track decision , launching the “ peace weeks ” in 1980-81 .
“ peace groups explained the meaning of it to the people , ” martin stenner , who joined the movement , told deutsche welle .
“ everyone became an expert in matters like forewarning times and how many cruise missiles were stationed where in germany . ” nato gave the soviet union four years to come up with a solution or it would begin deploying the pershing 2 and cruise missiles .
the peace movement mobilized to hinder nato plans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.12.2004 round two in romanian presidential ballot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanians take to the polls again on sunday these are important days for the future of romania .
not only has the eu agreed to conclude membership talks with bucharest , but sunday also sees the second round of presidential elections . as incumbent romanian president , ion iliescu steps down after almost 15 years in office , prime minister adrian nastase , leader of the ex-communist social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- is locked in battle with traian basescu , the mayor of bucarest and leader of an opposition centrist alliance of liberals and democrats for the highest office in the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest mayor and presidential candidate , traian basescu the first round of polls in what is the most hotly contested ballot in post-communist romania , were inconclusive with neither candidate achieving a clear majority .
nastase emerged slightly ahead of basescu , sparking the latter to accuse him of poll-rigging ukrainian style . in the first instance , nastase rejected the accusations , but later said that the " small irregularities " which had occurred did not substantially affect the outcome of the ballot .
the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .
instead , he has been waiting to see the results of the second round . low voter turnout statistics from the central election office have shown that only 11 million of the 18 million people entitled to vote actually cast a ballot , with the highest number of those who did n't coming from the characteristically pro-european western part of the country . instead of being considered a show of voter apathy , the low turnout has been generally judged as a form of silent protest at opposition party candidate basescu , whose communist background was recently exposed .
the information came as a blow to many intellectuals , who now consider him as nothing grander than the " lesser of two evils . " both candidates have been courting the hungarian party , udmr , which traditionally receives the backing of the hungarian minority .
but the courtships came to an official end when the party called on its supporters to back prime minister nastase in the ballot .
but those 8 percent wo n't necessarily tip the balance . " one should not consider the hungarian voters as one block .
sociologists have established that the hungarian minority is divided .
the hungarians from the center of rumania are more likely to listen to the hungarian party , whereas the hungarian minority in the west of the country is more self-contained and tends to support liberal , pro-western policies , " political analyst emil hurezeanu told deutsche welle .
" so it is not the decisions of the hungarian party which count , but the mobilization of that half of the population that did n't turn out to vote the first time round . " the path to european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian prime minister adrian nastase whoever wins after the sunday ballot will be focussed on leading romania into the arms of the european union in 2007 , and with that in mind , the two candidates are running with similar policies promising to tackle corruption and secure the independence of the justice system . in his campaign , nastase has claimed to be in the throes of introducing a reform process , suggesting voters should vote for him and opt for continuity . " romania genuinely does need the continuity of a pro-west integration policy , but is that really in keeping with adrain nastase 's policies ? "
hurezeanu said . there is no foregone conclusion for sunday 's elections quite simply because nobody can estimate how many first round non-voters will make use of their right to cast a ballot . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania vote marred by fraud charges exit polls in key romanian elections are showing a likely win for the ruling social democrats .

not only has the eu agreed to conclude membership talks with bucharest , but sunday also sees the second round of presidential elections . as incumbent romanian president , ion iliescu steps down after almost 15 years in office , prime minister adrian nastase , leader of the ex-communist social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- is locked in battle with traian basescu , the mayor of bucarest and leader of an opposition centrist alliance of liberals and democrats for the highest office in the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest mayor and presidential candidate , traian basescu the first round of polls in what is the most hotly contested ballot in post-communist romania , were inconclusive with neither candidate achieving a clear majority .
nastase emerged slightly ahead of basescu , sparking the latter to accuse him of poll-rigging ukrainian style . in the first instance , nastase rejected the accusations , but later said that the " small irregularities " which had occurred did not substantially affect the outcome of the ballot .
the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .
instead , he has been waiting to see the results of the second round . low voter turnout statistics from the central election office have shown that only 11 million of the 18 million people entitled to vote actually cast a ballot , with the highest number of those who did n't coming from the characteristically pro-european western part of the country . instead of being considered a show of voter apathy , the low turnout has been generally judged as a form of silent protest at opposition party candidate basescu , whose communist background was recently exposed .
the information came as a blow to many intellectuals , who now consider him as nothing grander than the " lesser of two evils . " both candidates have been courting the hungarian party , udmr , which traditionally receives the backing of the hungarian minority .
but the courtships came to an official end when the party called on its supporters to back prime minister nastase in the ballot .

" romania genuinely does need the continuity of a pro-west integration policy , but is that really in keeping with adrain nastase 's policies ? "

dresden 's particularly well-known for its version , which became a hotly traded good during communist times . shaped like an oblong , flat loaf of bread , studded with almonds and raisins and flavoured with orange and lemon , the stollen was first created in the ovens of the eastern city of dresden almost 600 years ago . so important is the cake to the city that bakers must meet a stringent quality test in order to be able to call their products genuine " dresden stollen . " hans-jürgen matzker heads the association for the protection of dresden stollen , which represents 150 producers , and sets the quality test .
he said that to judge the role stollen plays in dresden life , you only have to look at the figures for his small , pink-walled bakery in the city 's suburbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dresden baker with stollen cakes " the production of stollen represents 20 percent of our annual turnover , " matzker told afp , taking a short break from a hectic work day . from mid-october to january , matzker and his 27 employees work virtually flat out to satisfy the demand for his stollen which scores 18.3 points out of a possible 20 in the association 's quality test score . predecessor an austere affair the first stollen in the middle ages was a more austere affair - a dry cake made of flour , yeast and water which nourished people through the fasting period leading up to christmas .
it was known as " christbrod " -lrb- " bread of christ " -rrb- and because of its shape , it represented the swaddled body of the infant jesus . in the 15th century , the electoral princes of the then independent state of saxony found the cake too dry and in 1491 they were granted permission by pope innocent viii to add butter to the recipe . centuries later , matzker and his fellow bakers had to use all their ingenuity when confronted with the food shortages of communist rule in east germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker ronald morenz from dresden is pulling a stollen out of the oven " when we could n't get any candied lemon peel , we used small green tomatoes and soaked them in a sugary solution , then glazed them , " he recalled .
" they had a sweet taste , but they did n't taste of tomatoes . " communist currency the stollen also became a form of currency in communist times . unlike the nationalized industries , bakers were not allowed to export their goods but their customers would buy them by the dozen and send them to friends or relatives on the other side of the iron curtain in exchange for precious deutsche marks . when the berlin wall fell in 1989 and germany was reunified a year later , sales of stollen dropped because the people of saxony no longer needed to exchange the cakes for western currency . " we had to find new ways to sell our wares , " said matzker , whose father and grandfather were bakers too . going global so he now gives guided tours of the bakery to tourists and has specialized in mail order , sending his cakes around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker marlies morenz gets a stollen ready for shipping his customers include germans living as far away as the united states , canada and australia . " for someone from saxony , even if he left 50 years ago , a christmas without stollen is a sad christmas , " matzker said . and what makes them homesick is the prospect of biting into a slice of freshly baked stollen at teatime in the build-up to christmas in this semi-mountainous area where fir trees stretch up the hillsides .

it was known as " christbrod " -lrb- " bread of christ " -rrb- and because of its shape , it represented the swaddled body of the infant jesus . in the 15th century , the electoral princes of the then independent state of saxony found the cake too dry and in 1491 they were granted permission by pope innocent viii to add butter to the recipe . centuries later , matzker and his fellow bakers had to use all their ingenuity when confronted with the food shortages of communist rule in east germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker ronald morenz from dresden is pulling a stollen out of the oven " when we could n't get any candied lemon peel , we used small green tomatoes and soaked them in a sugary solution , then glazed them , " he recalled .
" they had a sweet taste , but they did n't taste of tomatoes . " communist currency the stollen also became a form of currency in communist times . unlike the nationalized industries , bakers were not allowed to export their goods but their customers would buy them by the dozen and send them to friends or relatives on the other side of the iron curtain in exchange for precious deutsche marks . when the berlin wall fell in 1989 and germany was reunified a year later , sales of stollen dropped because the people of saxony no longer needed to exchange the cakes for western currency . " we had to find new ways to sell our wares , " said matzker , whose father and grandfather were bakers too . going global so he now gives guided tours of the bakery to tourists and has specialized in mail order , sending his cakes around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker marlies morenz gets a stollen ready for shipping his customers include germans living as far away as the united states , canada and australia . " for someone from saxony , even if he left 50 years ago , a christmas without stollen is a sad christmas , " matzker said . and what makes them homesick is the prospect of biting into a slice of freshly baked stollen at teatime in the build-up to christmas in this semi-mountainous area where fir trees stretch up the hillsides . " we celebrate christmas in a big way , " matzker said before returning to his ovens .

" unfortunately , the opposition in germany seems to believe that it can make domestic politics out of our wish to join the european union , " erdogan was quoted by the mass-market bild am sonntag newspaper as saying .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.12.2004 round two in romanian presidential ballot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanians take to the polls again on sunday these are important days for the future of romania .
not only has the eu agreed to conclude membership talks with bucharest , but sunday also sees the second round of presidential elections . as incumbent romanian president , ion iliescu steps down after almost 15 years in office , prime minister adrian nastase , leader of the ex-communist social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- is locked in battle with traian basescu , the mayor of bucarest and leader of an opposition centrist alliance of liberals and democrats for the highest office in the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest mayor and presidential candidate , traian basescu the first round of polls in what is the most hotly contested ballot in post-communist romania , were inconclusive with neither candidate achieving a clear majority .
nastase emerged slightly ahead of basescu , sparking the latter to accuse him of poll-rigging ukrainian style . in the first instance , nastase rejected the accusations , but later said that the " small irregularities " which had occurred did not substantially affect the outcome of the ballot .
the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .
instead , he has been waiting to see the results of the second round . low voter turnout statistics from the central election office have shown that only 11 million of the 18 million people entitled to vote actually cast a ballot , with the highest number of those who did n't coming from the characteristically pro-european western part of the country . instead of being considered a show of voter apathy , the low turnout has been generally judged as a form of silent protest at opposition party candidate basescu , whose communist background was recently exposed .
the information came as a blow to many intellectuals , who now consider him as nothing grander than the " lesser of two evils . " both candidates have been courting the hungarian party , udmr , which traditionally receives the backing of the hungarian minority .
but the courtships came to an official end when the party called on its supporters to back prime minister nastase in the ballot .
but those 8 percent wo n't necessarily tip the balance . " one should not consider the hungarian voters as one block .
sociologists have established that the hungarian minority is divided .
the hungarians from the center of rumania are more likely to listen to the hungarian party , whereas the hungarian minority in the west of the country is more self-contained and tends to support liberal , pro-western policies , " political analyst emil hurezeanu told deutsche welle .
" so it is not the decisions of the hungarian party which count , but the mobilization of that half of the population that did n't turn out to vote the first time round . " the path to european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian prime minister adrian nastase whoever wins after the sunday ballot will be focussed on leading romania into the arms of the european union in 2007 , and with that in mind , the two candidates are running with similar policies promising to tackle corruption and secure the independence of the justice system . in his campaign , nastase has claimed to be in the throes of introducing a reform process , suggesting voters should vote for him and opt for continuity . " romania genuinely does need the continuity of a pro-west integration policy , but is that really in keeping with adrain nastase 's policies ? "
hurezeanu said . there is no foregone conclusion for sunday 's elections quite simply because nobody can estimate how many first round non-voters will make use of their right to cast a ballot . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania vote marred by fraud charges exit polls in key romanian elections are showing a likely win for the ruling social democrats .

not only has the eu agreed to conclude membership talks with bucharest , but sunday also sees the second round of presidential elections . as incumbent romanian president , ion iliescu steps down after almost 15 years in office , prime minister adrian nastase , leader of the ex-communist social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- is locked in battle with traian basescu , the mayor of bucarest and leader of an opposition centrist alliance of liberals and democrats for the highest office in the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest mayor and presidential candidate , traian basescu the first round of polls in what is the most hotly contested ballot in post-communist romania , were inconclusive with neither candidate achieving a clear majority .
nastase emerged slightly ahead of basescu , sparking the latter to accuse him of poll-rigging ukrainian style . in the first instance , nastase rejected the accusations , but later said that the " small irregularities " which had occurred did not substantially affect the outcome of the ballot .
the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .
instead , he has been waiting to see the results of the second round . low voter turnout statistics from the central election office have shown that only 11 million of the 18 million people entitled to vote actually cast a ballot , with the highest number of those who did n't coming from the characteristically pro-european western part of the country . instead of being considered a show of voter apathy , the low turnout has been generally judged as a form of silent protest at opposition party candidate basescu , whose communist background was recently exposed .
the information came as a blow to many intellectuals , who now consider him as nothing grander than the " lesser of two evils . " both candidates have been courting the hungarian party , udmr , which traditionally receives the backing of the hungarian minority .
but the courtships came to an official end when the party called on its supporters to back prime minister nastase in the ballot .
but those 8 percent wo n't necessarily tip the balance . " one should not consider the hungarian voters as one block .
sociologists have established that the hungarian minority is divided .
the hungarians from the center of rumania are more likely to listen to the hungarian party , whereas the hungarian minority in the west of the country is more self-contained and tends to support liberal , pro-western policies , " political analyst emil hurezeanu told deutsche welle .
" so it is not the decisions of the hungarian party which count , but the mobilization of that half of the population that did n't turn out to vote the first time round . " the path to european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian prime minister adrian nastase whoever wins after the sunday ballot will be focussed on leading romania into the arms of the european union in 2007 , and with that in mind , the two candidates are running with similar policies promising to tackle corruption and secure the independence of the justice system . in his campaign , nastase has claimed to be in the throes of introducing a reform process , suggesting voters should vote for him and opt for continuity . " romania genuinely does need the continuity of a pro-west integration policy , but is that really in keeping with adrain nastase 's policies ? "
hurezeanu said . there is no foregone conclusion for sunday 's elections quite simply because nobody can estimate how many first round non-voters will make use of their right to cast a ballot . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania vote marred by fraud charges exit polls in key romanian elections are showing a likely win for the ruling social democrats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.12.2004 moaning and groaning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economy was in better spirits in 2004 , but germans were n't germans should be pretty happy with the country 's economic performance in 2004 .
after three years of stagnation , the economy grew 1.8 percent .
but you 'd never know from all the complaining that 's been going on . listening to most people talking about the state of the german economy , one might think the apocalypse were fast approaching .
but in reality , 2004 was a fairly respectable year : the economy grew , not amazingly , but it finally woke up from a three-year slumber ; the german stock market index , the dax , reported slow but steady growth ; and exporters reported record surpluses , beating analysts ' expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doom and gloom so why all the glum faces ?
perhaps there 's something in germans ' genes that causes them to see the glass half empty . or perhaps it 's that despite the good news on several fronts , developments around issues that hit consumers directly were often less than encouraging .
here 's a look at several of the salient economic matters of 2004 . dax doing well , but mistrusted while the dax has performed well for at least a year and a half , there is still a reluctance by a large swath of the german public to invest money in the market .
germans tend to be more risk averse than some nationalities , and a string of well-publicized initial public offerings -lrb- ipos -rrb- in 2004 that did n't go well increased market shyness . " people were watching developments very , very carefully , " according to klaus nieding of the german association for the protection of small shareholders .
" one phrase that might apply to the stock market these days is : ' it 's cool to be stingy . " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all stocks were winners that philosophy was helped along by the experience of those holding stocks in the internet service provider t-online .
it 's parent company , deutsche telekom , now wants to bring it back into the fold and is offering shareholders just under € 9 -lrb- $ 11.86 -rrb- per share , exactly one third of that the stock cost when it was first offered in early 2000 . the consumer blues while germans are n't pouring their money into the stock market , they also are n't pouring it into retailers ' cash registers .
the retail industry was one of the biggest complainers in 2004 , but that 's nothing new .
for years , its goes on binges bemoaning germans ' tight-fisted ways .
but the dirge provided a near constant background hum throughout 2004 . " private spending remains the achilles ' heel of the german economy , " said gustav horn of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
" and the rise in household income is too weak to expect a real upturn in spending . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping - germans are n't doing it economists say the fundaments of a real economic recovery are there , it 's just the consumer is not playing along , therefore dragging the recovery down . " we 've passed through the valley of tears , " said economic minister wolfgang clement , sounding something like a preacher trying to convince a doubtful congregation .
" germany is moving , in an upward direction .
i 'm telling you , things are going well again in germany . " export explosion the reason for the rosier-than-lately economic picture in germany can basically be ascribed to one thing : exports .
exports have always been an important component of germany 's economic engine , but in 2004 , they were pretty much the sole power source . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another new porsche heading overseas exporters enjoyed a record surplus this year of € 160 billion -lrb- $ 212 billion -rrb- . " we have an very strong export-driven economy right now , better than expected , " said martin rogowski , president of the german federation of industry .
exports this year were strong enough to make up for the nation 's stagnant construction sector and poor domestic demand . but the export party can only last so long , the diw 's horn wrote in a recent report .
most analysts predict german exports will lose steam because the global economy will grow less robustly than it did this year . others worry that the strength the euro will hurt exporters if it continues its meteoric rise in value , since it makes german goods abroad more expensive .
the european common currency has hit record highs against the dollar in the last week , reaching over $ 1.34 .
the market looks determined the drive the dollar down further in the near future and exporters are starting to feel the pinch . work longer , or do n't work many germans have been grumbling due to the debate this year about extending the number of hours worked in a week in several sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : longer work , same pay employees in some branches , such as manufacturing , had contracts stipulating 35-hour work weeks .
but industry leaders have been saying that in order to stay competitive , german employers need to work longer - 40 hours or perhaps more , and often with no concomitant rise in pay . " if the normal working week were 40 hours instead of 35 , that would mean a difference of 15 percent in personnel costs , " said rogowski . low-wage countries in asia and even next door in eastern europe have put pressure on employees and their unions to agree to employers ' demands .
industry leaders have been eager to play the wage card - either make concessions regarding hours or wages , or production will be shifted from stuttgart to slovakia , from essen to estonia . now that 's something to grumble about . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cloudy skies ahead for german growth a group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for germany 's economic growth , as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy .

17 , 2004 -rrb- strong euro sparks export fears the euro is climbing from strength to strength .
on its flight of force , it briefly crossed the $ 1.30 threshold , and is showing no sign of dropping back down to earth .
but what are the implications for the economy ?

15 , 2004 -rrb- gloom deepens over german economy the german economy is recovering , but the modest upturn will lose momentum as early as next year as a result of surging oil prices and a slowdown in exports , leading economic research institutes said tuesday .

his country had “ conducted tests of the latest nuclear rocket systems , ” russian president vladimir putin declared in a cryptic comment . on the other side of the world , us president george w. bush pushed for so-called mini-nukes for use as tactical battlefield weapons .
and in europe , france revealed plans to modernize its atomic weapons arsenal . yet , these recent announcements hardly caused a stir .
but 25 years ago , such decisions would have brought hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets .
that was the case when nato ’ s revealed its infamous “ dual track ” decision on dec .
12 , 1979 . the strategy was a kind of carrot-and-stick approach intended to reduce nuclear arsenals .
nato announced its intention to deploy short and medium-range missiles in western europe , but promised to eliminate them if moscow removed similar rockets from its arsenal . balance in europe threatened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor helmut schmidt faced opposition at home in the mid-1970s , the soviet union developed the medium-range ss-20 missile .
however , the highly-advanced mobile rockets were not aimed at the united states , but at western europe .
this was of no great concern to the us , but german chancellor helmut schmidt pointed out the danger of the ss-20 ’ s to europe in 1977 . schmidt urged nato to counter the soviet threat , and nato responded by deciding to deploy over 100 pershing 2 and more than 400 cruise missiles in europe .
at the same time , schmidt offered a deal to the kremlin .
“ all europeans , also those in the soviet union , would be safer , if there were n't any rockets aimed at european targets , ” schmidt said .
“ therefore , our goal is for both sides eliminate these missiles . ” 300,000 protesters flock to bonn not everyone thought nato ’ s tactic would pay off .
critics feared the move would escalate the arms race in europe .
peace activists mobilized the west german people to protest the two-track decision , launching the “ peace weeks ” in 1980-81 .
“ peace groups explained the meaning of it to the people , ” martin stenner , who joined the movement , told deutsche welle .
“ everyone became an expert in matters like forewarning times and how many cruise missiles were stationed where in germany . ” nato gave the soviet union four years to come up with a solution or it would begin deploying the pershing 2 and cruise missiles .
the peace movement mobilized to hinder nato plans .
even politicians from chancellor schmidt ’ s own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- began joining the demonstrations , which reached a high point on oct .
10 , 1981 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace demonstrators came out in the thousands in bonn on that day , more than 300,000 demonstrators gathered in bonn .
spd politician erhard eppler joined the crowds .
“ we want to stop this ongoing weapons build-up that is choking us .
and we want to stop it where it ’ s occurring : here in central europe - here in germany , ” he cried . when the first pershing missiles were deployed in 1983 , another wave of protests was unleashed .
yet , the rockets would remain in germany only four years .
in december 1987 , the us and the soviet union signed the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- , which banned all 2,600 pershing 2 and ss-20 missiles . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powell re-buffed by nato us secretary of state colin powell 's " charm offensive " in europe bore little fruit on thursday .

dresden 's particularly well-known for its version , which became a hotly traded good during communist times . shaped like an oblong , flat loaf of bread , studded with almonds and raisins and flavoured with orange and lemon , the stollen was first created in the ovens of the eastern city of dresden almost 600 years ago . so important is the cake to the city that bakers must meet a stringent quality test in order to be able to call their products genuine " dresden stollen . " hans-jürgen matzker heads the association for the protection of dresden stollen , which represents 150 producers , and sets the quality test .
he said that to judge the role stollen plays in dresden life , you only have to look at the figures for his small , pink-walled bakery in the city 's suburbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dresden baker with stollen cakes " the production of stollen represents 20 percent of our annual turnover , " matzker told afp , taking a short break from a hectic work day . from mid-october to january , matzker and his 27 employees work virtually flat out to satisfy the demand for his stollen which scores 18.3 points out of a possible 20 in the association 's quality test score . predecessor an austere affair the first stollen in the middle ages was a more austere affair - a dry cake made of flour , yeast and water which nourished people through the fasting period leading up to christmas .
it was known as " christbrod " -lrb- " bread of christ " -rrb- and because of its shape , it represented the swaddled body of the infant jesus . in the 15th century , the electoral princes of the then independent state of saxony found the cake too dry and in 1491 they were granted permission by pope innocent viii to add butter to the recipe . centuries later , matzker and his fellow bakers had to use all their ingenuity when confronted with the food shortages of communist rule in east germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker ronald morenz from dresden is pulling a stollen out of the oven " when we could n't get any candied lemon peel , we used small green tomatoes and soaked them in a sugary solution , then glazed them , " he recalled .
" they had a sweet taste , but they did n't taste of tomatoes . " communist currency the stollen also became a form of currency in communist times . unlike the nationalized industries , bakers were not allowed to export their goods but their customers would buy them by the dozen and send them to friends or relatives on the other side of the iron curtain in exchange for precious deutsche marks . when the berlin wall fell in 1989 and germany was reunified a year later , sales of stollen dropped because the people of saxony no longer needed to exchange the cakes for western currency . " we had to find new ways to sell our wares , " said matzker , whose father and grandfather were bakers too . going global so he now gives guided tours of the bakery to tourists and has specialized in mail order , sending his cakes around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker marlies morenz gets a stollen ready for shipping his customers include germans living as far away as the united states , canada and australia . " for someone from saxony , even if he left 50 years ago , a christmas without stollen is a sad christmas , " matzker said . and what makes them homesick is the prospect of biting into a slice of freshly baked stollen at teatime in the build-up to christmas in this semi-mountainous area where fir trees stretch up the hillsides . " we celebrate christmas in a big way , " matzker said before returning to his ovens .

not only has the eu agreed to conclude membership talks with bucharest , but sunday also sees the second round of presidential elections . as incumbent romanian president , ion iliescu steps down after almost 15 years in office , prime minister adrian nastase , leader of the ex-communist social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- is locked in battle with traian basescu , the mayor of bucarest and leader of an opposition centrist alliance of liberals and democrats for the highest office in the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest mayor and presidential candidate , traian basescu the first round of polls in what is the most hotly contested ballot in post-communist romania , were inconclusive with neither candidate achieving a clear majority .
nastase emerged slightly ahead of basescu , sparking the latter to accuse him of poll-rigging ukrainian style . in the first instance , nastase rejected the accusations , but later said that the " small irregularities " which had occurred did not substantially affect the outcome of the ballot .
the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .
instead , he has been waiting to see the results of the second round . low voter turnout statistics from the central election office have shown that only 11 million of the 18 million people entitled to vote actually cast a ballot , with the highest number of those who did n't coming from the characteristically pro-european western part of the country . instead of being considered a show of voter apathy , the low turnout has been generally judged as a form of silent protest at opposition party candidate basescu , whose communist background was recently exposed .
the information came as a blow to many intellectuals , who now consider him as nothing grander than the " lesser of two evils . " both candidates have been courting the hungarian party , udmr , which traditionally receives the backing of the hungarian minority .
but the courtships came to an official end when the party called on its supporters to back prime minister nastase in the ballot .
but those 8 percent wo n't necessarily tip the balance . " one should not consider the hungarian voters as one block .
sociologists have established that the hungarian minority is divided .
the hungarians from the center of rumania are more likely to listen to the hungarian party , whereas the hungarian minority in the west of the country is more self-contained and tends to support liberal , pro-western policies , " political analyst emil hurezeanu told deutsche welle .
" so it is not the decisions of the hungarian party which count , but the mobilization of that half of the population that did n't turn out to vote the first time round . " the path to european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian prime minister adrian nastase whoever wins after the sunday ballot will be focussed on leading romania into the arms of the european union in 2007 , and with that in mind , the two candidates are running with similar policies promising to tackle corruption and secure the independence of the justice system . in his campaign , nastase has claimed to be in the throes of introducing a reform process , suggesting voters should vote for him and opt for continuity . " romania genuinely does need the continuity of a pro-west integration policy , but is that really in keeping with adrain nastase 's policies ? "
hurezeanu said . there is no foregone conclusion for sunday 's elections quite simply because nobody can estimate how many first round non-voters will make use of their right to cast a ballot . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania vote marred by fraud charges exit polls in key romanian elections are showing a likely win for the ruling social democrats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.12.2004 round two in romanian presidential ballot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanians take to the polls again on sunday these are important days for the future of romania .
not only has the eu agreed to conclude membership talks with bucharest , but sunday also sees the second round of presidential elections . as incumbent romanian president , ion iliescu steps down after almost 15 years in office , prime minister adrian nastase , leader of the ex-communist social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- is locked in battle with traian basescu , the mayor of bucarest and leader of an opposition centrist alliance of liberals and democrats for the highest office in the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest mayor and presidential candidate , traian basescu the first round of polls in what is the most hotly contested ballot in post-communist romania , were inconclusive with neither candidate achieving a clear majority .
nastase emerged slightly ahead of basescu , sparking the latter to accuse him of poll-rigging ukrainian style . in the first instance , nastase rejected the accusations , but later said that the " small irregularities " which had occurred did not substantially affect the outcome of the ballot .
the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .
instead , he has been waiting to see the results of the second round . low voter turnout statistics from the central election office have shown that only 11 million of the 18 million people entitled to vote actually cast a ballot , with the highest number of those who did n't coming from the characteristically pro-european western part of the country . instead of being considered a show of voter apathy , the low turnout has been generally judged as a form of silent protest at opposition party candidate basescu , whose communist background was recently exposed .
the information came as a blow to many intellectuals , who now consider him as nothing grander than the " lesser of two evils . " both candidates have been courting the hungarian party , udmr , which traditionally receives the backing of the hungarian minority .
but the courtships came to an official end when the party called on its supporters to back prime minister nastase in the ballot .
but those 8 percent wo n't necessarily tip the balance . " one should not consider the hungarian voters as one block .
sociologists have established that the hungarian minority is divided .
the hungarians from the center of rumania are more likely to listen to the hungarian party , whereas the hungarian minority in the west of the country is more self-contained and tends to support liberal , pro-western policies , " political analyst emil hurezeanu told deutsche welle .
" so it is not the decisions of the hungarian party which count , but the mobilization of that half of the population that did n't turn out to vote the first time round . " the path to european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian prime minister adrian nastase whoever wins after the sunday ballot will be focussed on leading romania into the arms of the european union in 2007 , and with that in mind , the two candidates are running with similar policies promising to tackle corruption and secure the independence of the justice system . in his campaign , nastase has claimed to be in the throes of introducing a reform process , suggesting voters should vote for him and opt for continuity . " romania genuinely does need the continuity of a pro-west integration policy , but is that really in keeping with adrain nastase 's policies ? "
hurezeanu said . there is no foregone conclusion for sunday 's elections quite simply because nobody can estimate how many first round non-voters will make use of their right to cast a ballot . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania vote marred by fraud charges exit polls in key romanian elections are showing a likely win for the ruling social democrats .

after three years of stagnation , the economy grew 1.8 percent .
but you 'd never know from all the complaining that 's been going on . listening to most people talking about the state of the german economy , one might think the apocalypse were fast approaching .
but in reality , 2004 was a fairly respectable year : the economy grew , not amazingly , but it finally woke up from a three-year slumber ; the german stock market index , the dax , reported slow but steady growth ; and exporters reported record surpluses , beating analysts ' expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doom and gloom so why all the glum faces ?
perhaps there 's something in germans ' genes that causes them to see the glass half empty . or perhaps it 's that despite the good news on several fronts , developments around issues that hit consumers directly were often less than encouraging .
here 's a look at several of the salient economic matters of 2004 . dax doing well , but mistrusted while the dax has performed well for at least a year and a half , there is still a reluctance by a large swath of the german public to invest money in the market .
germans tend to be more risk averse than some nationalities , and a string of well-publicized initial public offerings -lrb- ipos -rrb- in 2004 that did n't go well increased market shyness . " people were watching developments very , very carefully , " according to klaus nieding of the german association for the protection of small shareholders .
" one phrase that might apply to the stock market these days is : ' it 's cool to be stingy . " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all stocks were winners that philosophy was helped along by the experience of those holding stocks in the internet service provider t-online .
it 's parent company , deutsche telekom , now wants to bring it back into the fold and is offering shareholders just under € 9 -lrb- $ 11.86 -rrb- per share , exactly one third of that the stock cost when it was first offered in early 2000 . the consumer blues while germans are n't pouring their money into the stock market , they also are n't pouring it into retailers ' cash registers .
the retail industry was one of the biggest complainers in 2004 , but that 's nothing new .
for years , its goes on binges bemoaning germans ' tight-fisted ways .
but the dirge provided a near constant background hum throughout 2004 . " private spending remains the achilles ' heel of the german economy , " said gustav horn of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
" and the rise in household income is too weak to expect a real upturn in spending . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping - germans are n't doing it economists say the fundaments of a real economic recovery are there , it 's just the consumer is not playing along , therefore dragging the recovery down . " we 've passed through the valley of tears , " said economic minister wolfgang clement , sounding something like a preacher trying to convince a doubtful congregation .
" germany is moving , in an upward direction .
i 'm telling you , things are going well again in germany . " export explosion the reason for the rosier-than-lately economic picture in germany can basically be ascribed to one thing : exports .
exports have always been an important component of germany 's economic engine , but in 2004 , they were pretty much the sole power source . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another new porsche heading overseas exporters enjoyed a record surplus this year of € 160 billion -lrb- $ 212 billion -rrb- . " we have an very strong export-driven economy right now , better than expected , " said martin rogowski , president of the german federation of industry .
exports this year were strong enough to make up for the nation 's stagnant construction sector and poor domestic demand . but the export party can only last so long , the diw 's horn wrote in a recent report .
most analysts predict german exports will lose steam because the global economy will grow less robustly than it did this year . others worry that the strength the euro will hurt exporters if it continues its meteoric rise in value , since it makes german goods abroad more expensive .
the european common currency has hit record highs against the dollar in the last week , reaching over $ 1.34 .
the market looks determined the drive the dollar down further in the near future and exporters are starting to feel the pinch . work longer , or do n't work many germans have been grumbling due to the debate this year about extending the number of hours worked in a week in several sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : longer work , same pay employees in some branches , such as manufacturing , had contracts stipulating 35-hour work weeks .
but industry leaders have been saying that in order to stay competitive , german employers need to work longer - 40 hours or perhaps more , and often with no concomitant rise in pay . " if the normal working week were 40 hours instead of 35 , that would mean a difference of 15 percent in personnel costs , " said rogowski . low-wage countries in asia and even next door in eastern europe have put pressure on employees and their unions to agree to employers ' demands .
industry leaders have been eager to play the wage card - either make concessions regarding hours or wages , or production will be shifted from stuttgart to slovakia , from essen to estonia . now that 's something to grumble about . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cloudy skies ahead for german growth a group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for germany 's economic growth , as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy .

not only has the eu agreed to conclude membership talks with bucharest , but sunday also sees the second round of presidential elections . as incumbent romanian president , ion iliescu steps down after almost 15 years in office , prime minister adrian nastase , leader of the ex-communist social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- is locked in battle with traian basescu , the mayor of bucarest and leader of an opposition centrist alliance of liberals and democrats for the highest office in the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest mayor and presidential candidate , traian basescu the first round of polls in what is the most hotly contested ballot in post-communist romania , were inconclusive with neither candidate achieving a clear majority .
nastase emerged slightly ahead of basescu , sparking the latter to accuse him of poll-rigging ukrainian style . in the first instance , nastase rejected the accusations , but later said that the " small irregularities " which had occurred did not substantially affect the outcome of the ballot .
the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .
instead , he has been waiting to see the results of the second round . low voter turnout statistics from the central election office have shown that only 11 million of the 18 million people entitled to vote actually cast a ballot , with the highest number of those who did n't coming from the characteristically pro-european western part of the country . instead of being considered a show of voter apathy , the low turnout has been generally judged as a form of silent protest at opposition party candidate basescu , whose communist background was recently exposed .
the information came as a blow to many intellectuals , who now consider him as nothing grander than the " lesser of two evils . " both candidates have been courting the hungarian party , udmr , which traditionally receives the backing of the hungarian minority .
but the courtships came to an official end when the party called on its supporters to back prime minister nastase in the ballot .
but those 8 percent wo n't necessarily tip the balance . " one should not consider the hungarian voters as one block .
sociologists have established that the hungarian minority is divided .
the hungarians from the center of rumania are more likely to listen to the hungarian party , whereas the hungarian minority in the west of the country is more self-contained and tends to support liberal , pro-western policies , " political analyst emil hurezeanu told deutsche welle .
" so it is not the decisions of the hungarian party which count , but the mobilization of that half of the population that did n't turn out to vote the first time round . " the path to european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian prime minister adrian nastase whoever wins after the sunday ballot will be focussed on leading romania into the arms of the european union in 2007 , and with that in mind , the two candidates are running with similar policies promising to tackle corruption and secure the independence of the justice system . in his campaign , nastase has claimed to be in the throes of introducing a reform process , suggesting voters should vote for him and opt for continuity . " romania genuinely does need the continuity of a pro-west integration policy , but is that really in keeping with adrain nastase 's policies ? "
hurezeanu said . there is no foregone conclusion for sunday 's elections quite simply because nobody can estimate how many first round non-voters will make use of their right to cast a ballot . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania vote marred by fraud charges exit polls in key romanian elections are showing a likely win for the ruling social democrats .

not only has the eu agreed to conclude membership talks with bucharest , but sunday also sees the second round of presidential elections . as incumbent romanian president , ion iliescu steps down after almost 15 years in office , prime minister adrian nastase , leader of the ex-communist social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- is locked in battle with traian basescu , the mayor of bucarest and leader of an opposition centrist alliance of liberals and democrats for the highest office in the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest mayor and presidential candidate , traian basescu the first round of polls in what is the most hotly contested ballot in post-communist romania , were inconclusive with neither candidate achieving a clear majority .
nastase emerged slightly ahead of basescu , sparking the latter to accuse him of poll-rigging ukrainian style . in the first instance , nastase rejected the accusations , but later said that the " small irregularities " which had occurred did not substantially affect the outcome of the ballot .
the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .
instead , he has been waiting to see the results of the second round . low voter turnout statistics from the central election office have shown that only 11 million of the 18 million people entitled to vote actually cast a ballot , with the highest number of those who did n't coming from the characteristically pro-european western part of the country . instead of being considered a show of voter apathy , the low turnout has been generally judged as a form of silent protest at opposition party candidate basescu , whose communist background was recently exposed .
the information came as a blow to many intellectuals , who now consider him as nothing grander than the " lesser of two evils . " both candidates have been courting the hungarian party , udmr , which traditionally receives the backing of the hungarian minority .
but the courtships came to an official end when the party called on its supporters to back prime minister nastase in the ballot .
but those 8 percent wo n't necessarily tip the balance . " one should not consider the hungarian voters as one block .
sociologists have established that the hungarian minority is divided .
the hungarians from the center of rumania are more likely to listen to the hungarian party , whereas the hungarian minority in the west of the country is more self-contained and tends to support liberal , pro-western policies , " political analyst emil hurezeanu told deutsche welle .
" so it is not the decisions of the hungarian party which count , but the mobilization of that half of the population that did n't turn out to vote the first time round . " the path to european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian prime minister adrian nastase whoever wins after the sunday ballot will be focussed on leading romania into the arms of the european union in 2007 , and with that in mind , the two candidates are running with similar policies promising to tackle corruption and secure the independence of the justice system . in his campaign , nastase has claimed to be in the throes of introducing a reform process , suggesting voters should vote for him and opt for continuity . " romania genuinely does need the continuity of a pro-west integration policy , but is that really in keeping with adrain nastase 's policies ? "
hurezeanu said . there is no foregone conclusion for sunday 's elections quite simply because nobody can estimate how many first round non-voters will make use of their right to cast a ballot . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania vote marred by fraud charges exit polls in key romanian elections are showing a likely win for the ruling social democrats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.12.2004 moaning and groaning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economy was in better spirits in 2004 , but germans were n't germans should be pretty happy with the country 's economic performance in 2004 .
after three years of stagnation , the economy grew 1.8 percent .
but you 'd never know from all the complaining that 's been going on . listening to most people talking about the state of the german economy , one might think the apocalypse were fast approaching .
but in reality , 2004 was a fairly respectable year : the economy grew , not amazingly , but it finally woke up from a three-year slumber ; the german stock market index , the dax , reported slow but steady growth ; and exporters reported record surpluses , beating analysts ' expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doom and gloom so why all the glum faces ?
perhaps there 's something in germans ' genes that causes them to see the glass half empty . or perhaps it 's that despite the good news on several fronts , developments around issues that hit consumers directly were often less than encouraging .
here 's a look at several of the salient economic matters of 2004 . dax doing well , but mistrusted while the dax has performed well for at least a year and a half , there is still a reluctance by a large swath of the german public to invest money in the market .
germans tend to be more risk averse than some nationalities , and a string of well-publicized initial public offerings -lrb- ipos -rrb- in 2004 that did n't go well increased market shyness . " people were watching developments very , very carefully , " according to klaus nieding of the german association for the protection of small shareholders .
" one phrase that might apply to the stock market these days is : ' it 's cool to be stingy . " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all stocks were winners that philosophy was helped along by the experience of those holding stocks in the internet service provider t-online .
it 's parent company , deutsche telekom , now wants to bring it back into the fold and is offering shareholders just under € 9 -lrb- $ 11.86 -rrb- per share , exactly one third of that the stock cost when it was first offered in early 2000 . the consumer blues while germans are n't pouring their money into the stock market , they also are n't pouring it into retailers ' cash registers .
the retail industry was one of the biggest complainers in 2004 , but that 's nothing new .
for years , its goes on binges bemoaning germans ' tight-fisted ways .
but the dirge provided a near constant background hum throughout 2004 . " private spending remains the achilles ' heel of the german economy , " said gustav horn of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
" and the rise in household income is too weak to expect a real upturn in spending . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping - germans are n't doing it economists say the fundaments of a real economic recovery are there , it 's just the consumer is not playing along , therefore dragging the recovery down . " we 've passed through the valley of tears , " said economic minister wolfgang clement , sounding something like a preacher trying to convince a doubtful congregation .
" germany is moving , in an upward direction .
i 'm telling you , things are going well again in germany . " export explosion the reason for the rosier-than-lately economic picture in germany can basically be ascribed to one thing : exports .
exports have always been an important component of germany 's economic engine , but in 2004 , they were pretty much the sole power source . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another new porsche heading overseas exporters enjoyed a record surplus this year of € 160 billion -lrb- $ 212 billion -rrb- . " we have an very strong export-driven economy right now , better than expected , " said martin rogowski , president of the german federation of industry .
exports this year were strong enough to make up for the nation 's stagnant construction sector and poor domestic demand . but the export party can only last so long , the diw 's horn wrote in a recent report .
most analysts predict german exports will lose steam because the global economy will grow less robustly than it did this year . others worry that the strength the euro will hurt exporters if it continues its meteoric rise in value , since it makes german goods abroad more expensive .
the european common currency has hit record highs against the dollar in the last week , reaching over $ 1.34 .
the market looks determined the drive the dollar down further in the near future and exporters are starting to feel the pinch . work longer , or do n't work many germans have been grumbling due to the debate this year about extending the number of hours worked in a week in several sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : longer work , same pay employees in some branches , such as manufacturing , had contracts stipulating 35-hour work weeks .
but industry leaders have been saying that in order to stay competitive , german employers need to work longer - 40 hours or perhaps more , and often with no concomitant rise in pay . " if the normal working week were 40 hours instead of 35 , that would mean a difference of 15 percent in personnel costs , " said rogowski . low-wage countries in asia and even next door in eastern europe have put pressure on employees and their unions to agree to employers ' demands .
industry leaders have been eager to play the wage card - either make concessions regarding hours or wages , or production will be shifted from stuttgart to slovakia , from essen to estonia . now that 's something to grumble about . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cloudy skies ahead for german growth a group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for germany 's economic growth , as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy .

17 , 2004 -rrb- strong euro sparks export fears the euro is climbing from strength to strength .
on its flight of force , it briefly crossed the $ 1.30 threshold , and is showing no sign of dropping back down to earth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.12.2004 round two in romanian presidential ballot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanians take to the polls again on sunday these are important days for the future of romania .
not only has the eu agreed to conclude membership talks with bucharest , but sunday also sees the second round of presidential elections . as incumbent romanian president , ion iliescu steps down after almost 15 years in office , prime minister adrian nastase , leader of the ex-communist social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- is locked in battle with traian basescu , the mayor of bucarest and leader of an opposition centrist alliance of liberals and democrats for the highest office in the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest mayor and presidential candidate , traian basescu the first round of polls in what is the most hotly contested ballot in post-communist romania , were inconclusive with neither candidate achieving a clear majority .
nastase emerged slightly ahead of basescu , sparking the latter to accuse him of poll-rigging ukrainian style . in the first instance , nastase rejected the accusations , but later said that the " small irregularities " which had occurred did not substantially affect the outcome of the ballot .
the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .
instead , he has been waiting to see the results of the second round . low voter turnout statistics from the central election office have shown that only 11 million of the 18 million people entitled to vote actually cast a ballot , with the highest number of those who did n't coming from the characteristically pro-european western part of the country . instead of being considered a show of voter apathy , the low turnout has been generally judged as a form of silent protest at opposition party candidate basescu , whose communist background was recently exposed .
the information came as a blow to many intellectuals , who now consider him as nothing grander than the " lesser of two evils . " both candidates have been courting the hungarian party , udmr , which traditionally receives the backing of the hungarian minority .
but the courtships came to an official end when the party called on its supporters to back prime minister nastase in the ballot .
but those 8 percent wo n't necessarily tip the balance . " one should not consider the hungarian voters as one block .
sociologists have established that the hungarian minority is divided .
the hungarians from the center of rumania are more likely to listen to the hungarian party , whereas the hungarian minority in the west of the country is more self-contained and tends to support liberal , pro-western policies , " political analyst emil hurezeanu told deutsche welle .
" so it is not the decisions of the hungarian party which count , but the mobilization of that half of the population that did n't turn out to vote the first time round . " the path to european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian prime minister adrian nastase whoever wins after the sunday ballot will be focussed on leading romania into the arms of the european union in 2007 , and with that in mind , the two candidates are running with similar policies promising to tackle corruption and secure the independence of the justice system . in his campaign , nastase has claimed to be in the throes of introducing a reform process , suggesting voters should vote for him and opt for continuity . " romania genuinely does need the continuity of a pro-west integration policy , but is that really in keeping with adrain nastase 's policies ? "
hurezeanu said . there is no foregone conclusion for sunday 's elections quite simply because nobody can estimate how many first round non-voters will make use of their right to cast a ballot . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania vote marred by fraud charges exit polls in key romanian elections are showing a likely win for the ruling social democrats .

not only has the eu agreed to conclude membership talks with bucharest , but sunday also sees the second round of presidential elections . as incumbent romanian president , ion iliescu steps down after almost 15 years in office , prime minister adrian nastase , leader of the ex-communist social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- is locked in battle with traian basescu , the mayor of bucarest and leader of an opposition centrist alliance of liberals and democrats for the highest office in the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest mayor and presidential candidate , traian basescu the first round of polls in what is the most hotly contested ballot in post-communist romania , were inconclusive with neither candidate achieving a clear majority .
nastase emerged slightly ahead of basescu , sparking the latter to accuse him of poll-rigging ukrainian style . in the first instance , nastase rejected the accusations , but later said that the " small irregularities " which had occurred did not substantially affect the outcome of the ballot .
the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .
instead , he has been waiting to see the results of the second round . low voter turnout statistics from the central election office have shown that only 11 million of the 18 million people entitled to vote actually cast a ballot , with the highest number of those who did n't coming from the characteristically pro-european western part of the country . instead of being considered a show of voter apathy , the low turnout has been generally judged as a form of silent protest at opposition party candidate basescu , whose communist background was recently exposed .
the information came as a blow to many intellectuals , who now consider him as nothing grander than the " lesser of two evils . " both candidates have been courting the hungarian party , udmr , which traditionally receives the backing of the hungarian minority .

" romania genuinely does need the continuity of a pro-west integration policy , but is that really in keeping with adrain nastase 's policies ? "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.12.2004 controversial nukes decision remembered großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pershing missiles were not welcome in europe in the 1970s and 80s , when it seemed like the us and ussr might unleash a nuclear war in europe , “ no nukes ” was on every peace activist ’ s lips .
sunday marks the 25th anniversary of nato ’ s “ dual track decision . ” nuclear weapons are once again a timely issue .
last month , russia announced its intention to develop new atomic weapons .
his country had “ conducted tests of the latest nuclear rocket systems , ” russian president vladimir putin declared in a cryptic comment . on the other side of the world , us president george w. bush pushed for so-called mini-nukes for use as tactical battlefield weapons .
and in europe , france revealed plans to modernize its atomic weapons arsenal . yet , these recent announcements hardly caused a stir .
but 25 years ago , such decisions would have brought hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets .
that was the case when nato ’ s revealed its infamous “ dual track ” decision on dec .
12 , 1979 . the strategy was a kind of carrot-and-stick approach intended to reduce nuclear arsenals .
nato announced its intention to deploy short and medium-range missiles in western europe , but promised to eliminate them if moscow removed similar rockets from its arsenal . balance in europe threatened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor helmut schmidt faced opposition at home in the mid-1970s , the soviet union developed the medium-range ss-20 missile .
however , the highly-advanced mobile rockets were not aimed at the united states , but at western europe .
this was of no great concern to the us , but german chancellor helmut schmidt pointed out the danger of the ss-20 ’ s to europe in 1977 . schmidt urged nato to counter the soviet threat , and nato responded by deciding to deploy over 100 pershing 2 and more than 400 cruise missiles in europe .
at the same time , schmidt offered a deal to the kremlin .
“ all europeans , also those in the soviet union , would be safer , if there were n't any rockets aimed at european targets , ” schmidt said .
“ therefore , our goal is for both sides eliminate these missiles . ” 300,000 protesters flock to bonn not everyone thought nato ’ s tactic would pay off .
critics feared the move would escalate the arms race in europe .

sunday marks the 25th anniversary of nato ’ s “ dual track decision . ” nuclear weapons are once again a timely issue .
last month , russia announced its intention to develop new atomic weapons .
his country had “ conducted tests of the latest nuclear rocket systems , ” russian president vladimir putin declared in a cryptic comment . on the other side of the world , us president george w. bush pushed for so-called mini-nukes for use as tactical battlefield weapons .
and in europe , france revealed plans to modernize its atomic weapons arsenal . yet , these recent announcements hardly caused a stir .
but 25 years ago , such decisions would have brought hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets .
that was the case when nato ’ s revealed its infamous “ dual track ” decision on dec .
12 , 1979 . the strategy was a kind of carrot-and-stick approach intended to reduce nuclear arsenals .
nato announced its intention to deploy short and medium-range missiles in western europe , but promised to eliminate them if moscow removed similar rockets from its arsenal . balance in europe threatened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor helmut schmidt faced opposition at home in the mid-1970s , the soviet union developed the medium-range ss-20 missile .
however , the highly-advanced mobile rockets were not aimed at the united states , but at western europe .
this was of no great concern to the us , but german chancellor helmut schmidt pointed out the danger of the ss-20 ’ s to europe in 1977 . schmidt urged nato to counter the soviet threat , and nato responded by deciding to deploy over 100 pershing 2 and more than 400 cruise missiles in europe .
at the same time , schmidt offered a deal to the kremlin .
“ all europeans , also those in the soviet union , would be safer , if there were n't any rockets aimed at european targets , ” schmidt said .
“ therefore , our goal is for both sides eliminate these missiles . ” 300,000 protesters flock to bonn not everyone thought nato ’ s tactic would pay off .
critics feared the move would escalate the arms race in europe .
peace activists mobilized the west german people to protest the two-track decision , launching the “ peace weeks ” in 1980-81 .
“ peace groups explained the meaning of it to the people , ” martin stenner , who joined the movement , told deutsche welle .
“ everyone became an expert in matters like forewarning times and how many cruise missiles were stationed where in germany . ” nato gave the soviet union four years to come up with a solution or it would begin deploying the pershing 2 and cruise missiles .
the peace movement mobilized to hinder nato plans .
even politicians from chancellor schmidt ’ s own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- began joining the demonstrations , which reached a high point on oct .

and we want to stop it where it ’ s occurring : here in central europe - here in germany , ” he cried . when the first pershing missiles were deployed in 1983 , another wave of protests was unleashed .
yet , the rockets would remain in germany only four years .

dresden 's particularly well-known for its version , which became a hotly traded good during communist times . shaped like an oblong , flat loaf of bread , studded with almonds and raisins and flavoured with orange and lemon , the stollen was first created in the ovens of the eastern city of dresden almost 600 years ago . so important is the cake to the city that bakers must meet a stringent quality test in order to be able to call their products genuine " dresden stollen . " hans-jürgen matzker heads the association for the protection of dresden stollen , which represents 150 producers , and sets the quality test .
he said that to judge the role stollen plays in dresden life , you only have to look at the figures for his small , pink-walled bakery in the city 's suburbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dresden baker with stollen cakes " the production of stollen represents 20 percent of our annual turnover , " matzker told afp , taking a short break from a hectic work day . from mid-october to january , matzker and his 27 employees work virtually flat out to satisfy the demand for his stollen which scores 18.3 points out of a possible 20 in the association 's quality test score . predecessor an austere affair the first stollen in the middle ages was a more austere affair - a dry cake made of flour , yeast and water which nourished people through the fasting period leading up to christmas .
it was known as " christbrod " -lrb- " bread of christ " -rrb- and because of its shape , it represented the swaddled body of the infant jesus . in the 15th century , the electoral princes of the then independent state of saxony found the cake too dry and in 1491 they were granted permission by pope innocent viii to add butter to the recipe . centuries later , matzker and his fellow bakers had to use all their ingenuity when confronted with the food shortages of communist rule in east germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker ronald morenz from dresden is pulling a stollen out of the oven " when we could n't get any candied lemon peel , we used small green tomatoes and soaked them in a sugary solution , then glazed them , " he recalled .
" they had a sweet taste , but they did n't taste of tomatoes . " communist currency the stollen also became a form of currency in communist times . unlike the nationalized industries , bakers were not allowed to export their goods but their customers would buy them by the dozen and send them to friends or relatives on the other side of the iron curtain in exchange for precious deutsche marks . when the berlin wall fell in 1989 and germany was reunified a year later , sales of stollen dropped because the people of saxony no longer needed to exchange the cakes for western currency . " we had to find new ways to sell our wares , " said matzker , whose father and grandfather were bakers too . going global so he now gives guided tours of the bakery to tourists and has specialized in mail order , sending his cakes around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker marlies morenz gets a stollen ready for shipping his customers include germans living as far away as the united states , canada and australia . " for someone from saxony , even if he left 50 years ago , a christmas without stollen is a sad christmas , " matzker said . and what makes them homesick is the prospect of biting into a slice of freshly baked stollen at teatime in the build-up to christmas in this semi-mountainous area where fir trees stretch up the hillsides . " we celebrate christmas in a big way , " matzker said before returning to his ovens .

his country had “ conducted tests of the latest nuclear rocket systems , ” russian president vladimir putin declared in a cryptic comment . on the other side of the world , us president george w. bush pushed for so-called mini-nukes for use as tactical battlefield weapons .
and in europe , france revealed plans to modernize its atomic weapons arsenal . yet , these recent announcements hardly caused a stir .
but 25 years ago , such decisions would have brought hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets .
that was the case when nato ’ s revealed its infamous “ dual track ” decision on dec .
12 , 1979 . the strategy was a kind of carrot-and-stick approach intended to reduce nuclear arsenals .
nato announced its intention to deploy short and medium-range missiles in western europe , but promised to eliminate them if moscow removed similar rockets from its arsenal . balance in europe threatened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor helmut schmidt faced opposition at home in the mid-1970s , the soviet union developed the medium-range ss-20 missile .
however , the highly-advanced mobile rockets were not aimed at the united states , but at western europe .
this was of no great concern to the us , but german chancellor helmut schmidt pointed out the danger of the ss-20 ’ s to europe in 1977 . schmidt urged nato to counter the soviet threat , and nato responded by deciding to deploy over 100 pershing 2 and more than 400 cruise missiles in europe .
at the same time , schmidt offered a deal to the kremlin .
“ all europeans , also those in the soviet union , would be safer , if there were n't any rockets aimed at european targets , ” schmidt said .
“ therefore , our goal is for both sides eliminate these missiles . ” 300,000 protesters flock to bonn not everyone thought nato ’ s tactic would pay off .
critics feared the move would escalate the arms race in europe .
peace activists mobilized the west german people to protest the two-track decision , launching the “ peace weeks ” in 1980-81 .
“ peace groups explained the meaning of it to the people , ” martin stenner , who joined the movement , told deutsche welle .
“ everyone became an expert in matters like forewarning times and how many cruise missiles were stationed where in germany . ” nato gave the soviet union four years to come up with a solution or it would begin deploying the pershing 2 and cruise missiles .
the peace movement mobilized to hinder nato plans .
even politicians from chancellor schmidt ’ s own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- began joining the demonstrations , which reached a high point on oct .
10 , 1981 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace demonstrators came out in the thousands in bonn on that day , more than 300,000 demonstrators gathered in bonn .
spd politician erhard eppler joined the crowds .
“ we want to stop this ongoing weapons build-up that is choking us .
and we want to stop it where it ’ s occurring : here in central europe - here in germany , ” he cried . when the first pershing missiles were deployed in 1983 , another wave of protests was unleashed .
yet , the rockets would remain in germany only four years .
in december 1987 , the us and the soviet union signed the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- , which banned all 2,600 pershing 2 and ss-20 missiles . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powell re-buffed by nato us secretary of state colin powell 's " charm offensive " in europe bore little fruit on thursday .

dresden 's particularly well-known for its version , which became a hotly traded good during communist times . shaped like an oblong , flat loaf of bread , studded with almonds and raisins and flavoured with orange and lemon , the stollen was first created in the ovens of the eastern city of dresden almost 600 years ago . so important is the cake to the city that bakers must meet a stringent quality test in order to be able to call their products genuine " dresden stollen . " hans-jürgen matzker heads the association for the protection of dresden stollen , which represents 150 producers , and sets the quality test .
he said that to judge the role stollen plays in dresden life , you only have to look at the figures for his small , pink-walled bakery in the city 's suburbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dresden baker with stollen cakes " the production of stollen represents 20 percent of our annual turnover , " matzker told afp , taking a short break from a hectic work day . from mid-october to january , matzker and his 27 employees work virtually flat out to satisfy the demand for his stollen which scores 18.3 points out of a possible 20 in the association 's quality test score . predecessor an austere affair the first stollen in the middle ages was a more austere affair - a dry cake made of flour , yeast and water which nourished people through the fasting period leading up to christmas .
it was known as " christbrod " -lrb- " bread of christ " -rrb- and because of its shape , it represented the swaddled body of the infant jesus . in the 15th century , the electoral princes of the then independent state of saxony found the cake too dry and in 1491 they were granted permission by pope innocent viii to add butter to the recipe . centuries later , matzker and his fellow bakers had to use all their ingenuity when confronted with the food shortages of communist rule in east germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker ronald morenz from dresden is pulling a stollen out of the oven " when we could n't get any candied lemon peel , we used small green tomatoes and soaked them in a sugary solution , then glazed them , " he recalled .
" they had a sweet taste , but they did n't taste of tomatoes . " communist currency the stollen also became a form of currency in communist times . unlike the nationalized industries , bakers were not allowed to export their goods but their customers would buy them by the dozen and send them to friends or relatives on the other side of the iron curtain in exchange for precious deutsche marks . when the berlin wall fell in 1989 and germany was reunified a year later , sales of stollen dropped because the people of saxony no longer needed to exchange the cakes for western currency . " we had to find new ways to sell our wares , " said matzker , whose father and grandfather were bakers too . going global so he now gives guided tours of the bakery to tourists and has specialized in mail order , sending his cakes around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker marlies morenz gets a stollen ready for shipping his customers include germans living as far away as the united states , canada and australia . " for someone from saxony , even if he left 50 years ago , a christmas without stollen is a sad christmas , " matzker said . and what makes them homesick is the prospect of biting into a slice of freshly baked stollen at teatime in the build-up to christmas in this semi-mountainous area where fir trees stretch up the hillsides .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.12.2004 round two in romanian presidential ballot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanians take to the polls again on sunday these are important days for the future of romania .
not only has the eu agreed to conclude membership talks with bucharest , but sunday also sees the second round of presidential elections . as incumbent romanian president , ion iliescu steps down after almost 15 years in office , prime minister adrian nastase , leader of the ex-communist social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- is locked in battle with traian basescu , the mayor of bucarest and leader of an opposition centrist alliance of liberals and democrats for the highest office in the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest mayor and presidential candidate , traian basescu the first round of polls in what is the most hotly contested ballot in post-communist romania , were inconclusive with neither candidate achieving a clear majority .
nastase emerged slightly ahead of basescu , sparking the latter to accuse him of poll-rigging ukrainian style . in the first instance , nastase rejected the accusations , but later said that the " small irregularities " which had occurred did not substantially affect the outcome of the ballot .
the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .
instead , he has been waiting to see the results of the second round . low voter turnout statistics from the central election office have shown that only 11 million of the 18 million people entitled to vote actually cast a ballot , with the highest number of those who did n't coming from the characteristically pro-european western part of the country . instead of being considered a show of voter apathy , the low turnout has been generally judged as a form of silent protest at opposition party candidate basescu , whose communist background was recently exposed .
the information came as a blow to many intellectuals , who now consider him as nothing grander than the " lesser of two evils . " both candidates have been courting the hungarian party , udmr , which traditionally receives the backing of the hungarian minority .
but the courtships came to an official end when the party called on its supporters to back prime minister nastase in the ballot .
but those 8 percent wo n't necessarily tip the balance . " one should not consider the hungarian voters as one block .
sociologists have established that the hungarian minority is divided .
the hungarians from the center of rumania are more likely to listen to the hungarian party , whereas the hungarian minority in the west of the country is more self-contained and tends to support liberal , pro-western policies , " political analyst emil hurezeanu told deutsche welle .
" so it is not the decisions of the hungarian party which count , but the mobilization of that half of the population that did n't turn out to vote the first time round . " the path to european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian prime minister adrian nastase whoever wins after the sunday ballot will be focussed on leading romania into the arms of the european union in 2007 , and with that in mind , the two candidates are running with similar policies promising to tackle corruption and secure the independence of the justice system . in his campaign , nastase has claimed to be in the throes of introducing a reform process , suggesting voters should vote for him and opt for continuity . " romania genuinely does need the continuity of a pro-west integration policy , but is that really in keeping with adrain nastase 's policies ? "
hurezeanu said . there is no foregone conclusion for sunday 's elections quite simply because nobody can estimate how many first round non-voters will make use of their right to cast a ballot . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania vote marred by fraud charges exit polls in key romanian elections are showing a likely win for the ruling social democrats .

dresden 's particularly well-known for its version , which became a hotly traded good during communist times . shaped like an oblong , flat loaf of bread , studded with almonds and raisins and flavoured with orange and lemon , the stollen was first created in the ovens of the eastern city of dresden almost 600 years ago . so important is the cake to the city that bakers must meet a stringent quality test in order to be able to call their products genuine " dresden stollen . " hans-jürgen matzker heads the association for the protection of dresden stollen , which represents 150 producers , and sets the quality test .
he said that to judge the role stollen plays in dresden life , you only have to look at the figures for his small , pink-walled bakery in the city 's suburbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dresden baker with stollen cakes " the production of stollen represents 20 percent of our annual turnover , " matzker told afp , taking a short break from a hectic work day . from mid-october to january , matzker and his 27 employees work virtually flat out to satisfy the demand for his stollen which scores 18.3 points out of a possible 20 in the association 's quality test score . predecessor an austere affair the first stollen in the middle ages was a more austere affair - a dry cake made of flour , yeast and water which nourished people through the fasting period leading up to christmas .
it was known as " christbrod " -lrb- " bread of christ " -rrb- and because of its shape , it represented the swaddled body of the infant jesus . in the 15th century , the electoral princes of the then independent state of saxony found the cake too dry and in 1491 they were granted permission by pope innocent viii to add butter to the recipe . centuries later , matzker and his fellow bakers had to use all their ingenuity when confronted with the food shortages of communist rule in east germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker ronald morenz from dresden is pulling a stollen out of the oven " when we could n't get any candied lemon peel , we used small green tomatoes and soaked them in a sugary solution , then glazed them , " he recalled .
" they had a sweet taste , but they did n't taste of tomatoes . " communist currency the stollen also became a form of currency in communist times . unlike the nationalized industries , bakers were not allowed to export their goods but their customers would buy them by the dozen and send them to friends or relatives on the other side of the iron curtain in exchange for precious deutsche marks . when the berlin wall fell in 1989 and germany was reunified a year later , sales of stollen dropped because the people of saxony no longer needed to exchange the cakes for western currency . " we had to find new ways to sell our wares , " said matzker , whose father and grandfather were bakers too . going global so he now gives guided tours of the bakery to tourists and has specialized in mail order , sending his cakes around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker marlies morenz gets a stollen ready for shipping his customers include germans living as far away as the united states , canada and australia . " for someone from saxony , even if he left 50 years ago , a christmas without stollen is a sad christmas , " matzker said . and what makes them homesick is the prospect of biting into a slice of freshly baked stollen at teatime in the build-up to christmas in this semi-mountainous area where fir trees stretch up the hillsides . " we celebrate christmas in a big way , " matzker said before returning to his ovens .

sunday marks the 25th anniversary of nato ’ s “ dual track decision . ” nuclear weapons are once again a timely issue .
last month , russia announced its intention to develop new atomic weapons .
his country had “ conducted tests of the latest nuclear rocket systems , ” russian president vladimir putin declared in a cryptic comment . on the other side of the world , us president george w. bush pushed for so-called mini-nukes for use as tactical battlefield weapons .
and in europe , france revealed plans to modernize its atomic weapons arsenal . yet , these recent announcements hardly caused a stir .
but 25 years ago , such decisions would have brought hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets .
that was the case when nato ’ s revealed its infamous “ dual track ” decision on dec .
12 , 1979 . the strategy was a kind of carrot-and-stick approach intended to reduce nuclear arsenals .
nato announced its intention to deploy short and medium-range missiles in western europe , but promised to eliminate them if moscow removed similar rockets from its arsenal . balance in europe threatened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor helmut schmidt faced opposition at home in the mid-1970s , the soviet union developed the medium-range ss-20 missile .
however , the highly-advanced mobile rockets were not aimed at the united states , but at western europe .
this was of no great concern to the us , but german chancellor helmut schmidt pointed out the danger of the ss-20 ’ s to europe in 1977 . schmidt urged nato to counter the soviet threat , and nato responded by deciding to deploy over 100 pershing 2 and more than 400 cruise missiles in europe .
at the same time , schmidt offered a deal to the kremlin .
“ all europeans , also those in the soviet union , would be safer , if there were n't any rockets aimed at european targets , ” schmidt said .
“ therefore , our goal is for both sides eliminate these missiles . ” 300,000 protesters flock to bonn not everyone thought nato ’ s tactic would pay off .
critics feared the move would escalate the arms race in europe .
peace activists mobilized the west german people to protest the two-track decision , launching the “ peace weeks ” in 1980-81 .
“ peace groups explained the meaning of it to the people , ” martin stenner , who joined the movement , told deutsche welle .
“ everyone became an expert in matters like forewarning times and how many cruise missiles were stationed where in germany . ” nato gave the soviet union four years to come up with a solution or it would begin deploying the pershing 2 and cruise missiles .
the peace movement mobilized to hinder nato plans .

“ we want to stop this ongoing weapons build-up that is choking us .
and we want to stop it where it ’ s occurring : here in central europe - here in germany , ” he cried . when the first pershing missiles were deployed in 1983 , another wave of protests was unleashed .
yet , the rockets would remain in germany only four years .

after three years of stagnation , the economy grew 1.8 percent .
but you 'd never know from all the complaining that 's been going on . listening to most people talking about the state of the german economy , one might think the apocalypse were fast approaching .
but in reality , 2004 was a fairly respectable year : the economy grew , not amazingly , but it finally woke up from a three-year slumber ; the german stock market index , the dax , reported slow but steady growth ; and exporters reported record surpluses , beating analysts ' expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doom and gloom so why all the glum faces ?
perhaps there 's something in germans ' genes that causes them to see the glass half empty . or perhaps it 's that despite the good news on several fronts , developments around issues that hit consumers directly were often less than encouraging .
here 's a look at several of the salient economic matters of 2004 . dax doing well , but mistrusted while the dax has performed well for at least a year and a half , there is still a reluctance by a large swath of the german public to invest money in the market .
germans tend to be more risk averse than some nationalities , and a string of well-publicized initial public offerings -lrb- ipos -rrb- in 2004 that did n't go well increased market shyness . " people were watching developments very , very carefully , " according to klaus nieding of the german association for the protection of small shareholders .
" one phrase that might apply to the stock market these days is : ' it 's cool to be stingy . " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all stocks were winners that philosophy was helped along by the experience of those holding stocks in the internet service provider t-online .
it 's parent company , deutsche telekom , now wants to bring it back into the fold and is offering shareholders just under € 9 -lrb- $ 11.86 -rrb- per share , exactly one third of that the stock cost when it was first offered in early 2000 . the consumer blues while germans are n't pouring their money into the stock market , they also are n't pouring it into retailers ' cash registers .
the retail industry was one of the biggest complainers in 2004 , but that 's nothing new .
for years , its goes on binges bemoaning germans ' tight-fisted ways .
but the dirge provided a near constant background hum throughout 2004 . " private spending remains the achilles ' heel of the german economy , " said gustav horn of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
" and the rise in household income is too weak to expect a real upturn in spending . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping - germans are n't doing it economists say the fundaments of a real economic recovery are there , it 's just the consumer is not playing along , therefore dragging the recovery down . " we 've passed through the valley of tears , " said economic minister wolfgang clement , sounding something like a preacher trying to convince a doubtful congregation .
" germany is moving , in an upward direction .
i 'm telling you , things are going well again in germany . " export explosion the reason for the rosier-than-lately economic picture in germany can basically be ascribed to one thing : exports .
exports have always been an important component of germany 's economic engine , but in 2004 , they were pretty much the sole power source . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another new porsche heading overseas exporters enjoyed a record surplus this year of € 160 billion -lrb- $ 212 billion -rrb- . " we have an very strong export-driven economy right now , better than expected , " said martin rogowski , president of the german federation of industry .
exports this year were strong enough to make up for the nation 's stagnant construction sector and poor domestic demand . but the export party can only last so long , the diw 's horn wrote in a recent report .
most analysts predict german exports will lose steam because the global economy will grow less robustly than it did this year . others worry that the strength the euro will hurt exporters if it continues its meteoric rise in value , since it makes german goods abroad more expensive .
the european common currency has hit record highs against the dollar in the last week , reaching over $ 1.34 .
the market looks determined the drive the dollar down further in the near future and exporters are starting to feel the pinch . work longer , or do n't work many germans have been grumbling due to the debate this year about extending the number of hours worked in a week in several sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : longer work , same pay employees in some branches , such as manufacturing , had contracts stipulating 35-hour work weeks .
but industry leaders have been saying that in order to stay competitive , german employers need to work longer - 40 hours or perhaps more , and often with no concomitant rise in pay . " if the normal working week were 40 hours instead of 35 , that would mean a difference of 15 percent in personnel costs , " said rogowski . low-wage countries in asia and even next door in eastern europe have put pressure on employees and their unions to agree to employers ' demands .
industry leaders have been eager to play the wage card - either make concessions regarding hours or wages , or production will be shifted from stuttgart to slovakia , from essen to estonia . now that 's something to grumble about . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cloudy skies ahead for german growth a group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for germany 's economic growth , as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy .

after three years of stagnation , the economy grew 1.8 percent .
but you 'd never know from all the complaining that 's been going on . listening to most people talking about the state of the german economy , one might think the apocalypse were fast approaching .
but in reality , 2004 was a fairly respectable year : the economy grew , not amazingly , but it finally woke up from a three-year slumber ; the german stock market index , the dax , reported slow but steady growth ; and exporters reported record surpluses , beating analysts ' expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doom and gloom so why all the glum faces ?
perhaps there 's something in germans ' genes that causes them to see the glass half empty . or perhaps it 's that despite the good news on several fronts , developments around issues that hit consumers directly were often less than encouraging .
here 's a look at several of the salient economic matters of 2004 . dax doing well , but mistrusted while the dax has performed well for at least a year and a half , there is still a reluctance by a large swath of the german public to invest money in the market .
germans tend to be more risk averse than some nationalities , and a string of well-publicized initial public offerings -lrb- ipos -rrb- in 2004 that did n't go well increased market shyness . " people were watching developments very , very carefully , " according to klaus nieding of the german association for the protection of small shareholders .

a spokesman for the state crime office in the eastern region of thuringia said that an ongoing probe of four germans had allowed authorities to crack the online address book of the site , unmasking thousands of suspects .
" we do n't know yet if we are talking about 8,000 or 20,000 people , " the spokesman said , noting that copyright violators could face heavy fines or even prison terms .
the four men at the center of the probe between the ages of 19 and 46 were detained in september .
three have since been remanded in custody .

a gvu spokesman said the group had the largest operation in german-speaking europe with the most up-to-date music and films on offer .
prosecutors said they believed the copyright holders of the media had lost revenues running into tens of millions of euros due to the illegal site .

dresden 's particularly well-known for its version , which became a hotly traded good during communist times . shaped like an oblong , flat loaf of bread , studded with almonds and raisins and flavoured with orange and lemon , the stollen was first created in the ovens of the eastern city of dresden almost 600 years ago . so important is the cake to the city that bakers must meet a stringent quality test in order to be able to call their products genuine " dresden stollen . " hans-jürgen matzker heads the association for the protection of dresden stollen , which represents 150 producers , and sets the quality test .
he said that to judge the role stollen plays in dresden life , you only have to look at the figures for his small , pink-walled bakery in the city 's suburbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dresden baker with stollen cakes " the production of stollen represents 20 percent of our annual turnover , " matzker told afp , taking a short break from a hectic work day . from mid-october to january , matzker and his 27 employees work virtually flat out to satisfy the demand for his stollen which scores 18.3 points out of a possible 20 in the association 's quality test score . predecessor an austere affair the first stollen in the middle ages was a more austere affair - a dry cake made of flour , yeast and water which nourished people through the fasting period leading up to christmas .
it was known as " christbrod " -lrb- " bread of christ " -rrb- and because of its shape , it represented the swaddled body of the infant jesus . in the 15th century , the electoral princes of the then independent state of saxony found the cake too dry and in 1491 they were granted permission by pope innocent viii to add butter to the recipe . centuries later , matzker and his fellow bakers had to use all their ingenuity when confronted with the food shortages of communist rule in east germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker ronald morenz from dresden is pulling a stollen out of the oven " when we could n't get any candied lemon peel , we used small green tomatoes and soaked them in a sugary solution , then glazed them , " he recalled .
" they had a sweet taste , but they did n't taste of tomatoes . " communist currency the stollen also became a form of currency in communist times . unlike the nationalized industries , bakers were not allowed to export their goods but their customers would buy them by the dozen and send them to friends or relatives on the other side of the iron curtain in exchange for precious deutsche marks . when the berlin wall fell in 1989 and germany was reunified a year later , sales of stollen dropped because the people of saxony no longer needed to exchange the cakes for western currency . " we had to find new ways to sell our wares , " said matzker , whose father and grandfather were bakers too . going global so he now gives guided tours of the bakery to tourists and has specialized in mail order , sending his cakes around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker marlies morenz gets a stollen ready for shipping his customers include germans living as far away as the united states , canada and australia . " for someone from saxony , even if he left 50 years ago , a christmas without stollen is a sad christmas , " matzker said . and what makes them homesick is the prospect of biting into a slice of freshly baked stollen at teatime in the build-up to christmas in this semi-mountainous area where fir trees stretch up the hillsides . " we celebrate christmas in a big way , " matzker said before returning to his ovens .

dresden 's particularly well-known for its version , which became a hotly traded good during communist times . shaped like an oblong , flat loaf of bread , studded with almonds and raisins and flavoured with orange and lemon , the stollen was first created in the ovens of the eastern city of dresden almost 600 years ago . so important is the cake to the city that bakers must meet a stringent quality test in order to be able to call their products genuine " dresden stollen . " hans-jürgen matzker heads the association for the protection of dresden stollen , which represents 150 producers , and sets the quality test .
he said that to judge the role stollen plays in dresden life , you only have to look at the figures for his small , pink-walled bakery in the city 's suburbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dresden baker with stollen cakes " the production of stollen represents 20 percent of our annual turnover , " matzker told afp , taking a short break from a hectic work day . from mid-october to january , matzker and his 27 employees work virtually flat out to satisfy the demand for his stollen which scores 18.3 points out of a possible 20 in the association 's quality test score . predecessor an austere affair the first stollen in the middle ages was a more austere affair - a dry cake made of flour , yeast and water which nourished people through the fasting period leading up to christmas .
it was known as " christbrod " -lrb- " bread of christ " -rrb- and because of its shape , it represented the swaddled body of the infant jesus . in the 15th century , the electoral princes of the then independent state of saxony found the cake too dry and in 1491 they were granted permission by pope innocent viii to add butter to the recipe . centuries later , matzker and his fellow bakers had to use all their ingenuity when confronted with the food shortages of communist rule in east germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker ronald morenz from dresden is pulling a stollen out of the oven " when we could n't get any candied lemon peel , we used small green tomatoes and soaked them in a sugary solution , then glazed them , " he recalled .
" they had a sweet taste , but they did n't taste of tomatoes . " communist currency the stollen also became a form of currency in communist times . unlike the nationalized industries , bakers were not allowed to export their goods but their customers would buy them by the dozen and send them to friends or relatives on the other side of the iron curtain in exchange for precious deutsche marks . when the berlin wall fell in 1989 and germany was reunified a year later , sales of stollen dropped because the people of saxony no longer needed to exchange the cakes for western currency . " we had to find new ways to sell our wares , " said matzker , whose father and grandfather were bakers too . going global so he now gives guided tours of the bakery to tourists and has specialized in mail order , sending his cakes around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker marlies morenz gets a stollen ready for shipping his customers include germans living as far away as the united states , canada and australia . " for someone from saxony , even if he left 50 years ago , a christmas without stollen is a sad christmas , " matzker said . and what makes them homesick is the prospect of biting into a slice of freshly baked stollen at teatime in the build-up to christmas in this semi-mountainous area where fir trees stretch up the hillsides . " we celebrate christmas in a big way , " matzker said before returning to his ovens .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.12.2004 round two in romanian presidential ballot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanians take to the polls again on sunday these are important days for the future of romania .
not only has the eu agreed to conclude membership talks with bucharest , but sunday also sees the second round of presidential elections . as incumbent romanian president , ion iliescu steps down after almost 15 years in office , prime minister adrian nastase , leader of the ex-communist social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- is locked in battle with traian basescu , the mayor of bucarest and leader of an opposition centrist alliance of liberals and democrats for the highest office in the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest mayor and presidential candidate , traian basescu the first round of polls in what is the most hotly contested ballot in post-communist romania , were inconclusive with neither candidate achieving a clear majority .
nastase emerged slightly ahead of basescu , sparking the latter to accuse him of poll-rigging ukrainian style . in the first instance , nastase rejected the accusations , but later said that the " small irregularities " which had occurred did not substantially affect the outcome of the ballot .
the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .
instead , he has been waiting to see the results of the second round . low voter turnout statistics from the central election office have shown that only 11 million of the 18 million people entitled to vote actually cast a ballot , with the highest number of those who did n't coming from the characteristically pro-european western part of the country . instead of being considered a show of voter apathy , the low turnout has been generally judged as a form of silent protest at opposition party candidate basescu , whose communist background was recently exposed .
the information came as a blow to many intellectuals , who now consider him as nothing grander than the " lesser of two evils . " both candidates have been courting the hungarian party , udmr , which traditionally receives the backing of the hungarian minority .
but the courtships came to an official end when the party called on its supporters to back prime minister nastase in the ballot .
but those 8 percent wo n't necessarily tip the balance . " one should not consider the hungarian voters as one block .
sociologists have established that the hungarian minority is divided .
the hungarians from the center of rumania are more likely to listen to the hungarian party , whereas the hungarian minority in the west of the country is more self-contained and tends to support liberal , pro-western policies , " political analyst emil hurezeanu told deutsche welle .
" so it is not the decisions of the hungarian party which count , but the mobilization of that half of the population that did n't turn out to vote the first time round . " the path to european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian prime minister adrian nastase whoever wins after the sunday ballot will be focussed on leading romania into the arms of the european union in 2007 , and with that in mind , the two candidates are running with similar policies promising to tackle corruption and secure the independence of the justice system . in his campaign , nastase has claimed to be in the throes of introducing a reform process , suggesting voters should vote for him and opt for continuity . " romania genuinely does need the continuity of a pro-west integration policy , but is that really in keeping with adrain nastase 's policies ? "
hurezeanu said . there is no foregone conclusion for sunday 's elections quite simply because nobody can estimate how many first round non-voters will make use of their right to cast a ballot . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania vote marred by fraud charges exit polls in key romanian elections are showing a likely win for the ruling social democrats .

sunday marks the 25th anniversary of nato ’ s “ dual track decision . ” nuclear weapons are once again a timely issue .
last month , russia announced its intention to develop new atomic weapons .
his country had “ conducted tests of the latest nuclear rocket systems , ” russian president vladimir putin declared in a cryptic comment . on the other side of the world , us president george w. bush pushed for so-called mini-nukes for use as tactical battlefield weapons .
and in europe , france revealed plans to modernize its atomic weapons arsenal . yet , these recent announcements hardly caused a stir .
but 25 years ago , such decisions would have brought hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets .
that was the case when nato ’ s revealed its infamous “ dual track ” decision on dec .
12 , 1979 . the strategy was a kind of carrot-and-stick approach intended to reduce nuclear arsenals .
nato announced its intention to deploy short and medium-range missiles in western europe , but promised to eliminate them if moscow removed similar rockets from its arsenal . balance in europe threatened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor helmut schmidt faced opposition at home in the mid-1970s , the soviet union developed the medium-range ss-20 missile .

this was of no great concern to the us , but german chancellor helmut schmidt pointed out the danger of the ss-20 ’ s to europe in 1977 . schmidt urged nato to counter the soviet threat , and nato responded by deciding to deploy over 100 pershing 2 and more than 400 cruise missiles in europe .
at the same time , schmidt offered a deal to the kremlin .
“ all europeans , also those in the soviet union , would be safer , if there were n't any rockets aimed at european targets , ” schmidt said .
“ therefore , our goal is for both sides eliminate these missiles . ” 300,000 protesters flock to bonn not everyone thought nato ’ s tactic would pay off .
critics feared the move would escalate the arms race in europe .
peace activists mobilized the west german people to protest the two-track decision , launching the “ peace weeks ” in 1980-81 .
“ peace groups explained the meaning of it to the people , ” martin stenner , who joined the movement , told deutsche welle .
“ everyone became an expert in matters like forewarning times and how many cruise missiles were stationed where in germany . ” nato gave the soviet union four years to come up with a solution or it would begin deploying the pershing 2 and cruise missiles .
the peace movement mobilized to hinder nato plans .
even politicians from chancellor schmidt ’ s own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- began joining the demonstrations , which reached a high point on oct .

and we want to stop it where it ’ s occurring : here in central europe - here in germany , ” he cried . when the first pershing missiles were deployed in 1983 , another wave of protests was unleashed .
yet , the rockets would remain in germany only four years .

not only has the eu agreed to conclude membership talks with bucharest , but sunday also sees the second round of presidential elections . as incumbent romanian president , ion iliescu steps down after almost 15 years in office , prime minister adrian nastase , leader of the ex-communist social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- is locked in battle with traian basescu , the mayor of bucarest and leader of an opposition centrist alliance of liberals and democrats for the highest office in the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest mayor and presidential candidate , traian basescu the first round of polls in what is the most hotly contested ballot in post-communist romania , were inconclusive with neither candidate achieving a clear majority .
nastase emerged slightly ahead of basescu , sparking the latter to accuse him of poll-rigging ukrainian style . in the first instance , nastase rejected the accusations , but later said that the " small irregularities " which had occurred did not substantially affect the outcome of the ballot .
the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .
instead , he has been waiting to see the results of the second round . low voter turnout statistics from the central election office have shown that only 11 million of the 18 million people entitled to vote actually cast a ballot , with the highest number of those who did n't coming from the characteristically pro-european western part of the country . instead of being considered a show of voter apathy , the low turnout has been generally judged as a form of silent protest at opposition party candidate basescu , whose communist background was recently exposed .
the information came as a blow to many intellectuals , who now consider him as nothing grander than the " lesser of two evils . " both candidates have been courting the hungarian party , udmr , which traditionally receives the backing of the hungarian minority .
but the courtships came to an official end when the party called on its supporters to back prime minister nastase in the ballot .
but those 8 percent wo n't necessarily tip the balance . " one should not consider the hungarian voters as one block .
sociologists have established that the hungarian minority is divided .

" romania genuinely does need the continuity of a pro-west integration policy , but is that really in keeping with adrain nastase 's policies ? "

dresden 's particularly well-known for its version , which became a hotly traded good during communist times . shaped like an oblong , flat loaf of bread , studded with almonds and raisins and flavoured with orange and lemon , the stollen was first created in the ovens of the eastern city of dresden almost 600 years ago . so important is the cake to the city that bakers must meet a stringent quality test in order to be able to call their products genuine " dresden stollen . " hans-jürgen matzker heads the association for the protection of dresden stollen , which represents 150 producers , and sets the quality test .
he said that to judge the role stollen plays in dresden life , you only have to look at the figures for his small , pink-walled bakery in the city 's suburbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dresden baker with stollen cakes " the production of stollen represents 20 percent of our annual turnover , " matzker told afp , taking a short break from a hectic work day . from mid-october to january , matzker and his 27 employees work virtually flat out to satisfy the demand for his stollen which scores 18.3 points out of a possible 20 in the association 's quality test score . predecessor an austere affair the first stollen in the middle ages was a more austere affair - a dry cake made of flour , yeast and water which nourished people through the fasting period leading up to christmas .
it was known as " christbrod " -lrb- " bread of christ " -rrb- and because of its shape , it represented the swaddled body of the infant jesus . in the 15th century , the electoral princes of the then independent state of saxony found the cake too dry and in 1491 they were granted permission by pope innocent viii to add butter to the recipe . centuries later , matzker and his fellow bakers had to use all their ingenuity when confronted with the food shortages of communist rule in east germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker ronald morenz from dresden is pulling a stollen out of the oven " when we could n't get any candied lemon peel , we used small green tomatoes and soaked them in a sugary solution , then glazed them , " he recalled .
" they had a sweet taste , but they did n't taste of tomatoes . " communist currency the stollen also became a form of currency in communist times . unlike the nationalized industries , bakers were not allowed to export their goods but their customers would buy them by the dozen and send them to friends or relatives on the other side of the iron curtain in exchange for precious deutsche marks . when the berlin wall fell in 1989 and germany was reunified a year later , sales of stollen dropped because the people of saxony no longer needed to exchange the cakes for western currency . " we had to find new ways to sell our wares , " said matzker , whose father and grandfather were bakers too . going global so he now gives guided tours of the bakery to tourists and has specialized in mail order , sending his cakes around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker marlies morenz gets a stollen ready for shipping his customers include germans living as far away as the united states , canada and australia . " for someone from saxony , even if he left 50 years ago , a christmas without stollen is a sad christmas , " matzker said . and what makes them homesick is the prospect of biting into a slice of freshly baked stollen at teatime in the build-up to christmas in this semi-mountainous area where fir trees stretch up the hillsides . " we celebrate christmas in a big way , " matzker said before returning to his ovens .

after three years of stagnation , the economy grew 1.8 percent .
but you 'd never know from all the complaining that 's been going on . listening to most people talking about the state of the german economy , one might think the apocalypse were fast approaching .
but in reality , 2004 was a fairly respectable year : the economy grew , not amazingly , but it finally woke up from a three-year slumber ; the german stock market index , the dax , reported slow but steady growth ; and exporters reported record surpluses , beating analysts ' expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doom and gloom so why all the glum faces ?
perhaps there 's something in germans ' genes that causes them to see the glass half empty . or perhaps it 's that despite the good news on several fronts , developments around issues that hit consumers directly were often less than encouraging .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.12.2004 moaning and groaning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economy was in better spirits in 2004 , but germans were n't germans should be pretty happy with the country 's economic performance in 2004 .
after three years of stagnation , the economy grew 1.8 percent .
but you 'd never know from all the complaining that 's been going on . listening to most people talking about the state of the german economy , one might think the apocalypse were fast approaching .
but in reality , 2004 was a fairly respectable year : the economy grew , not amazingly , but it finally woke up from a three-year slumber ; the german stock market index , the dax , reported slow but steady growth ; and exporters reported record surpluses , beating analysts ' expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doom and gloom so why all the glum faces ?
perhaps there 's something in germans ' genes that causes them to see the glass half empty . or perhaps it 's that despite the good news on several fronts , developments around issues that hit consumers directly were often less than encouraging .
here 's a look at several of the salient economic matters of 2004 . dax doing well , but mistrusted while the dax has performed well for at least a year and a half , there is still a reluctance by a large swath of the german public to invest money in the market .
germans tend to be more risk averse than some nationalities , and a string of well-publicized initial public offerings -lrb- ipos -rrb- in 2004 that did n't go well increased market shyness . " people were watching developments very , very carefully , " according to klaus nieding of the german association for the protection of small shareholders .
" one phrase that might apply to the stock market these days is : ' it 's cool to be stingy . " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all stocks were winners that philosophy was helped along by the experience of those holding stocks in the internet service provider t-online .
it 's parent company , deutsche telekom , now wants to bring it back into the fold and is offering shareholders just under € 9 -lrb- $ 11.86 -rrb- per share , exactly one third of that the stock cost when it was first offered in early 2000 . the consumer blues while germans are n't pouring their money into the stock market , they also are n't pouring it into retailers ' cash registers .
the retail industry was one of the biggest complainers in 2004 , but that 's nothing new .
for years , its goes on binges bemoaning germans ' tight-fisted ways .
but the dirge provided a near constant background hum throughout 2004 . " private spending remains the achilles ' heel of the german economy , " said gustav horn of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
" and the rise in household income is too weak to expect a real upturn in spending . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping - germans are n't doing it economists say the fundaments of a real economic recovery are there , it 's just the consumer is not playing along , therefore dragging the recovery down . " we 've passed through the valley of tears , " said economic minister wolfgang clement , sounding something like a preacher trying to convince a doubtful congregation .
" germany is moving , in an upward direction .
i 'm telling you , things are going well again in germany . " export explosion the reason for the rosier-than-lately economic picture in germany can basically be ascribed to one thing : exports .
exports have always been an important component of germany 's economic engine , but in 2004 , they were pretty much the sole power source . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another new porsche heading overseas exporters enjoyed a record surplus this year of € 160 billion -lrb- $ 212 billion -rrb- . " we have an very strong export-driven economy right now , better than expected , " said martin rogowski , president of the german federation of industry .
exports this year were strong enough to make up for the nation 's stagnant construction sector and poor domestic demand . but the export party can only last so long , the diw 's horn wrote in a recent report .
most analysts predict german exports will lose steam because the global economy will grow less robustly than it did this year . others worry that the strength the euro will hurt exporters if it continues its meteoric rise in value , since it makes german goods abroad more expensive .
the european common currency has hit record highs against the dollar in the last week , reaching over $ 1.34 .

after three years of stagnation , the economy grew 1.8 percent .
but you 'd never know from all the complaining that 's been going on . listening to most people talking about the state of the german economy , one might think the apocalypse were fast approaching .
but in reality , 2004 was a fairly respectable year : the economy grew , not amazingly , but it finally woke up from a three-year slumber ; the german stock market index , the dax , reported slow but steady growth ; and exporters reported record surpluses , beating analysts ' expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doom and gloom so why all the glum faces ?
perhaps there 's something in germans ' genes that causes them to see the glass half empty . or perhaps it 's that despite the good news on several fronts , developments around issues that hit consumers directly were often less than encouraging .
here 's a look at several of the salient economic matters of 2004 . dax doing well , but mistrusted while the dax has performed well for at least a year and a half , there is still a reluctance by a large swath of the german public to invest money in the market .
germans tend to be more risk averse than some nationalities , and a string of well-publicized initial public offerings -lrb- ipos -rrb- in 2004 that did n't go well increased market shyness . " people were watching developments very , very carefully , " according to klaus nieding of the german association for the protection of small shareholders .
" one phrase that might apply to the stock market these days is : ' it 's cool to be stingy . " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all stocks were winners that philosophy was helped along by the experience of those holding stocks in the internet service provider t-online .

it was known as " christbrod " -lrb- " bread of christ " -rrb- and because of its shape , it represented the swaddled body of the infant jesus . in the 15th century , the electoral princes of the then independent state of saxony found the cake too dry and in 1491 they were granted permission by pope innocent viii to add butter to the recipe . centuries later , matzker and his fellow bakers had to use all their ingenuity when confronted with the food shortages of communist rule in east germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker ronald morenz from dresden is pulling a stollen out of the oven " when we could n't get any candied lemon peel , we used small green tomatoes and soaked them in a sugary solution , then glazed them , " he recalled .
" they had a sweet taste , but they did n't taste of tomatoes . " communist currency the stollen also became a form of currency in communist times . unlike the nationalized industries , bakers were not allowed to export their goods but their customers would buy them by the dozen and send them to friends or relatives on the other side of the iron curtain in exchange for precious deutsche marks . when the berlin wall fell in 1989 and germany was reunified a year later , sales of stollen dropped because the people of saxony no longer needed to exchange the cakes for western currency . " we had to find new ways to sell our wares , " said matzker , whose father and grandfather were bakers too . going global so he now gives guided tours of the bakery to tourists and has specialized in mail order , sending his cakes around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker marlies morenz gets a stollen ready for shipping his customers include germans living as far away as the united states , canada and australia . " for someone from saxony , even if he left 50 years ago , a christmas without stollen is a sad christmas , " matzker said . and what makes them homesick is the prospect of biting into a slice of freshly baked stollen at teatime in the build-up to christmas in this semi-mountainous area where fir trees stretch up the hillsides . " we celebrate christmas in a big way , " matzker said before returning to his ovens .

" we do n't know yet if we are talking about 8,000 or 20,000 people , " the spokesman said , noting that copyright violators could face heavy fines or even prison terms .
the four men at the center of the probe between the ages of 19 and 46 were detained in september .
three have since been remanded in custody .
authorities believe their internet site , which was not named , posted revenues of nearly € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- .
the hamburg society for the prosecution of copyright infringements -lrb- gvu -rrb- said that smashing the ring had wiped out a major part of the german-language internet piracy industry .
a gvu spokesman said the group had the largest operation in german-speaking europe with the most up-to-date music and films on offer .
prosecutors said they believed the copyright holders of the media had lost revenues running into tens of millions of euros due to the illegal site .

dresden 's particularly well-known for its version , which became a hotly traded good during communist times . shaped like an oblong , flat loaf of bread , studded with almonds and raisins and flavoured with orange and lemon , the stollen was first created in the ovens of the eastern city of dresden almost 600 years ago . so important is the cake to the city that bakers must meet a stringent quality test in order to be able to call their products genuine " dresden stollen . " hans-jürgen matzker heads the association for the protection of dresden stollen , which represents 150 producers , and sets the quality test .
he said that to judge the role stollen plays in dresden life , you only have to look at the figures for his small , pink-walled bakery in the city 's suburbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dresden baker with stollen cakes " the production of stollen represents 20 percent of our annual turnover , " matzker told afp , taking a short break from a hectic work day . from mid-october to january , matzker and his 27 employees work virtually flat out to satisfy the demand for his stollen which scores 18.3 points out of a possible 20 in the association 's quality test score . predecessor an austere affair the first stollen in the middle ages was a more austere affair - a dry cake made of flour , yeast and water which nourished people through the fasting period leading up to christmas .
it was known as " christbrod " -lrb- " bread of christ " -rrb- and because of its shape , it represented the swaddled body of the infant jesus . in the 15th century , the electoral princes of the then independent state of saxony found the cake too dry and in 1491 they were granted permission by pope innocent viii to add butter to the recipe . centuries later , matzker and his fellow bakers had to use all their ingenuity when confronted with the food shortages of communist rule in east germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker ronald morenz from dresden is pulling a stollen out of the oven " when we could n't get any candied lemon peel , we used small green tomatoes and soaked them in a sugary solution , then glazed them , " he recalled .
" they had a sweet taste , but they did n't taste of tomatoes . " communist currency the stollen also became a form of currency in communist times . unlike the nationalized industries , bakers were not allowed to export their goods but their customers would buy them by the dozen and send them to friends or relatives on the other side of the iron curtain in exchange for precious deutsche marks . when the berlin wall fell in 1989 and germany was reunified a year later , sales of stollen dropped because the people of saxony no longer needed to exchange the cakes for western currency . " we had to find new ways to sell our wares , " said matzker , whose father and grandfather were bakers too . going global so he now gives guided tours of the bakery to tourists and has specialized in mail order , sending his cakes around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker marlies morenz gets a stollen ready for shipping his customers include germans living as far away as the united states , canada and australia . " for someone from saxony , even if he left 50 years ago , a christmas without stollen is a sad christmas , " matzker said . and what makes them homesick is the prospect of biting into a slice of freshly baked stollen at teatime in the build-up to christmas in this semi-mountainous area where fir trees stretch up the hillsides . " we celebrate christmas in a big way , " matzker said before returning to his ovens .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.12.2004 controversial nukes decision remembered großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pershing missiles were not welcome in europe in the 1970s and 80s , when it seemed like the us and ussr might unleash a nuclear war in europe , “ no nukes ” was on every peace activist ’ s lips .
sunday marks the 25th anniversary of nato ’ s “ dual track decision . ” nuclear weapons are once again a timely issue .
last month , russia announced its intention to develop new atomic weapons .
his country had “ conducted tests of the latest nuclear rocket systems , ” russian president vladimir putin declared in a cryptic comment . on the other side of the world , us president george w. bush pushed for so-called mini-nukes for use as tactical battlefield weapons .
and in europe , france revealed plans to modernize its atomic weapons arsenal . yet , these recent announcements hardly caused a stir .
but 25 years ago , such decisions would have brought hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets .
that was the case when nato ’ s revealed its infamous “ dual track ” decision on dec .
12 , 1979 . the strategy was a kind of carrot-and-stick approach intended to reduce nuclear arsenals .
nato announced its intention to deploy short and medium-range missiles in western europe , but promised to eliminate them if moscow removed similar rockets from its arsenal . balance in europe threatened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor helmut schmidt faced opposition at home in the mid-1970s , the soviet union developed the medium-range ss-20 missile .
however , the highly-advanced mobile rockets were not aimed at the united states , but at western europe .
this was of no great concern to the us , but german chancellor helmut schmidt pointed out the danger of the ss-20 ’ s to europe in 1977 . schmidt urged nato to counter the soviet threat , and nato responded by deciding to deploy over 100 pershing 2 and more than 400 cruise missiles in europe .
at the same time , schmidt offered a deal to the kremlin .
“ all europeans , also those in the soviet union , would be safer , if there were n't any rockets aimed at european targets , ” schmidt said .
“ therefore , our goal is for both sides eliminate these missiles . ” 300,000 protesters flock to bonn not everyone thought nato ’ s tactic would pay off .
critics feared the move would escalate the arms race in europe .
peace activists mobilized the west german people to protest the two-track decision , launching the “ peace weeks ” in 1980-81 .
“ peace groups explained the meaning of it to the people , ” martin stenner , who joined the movement , told deutsche welle .
“ everyone became an expert in matters like forewarning times and how many cruise missiles were stationed where in germany . ” nato gave the soviet union four years to come up with a solution or it would begin deploying the pershing 2 and cruise missiles .
the peace movement mobilized to hinder nato plans .
even politicians from chancellor schmidt ’ s own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- began joining the demonstrations , which reached a high point on oct .
10 , 1981 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace demonstrators came out in the thousands in bonn on that day , more than 300,000 demonstrators gathered in bonn .
spd politician erhard eppler joined the crowds .
“ we want to stop this ongoing weapons build-up that is choking us .
and we want to stop it where it ’ s occurring : here in central europe - here in germany , ” he cried . when the first pershing missiles were deployed in 1983 , another wave of protests was unleashed .
yet , the rockets would remain in germany only four years .
in december 1987 , the us and the soviet union signed the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- , which banned all 2,600 pershing 2 and ss-20 missiles . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powell re-buffed by nato us secretary of state colin powell 's " charm offensive " in europe bore little fruit on thursday .

the market looks determined the drive the dollar down further in the near future and exporters are starting to feel the pinch . work longer , or do n't work many germans have been grumbling due to the debate this year about extending the number of hours worked in a week in several sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : longer work , same pay employees in some branches , such as manufacturing , had contracts stipulating 35-hour work weeks .
but industry leaders have been saying that in order to stay competitive , german employers need to work longer - 40 hours or perhaps more , and often with no concomitant rise in pay . " if the normal working week were 40 hours instead of 35 , that would mean a difference of 15 percent in personnel costs , " said rogowski . low-wage countries in asia and even next door in eastern europe have put pressure on employees and their unions to agree to employers ' demands .
industry leaders have been eager to play the wage card - either make concessions regarding hours or wages , or production will be shifted from stuttgart to slovakia , from essen to estonia . now that 's something to grumble about . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cloudy skies ahead for german growth a group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for germany 's economic growth , as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy .

not only has the eu agreed to conclude membership talks with bucharest , but sunday also sees the second round of presidential elections . as incumbent romanian president , ion iliescu steps down after almost 15 years in office , prime minister adrian nastase , leader of the ex-communist social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- is locked in battle with traian basescu , the mayor of bucarest and leader of an opposition centrist alliance of liberals and democrats for the highest office in the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest mayor and presidential candidate , traian basescu the first round of polls in what is the most hotly contested ballot in post-communist romania , were inconclusive with neither candidate achieving a clear majority .
nastase emerged slightly ahead of basescu , sparking the latter to accuse him of poll-rigging ukrainian style . in the first instance , nastase rejected the accusations , but later said that the " small irregularities " which had occurred did not substantially affect the outcome of the ballot .
the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .
instead , he has been waiting to see the results of the second round . low voter turnout statistics from the central election office have shown that only 11 million of the 18 million people entitled to vote actually cast a ballot , with the highest number of those who did n't coming from the characteristically pro-european western part of the country . instead of being considered a show of voter apathy , the low turnout has been generally judged as a form of silent protest at opposition party candidate basescu , whose communist background was recently exposed .
the information came as a blow to many intellectuals , who now consider him as nothing grander than the " lesser of two evils . " both candidates have been courting the hungarian party , udmr , which traditionally receives the backing of the hungarian minority .
but the courtships came to an official end when the party called on its supporters to back prime minister nastase in the ballot .
but those 8 percent wo n't necessarily tip the balance . " one should not consider the hungarian voters as one block .
sociologists have established that the hungarian minority is divided .
the hungarians from the center of rumania are more likely to listen to the hungarian party , whereas the hungarian minority in the west of the country is more self-contained and tends to support liberal , pro-western policies , " political analyst emil hurezeanu told deutsche welle .

" romania genuinely does need the continuity of a pro-west integration policy , but is that really in keeping with adrain nastase 's policies ? "
hurezeanu said . there is no foregone conclusion for sunday 's elections quite simply because nobody can estimate how many first round non-voters will make use of their right to cast a ballot . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania vote marred by fraud charges exit polls in key romanian elections are showing a likely win for the ruling social democrats .

nastase emerged slightly ahead of basescu , sparking the latter to accuse him of poll-rigging ukrainian style . in the first instance , nastase rejected the accusations , but later said that the " small irregularities " which had occurred did not substantially affect the outcome of the ballot .
the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .
instead , he has been waiting to see the results of the second round . low voter turnout statistics from the central election office have shown that only 11 million of the 18 million people entitled to vote actually cast a ballot , with the highest number of those who did n't coming from the characteristically pro-european western part of the country . instead of being considered a show of voter apathy , the low turnout has been generally judged as a form of silent protest at opposition party candidate basescu , whose communist background was recently exposed .
the information came as a blow to many intellectuals , who now consider him as nothing grander than the " lesser of two evils . " both candidates have been courting the hungarian party , udmr , which traditionally receives the backing of the hungarian minority .
but the courtships came to an official end when the party called on its supporters to back prime minister nastase in the ballot .
but those 8 percent wo n't necessarily tip the balance . " one should not consider the hungarian voters as one block .
sociologists have established that the hungarian minority is divided .
the hungarians from the center of rumania are more likely to listen to the hungarian party , whereas the hungarian minority in the west of the country is more self-contained and tends to support liberal , pro-western policies , " political analyst emil hurezeanu told deutsche welle .

" romania genuinely does need the continuity of a pro-west integration policy , but is that really in keeping with adrain nastase 's policies ? "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.12.2004 controversial nukes decision remembered großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pershing missiles were not welcome in europe in the 1970s and 80s , when it seemed like the us and ussr might unleash a nuclear war in europe , “ no nukes ” was on every peace activist ’ s lips .
sunday marks the 25th anniversary of nato ’ s “ dual track decision . ” nuclear weapons are once again a timely issue .
last month , russia announced its intention to develop new atomic weapons .
his country had “ conducted tests of the latest nuclear rocket systems , ” russian president vladimir putin declared in a cryptic comment . on the other side of the world , us president george w. bush pushed for so-called mini-nukes for use as tactical battlefield weapons .
and in europe , france revealed plans to modernize its atomic weapons arsenal . yet , these recent announcements hardly caused a stir .
but 25 years ago , such decisions would have brought hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets .
that was the case when nato ’ s revealed its infamous “ dual track ” decision on dec .
12 , 1979 . the strategy was a kind of carrot-and-stick approach intended to reduce nuclear arsenals .
nato announced its intention to deploy short and medium-range missiles in western europe , but promised to eliminate them if moscow removed similar rockets from its arsenal . balance in europe threatened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor helmut schmidt faced opposition at home in the mid-1970s , the soviet union developed the medium-range ss-20 missile .
however , the highly-advanced mobile rockets were not aimed at the united states , but at western europe .
this was of no great concern to the us , but german chancellor helmut schmidt pointed out the danger of the ss-20 ’ s to europe in 1977 . schmidt urged nato to counter the soviet threat , and nato responded by deciding to deploy over 100 pershing 2 and more than 400 cruise missiles in europe .
at the same time , schmidt offered a deal to the kremlin .
“ all europeans , also those in the soviet union , would be safer , if there were n't any rockets aimed at european targets , ” schmidt said .
“ therefore , our goal is for both sides eliminate these missiles . ” 300,000 protesters flock to bonn not everyone thought nato ’ s tactic would pay off .
critics feared the move would escalate the arms race in europe .
peace activists mobilized the west german people to protest the two-track decision , launching the “ peace weeks ” in 1980-81 .
“ peace groups explained the meaning of it to the people , ” martin stenner , who joined the movement , told deutsche welle .
“ everyone became an expert in matters like forewarning times and how many cruise missiles were stationed where in germany . ” nato gave the soviet union four years to come up with a solution or it would begin deploying the pershing 2 and cruise missiles .
the peace movement mobilized to hinder nato plans .
even politicians from chancellor schmidt ’ s own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- began joining the demonstrations , which reached a high point on oct .
10 , 1981 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace demonstrators came out in the thousands in bonn on that day , more than 300,000 demonstrators gathered in bonn .
spd politician erhard eppler joined the crowds .
“ we want to stop this ongoing weapons build-up that is choking us .
and we want to stop it where it ’ s occurring : here in central europe - here in germany , ” he cried . when the first pershing missiles were deployed in 1983 , another wave of protests was unleashed .
yet , the rockets would remain in germany only four years .
in december 1987 , the us and the soviet union signed the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- , which banned all 2,600 pershing 2 and ss-20 missiles . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powell re-buffed by nato us secretary of state colin powell 's " charm offensive " in europe bore little fruit on thursday .

prosecutors said they believed the copyright holders of the media had lost revenues running into tens of millions of euros due to the illegal site .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.12.2004 controversial nukes decision remembered großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pershing missiles were not welcome in europe in the 1970s and 80s , when it seemed like the us and ussr might unleash a nuclear war in europe , “ no nukes ” was on every peace activist ’ s lips .
sunday marks the 25th anniversary of nato ’ s “ dual track decision . ” nuclear weapons are once again a timely issue .
last month , russia announced its intention to develop new atomic weapons .
his country had “ conducted tests of the latest nuclear rocket systems , ” russian president vladimir putin declared in a cryptic comment . on the other side of the world , us president george w. bush pushed for so-called mini-nukes for use as tactical battlefield weapons .
and in europe , france revealed plans to modernize its atomic weapons arsenal . yet , these recent announcements hardly caused a stir .
but 25 years ago , such decisions would have brought hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets .
that was the case when nato ’ s revealed its infamous “ dual track ” decision on dec .
12 , 1979 . the strategy was a kind of carrot-and-stick approach intended to reduce nuclear arsenals .
nato announced its intention to deploy short and medium-range missiles in western europe , but promised to eliminate them if moscow removed similar rockets from its arsenal . balance in europe threatened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor helmut schmidt faced opposition at home in the mid-1970s , the soviet union developed the medium-range ss-20 missile .
however , the highly-advanced mobile rockets were not aimed at the united states , but at western europe .
this was of no great concern to the us , but german chancellor helmut schmidt pointed out the danger of the ss-20 ’ s to europe in 1977 . schmidt urged nato to counter the soviet threat , and nato responded by deciding to deploy over 100 pershing 2 and more than 400 cruise missiles in europe .
at the same time , schmidt offered a deal to the kremlin .
“ all europeans , also those in the soviet union , would be safer , if there were n't any rockets aimed at european targets , ” schmidt said .
“ therefore , our goal is for both sides eliminate these missiles . ” 300,000 protesters flock to bonn not everyone thought nato ’ s tactic would pay off .
critics feared the move would escalate the arms race in europe .
peace activists mobilized the west german people to protest the two-track decision , launching the “ peace weeks ” in 1980-81 .
“ peace groups explained the meaning of it to the people , ” martin stenner , who joined the movement , told deutsche welle .
“ everyone became an expert in matters like forewarning times and how many cruise missiles were stationed where in germany . ” nato gave the soviet union four years to come up with a solution or it would begin deploying the pershing 2 and cruise missiles .
the peace movement mobilized to hinder nato plans .
even politicians from chancellor schmidt ’ s own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- began joining the demonstrations , which reached a high point on oct .
10 , 1981 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace demonstrators came out in the thousands in bonn on that day , more than 300,000 demonstrators gathered in bonn .
spd politician erhard eppler joined the crowds .
“ we want to stop this ongoing weapons build-up that is choking us .
and we want to stop it where it ’ s occurring : here in central europe - here in germany , ” he cried . when the first pershing missiles were deployed in 1983 , another wave of protests was unleashed .
yet , the rockets would remain in germany only four years .
in december 1987 , the us and the soviet union signed the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- , which banned all 2,600 pershing 2 and ss-20 missiles . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powell re-buffed by nato us secretary of state colin powell 's " charm offensive " in europe bore little fruit on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.12.2004 moaning and groaning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economy was in better spirits in 2004 , but germans were n't germans should be pretty happy with the country 's economic performance in 2004 .
after three years of stagnation , the economy grew 1.8 percent .
but you 'd never know from all the complaining that 's been going on . listening to most people talking about the state of the german economy , one might think the apocalypse were fast approaching .
but in reality , 2004 was a fairly respectable year : the economy grew , not amazingly , but it finally woke up from a three-year slumber ; the german stock market index , the dax , reported slow but steady growth ; and exporters reported record surpluses , beating analysts ' expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doom and gloom so why all the glum faces ?
perhaps there 's something in germans ' genes that causes them to see the glass half empty . or perhaps it 's that despite the good news on several fronts , developments around issues that hit consumers directly were often less than encouraging .
here 's a look at several of the salient economic matters of 2004 . dax doing well , but mistrusted while the dax has performed well for at least a year and a half , there is still a reluctance by a large swath of the german public to invest money in the market .
germans tend to be more risk averse than some nationalities , and a string of well-publicized initial public offerings -lrb- ipos -rrb- in 2004 that did n't go well increased market shyness . " people were watching developments very , very carefully , " according to klaus nieding of the german association for the protection of small shareholders .
" one phrase that might apply to the stock market these days is : ' it 's cool to be stingy . " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all stocks were winners that philosophy was helped along by the experience of those holding stocks in the internet service provider t-online .
it 's parent company , deutsche telekom , now wants to bring it back into the fold and is offering shareholders just under € 9 -lrb- $ 11.86 -rrb- per share , exactly one third of that the stock cost when it was first offered in early 2000 . the consumer blues while germans are n't pouring their money into the stock market , they also are n't pouring it into retailers ' cash registers .
the retail industry was one of the biggest complainers in 2004 , but that 's nothing new .
for years , its goes on binges bemoaning germans ' tight-fisted ways .
but the dirge provided a near constant background hum throughout 2004 . " private spending remains the achilles ' heel of the german economy , " said gustav horn of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
" and the rise in household income is too weak to expect a real upturn in spending . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping - germans are n't doing it economists say the fundaments of a real economic recovery are there , it 's just the consumer is not playing along , therefore dragging the recovery down . " we 've passed through the valley of tears , " said economic minister wolfgang clement , sounding something like a preacher trying to convince a doubtful congregation .
" germany is moving , in an upward direction .
i 'm telling you , things are going well again in germany . " export explosion the reason for the rosier-than-lately economic picture in germany can basically be ascribed to one thing : exports .
exports have always been an important component of germany 's economic engine , but in 2004 , they were pretty much the sole power source . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another new porsche heading overseas exporters enjoyed a record surplus this year of € 160 billion -lrb- $ 212 billion -rrb- . " we have an very strong export-driven economy right now , better than expected , " said martin rogowski , president of the german federation of industry .
exports this year were strong enough to make up for the nation 's stagnant construction sector and poor domestic demand . but the export party can only last so long , the diw 's horn wrote in a recent report .
most analysts predict german exports will lose steam because the global economy will grow less robustly than it did this year . others worry that the strength the euro will hurt exporters if it continues its meteoric rise in value , since it makes german goods abroad more expensive .
the european common currency has hit record highs against the dollar in the last week , reaching over $ 1.34 .
the market looks determined the drive the dollar down further in the near future and exporters are starting to feel the pinch . work longer , or do n't work many germans have been grumbling due to the debate this year about extending the number of hours worked in a week in several sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : longer work , same pay employees in some branches , such as manufacturing , had contracts stipulating 35-hour work weeks .
but industry leaders have been saying that in order to stay competitive , german employers need to work longer - 40 hours or perhaps more , and often with no concomitant rise in pay . " if the normal working week were 40 hours instead of 35 , that would mean a difference of 15 percent in personnel costs , " said rogowski . low-wage countries in asia and even next door in eastern europe have put pressure on employees and their unions to agree to employers ' demands .
industry leaders have been eager to play the wage card - either make concessions regarding hours or wages , or production will be shifted from stuttgart to slovakia , from essen to estonia . now that 's something to grumble about . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cloudy skies ahead for german growth a group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for germany 's economic growth , as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.12.2004 controversial nukes decision remembered großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pershing missiles were not welcome in europe in the 1970s and 80s , when it seemed like the us and ussr might unleash a nuclear war in europe , “ no nukes ” was on every peace activist ’ s lips .
sunday marks the 25th anniversary of nato ’ s “ dual track decision . ” nuclear weapons are once again a timely issue .
last month , russia announced its intention to develop new atomic weapons .
his country had “ conducted tests of the latest nuclear rocket systems , ” russian president vladimir putin declared in a cryptic comment . on the other side of the world , us president george w. bush pushed for so-called mini-nukes for use as tactical battlefield weapons .
and in europe , france revealed plans to modernize its atomic weapons arsenal . yet , these recent announcements hardly caused a stir .
but 25 years ago , such decisions would have brought hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets .
that was the case when nato ’ s revealed its infamous “ dual track ” decision on dec .
12 , 1979 . the strategy was a kind of carrot-and-stick approach intended to reduce nuclear arsenals .
nato announced its intention to deploy short and medium-range missiles in western europe , but promised to eliminate them if moscow removed similar rockets from its arsenal . balance in europe threatened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor helmut schmidt faced opposition at home in the mid-1970s , the soviet union developed the medium-range ss-20 missile .
however , the highly-advanced mobile rockets were not aimed at the united states , but at western europe .
this was of no great concern to the us , but german chancellor helmut schmidt pointed out the danger of the ss-20 ’ s to europe in 1977 . schmidt urged nato to counter the soviet threat , and nato responded by deciding to deploy over 100 pershing 2 and more than 400 cruise missiles in europe .
at the same time , schmidt offered a deal to the kremlin .
“ all europeans , also those in the soviet union , would be safer , if there were n't any rockets aimed at european targets , ” schmidt said .
“ therefore , our goal is for both sides eliminate these missiles . ” 300,000 protesters flock to bonn not everyone thought nato ’ s tactic would pay off .
critics feared the move would escalate the arms race in europe .
peace activists mobilized the west german people to protest the two-track decision , launching the “ peace weeks ” in 1980-81 .
“ peace groups explained the meaning of it to the people , ” martin stenner , who joined the movement , told deutsche welle .
“ everyone became an expert in matters like forewarning times and how many cruise missiles were stationed where in germany . ” nato gave the soviet union four years to come up with a solution or it would begin deploying the pershing 2 and cruise missiles .
the peace movement mobilized to hinder nato plans .
even politicians from chancellor schmidt ’ s own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- began joining the demonstrations , which reached a high point on oct .
10 , 1981 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace demonstrators came out in the thousands in bonn on that day , more than 300,000 demonstrators gathered in bonn .
spd politician erhard eppler joined the crowds .
“ we want to stop this ongoing weapons build-up that is choking us .
and we want to stop it where it ’ s occurring : here in central europe - here in germany , ” he cried . when the first pershing missiles were deployed in 1983 , another wave of protests was unleashed .
yet , the rockets would remain in germany only four years .
in december 1987 , the us and the soviet union signed the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- , which banned all 2,600 pershing 2 and ss-20 missiles . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powell re-buffed by nato us secretary of state colin powell 's " charm offensive " in europe bore little fruit on thursday .

not only has the eu agreed to conclude membership talks with bucharest , but sunday also sees the second round of presidential elections . as incumbent romanian president , ion iliescu steps down after almost 15 years in office , prime minister adrian nastase , leader of the ex-communist social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- is locked in battle with traian basescu , the mayor of bucarest and leader of an opposition centrist alliance of liberals and democrats for the highest office in the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest mayor and presidential candidate , traian basescu the first round of polls in what is the most hotly contested ballot in post-communist romania , were inconclusive with neither candidate achieving a clear majority .
nastase emerged slightly ahead of basescu , sparking the latter to accuse him of poll-rigging ukrainian style . in the first instance , nastase rejected the accusations , but later said that the " small irregularities " which had occurred did not substantially affect the outcome of the ballot .
the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .
instead , he has been waiting to see the results of the second round . low voter turnout statistics from the central election office have shown that only 11 million of the 18 million people entitled to vote actually cast a ballot , with the highest number of those who did n't coming from the characteristically pro-european western part of the country . instead of being considered a show of voter apathy , the low turnout has been generally judged as a form of silent protest at opposition party candidate basescu , whose communist background was recently exposed .
the information came as a blow to many intellectuals , who now consider him as nothing grander than the " lesser of two evils . " both candidates have been courting the hungarian party , udmr , which traditionally receives the backing of the hungarian minority .

" romania genuinely does need the continuity of a pro-west integration policy , but is that really in keeping with adrain nastase 's policies ? "

sunday marks the 25th anniversary of nato ’ s “ dual track decision . ” nuclear weapons are once again a timely issue .
last month , russia announced its intention to develop new atomic weapons .
his country had “ conducted tests of the latest nuclear rocket systems , ” russian president vladimir putin declared in a cryptic comment . on the other side of the world , us president george w. bush pushed for so-called mini-nukes for use as tactical battlefield weapons .
and in europe , france revealed plans to modernize its atomic weapons arsenal . yet , these recent announcements hardly caused a stir .
but 25 years ago , such decisions would have brought hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets .
that was the case when nato ’ s revealed its infamous “ dual track ” decision on dec .

this was of no great concern to the us , but german chancellor helmut schmidt pointed out the danger of the ss-20 ’ s to europe in 1977 . schmidt urged nato to counter the soviet threat , and nato responded by deciding to deploy over 100 pershing 2 and more than 400 cruise missiles in europe .
at the same time , schmidt offered a deal to the kremlin .
“ all europeans , also those in the soviet union , would be safer , if there were n't any rockets aimed at european targets , ” schmidt said .
“ therefore , our goal is for both sides eliminate these missiles . ” 300,000 protesters flock to bonn not everyone thought nato ’ s tactic would pay off .
critics feared the move would escalate the arms race in europe .
peace activists mobilized the west german people to protest the two-track decision , launching the “ peace weeks ” in 1980-81 .
“ peace groups explained the meaning of it to the people , ” martin stenner , who joined the movement , told deutsche welle .
“ everyone became an expert in matters like forewarning times and how many cruise missiles were stationed where in germany . ” nato gave the soviet union four years to come up with a solution or it would begin deploying the pershing 2 and cruise missiles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.12.2004 moaning and groaning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economy was in better spirits in 2004 , but germans were n't germans should be pretty happy with the country 's economic performance in 2004 .
after three years of stagnation , the economy grew 1.8 percent .
but you 'd never know from all the complaining that 's been going on . listening to most people talking about the state of the german economy , one might think the apocalypse were fast approaching .
but in reality , 2004 was a fairly respectable year : the economy grew , not amazingly , but it finally woke up from a three-year slumber ; the german stock market index , the dax , reported slow but steady growth ; and exporters reported record surpluses , beating analysts ' expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doom and gloom so why all the glum faces ?
perhaps there 's something in germans ' genes that causes them to see the glass half empty . or perhaps it 's that despite the good news on several fronts , developments around issues that hit consumers directly were often less than encouraging .
here 's a look at several of the salient economic matters of 2004 . dax doing well , but mistrusted while the dax has performed well for at least a year and a half , there is still a reluctance by a large swath of the german public to invest money in the market .
germans tend to be more risk averse than some nationalities , and a string of well-publicized initial public offerings -lrb- ipos -rrb- in 2004 that did n't go well increased market shyness . " people were watching developments very , very carefully , " according to klaus nieding of the german association for the protection of small shareholders .
" one phrase that might apply to the stock market these days is : ' it 's cool to be stingy . " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all stocks were winners that philosophy was helped along by the experience of those holding stocks in the internet service provider t-online .
it 's parent company , deutsche telekom , now wants to bring it back into the fold and is offering shareholders just under € 9 -lrb- $ 11.86 -rrb- per share , exactly one third of that the stock cost when it was first offered in early 2000 . the consumer blues while germans are n't pouring their money into the stock market , they also are n't pouring it into retailers ' cash registers .
the retail industry was one of the biggest complainers in 2004 , but that 's nothing new .
for years , its goes on binges bemoaning germans ' tight-fisted ways .
but the dirge provided a near constant background hum throughout 2004 . " private spending remains the achilles ' heel of the german economy , " said gustav horn of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
" and the rise in household income is too weak to expect a real upturn in spending . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping - germans are n't doing it economists say the fundaments of a real economic recovery are there , it 's just the consumer is not playing along , therefore dragging the recovery down . " we 've passed through the valley of tears , " said economic minister wolfgang clement , sounding something like a preacher trying to convince a doubtful congregation .
" germany is moving , in an upward direction .
i 'm telling you , things are going well again in germany . " export explosion the reason for the rosier-than-lately economic picture in germany can basically be ascribed to one thing : exports .
exports have always been an important component of germany 's economic engine , but in 2004 , they were pretty much the sole power source . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another new porsche heading overseas exporters enjoyed a record surplus this year of € 160 billion -lrb- $ 212 billion -rrb- . " we have an very strong export-driven economy right now , better than expected , " said martin rogowski , president of the german federation of industry .
exports this year were strong enough to make up for the nation 's stagnant construction sector and poor domestic demand . but the export party can only last so long , the diw 's horn wrote in a recent report .
most analysts predict german exports will lose steam because the global economy will grow less robustly than it did this year . others worry that the strength the euro will hurt exporters if it continues its meteoric rise in value , since it makes german goods abroad more expensive .
the european common currency has hit record highs against the dollar in the last week , reaching over $ 1.34 .
the market looks determined the drive the dollar down further in the near future and exporters are starting to feel the pinch . work longer , or do n't work many germans have been grumbling due to the debate this year about extending the number of hours worked in a week in several sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : longer work , same pay employees in some branches , such as manufacturing , had contracts stipulating 35-hour work weeks .
but industry leaders have been saying that in order to stay competitive , german employers need to work longer - 40 hours or perhaps more , and often with no concomitant rise in pay . " if the normal working week were 40 hours instead of 35 , that would mean a difference of 15 percent in personnel costs , " said rogowski . low-wage countries in asia and even next door in eastern europe have put pressure on employees and their unions to agree to employers ' demands .
industry leaders have been eager to play the wage card - either make concessions regarding hours or wages , or production will be shifted from stuttgart to slovakia , from essen to estonia . now that 's something to grumble about . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cloudy skies ahead for german growth a group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for germany 's economic growth , as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy .

after three years of stagnation , the economy grew 1.8 percent .
but you 'd never know from all the complaining that 's been going on . listening to most people talking about the state of the german economy , one might think the apocalypse were fast approaching .
but in reality , 2004 was a fairly respectable year : the economy grew , not amazingly , but it finally woke up from a three-year slumber ; the german stock market index , the dax , reported slow but steady growth ; and exporters reported record surpluses , beating analysts ' expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doom and gloom so why all the glum faces ?
perhaps there 's something in germans ' genes that causes them to see the glass half empty . or perhaps it 's that despite the good news on several fronts , developments around issues that hit consumers directly were often less than encouraging .
here 's a look at several of the salient economic matters of 2004 . dax doing well , but mistrusted while the dax has performed well for at least a year and a half , there is still a reluctance by a large swath of the german public to invest money in the market .
germans tend to be more risk averse than some nationalities , and a string of well-publicized initial public offerings -lrb- ipos -rrb- in 2004 that did n't go well increased market shyness . " people were watching developments very , very carefully , " according to klaus nieding of the german association for the protection of small shareholders .
" one phrase that might apply to the stock market these days is : ' it 's cool to be stingy . " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all stocks were winners that philosophy was helped along by the experience of those holding stocks in the internet service provider t-online .
it 's parent company , deutsche telekom , now wants to bring it back into the fold and is offering shareholders just under € 9 -lrb- $ 11.86 -rrb- per share , exactly one third of that the stock cost when it was first offered in early 2000 . the consumer blues while germans are n't pouring their money into the stock market , they also are n't pouring it into retailers ' cash registers .
the retail industry was one of the biggest complainers in 2004 , but that 's nothing new .
for years , its goes on binges bemoaning germans ' tight-fisted ways .
but the dirge provided a near constant background hum throughout 2004 . " private spending remains the achilles ' heel of the german economy , " said gustav horn of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
" and the rise in household income is too weak to expect a real upturn in spending . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping - germans are n't doing it economists say the fundaments of a real economic recovery are there , it 's just the consumer is not playing along , therefore dragging the recovery down . " we 've passed through the valley of tears , " said economic minister wolfgang clement , sounding something like a preacher trying to convince a doubtful congregation .
" germany is moving , in an upward direction .
i 'm telling you , things are going well again in germany . " export explosion the reason for the rosier-than-lately economic picture in germany can basically be ascribed to one thing : exports .
exports have always been an important component of germany 's economic engine , but in 2004 , they were pretty much the sole power source . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another new porsche heading overseas exporters enjoyed a record surplus this year of € 160 billion -lrb- $ 212 billion -rrb- . " we have an very strong export-driven economy right now , better than expected , " said martin rogowski , president of the german federation of industry .
exports this year were strong enough to make up for the nation 's stagnant construction sector and poor domestic demand . but the export party can only last so long , the diw 's horn wrote in a recent report .
most analysts predict german exports will lose steam because the global economy will grow less robustly than it did this year . others worry that the strength the euro will hurt exporters if it continues its meteoric rise in value , since it makes german goods abroad more expensive .
the european common currency has hit record highs against the dollar in the last week , reaching over $ 1.34 .
the market looks determined the drive the dollar down further in the near future and exporters are starting to feel the pinch . work longer , or do n't work many germans have been grumbling due to the debate this year about extending the number of hours worked in a week in several sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : longer work , same pay employees in some branches , such as manufacturing , had contracts stipulating 35-hour work weeks .
but industry leaders have been saying that in order to stay competitive , german employers need to work longer - 40 hours or perhaps more , and often with no concomitant rise in pay . " if the normal working week were 40 hours instead of 35 , that would mean a difference of 15 percent in personnel costs , " said rogowski . low-wage countries in asia and even next door in eastern europe have put pressure on employees and their unions to agree to employers ' demands .
industry leaders have been eager to play the wage card - either make concessions regarding hours or wages , or production will be shifted from stuttgart to slovakia , from essen to estonia . now that 's something to grumble about . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cloudy skies ahead for german growth a group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for germany 's economic growth , as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone 's biggest economy .

not only has the eu agreed to conclude membership talks with bucharest , but sunday also sees the second round of presidential elections . as incumbent romanian president , ion iliescu steps down after almost 15 years in office , prime minister adrian nastase , leader of the ex-communist social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- is locked in battle with traian basescu , the mayor of bucarest and leader of an opposition centrist alliance of liberals and democrats for the highest office in the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest mayor and presidential candidate , traian basescu the first round of polls in what is the most hotly contested ballot in post-communist romania , were inconclusive with neither candidate achieving a clear majority .
nastase emerged slightly ahead of basescu , sparking the latter to accuse him of poll-rigging ukrainian style . in the first instance , nastase rejected the accusations , but later said that the " small irregularities " which had occurred did not substantially affect the outcome of the ballot .
the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .
instead , he has been waiting to see the results of the second round . low voter turnout statistics from the central election office have shown that only 11 million of the 18 million people entitled to vote actually cast a ballot , with the highest number of those who did n't coming from the characteristically pro-european western part of the country . instead of being considered a show of voter apathy , the low turnout has been generally judged as a form of silent protest at opposition party candidate basescu , whose communist background was recently exposed .
the information came as a blow to many intellectuals , who now consider him as nothing grander than the " lesser of two evils . " both candidates have been courting the hungarian party , udmr , which traditionally receives the backing of the hungarian minority .
but the courtships came to an official end when the party called on its supporters to back prime minister nastase in the ballot .
but those 8 percent wo n't necessarily tip the balance . " one should not consider the hungarian voters as one block .
sociologists have established that the hungarian minority is divided .
the hungarians from the center of rumania are more likely to listen to the hungarian party , whereas the hungarian minority in the west of the country is more self-contained and tends to support liberal , pro-western policies , " political analyst emil hurezeanu told deutsche welle .
" so it is not the decisions of the hungarian party which count , but the mobilization of that half of the population that did n't turn out to vote the first time round . " the path to european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian prime minister adrian nastase whoever wins after the sunday ballot will be focussed on leading romania into the arms of the european union in 2007 , and with that in mind , the two candidates are running with similar policies promising to tackle corruption and secure the independence of the justice system . in his campaign , nastase has claimed to be in the throes of introducing a reform process , suggesting voters should vote for him and opt for continuity . " romania genuinely does need the continuity of a pro-west integration policy , but is that really in keeping with adrain nastase 's policies ? "
hurezeanu said . there is no foregone conclusion for sunday 's elections quite simply because nobody can estimate how many first round non-voters will make use of their right to cast a ballot . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania vote marred by fraud charges exit polls in key romanian elections are showing a likely win for the ruling social democrats .

not only has the eu agreed to conclude membership talks with bucharest , but sunday also sees the second round of presidential elections . as incumbent romanian president , ion iliescu steps down after almost 15 years in office , prime minister adrian nastase , leader of the ex-communist social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- is locked in battle with traian basescu , the mayor of bucarest and leader of an opposition centrist alliance of liberals and democrats for the highest office in the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest mayor and presidential candidate , traian basescu the first round of polls in what is the most hotly contested ballot in post-communist romania , were inconclusive with neither candidate achieving a clear majority .
nastase emerged slightly ahead of basescu , sparking the latter to accuse him of poll-rigging ukrainian style . in the first instance , nastase rejected the accusations , but later said that the " small irregularities " which had occurred did not substantially affect the outcome of the ballot .
the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.12.2004 controversial nukes decision remembered großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pershing missiles were not welcome in europe in the 1970s and 80s , when it seemed like the us and ussr might unleash a nuclear war in europe , “ no nukes ” was on every peace activist ’ s lips .
sunday marks the 25th anniversary of nato ’ s “ dual track decision . ” nuclear weapons are once again a timely issue .
last month , russia announced its intention to develop new atomic weapons .
his country had “ conducted tests of the latest nuclear rocket systems , ” russian president vladimir putin declared in a cryptic comment . on the other side of the world , us president george w. bush pushed for so-called mini-nukes for use as tactical battlefield weapons .
and in europe , france revealed plans to modernize its atomic weapons arsenal . yet , these recent announcements hardly caused a stir .
but 25 years ago , such decisions would have brought hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets .
that was the case when nato ’ s revealed its infamous “ dual track ” decision on dec .
12 , 1979 . the strategy was a kind of carrot-and-stick approach intended to reduce nuclear arsenals .
nato announced its intention to deploy short and medium-range missiles in western europe , but promised to eliminate them if moscow removed similar rockets from its arsenal . balance in europe threatened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor helmut schmidt faced opposition at home in the mid-1970s , the soviet union developed the medium-range ss-20 missile .
however , the highly-advanced mobile rockets were not aimed at the united states , but at western europe .
this was of no great concern to the us , but german chancellor helmut schmidt pointed out the danger of the ss-20 ’ s to europe in 1977 . schmidt urged nato to counter the soviet threat , and nato responded by deciding to deploy over 100 pershing 2 and more than 400 cruise missiles in europe .
at the same time , schmidt offered a deal to the kremlin .
“ all europeans , also those in the soviet union , would be safer , if there were n't any rockets aimed at european targets , ” schmidt said .
“ therefore , our goal is for both sides eliminate these missiles . ” 300,000 protesters flock to bonn not everyone thought nato ’ s tactic would pay off .
critics feared the move would escalate the arms race in europe .
peace activists mobilized the west german people to protest the two-track decision , launching the “ peace weeks ” in 1980-81 .
“ peace groups explained the meaning of it to the people , ” martin stenner , who joined the movement , told deutsche welle .
“ everyone became an expert in matters like forewarning times and how many cruise missiles were stationed where in germany . ” nato gave the soviet union four years to come up with a solution or it would begin deploying the pershing 2 and cruise missiles .
the peace movement mobilized to hinder nato plans .
even politicians from chancellor schmidt ’ s own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- began joining the demonstrations , which reached a high point on oct .
10 , 1981 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace demonstrators came out in the thousands in bonn on that day , more than 300,000 demonstrators gathered in bonn .
spd politician erhard eppler joined the crowds .
“ we want to stop this ongoing weapons build-up that is choking us .
and we want to stop it where it ’ s occurring : here in central europe - here in germany , ” he cried . when the first pershing missiles were deployed in 1983 , another wave of protests was unleashed .
yet , the rockets would remain in germany only four years .
in december 1987 , the us and the soviet union signed the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- , which banned all 2,600 pershing 2 and ss-20 missiles . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powell re-buffed by nato us secretary of state colin powell 's " charm offensive " in europe bore little fruit on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.12.2004 round two in romanian presidential ballot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanians take to the polls again on sunday these are important days for the future of romania .
not only has the eu agreed to conclude membership talks with bucharest , but sunday also sees the second round of presidential elections . as incumbent romanian president , ion iliescu steps down after almost 15 years in office , prime minister adrian nastase , leader of the ex-communist social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- is locked in battle with traian basescu , the mayor of bucarest and leader of an opposition centrist alliance of liberals and democrats for the highest office in the land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bucharest mayor and presidential candidate , traian basescu the first round of polls in what is the most hotly contested ballot in post-communist romania , were inconclusive with neither candidate achieving a clear majority .
nastase emerged slightly ahead of basescu , sparking the latter to accuse him of poll-rigging ukrainian style . in the first instance , nastase rejected the accusations , but later said that the " small irregularities " which had occurred did not substantially affect the outcome of the ballot .
the prime minister subsequently accused his challenger of trying to incite unrest amongst the population . but basescu did not call for the romanian people to take to the streets in protest .
instead , he has been waiting to see the results of the second round . low voter turnout statistics from the central election office have shown that only 11 million of the 18 million people entitled to vote actually cast a ballot , with the highest number of those who did n't coming from the characteristically pro-european western part of the country . instead of being considered a show of voter apathy , the low turnout has been generally judged as a form of silent protest at opposition party candidate basescu , whose communist background was recently exposed .
the information came as a blow to many intellectuals , who now consider him as nothing grander than the " lesser of two evils . " both candidates have been courting the hungarian party , udmr , which traditionally receives the backing of the hungarian minority .
but the courtships came to an official end when the party called on its supporters to back prime minister nastase in the ballot .
but those 8 percent wo n't necessarily tip the balance . " one should not consider the hungarian voters as one block .
sociologists have established that the hungarian minority is divided .
the hungarians from the center of rumania are more likely to listen to the hungarian party , whereas the hungarian minority in the west of the country is more self-contained and tends to support liberal , pro-western policies , " political analyst emil hurezeanu told deutsche welle .
" so it is not the decisions of the hungarian party which count , but the mobilization of that half of the population that did n't turn out to vote the first time round . " the path to european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian prime minister adrian nastase whoever wins after the sunday ballot will be focussed on leading romania into the arms of the european union in 2007 , and with that in mind , the two candidates are running with similar policies promising to tackle corruption and secure the independence of the justice system . in his campaign , nastase has claimed to be in the throes of introducing a reform process , suggesting voters should vote for him and opt for continuity . " romania genuinely does need the continuity of a pro-west integration policy , but is that really in keeping with adrain nastase 's policies ? "
hurezeanu said . there is no foregone conclusion for sunday 's elections quite simply because nobody can estimate how many first round non-voters will make use of their right to cast a ballot . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania vote marred by fraud charges exit polls in key romanian elections are showing a likely win for the ruling social democrats .

dresden 's particularly well-known for its version , which became a hotly traded good during communist times . shaped like an oblong , flat loaf of bread , studded with almonds and raisins and flavoured with orange and lemon , the stollen was first created in the ovens of the eastern city of dresden almost 600 years ago . so important is the cake to the city that bakers must meet a stringent quality test in order to be able to call their products genuine " dresden stollen . " hans-jürgen matzker heads the association for the protection of dresden stollen , which represents 150 producers , and sets the quality test .
he said that to judge the role stollen plays in dresden life , you only have to look at the figures for his small , pink-walled bakery in the city 's suburbs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dresden baker with stollen cakes " the production of stollen represents 20 percent of our annual turnover , " matzker told afp , taking a short break from a hectic work day . from mid-october to january , matzker and his 27 employees work virtually flat out to satisfy the demand for his stollen which scores 18.3 points out of a possible 20 in the association 's quality test score . predecessor an austere affair the first stollen in the middle ages was a more austere affair - a dry cake made of flour , yeast and water which nourished people through the fasting period leading up to christmas .
it was known as " christbrod " -lrb- " bread of christ " -rrb- and because of its shape , it represented the swaddled body of the infant jesus . in the 15th century , the electoral princes of the then independent state of saxony found the cake too dry and in 1491 they were granted permission by pope innocent viii to add butter to the recipe . centuries later , matzker and his fellow bakers had to use all their ingenuity when confronted with the food shortages of communist rule in east germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker ronald morenz from dresden is pulling a stollen out of the oven " when we could n't get any candied lemon peel , we used small green tomatoes and soaked them in a sugary solution , then glazed them , " he recalled .
" they had a sweet taste , but they did n't taste of tomatoes . " communist currency the stollen also became a form of currency in communist times . unlike the nationalized industries , bakers were not allowed to export their goods but their customers would buy them by the dozen and send them to friends or relatives on the other side of the iron curtain in exchange for precious deutsche marks . when the berlin wall fell in 1989 and germany was reunified a year later , sales of stollen dropped because the people of saxony no longer needed to exchange the cakes for western currency . " we had to find new ways to sell our wares , " said matzker , whose father and grandfather were bakers too . going global so he now gives guided tours of the bakery to tourists and has specialized in mail order , sending his cakes around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baker marlies morenz gets a stollen ready for shipping his customers include germans living as far away as the united states , canada and australia . " for someone from saxony , even if he left 50 years ago , a christmas without stollen is a sad christmas , " matzker said . and what makes them homesick is the prospect of biting into a slice of freshly baked stollen at teatime in the build-up to christmas in this semi-mountainous area where fir trees stretch up the hillsides . " we celebrate christmas in a big way , " matzker said before returning to his ovens .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.12.2004 controversial nukes decision remembered großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pershing missiles were not welcome in europe in the 1970s and 80s , when it seemed like the us and ussr might unleash a nuclear war in europe , “ no nukes ” was on every peace activist ’ s lips .
sunday marks the 25th anniversary of nato ’ s “ dual track decision . ” nuclear weapons are once again a timely issue .
last month , russia announced its intention to develop new atomic weapons .
his country had “ conducted tests of the latest nuclear rocket systems , ” russian president vladimir putin declared in a cryptic comment . on the other side of the world , us president george w. bush pushed for so-called mini-nukes for use as tactical battlefield weapons .
and in europe , france revealed plans to modernize its atomic weapons arsenal . yet , these recent announcements hardly caused a stir .
but 25 years ago , such decisions would have brought hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets .
that was the case when nato ’ s revealed its infamous “ dual track ” decision on dec .
12 , 1979 . the strategy was a kind of carrot-and-stick approach intended to reduce nuclear arsenals .
nato announced its intention to deploy short and medium-range missiles in western europe , but promised to eliminate them if moscow removed similar rockets from its arsenal . balance in europe threatened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor helmut schmidt faced opposition at home in the mid-1970s , the soviet union developed the medium-range ss-20 missile .
however , the highly-advanced mobile rockets were not aimed at the united states , but at western europe .
this was of no great concern to the us , but german chancellor helmut schmidt pointed out the danger of the ss-20 ’ s to europe in 1977 . schmidt urged nato to counter the soviet threat , and nato responded by deciding to deploy over 100 pershing 2 and more than 400 cruise missiles in europe .
at the same time , schmidt offered a deal to the kremlin .
“ all europeans , also those in the soviet union , would be safer , if there were n't any rockets aimed at european targets , ” schmidt said .
“ therefore , our goal is for both sides eliminate these missiles . ” 300,000 protesters flock to bonn not everyone thought nato ’ s tactic would pay off .
critics feared the move would escalate the arms race in europe .
peace activists mobilized the west german people to protest the two-track decision , launching the “ peace weeks ” in 1980-81 .
“ peace groups explained the meaning of it to the people , ” martin stenner , who joined the movement , told deutsche welle .
“ everyone became an expert in matters like forewarning times and how many cruise missiles were stationed where in germany . ” nato gave the soviet union four years to come up with a solution or it would begin deploying the pershing 2 and cruise missiles .

the women were staying in a safe house run by the group after a police raid on the hotel where they worked .
an armed gang took most of them away from the shelter on wednesday .
it is not clear what has happened to them since and the biggest raid of the year by anti-human trafficking police has turned into an embarrassing mess .
on saturday a group of women who claim to have been at the safe house protested outside the us embassy .
they said they had been taken away from the hotel against their will .
protest letter female staff at the chhay hour ii hotel in phnom penh have denied they are sex workers .
the management at the hotel say the women were not abducted from the safe house , but escaped from the facility to return to work .
the organisation which ran the safe house , afesip , is not convinced by the claims .
they say a two-month long investigation by the anti-trafficking police confirmed that the hotel was being run as a brothel .
afesip believe their operations and the work of the police are being undermined by high-level officials .
their spokesperson said that if these people are confident and powerful enough to break into our centre and take these girls then they feel confident enough to take all these girls back to work .
on monday afesip will send a letter of protest to prime minister hun sen. the following day they will hold a news conference in bangkok .
they say they no longer feel comfortable operating in cambodia .

last week e.w. pepper ltd , of herts , pleaded guilty to breaching health and safety laws after the woman 's death at a farm in melbourn , cambs .
chris kaufman , who represents rural workers for the t & g union , said too many firms cut corners on safety .
he called for new laws to be brought in so lax employers could face jail .
last week 's health and safety executive prosecution related to the death of hungarian employee ezther nagy who died after her forklift truck overturned .
it is all about the firm 's balance sheets , and they do include the cost of people 's lives chris kaufman , t & g union the court heard of e.w. pepper 's failure to use trained staff to drive forklift trucks and failure to control access to this mobile mechanical handling equipment .
as well as the fine , magistrates ordered the firm to pay £ 11,500 in costs .

the dispute is between managers and the aslef union over pay .
it comes on the day new rail timetables are introduced nationwide as part of a major shake-up .
midland mainline is laying on buses from the stations south of derby to bedford , where passengers can transfer to thameslink services on to london .
the 200 drivers taking action are not contracted to work on sundays .
none of them have offered to work overtime .
there are no replacement midland mainline -lrb- mml -rrb- buses north of derby and nottingham , but central trains rail services are running as normal on that route .
london to sheffield passengers are advised to travel via doncaster on other rail services .
they will need to catch two trains but will not have to travel on a bus .
' held to ransom ' mml has said passengers can use their tickets from other stations on rival gner and virgin services to london , although gner is only accepting certain tickets .
the drivers ' action follows a similar dispute in april which saw train services cancelled .
aslef members have rejected a 4 % pay offer and it is reported the drivers will be attending a christmas party .
mml is reviewing the policy of not contracting drivers to work on sundays .
mml sales and marketing director jamie burles said : " from our point of view , the most disappointing thing is the disruption it 's going to cause the passengers . "
there will be quicker services or more frequent trains on some routes " anthony smith , director of the rail passengers council huge shake-up for rail commuters " we are just incredibly disappointed it 's going ahead .
" we have offered them 4 % on the back of several inflation-busting pay rises over the years so for them to say it 's derisory just beggars belief .
" they are effectively holding our customers to ransom . "
passengers with booked tickets for sunday can request a full refund , or travel on monday .
meanwhile , train companies are promising an increase of 320 passenger trains a day as part of new timetables unveiled on sunday .
it is hoped the changes will bring more frequent services to most lines at times of highest demand .
