in 20 years , the vessel could shuttle satellites and humans to space . space researchers in bremen came a step closer this weekend to the creation of europe 's first reusable , unmanned space shuttle .
the so-called phoenix craft , a prototype of the future hopper space glider , landed safely at a testing ground after reaching speeds of 450 kilometers per hour in northern sweden on saturday .
bremen-based eads space transportation is developing the shuttle in the hopes that it will carry cargo and astronauts into space within the next 20 years .
the european space agency , which initiated the project , said the 90-second flight represents a further step towards europe 's possible manned space flights in the future .
the german-designed prototype was carried to a height of 2,400 meters by a helicopter .
it then glided back to earth without the use of a motor and without controls from the ground .
an onboard computer equipped with gps guided the phoenix to a perfect landing .
measuring just under 6 meters in length , phoenix is one-sixth the size of the planned hopper .
" everyone here is ecstatic , " johanna bergstroem-roos of the north european aerospace test range in kiruna , sweden , told the associated press .
" this gives us wind in our sails . "
a craft with artificial intelligence ?
but what really set the phoenix mission apart from others was the fact that it steered itself .
an onboard computer controlled the navigation of the craft by processing data from radar , laser-distance measurements and satellite navigation , which it then used to determine small changes of direction and altitude until it made its landing .
officials at eads space transportation also expressed elation .
" for the first time , we have proven that the automated landing of this type of aircraft is technically controllable , " said peter kyr , project manager for the phoenix program .
" this successful test flight is the decisive german contribution on the way to a future reusable space transporter , " said the firm 's president , josef kind .
the launcher of the future the european space agency and eads hope to complete development of hopper between 2015 and 2020 , when it would go into service as a replacement for the ariane 5 rocket , the workhorse launcher currently used by the european space program to send satellites and other payloads into orbit .
the hopper shuttle would fly payloads into space and then return to earth without any help from mission control .
the shuttle is being developed and constructed at eads ' bremen facilities .
so far , € 8.2 million has been invested in the project , with the city-state of bremen contributing € 4.3 million and an additional € 3.5 million coming from the german aerospace center .
three further tests are planned in the coming days. using data from the flights , researchers will optimize phoenix and prepare it for further tests at higher elevations .
drops are planned from as high as 25 kilometers using balloons or supersonic aircraft .
in the mid-term , eads also plans to outfit phoenix with its own engine .
before it is ready for prime time , the shuttle will have to be able to glide from an altitude of 130 kilometers . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links europe in space a dw-world special report on the european space program - from mars express to the aurora vision of manned space flights .

in italy , the first-ever study on women in italian organized crime reveals that women are rising up the ranks to leadership positions .
this is both because the mafia is changing , and women are changing the mafia . from la dolce vita , the sweet life , to the malavita , the underworld , the growing presence of women is being felt everywhere in italy .
until recently , this was almost unthinkable .
the first woman arrested for " criminal association " was just five years ago , in 1999 .
police have known that women play a supporting role within the mafia : as mothers , wives , and daughters , they 've carried out minor tasks .
filling in for locked up hubbies occasionally , women have even stepped in to run things temporarily when their men have been jailed or murdered .
but a new study shows that women within the mafia are rising through the ranks and becoming bosses in their own right .
and it says that the italian judicial system should start paying closer attention .
ernesto savona of the catholic university of milan , one of the report ’ s authors , says criminal organizations are becoming more appealing to women .
" criminal organizations are changing .
they ’ re producing less violence .
less people are killed in palermo and columbia and in others in proportion to how many were killed before .
they ’ re transforming the hierarchical organization into a more flexible one .
that means you ’ ll get more women having managerial roles .
we call them ' sweet criminal organizations ' , " he told deutsche welle .
from hard crime to financial crime as underworld activities have shifted to financial crimes , violence has dropped .
organizations have also become less centralized .
" that you find women having managerial roles in small criminal organization shows that it 's very flexible and not hierarchical , " savona explains .
" especially juvenile gangs .
sometimes you find a woman who has the leadership in the organization . "
the evolution of women in the criminal world is exactly the same as that of women in the business world .
pierluigi vigna , who heads up italy ’ s national anti-mafia office , says that with politically motivated crimes , women are just as willing to kill as men .
mafia women , however , aren ’ t as willing when it comes to business .
the researchers say that ’ s because women find murder for profit harder to justify .
and their roles reflect this difference in values .
" they ’ re mainly found in areas that require a certain finesse , " vigna explains , " like money laundering rather than murder . "
while there are no statistics on the exact number of women in the italian mafia , the researchers say that more women in key positions are being arrested .

with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week . they have names like " slammer , " " blaster , " or even " sasser . "
very often they 're programmed by college or high school students .
and even though experts see the signature of amateurs in their work , they still manage to cause billions of dollars in damage in industrial nations .
last week it was the " sasser " worm that wriggled its way around the world , bringing computer networks to a crawl or complete halt .
the consequences : hours-long delays at british airways .
finland 's sampo bank took the precautionary measure of closing its 130 branches because the anti-virus software on its computers had n't been updated yet .
at the european commission in brussels , 1,200 computers were affected by sasser , leading a spokesman to describe it as a " serious problem . "
worse yet , the british coast guard was forced to abandon its electronic navigation system and instead pull out paper maps .
german police on saturday morning arrested the suspected " cyber terrorist " believed to have foisted sasser on the world .
the 18-year-old high school student , who hails from a small town near bremen , confessed to the crime after his arrest , officials said .
officials from the state office of criminal investigation in the state of lower saxony first searched the home of the boy 's parents before making the arrest .
he was later released on bail .
luck in misfortune fortunately , sasser was one of the less harmful varieties of its species .
the worm , which infected millions of computers , did n't cause any direct damage other than the fact that it made computers crash and stalled networks .
" the damage is difficult to estimate because nothing has actually been destroyed in the sense of the word , " said michael dickopf of the federal office for information technology security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
" only companies ' productivity was affected , their networks were slowed down . "
despite all the media attention it got , " sasser " caused far less damage than its predecessors .
" the situation was nowhere near as dramatic as last august , when ' blaster ' was going around , " said rainer link of the virus protection software maker trend micro .
and even blaster , a so-called super worm , was more like a baby worm compared to the " love bug . "
the consulting firm computer economics estimates that that virus caused as much as € 9 billion in damage .
but sasser is especially sneaky : it does n't spread itself as an e-mail attachment .
sasser instead takes advantage of a weakness in the windows operating system to automatically install itself on unsuspecting computers .
" in the worst-case scenarios , people go online and are infected within 30 seconds , " link said .
private users are especially vulnerable to the virus .
the only possibility for repairing the security hole that enables sasser to attack is to download a software patch from the microsoft web site .
but , complains michael dickopf of bsi , " most private users are lacking the security needs .
they do n't download those kinds of updates . "
most firms , on the other hand , reacted quickly to the warning and downloaded the patch .
in the end , the biggest problems were encountered at firms where the microsoft patch was incompatible with the company network .
competition of the worst kind lately , there 's been an alarming trend in the increasing speed with which viruses reach their victims .
" the number of attacks has increased unbelievably , " said trend micro 's link .
" it 's an entirely new dimension . "
worms like sasser , which do n't require the help of e-mail to spread across the internet have reached distribution rates that would have been unimaginable earlier .
the time span between viruses is also shrinking .
" it always was a kind of competition , " he said .
" the virus programmers see the new anti-virus programs and then they try to get around them .
that creates a whole new challenge for us . "
in the case of sasser , it only took two weeks .

with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week . they have names like " slammer , " " blaster , " or even " sasser . "
very often they 're programmed by college or high school students .
and even though experts see the signature of amateurs in their work , they still manage to cause billions of dollars in damage in industrial nations .
last week it was the " sasser " worm that wriggled its way around the world , bringing computer networks to a crawl or complete halt .
the consequences : hours-long delays at british airways .
finland 's sampo bank took the precautionary measure of closing its 130 branches because the anti-virus software on its computers had n't been updated yet .
at the european commission in brussels , 1,200 computers were affected by sasser , leading a spokesman to describe it as a " serious problem . "
worse yet , the british coast guard was forced to abandon its electronic navigation system and instead pull out paper maps .
german police on saturday morning arrested the suspected " cyber terrorist " believed to have foisted sasser on the world .
the 18-year-old high school student , who hails from a small town near bremen , confessed to the crime after his arrest , officials said .
officials from the state office of criminal investigation in the state of lower saxony first searched the home of the boy 's parents before making the arrest .
he was later released on bail .
luck in misfortune fortunately , sasser was one of the less harmful varieties of its species .
the worm , which infected millions of computers , did n't cause any direct damage other than the fact that it made computers crash and stalled networks .
" the damage is difficult to estimate because nothing has actually been destroyed in the sense of the word , " said michael dickopf of the federal office for information technology security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
" only companies ' productivity was affected , their networks were slowed down . "
despite all the media attention it got , " sasser " caused far less damage than its predecessors .
" the situation was nowhere near as dramatic as last august , when ' blaster ' was going around , " said rainer link of the virus protection software maker trend micro .
and even blaster , a so-called super worm , was more like a baby worm compared to the " love bug . "
the consulting firm computer economics estimates that that virus caused as much as € 9 billion in damage .
but sasser is especially sneaky : it does n't spread itself as an e-mail attachment .
sasser instead takes advantage of a weakness in the windows operating system to automatically install itself on unsuspecting computers .
" in the worst-case scenarios , people go online and are infected within 30 seconds , " link said .
private users are especially vulnerable to the virus .
the only possibility for repairing the security hole that enables sasser to attack is to download a software patch from the microsoft web site .
but , complains michael dickopf of bsi , " most private users are lacking the security needs .
they do n't download those kinds of updates . "
most firms , on the other hand , reacted quickly to the warning and downloaded the patch .

it is bremen 's fourth championship win in all following their triumphs in 1965 , 1988 and 1993 and will taste all the sweeter as it was clinched on bayern 's own patch .
" i think it is sensational what this team has achieved , " said a jubilant bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" the fact that uli hoeness -lrb- bayern general manager -rrb- congratulated us shows there is a mutual respect . "
bremen now have the chance of a league and cup double if they can defeat second division outfit alemannia aachen in the german cup final on may 26 in berlin .
a first-half goal blitz did the damage for bremen with croat ivan klasnic , frenchman johan micoud and brazilian ailton scoring inside 35 minutes .
when the title contenders were being discussed in pre-season , bayern , borussia dortmund and vfb stuttgart came to the fore , but not many pundits would have wagered on a team eliminated in the intertoto cup by austrian minnows sv pasching .
however , bremen have gone 23 games unbeaten to defy the odds and topple bayern - who they finished 23 points behind last season - with some adventurous football this term .
" sometimes you have lows in football , " said bayern chief ottmar hitzfeld . " it can not just be running around celebrating all the time .
" i have congratulated thomas schaaf as bremen played the best football this season . "
schaaf claimed bremen would attack from the first whistle in bavaria and he was good to his word as the visitors swamped bayern in the opening exchanges .
bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn insisted bremen were feeling the pressure before the match but those words came back to haunt him on 19 minutes with a calamitous error .
brazilian ailton fed strike partner ivan klasnic but kahn seemed to have the situation in hand reaching the ball first before inexplicably fumbling , allowing croat klasnic to slot home into an empty net .
" it is ironic that kahn - one of our best players this season - made the mistake , " pointed out hitzfeld .
it has been a difficult time for the 34-year-old international keeper , who conceded five goals in germany 's 5-1 thrashing by romania in bucharest , and things did not improve .

it is bremen 's fourth championship win in all following their triumphs in 1965 , 1988 and 1993 and will taste all the sweeter as it was clinched on bayern 's own patch .
" i think it is sensational what this team has achieved , " said a jubilant bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" the fact that uli hoeness -lrb- bayern general manager -rrb- congratulated us shows there is a mutual respect . "
bremen now have the chance of a league and cup double if they can defeat second division outfit alemannia aachen in the german cup final on may 26 in berlin .
a first-half goal blitz did the damage for bremen with croat ivan klasnic , frenchman johan micoud and brazilian ailton scoring inside 35 minutes .
when the title contenders were being discussed in pre-season , bayern , borussia dortmund and vfb stuttgart came to the fore , but not many pundits would have wagered on a team eliminated in the intertoto cup by austrian minnows sv pasching .
however , bremen have gone 23 games unbeaten to defy the odds and topple bayern - who they finished 23 points behind last season - with some adventurous football this term .
" sometimes you have lows in football , " said bayern chief ottmar hitzfeld . " it can not just be running around celebrating all the time .
" i have congratulated thomas schaaf as bremen played the best football this season . "
schaaf claimed bremen would attack from the first whistle in bavaria and he was good to his word as the visitors swamped bayern in the opening exchanges .
bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn insisted bremen were feeling the pressure before the match but those words came back to haunt him on 19 minutes with a calamitous error .
brazilian ailton fed strike partner ivan klasnic but kahn seemed to have the situation in hand reaching the ball first before inexplicably fumbling , allowing croat klasnic to slot home into an empty net .
" it is ironic that kahn - one of our best players this season - made the mistake , " pointed out hitzfeld .
it has been a difficult time for the 34-year-old international keeper , who conceded five goals in germany 's 5-1 thrashing by romania in bucharest , and things did not improve .
french international johan micoud lobbed him magnificently seven minutes later to make it 2-0 .

in italy , the first-ever study on women in italian organized crime reveals that women are rising up the ranks to leadership positions .
this is both because the mafia is changing , and women are changing the mafia . from la dolce vita , the sweet life , to the malavita , the underworld , the growing presence of women is being felt everywhere in italy .
until recently , this was almost unthinkable .
the first woman arrested for " criminal association " was just five years ago , in 1999 .
police have known that women play a supporting role within the mafia : as mothers , wives , and daughters , they 've carried out minor tasks .
filling in for locked up hubbies occasionally , women have even stepped in to run things temporarily when their men have been jailed or murdered .
but a new study shows that women within the mafia are rising through the ranks and becoming bosses in their own right .
and it says that the italian judicial system should start paying closer attention .
ernesto savona of the catholic university of milan , one of the report ’ s authors , says criminal organizations are becoming more appealing to women .
" criminal organizations are changing .
they ’ re producing less violence .
less people are killed in palermo and columbia and in others in proportion to how many were killed before .
they ’ re transforming the hierarchical organization into a more flexible one .
that means you ’ ll get more women having managerial roles .
we call them ' sweet criminal organizations ' , " he told deutsche welle .
from hard crime to financial crime as underworld activities have shifted to financial crimes , violence has dropped .
organizations have also become less centralized .
" that you find women having managerial roles in small criminal organization shows that it 's very flexible and not hierarchical , " savona explains .
" especially juvenile gangs .
sometimes you find a woman who has the leadership in the organization . "
the evolution of women in the criminal world is exactly the same as that of women in the business world .
pierluigi vigna , who heads up italy ’ s national anti-mafia office , says that with politically motivated crimes , women are just as willing to kill as men .
mafia women , however , aren ’ t as willing when it comes to business .
the researchers say that ’ s because women find murder for profit harder to justify .
and their roles reflect this difference in values .
" they ’ re mainly found in areas that require a certain finesse , " vigna explains , " like money laundering rather than murder . "
while there are no statistics on the exact number of women in the italian mafia , the researchers say that more women in key positions are being arrested .
in april , a 28-year-old sicilian woman was found guilty of 50 percent ownership of a thriving underworld business .
this may not be this kind of emancipation feminists had in mind , but it does show that women in italy need to be taken seriously in all facets of life . megan williams -lrb- dw-radio -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.05.2004 werder bremen clinch german championship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's players celebrate their upset defeat over fc bayern munchen the northern german city 's football team take the title after a sensational 3-1 win over bayer munich on saturday . werder bremen lifted their first german championship in 11 years with a sensational 3-1 win over reigning champions bayern munich at the olympic stadium on saturday . bremen move nine points ahead of holders bayern , who suffered their first home defeat of the season , with two games left to play .
it is bremen 's fourth championship win in all following their triumphs in 1965 , 1988 and 1993 and will taste all the sweeter as it was clinched on bayern 's own patch .
" i think it is sensational what this team has achieved , " said a jubilant bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" the fact that uli hoeness -lrb- bayern general manager -rrb- congratulated us shows there is a mutual respect . "
bremen now have the chance of a league and cup double if they can defeat second division outfit alemannia aachen in the german cup final on may 26 in berlin .
a first-half goal blitz did the damage for bremen with croat ivan klasnic , frenchman johan micoud and brazilian ailton scoring inside 35 minutes .
when the title contenders were being discussed in pre-season , bayern , borussia dortmund and vfb stuttgart came to the fore , but not many pundits would have wagered on a team eliminated in the intertoto cup by austrian minnows sv pasching .
however , bremen have gone 23 games unbeaten to defy the odds and topple bayern - who they finished 23 points behind last season - with some adventurous football this term .
" sometimes you have lows in football , " said bayern chief ottmar hitzfeld . " it can not just be running around celebrating all the time .
" i have congratulated thomas schaaf as bremen played the best football this season . "
schaaf claimed bremen would attack from the first whistle in bavaria and he was good to his word as the visitors swamped bayern in the opening exchanges .
bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn insisted bremen were feeling the pressure before the match but those words came back to haunt him on 19 minutes with a calamitous error .
brazilian ailton fed strike partner ivan klasnic but kahn seemed to have the situation in hand reaching the ball first before inexplicably fumbling , allowing croat klasnic to slot home into an empty net .
" it is ironic that kahn - one of our best players this season - made the mistake , " pointed out hitzfeld .
it has been a difficult time for the 34-year-old international keeper , who conceded five goals in germany 's 5-1 thrashing by romania in bucharest , and things did not improve .
french international johan micoud lobbed him magnificently seven minutes later to make it 2-0 .
" we dedicate this title to our fantastic fans , " added micoud .
then in the 35th minute ailton notched his 27th goal of a productive campaign , curling a 25-yard shot into the top corner past the despairing kahn .
the travelling contingent of bremen supporters were in a state of delirium .
dutch international roy makaay reduced the arrears on 56 minutes after bremen switched off but it was just a momentary lapse as bremen held their nerve and dethroned bayern as german champions .
the only consolation for bayern , who have ended the season empty-handed , was that third-placed stuttgart did not take advantage of their slip-up tasting a 2-1 defeat at sv hamburg .
felix magath 's side will be kicking themselves as they could have moved to within one point of munich with victory .
borussia dortmund 's chances of playing european football in 2004/05 suffered a blow following a surprise 6-2 thumping by struggling hertha berlin in the capital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.05.2004 mob ladies : women 's roles in the italian mafia are growing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " love , love and love " are no longer enough for italian women .
in italy , the first-ever study on women in italian organized crime reveals that women are rising up the ranks to leadership positions .
this is both because the mafia is changing , and women are changing the mafia . from la dolce vita , the sweet life , to the malavita , the underworld , the growing presence of women is being felt everywhere in italy .
until recently , this was almost unthinkable .
the first woman arrested for " criminal association " was just five years ago , in 1999 .
police have known that women play a supporting role within the mafia : as mothers , wives , and daughters , they 've carried out minor tasks .
filling in for locked up hubbies occasionally , women have even stepped in to run things temporarily when their men have been jailed or murdered .
but a new study shows that women within the mafia are rising through the ranks and becoming bosses in their own right .
and it says that the italian judicial system should start paying closer attention .
ernesto savona of the catholic university of milan , one of the report ’ s authors , says criminal organizations are becoming more appealing to women .
" criminal organizations are changing .
they ’ re producing less violence .
less people are killed in palermo and columbia and in others in proportion to how many were killed before .
they ’ re transforming the hierarchical organization into a more flexible one .
that means you ’ ll get more women having managerial roles .
we call them ' sweet criminal organizations ' , " he told deutsche welle .
from hard crime to financial crime as underworld activities have shifted to financial crimes , violence has dropped .
organizations have also become less centralized .
" that you find women having managerial roles in small criminal organization shows that it 's very flexible and not hierarchical , " savona explains .
" especially juvenile gangs .
sometimes you find a woman who has the leadership in the organization . "
the evolution of women in the criminal world is exactly the same as that of women in the business world .
pierluigi vigna , who heads up italy ’ s national anti-mafia office , says that with politically motivated crimes , women are just as willing to kill as men .
mafia women , however , aren ’ t as willing when it comes to business .
the researchers say that ’ s because women find murder for profit harder to justify .
and their roles reflect this difference in values .
" they ’ re mainly found in areas that require a certain finesse , " vigna explains , " like money laundering rather than murder . "
while there are no statistics on the exact number of women in the italian mafia , the researchers say that more women in key positions are being arrested .
in april , a 28-year-old sicilian woman was found guilty of 50 percent ownership of a thriving underworld business .
this may not be this kind of emancipation feminists had in mind , but it does show that women in italy need to be taken seriously in all facets of life . megan williams -lrb- dw-radio -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

in 20 years , the vessel could shuttle satellites and humans to space . space researchers in bremen came a step closer this weekend to the creation of europe 's first reusable , unmanned space shuttle .
the so-called phoenix craft , a prototype of the future hopper space glider , landed safely at a testing ground after reaching speeds of 450 kilometers per hour in northern sweden on saturday .
bremen-based eads space transportation is developing the shuttle in the hopes that it will carry cargo and astronauts into space within the next 20 years .
the european space agency , which initiated the project , said the 90-second flight represents a further step towards europe 's possible manned space flights in the future .
the german-designed prototype was carried to a height of 2,400 meters by a helicopter .
it then glided back to earth without the use of a motor and without controls from the ground .
an onboard computer equipped with gps guided the phoenix to a perfect landing .
measuring just under 6 meters in length , phoenix is one-sixth the size of the planned hopper .
" everyone here is ecstatic , " johanna bergstroem-roos of the north european aerospace test range in kiruna , sweden , told the associated press .
" this gives us wind in our sails . "
a craft with artificial intelligence ?
but what really set the phoenix mission apart from others was the fact that it steered itself .
an onboard computer controlled the navigation of the craft by processing data from radar , laser-distance measurements and satellite navigation , which it then used to determine small changes of direction and altitude until it made its landing .
officials at eads space transportation also expressed elation .
" for the first time , we have proven that the automated landing of this type of aircraft is technically controllable , " said peter kyr , project manager for the phoenix program .
" this successful test flight is the decisive german contribution on the way to a future reusable space transporter , " said the firm 's president , josef kind .
the launcher of the future the european space agency and eads hope to complete development of hopper between 2015 and 2020 , when it would go into service as a replacement for the ariane 5 rocket , the workhorse launcher currently used by the european space program to send satellites and other payloads into orbit .
the hopper shuttle would fly payloads into space and then return to earth without any help from mission control .
the shuttle is being developed and constructed at eads ' bremen facilities .
so far , € 8.2 million has been invested in the project , with the city-state of bremen contributing € 4.3 million and an additional € 3.5 million coming from the german aerospace center .
three further tests are planned in the coming days. using data from the flights , researchers will optimize phoenix and prepare it for further tests at higher elevations .
drops are planned from as high as 25 kilometers using balloons or supersonic aircraft .
in the mid-term , eads also plans to outfit phoenix with its own engine .
before it is ready for prime time , the shuttle will have to be able to glide from an altitude of 130 kilometers . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links europe in space a dw-world special report on the european space program - from mars express to the aurora vision of manned space flights .

it is bremen 's fourth championship win in all following their triumphs in 1965 , 1988 and 1993 and will taste all the sweeter as it was clinched on bayern 's own patch .
" i think it is sensational what this team has achieved , " said a jubilant bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" the fact that uli hoeness -lrb- bayern general manager -rrb- congratulated us shows there is a mutual respect . "
bremen now have the chance of a league and cup double if they can defeat second division outfit alemannia aachen in the german cup final on may 26 in berlin .
a first-half goal blitz did the damage for bremen with croat ivan klasnic , frenchman johan micoud and brazilian ailton scoring inside 35 minutes .
when the title contenders were being discussed in pre-season , bayern , borussia dortmund and vfb stuttgart came to the fore , but not many pundits would have wagered on a team eliminated in the intertoto cup by austrian minnows sv pasching .
however , bremen have gone 23 games unbeaten to defy the odds and topple bayern - who they finished 23 points behind last season - with some adventurous football this term .
" sometimes you have lows in football , " said bayern chief ottmar hitzfeld . " it can not just be running around celebrating all the time .
" i have congratulated thomas schaaf as bremen played the best football this season . "
schaaf claimed bremen would attack from the first whistle in bavaria and he was good to his word as the visitors swamped bayern in the opening exchanges .
bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn insisted bremen were feeling the pressure before the match but those words came back to haunt him on 19 minutes with a calamitous error .
brazilian ailton fed strike partner ivan klasnic but kahn seemed to have the situation in hand reaching the ball first before inexplicably fumbling , allowing croat klasnic to slot home into an empty net .
" it is ironic that kahn - one of our best players this season - made the mistake , " pointed out hitzfeld .
it has been a difficult time for the 34-year-old international keeper , who conceded five goals in germany 's 5-1 thrashing by romania in bucharest , and things did not improve .
french international johan micoud lobbed him magnificently seven minutes later to make it 2-0 .
" we dedicate this title to our fantastic fans , " added micoud .
then in the 35th minute ailton notched his 27th goal of a productive campaign , curling a 25-yard shot into the top corner past the despairing kahn .
the travelling contingent of bremen supporters were in a state of delirium .
dutch international roy makaay reduced the arrears on 56 minutes after bremen switched off but it was just a momentary lapse as bremen held their nerve and dethroned bayern as german champions .
the only consolation for bayern , who have ended the season empty-handed , was that third-placed stuttgart did not take advantage of their slip-up tasting a 2-1 defeat at sv hamburg .
felix magath 's side will be kicking themselves as they could have moved to within one point of munich with victory .

in italy , the first-ever study on women in italian organized crime reveals that women are rising up the ranks to leadership positions .
this is both because the mafia is changing , and women are changing the mafia . from la dolce vita , the sweet life , to the malavita , the underworld , the growing presence of women is being felt everywhere in italy .
until recently , this was almost unthinkable .
the first woman arrested for " criminal association " was just five years ago , in 1999 .
police have known that women play a supporting role within the mafia : as mothers , wives , and daughters , they 've carried out minor tasks .
filling in for locked up hubbies occasionally , women have even stepped in to run things temporarily when their men have been jailed or murdered .
but a new study shows that women within the mafia are rising through the ranks and becoming bosses in their own right .
and it says that the italian judicial system should start paying closer attention .
ernesto savona of the catholic university of milan , one of the report ’ s authors , says criminal organizations are becoming more appealing to women .
" criminal organizations are changing .
they ’ re producing less violence .
less people are killed in palermo and columbia and in others in proportion to how many were killed before .
they ’ re transforming the hierarchical organization into a more flexible one .
that means you ’ ll get more women having managerial roles .
we call them ' sweet criminal organizations ' , " he told deutsche welle .
from hard crime to financial crime as underworld activities have shifted to financial crimes , violence has dropped .
organizations have also become less centralized .
" that you find women having managerial roles in small criminal organization shows that it 's very flexible and not hierarchical , " savona explains .
" especially juvenile gangs .
sometimes you find a woman who has the leadership in the organization . "
the evolution of women in the criminal world is exactly the same as that of women in the business world .
pierluigi vigna , who heads up italy ’ s national anti-mafia office , says that with politically motivated crimes , women are just as willing to kill as men .
mafia women , however , aren ’ t as willing when it comes to business .
the researchers say that ’ s because women find murder for profit harder to justify .
and their roles reflect this difference in values .
" they ’ re mainly found in areas that require a certain finesse , " vigna explains , " like money laundering rather than murder . "
while there are no statistics on the exact number of women in the italian mafia , the researchers say that more women in key positions are being arrested .
in april , a 28-year-old sicilian woman was found guilty of 50 percent ownership of a thriving underworld business .
this may not be this kind of emancipation feminists had in mind , but it does show that women in italy need to be taken seriously in all facets of life . megan williams -lrb- dw-radio -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

in 20 years , the vessel could shuttle satellites and humans to space . space researchers in bremen came a step closer this weekend to the creation of europe 's first reusable , unmanned space shuttle .
the so-called phoenix craft , a prototype of the future hopper space glider , landed safely at a testing ground after reaching speeds of 450 kilometers per hour in northern sweden on saturday .
bremen-based eads space transportation is developing the shuttle in the hopes that it will carry cargo and astronauts into space within the next 20 years .
the european space agency , which initiated the project , said the 90-second flight represents a further step towards europe 's possible manned space flights in the future .
the german-designed prototype was carried to a height of 2,400 meters by a helicopter .
it then glided back to earth without the use of a motor and without controls from the ground .
an onboard computer equipped with gps guided the phoenix to a perfect landing .
measuring just under 6 meters in length , phoenix is one-sixth the size of the planned hopper .
" everyone here is ecstatic , " johanna bergstroem-roos of the north european aerospace test range in kiruna , sweden , told the associated press .
" this gives us wind in our sails . "
a craft with artificial intelligence ?
but what really set the phoenix mission apart from others was the fact that it steered itself .
an onboard computer controlled the navigation of the craft by processing data from radar , laser-distance measurements and satellite navigation , which it then used to determine small changes of direction and altitude until it made its landing .
officials at eads space transportation also expressed elation .
" for the first time , we have proven that the automated landing of this type of aircraft is technically controllable , " said peter kyr , project manager for the phoenix program .
" this successful test flight is the decisive german contribution on the way to a future reusable space transporter , " said the firm 's president , josef kind .
the launcher of the future the european space agency and eads hope to complete development of hopper between 2015 and 2020 , when it would go into service as a replacement for the ariane 5 rocket , the workhorse launcher currently used by the european space program to send satellites and other payloads into orbit .
the hopper shuttle would fly payloads into space and then return to earth without any help from mission control .
the shuttle is being developed and constructed at eads ' bremen facilities .
so far , € 8.2 million has been invested in the project , with the city-state of bremen contributing € 4.3 million and an additional € 3.5 million coming from the german aerospace center .
three further tests are planned in the coming days. using data from the flights , researchers will optimize phoenix and prepare it for further tests at higher elevations .
drops are planned from as high as 25 kilometers using balloons or supersonic aircraft .
in the mid-term , eads also plans to outfit phoenix with its own engine .
before it is ready for prime time , the shuttle will have to be able to glide from an altitude of 130 kilometers . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links europe in space a dw-world special report on the european space program - from mars express to the aurora vision of manned space flights .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.05.2004 werder bremen clinch german championship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's players celebrate their upset defeat over fc bayern munchen the northern german city 's football team take the title after a sensational 3-1 win over bayer munich on saturday . werder bremen lifted their first german championship in 11 years with a sensational 3-1 win over reigning champions bayern munich at the olympic stadium on saturday . bremen move nine points ahead of holders bayern , who suffered their first home defeat of the season , with two games left to play .
it is bremen 's fourth championship win in all following their triumphs in 1965 , 1988 and 1993 and will taste all the sweeter as it was clinched on bayern 's own patch .
" i think it is sensational what this team has achieved , " said a jubilant bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" the fact that uli hoeness -lrb- bayern general manager -rrb- congratulated us shows there is a mutual respect . "
bremen now have the chance of a league and cup double if they can defeat second division outfit alemannia aachen in the german cup final on may 26 in berlin .
a first-half goal blitz did the damage for bremen with croat ivan klasnic , frenchman johan micoud and brazilian ailton scoring inside 35 minutes .
when the title contenders were being discussed in pre-season , bayern , borussia dortmund and vfb stuttgart came to the fore , but not many pundits would have wagered on a team eliminated in the intertoto cup by austrian minnows sv pasching .
however , bremen have gone 23 games unbeaten to defy the odds and topple bayern - who they finished 23 points behind last season - with some adventurous football this term .
" sometimes you have lows in football , " said bayern chief ottmar hitzfeld . " it can not just be running around celebrating all the time .
" i have congratulated thomas schaaf as bremen played the best football this season . "
schaaf claimed bremen would attack from the first whistle in bavaria and he was good to his word as the visitors swamped bayern in the opening exchanges .
bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn insisted bremen were feeling the pressure before the match but those words came back to haunt him on 19 minutes with a calamitous error .
brazilian ailton fed strike partner ivan klasnic but kahn seemed to have the situation in hand reaching the ball first before inexplicably fumbling , allowing croat klasnic to slot home into an empty net .
" it is ironic that kahn - one of our best players this season - made the mistake , " pointed out hitzfeld .
it has been a difficult time for the 34-year-old international keeper , who conceded five goals in germany 's 5-1 thrashing by romania in bucharest , and things did not improve .
french international johan micoud lobbed him magnificently seven minutes later to make it 2-0 .
" we dedicate this title to our fantastic fans , " added micoud .
then in the 35th minute ailton notched his 27th goal of a productive campaign , curling a 25-yard shot into the top corner past the despairing kahn .
the travelling contingent of bremen supporters were in a state of delirium .
dutch international roy makaay reduced the arrears on 56 minutes after bremen switched off but it was just a momentary lapse as bremen held their nerve and dethroned bayern as german champions .
the only consolation for bayern , who have ended the season empty-handed , was that third-placed stuttgart did not take advantage of their slip-up tasting a 2-1 defeat at sv hamburg .
felix magath 's side will be kicking themselves as they could have moved to within one point of munich with victory .
borussia dortmund 's chances of playing european football in 2004/05 suffered a blow following a surprise 6-2 thumping by struggling hertha berlin in the capital .

in 20 years , the vessel could shuttle satellites and humans to space . space researchers in bremen came a step closer this weekend to the creation of europe 's first reusable , unmanned space shuttle .
the so-called phoenix craft , a prototype of the future hopper space glider , landed safely at a testing ground after reaching speeds of 450 kilometers per hour in northern sweden on saturday .
bremen-based eads space transportation is developing the shuttle in the hopes that it will carry cargo and astronauts into space within the next 20 years .
the european space agency , which initiated the project , said the 90-second flight represents a further step towards europe 's possible manned space flights in the future .
the german-designed prototype was carried to a height of 2,400 meters by a helicopter .
it then glided back to earth without the use of a motor and without controls from the ground .
an onboard computer equipped with gps guided the phoenix to a perfect landing .
measuring just under 6 meters in length , phoenix is one-sixth the size of the planned hopper .
" everyone here is ecstatic , " johanna bergstroem-roos of the north european aerospace test range in kiruna , sweden , told the associated press .
" this gives us wind in our sails . "
a craft with artificial intelligence ?
but what really set the phoenix mission apart from others was the fact that it steered itself .
an onboard computer controlled the navigation of the craft by processing data from radar , laser-distance measurements and satellite navigation , which it then used to determine small changes of direction and altitude until it made its landing .
officials at eads space transportation also expressed elation .
" for the first time , we have proven that the automated landing of this type of aircraft is technically controllable , " said peter kyr , project manager for the phoenix program .

in italy , the first-ever study on women in italian organized crime reveals that women are rising up the ranks to leadership positions .
this is both because the mafia is changing , and women are changing the mafia . from la dolce vita , the sweet life , to the malavita , the underworld , the growing presence of women is being felt everywhere in italy .
until recently , this was almost unthinkable .
the first woman arrested for " criminal association " was just five years ago , in 1999 .

with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week . they have names like " slammer , " " blaster , " or even " sasser . "
very often they 're programmed by college or high school students .
and even though experts see the signature of amateurs in their work , they still manage to cause billions of dollars in damage in industrial nations .
last week it was the " sasser " worm that wriggled its way around the world , bringing computer networks to a crawl or complete halt .
the consequences : hours-long delays at british airways .
finland 's sampo bank took the precautionary measure of closing its 130 branches because the anti-virus software on its computers had n't been updated yet .
at the european commission in brussels , 1,200 computers were affected by sasser , leading a spokesman to describe it as a " serious problem . "
worse yet , the british coast guard was forced to abandon its electronic navigation system and instead pull out paper maps .
german police on saturday morning arrested the suspected " cyber terrorist " believed to have foisted sasser on the world .
the 18-year-old high school student , who hails from a small town near bremen , confessed to the crime after his arrest , officials said .
officials from the state office of criminal investigation in the state of lower saxony first searched the home of the boy 's parents before making the arrest .
he was later released on bail .
luck in misfortune fortunately , sasser was one of the less harmful varieties of its species .
the worm , which infected millions of computers , did n't cause any direct damage other than the fact that it made computers crash and stalled networks .
" the damage is difficult to estimate because nothing has actually been destroyed in the sense of the word , " said michael dickopf of the federal office for information technology security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
" only companies ' productivity was affected , their networks were slowed down . "
despite all the media attention it got , " sasser " caused far less damage than its predecessors .
" the situation was nowhere near as dramatic as last august , when ' blaster ' was going around , " said rainer link of the virus protection software maker trend micro .
and even blaster , a so-called super worm , was more like a baby worm compared to the " love bug . "
the consulting firm computer economics estimates that that virus caused as much as € 9 billion in damage .
but sasser is especially sneaky : it does n't spread itself as an e-mail attachment .
sasser instead takes advantage of a weakness in the windows operating system to automatically install itself on unsuspecting computers .
" in the worst-case scenarios , people go online and are infected within 30 seconds , " link said .
private users are especially vulnerable to the virus .
the only possibility for repairing the security hole that enables sasser to attack is to download a software patch from the microsoft web site .
but , complains michael dickopf of bsi , " most private users are lacking the security needs .
they do n't download those kinds of updates . "
most firms , on the other hand , reacted quickly to the warning and downloaded the patch .
in the end , the biggest problems were encountered at firms where the microsoft patch was incompatible with the company network .
competition of the worst kind lately , there 's been an alarming trend in the increasing speed with which viruses reach their victims .
" the number of attacks has increased unbelievably , " said trend micro 's link .
" it 's an entirely new dimension . "
worms like sasser , which do n't require the help of e-mail to spread across the internet have reached distribution rates that would have been unimaginable earlier .
the time span between viruses is also shrinking .
" it always was a kind of competition , " he said .
" the virus programmers see the new anti-virus programs and then they try to get around them .
that creates a whole new challenge for us . "
in the case of sasser , it only took two weeks .

with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week . they have names like " slammer , " " blaster , " or even " sasser . "
very often they 're programmed by college or high school students .
and even though experts see the signature of amateurs in their work , they still manage to cause billions of dollars in damage in industrial nations .
last week it was the " sasser " worm that wriggled its way around the world , bringing computer networks to a crawl or complete halt .
the consequences : hours-long delays at british airways .
finland 's sampo bank took the precautionary measure of closing its 130 branches because the anti-virus software on its computers had n't been updated yet .
at the european commission in brussels , 1,200 computers were affected by sasser , leading a spokesman to describe it as a " serious problem . "
worse yet , the british coast guard was forced to abandon its electronic navigation system and instead pull out paper maps .
german police on saturday morning arrested the suspected " cyber terrorist " believed to have foisted sasser on the world .
the 18-year-old high school student , who hails from a small town near bremen , confessed to the crime after his arrest , officials said .
officials from the state office of criminal investigation in the state of lower saxony first searched the home of the boy 's parents before making the arrest .
he was later released on bail .
luck in misfortune fortunately , sasser was one of the less harmful varieties of its species .
the worm , which infected millions of computers , did n't cause any direct damage other than the fact that it made computers crash and stalled networks .
" the damage is difficult to estimate because nothing has actually been destroyed in the sense of the word , " said michael dickopf of the federal office for information technology security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
" only companies ' productivity was affected , their networks were slowed down . "
despite all the media attention it got , " sasser " caused far less damage than its predecessors .
" the situation was nowhere near as dramatic as last august , when ' blaster ' was going around , " said rainer link of the virus protection software maker trend micro .
and even blaster , a so-called super worm , was more like a baby worm compared to the " love bug . "
the consulting firm computer economics estimates that that virus caused as much as € 9 billion in damage .
but sasser is especially sneaky : it does n't spread itself as an e-mail attachment .
sasser instead takes advantage of a weakness in the windows operating system to automatically install itself on unsuspecting computers .
" in the worst-case scenarios , people go online and are infected within 30 seconds , " link said .
private users are especially vulnerable to the virus .
the only possibility for repairing the security hole that enables sasser to attack is to download a software patch from the microsoft web site .
but , complains michael dickopf of bsi , " most private users are lacking the security needs .
they do n't download those kinds of updates . "
most firms , on the other hand , reacted quickly to the warning and downloaded the patch .
in the end , the biggest problems were encountered at firms where the microsoft patch was incompatible with the company network .
competition of the worst kind lately , there 's been an alarming trend in the increasing speed with which viruses reach their victims .
" the number of attacks has increased unbelievably , " said trend micro 's link .
" it 's an entirely new dimension . "
worms like sasser , which do n't require the help of e-mail to spread across the internet have reached distribution rates that would have been unimaginable earlier .
the time span between viruses is also shrinking .
" it always was a kind of competition , " he said .
" the virus programmers see the new anti-virus programs and then they try to get around them .
that creates a whole new challenge for us . "
in the case of sasser , it only took two weeks .

it is bremen 's fourth championship win in all following their triumphs in 1965 , 1988 and 1993 and will taste all the sweeter as it was clinched on bayern 's own patch .
" i think it is sensational what this team has achieved , " said a jubilant bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" the fact that uli hoeness -lrb- bayern general manager -rrb- congratulated us shows there is a mutual respect . "
bremen now have the chance of a league and cup double if they can defeat second division outfit alemannia aachen in the german cup final on may 26 in berlin .
a first-half goal blitz did the damage for bremen with croat ivan klasnic , frenchman johan micoud and brazilian ailton scoring inside 35 minutes .
when the title contenders were being discussed in pre-season , bayern , borussia dortmund and vfb stuttgart came to the fore , but not many pundits would have wagered on a team eliminated in the intertoto cup by austrian minnows sv pasching .
however , bremen have gone 23 games unbeaten to defy the odds and topple bayern - who they finished 23 points behind last season - with some adventurous football this term .
" sometimes you have lows in football , " said bayern chief ottmar hitzfeld . " it can not just be running around celebrating all the time .
" i have congratulated thomas schaaf as bremen played the best football this season . "
schaaf claimed bremen would attack from the first whistle in bavaria and he was good to his word as the visitors swamped bayern in the opening exchanges .
bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn insisted bremen were feeling the pressure before the match but those words came back to haunt him on 19 minutes with a calamitous error .
brazilian ailton fed strike partner ivan klasnic but kahn seemed to have the situation in hand reaching the ball first before inexplicably fumbling , allowing croat klasnic to slot home into an empty net .
" it is ironic that kahn - one of our best players this season - made the mistake , " pointed out hitzfeld .
it has been a difficult time for the 34-year-old international keeper , who conceded five goals in germany 's 5-1 thrashing by romania in bucharest , and things did not improve .
french international johan micoud lobbed him magnificently seven minutes later to make it 2-0 .
" we dedicate this title to our fantastic fans , " added micoud .
then in the 35th minute ailton notched his 27th goal of a productive campaign , curling a 25-yard shot into the top corner past the despairing kahn .
the travelling contingent of bremen supporters were in a state of delirium .
dutch international roy makaay reduced the arrears on 56 minutes after bremen switched off but it was just a momentary lapse as bremen held their nerve and dethroned bayern as german champions .
the only consolation for bayern , who have ended the season empty-handed , was that third-placed stuttgart did not take advantage of their slip-up tasting a 2-1 defeat at sv hamburg .
felix magath 's side will be kicking themselves as they could have moved to within one point of munich with victory .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.05.2004 werder bremen clinch german championship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's players celebrate their upset defeat over fc bayern munchen the northern german city 's football team take the title after a sensational 3-1 win over bayer munich on saturday . werder bremen lifted their first german championship in 11 years with a sensational 3-1 win over reigning champions bayern munich at the olympic stadium on saturday . bremen move nine points ahead of holders bayern , who suffered their first home defeat of the season , with two games left to play .
it is bremen 's fourth championship win in all following their triumphs in 1965 , 1988 and 1993 and will taste all the sweeter as it was clinched on bayern 's own patch .
" i think it is sensational what this team has achieved , " said a jubilant bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" the fact that uli hoeness -lrb- bayern general manager -rrb- congratulated us shows there is a mutual respect . "
bremen now have the chance of a league and cup double if they can defeat second division outfit alemannia aachen in the german cup final on may 26 in berlin .
a first-half goal blitz did the damage for bremen with croat ivan klasnic , frenchman johan micoud and brazilian ailton scoring inside 35 minutes .
when the title contenders were being discussed in pre-season , bayern , borussia dortmund and vfb stuttgart came to the fore , but not many pundits would have wagered on a team eliminated in the intertoto cup by austrian minnows sv pasching .
however , bremen have gone 23 games unbeaten to defy the odds and topple bayern - who they finished 23 points behind last season - with some adventurous football this term .
" sometimes you have lows in football , " said bayern chief ottmar hitzfeld . " it can not just be running around celebrating all the time .
" i have congratulated thomas schaaf as bremen played the best football this season . "
schaaf claimed bremen would attack from the first whistle in bavaria and he was good to his word as the visitors swamped bayern in the opening exchanges .
bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn insisted bremen were feeling the pressure before the match but those words came back to haunt him on 19 minutes with a calamitous error .
brazilian ailton fed strike partner ivan klasnic but kahn seemed to have the situation in hand reaching the ball first before inexplicably fumbling , allowing croat klasnic to slot home into an empty net .
" it is ironic that kahn - one of our best players this season - made the mistake , " pointed out hitzfeld .
it has been a difficult time for the 34-year-old international keeper , who conceded five goals in germany 's 5-1 thrashing by romania in bucharest , and things did not improve .
french international johan micoud lobbed him magnificently seven minutes later to make it 2-0 .
" we dedicate this title to our fantastic fans , " added micoud .
then in the 35th minute ailton notched his 27th goal of a productive campaign , curling a 25-yard shot into the top corner past the despairing kahn .
the travelling contingent of bremen supporters were in a state of delirium .
dutch international roy makaay reduced the arrears on 56 minutes after bremen switched off but it was just a momentary lapse as bremen held their nerve and dethroned bayern as german champions .
the only consolation for bayern , who have ended the season empty-handed , was that third-placed stuttgart did not take advantage of their slip-up tasting a 2-1 defeat at sv hamburg .

with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week . they have names like " slammer , " " blaster , " or even " sasser . "
very often they 're programmed by college or high school students .
and even though experts see the signature of amateurs in their work , they still manage to cause billions of dollars in damage in industrial nations .
last week it was the " sasser " worm that wriggled its way around the world , bringing computer networks to a crawl or complete halt .
the consequences : hours-long delays at british airways .
finland 's sampo bank took the precautionary measure of closing its 130 branches because the anti-virus software on its computers had n't been updated yet .
at the european commission in brussels , 1,200 computers were affected by sasser , leading a spokesman to describe it as a " serious problem . "
worse yet , the british coast guard was forced to abandon its electronic navigation system and instead pull out paper maps .
german police on saturday morning arrested the suspected " cyber terrorist " believed to have foisted sasser on the world .
the 18-year-old high school student , who hails from a small town near bremen , confessed to the crime after his arrest , officials said .
officials from the state office of criminal investigation in the state of lower saxony first searched the home of the boy 's parents before making the arrest .
he was later released on bail .
luck in misfortune fortunately , sasser was one of the less harmful varieties of its species .
the worm , which infected millions of computers , did n't cause any direct damage other than the fact that it made computers crash and stalled networks .
" the damage is difficult to estimate because nothing has actually been destroyed in the sense of the word , " said michael dickopf of the federal office for information technology security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
" only companies ' productivity was affected , their networks were slowed down . "
despite all the media attention it got , " sasser " caused far less damage than its predecessors .
" the situation was nowhere near as dramatic as last august , when ' blaster ' was going around , " said rainer link of the virus protection software maker trend micro .
and even blaster , a so-called super worm , was more like a baby worm compared to the " love bug . "
the consulting firm computer economics estimates that that virus caused as much as € 9 billion in damage .
but sasser is especially sneaky : it does n't spread itself as an e-mail attachment .
sasser instead takes advantage of a weakness in the windows operating system to automatically install itself on unsuspecting computers .
" in the worst-case scenarios , people go online and are infected within 30 seconds , " link said .
private users are especially vulnerable to the virus .
the only possibility for repairing the security hole that enables sasser to attack is to download a software patch from the microsoft web site .
but , complains michael dickopf of bsi , " most private users are lacking the security needs .
they do n't download those kinds of updates . "
most firms , on the other hand , reacted quickly to the warning and downloaded the patch .
in the end , the biggest problems were encountered at firms where the microsoft patch was incompatible with the company network .
competition of the worst kind lately , there 's been an alarming trend in the increasing speed with which viruses reach their victims .
" the number of attacks has increased unbelievably , " said trend micro 's link .
" it 's an entirely new dimension . "
worms like sasser , which do n't require the help of e-mail to spread across the internet have reached distribution rates that would have been unimaginable earlier .
the time span between viruses is also shrinking .
" it always was a kind of competition , " he said .
" the virus programmers see the new anti-virus programs and then they try to get around them .
that creates a whole new challenge for us . "
in the case of sasser , it only took two weeks .
on april 14 , microsoft issued a warning and by may 1 , the worm was already attacking . arend wulff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blackout - could it happen in germany ?

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.05.2004 werder bremen clinch german championship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's players celebrate their upset defeat over fc bayern munchen the northern german city 's football team take the title after a sensational 3-1 win over bayer munich on saturday . werder bremen lifted their first german championship in 11 years with a sensational 3-1 win over reigning champions bayern munich at the olympic stadium on saturday . bremen move nine points ahead of holders bayern , who suffered their first home defeat of the season , with two games left to play .
it is bremen 's fourth championship win in all following their triumphs in 1965 , 1988 and 1993 and will taste all the sweeter as it was clinched on bayern 's own patch .
" i think it is sensational what this team has achieved , " said a jubilant bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" the fact that uli hoeness -lrb- bayern general manager -rrb- congratulated us shows there is a mutual respect . "
bremen now have the chance of a league and cup double if they can defeat second division outfit alemannia aachen in the german cup final on may 26 in berlin .
a first-half goal blitz did the damage for bremen with croat ivan klasnic , frenchman johan micoud and brazilian ailton scoring inside 35 minutes .
when the title contenders were being discussed in pre-season , bayern , borussia dortmund and vfb stuttgart came to the fore , but not many pundits would have wagered on a team eliminated in the intertoto cup by austrian minnows sv pasching .
however , bremen have gone 23 games unbeaten to defy the odds and topple bayern - who they finished 23 points behind last season - with some adventurous football this term .
" sometimes you have lows in football , " said bayern chief ottmar hitzfeld . " it can not just be running around celebrating all the time .
" i have congratulated thomas schaaf as bremen played the best football this season . "
schaaf claimed bremen would attack from the first whistle in bavaria and he was good to his word as the visitors swamped bayern in the opening exchanges .
bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn insisted bremen were feeling the pressure before the match but those words came back to haunt him on 19 minutes with a calamitous error .
brazilian ailton fed strike partner ivan klasnic but kahn seemed to have the situation in hand reaching the ball first before inexplicably fumbling , allowing croat klasnic to slot home into an empty net .
" it is ironic that kahn - one of our best players this season - made the mistake , " pointed out hitzfeld .
it has been a difficult time for the 34-year-old international keeper , who conceded five goals in germany 's 5-1 thrashing by romania in bucharest , and things did not improve .
french international johan micoud lobbed him magnificently seven minutes later to make it 2-0 .
" we dedicate this title to our fantastic fans , " added micoud .
then in the 35th minute ailton notched his 27th goal of a productive campaign , curling a 25-yard shot into the top corner past the despairing kahn .
the travelling contingent of bremen supporters were in a state of delirium .
dutch international roy makaay reduced the arrears on 56 minutes after bremen switched off but it was just a momentary lapse as bremen held their nerve and dethroned bayern as german champions .
the only consolation for bayern , who have ended the season empty-handed , was that third-placed stuttgart did not take advantage of their slip-up tasting a 2-1 defeat at sv hamburg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.05.2004 german police arrest ' sasser ' programmer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody likes a worm .
with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week . they have names like " slammer , " " blaster , " or even " sasser . "
very often they 're programmed by college or high school students .
and even though experts see the signature of amateurs in their work , they still manage to cause billions of dollars in damage in industrial nations .
last week it was the " sasser " worm that wriggled its way around the world , bringing computer networks to a crawl or complete halt .
the consequences : hours-long delays at british airways .
finland 's sampo bank took the precautionary measure of closing its 130 branches because the anti-virus software on its computers had n't been updated yet .
at the european commission in brussels , 1,200 computers were affected by sasser , leading a spokesman to describe it as a " serious problem . "
worse yet , the british coast guard was forced to abandon its electronic navigation system and instead pull out paper maps .
german police on saturday morning arrested the suspected " cyber terrorist " believed to have foisted sasser on the world .
the 18-year-old high school student , who hails from a small town near bremen , confessed to the crime after his arrest , officials said .
officials from the state office of criminal investigation in the state of lower saxony first searched the home of the boy 's parents before making the arrest .
he was later released on bail .
luck in misfortune fortunately , sasser was one of the less harmful varieties of its species .
the worm , which infected millions of computers , did n't cause any direct damage other than the fact that it made computers crash and stalled networks .
" the damage is difficult to estimate because nothing has actually been destroyed in the sense of the word , " said michael dickopf of the federal office for information technology security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
" only companies ' productivity was affected , their networks were slowed down . "
despite all the media attention it got , " sasser " caused far less damage than its predecessors .
" the situation was nowhere near as dramatic as last august , when ' blaster ' was going around , " said rainer link of the virus protection software maker trend micro .
and even blaster , a so-called super worm , was more like a baby worm compared to the " love bug . "
the consulting firm computer economics estimates that that virus caused as much as € 9 billion in damage .
but sasser is especially sneaky : it does n't spread itself as an e-mail attachment .
sasser instead takes advantage of a weakness in the windows operating system to automatically install itself on unsuspecting computers .
" in the worst-case scenarios , people go online and are infected within 30 seconds , " link said .
private users are especially vulnerable to the virus .
the only possibility for repairing the security hole that enables sasser to attack is to download a software patch from the microsoft web site .
but , complains michael dickopf of bsi , " most private users are lacking the security needs .
they do n't download those kinds of updates . "
most firms , on the other hand , reacted quickly to the warning and downloaded the patch .
in the end , the biggest problems were encountered at firms where the microsoft patch was incompatible with the company network .
competition of the worst kind lately , there 's been an alarming trend in the increasing speed with which viruses reach their victims .
" the number of attacks has increased unbelievably , " said trend micro 's link .
" it 's an entirely new dimension . "
worms like sasser , which do n't require the help of e-mail to spread across the internet have reached distribution rates that would have been unimaginable earlier .
the time span between viruses is also shrinking .
" it always was a kind of competition , " he said .
" the virus programmers see the new anti-virus programs and then they try to get around them .
that creates a whole new challenge for us . "
in the case of sasser , it only took two weeks .
on april 14 , microsoft issued a warning and by may 1 , the worm was already attacking . arend wulff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blackout - could it happen in germany ?

in italy , the first-ever study on women in italian organized crime reveals that women are rising up the ranks to leadership positions .
this is both because the mafia is changing , and women are changing the mafia . from la dolce vita , the sweet life , to the malavita , the underworld , the growing presence of women is being felt everywhere in italy .
until recently , this was almost unthinkable .
the first woman arrested for " criminal association " was just five years ago , in 1999 .
police have known that women play a supporting role within the mafia : as mothers , wives , and daughters , they 've carried out minor tasks .
filling in for locked up hubbies occasionally , women have even stepped in to run things temporarily when their men have been jailed or murdered .
but a new study shows that women within the mafia are rising through the ranks and becoming bosses in their own right .
and it says that the italian judicial system should start paying closer attention .
ernesto savona of the catholic university of milan , one of the report ’ s authors , says criminal organizations are becoming more appealing to women .
" criminal organizations are changing .
they ’ re producing less violence .
less people are killed in palermo and columbia and in others in proportion to how many were killed before .
they ’ re transforming the hierarchical organization into a more flexible one .
that means you ’ ll get more women having managerial roles .
we call them ' sweet criminal organizations ' , " he told deutsche welle .
from hard crime to financial crime as underworld activities have shifted to financial crimes , violence has dropped .
organizations have also become less centralized .
" that you find women having managerial roles in small criminal organization shows that it 's very flexible and not hierarchical , " savona explains .
" especially juvenile gangs .
sometimes you find a woman who has the leadership in the organization . "
the evolution of women in the criminal world is exactly the same as that of women in the business world .
pierluigi vigna , who heads up italy ’ s national anti-mafia office , says that with politically motivated crimes , women are just as willing to kill as men .
mafia women , however , aren ’ t as willing when it comes to business .
the researchers say that ’ s because women find murder for profit harder to justify .
and their roles reflect this difference in values .
" they ’ re mainly found in areas that require a certain finesse , " vigna explains , " like money laundering rather than murder . "
while there are no statistics on the exact number of women in the italian mafia , the researchers say that more women in key positions are being arrested .
in april , a 28-year-old sicilian woman was found guilty of 50 percent ownership of a thriving underworld business .
this may not be this kind of emancipation feminists had in mind , but it does show that women in italy need to be taken seriously in all facets of life . megan williams -lrb- dw-radio -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

in italy , the first-ever study on women in italian organized crime reveals that women are rising up the ranks to leadership positions .
this is both because the mafia is changing , and women are changing the mafia . from la dolce vita , the sweet life , to the malavita , the underworld , the growing presence of women is being felt everywhere in italy .
until recently , this was almost unthinkable .
the first woman arrested for " criminal association " was just five years ago , in 1999 .
police have known that women play a supporting role within the mafia : as mothers , wives , and daughters , they 've carried out minor tasks .
filling in for locked up hubbies occasionally , women have even stepped in to run things temporarily when their men have been jailed or murdered .
but a new study shows that women within the mafia are rising through the ranks and becoming bosses in their own right .
and it says that the italian judicial system should start paying closer attention .
ernesto savona of the catholic university of milan , one of the report ’ s authors , says criminal organizations are becoming more appealing to women .
" criminal organizations are changing .
they ’ re producing less violence .
less people are killed in palermo and columbia and in others in proportion to how many were killed before .
they ’ re transforming the hierarchical organization into a more flexible one .
that means you ’ ll get more women having managerial roles .
we call them ' sweet criminal organizations ' , " he told deutsche welle .
from hard crime to financial crime as underworld activities have shifted to financial crimes , violence has dropped .
organizations have also become less centralized .
" that you find women having managerial roles in small criminal organization shows that it 's very flexible and not hierarchical , " savona explains .
" especially juvenile gangs .
sometimes you find a woman who has the leadership in the organization . "
the evolution of women in the criminal world is exactly the same as that of women in the business world .
pierluigi vigna , who heads up italy ’ s national anti-mafia office , says that with politically motivated crimes , women are just as willing to kill as men .
mafia women , however , aren ’ t as willing when it comes to business .
the researchers say that ’ s because women find murder for profit harder to justify .
and their roles reflect this difference in values .
" they ’ re mainly found in areas that require a certain finesse , " vigna explains , " like money laundering rather than murder . "
while there are no statistics on the exact number of women in the italian mafia , the researchers say that more women in key positions are being arrested .
in april , a 28-year-old sicilian woman was found guilty of 50 percent ownership of a thriving underworld business .
this may not be this kind of emancipation feminists had in mind , but it does show that women in italy need to be taken seriously in all facets of life . megan williams -lrb- dw-radio -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

in 20 years , the vessel could shuttle satellites and humans to space . space researchers in bremen came a step closer this weekend to the creation of europe 's first reusable , unmanned space shuttle .
the so-called phoenix craft , a prototype of the future hopper space glider , landed safely at a testing ground after reaching speeds of 450 kilometers per hour in northern sweden on saturday .
bremen-based eads space transportation is developing the shuttle in the hopes that it will carry cargo and astronauts into space within the next 20 years .
the european space agency , which initiated the project , said the 90-second flight represents a further step towards europe 's possible manned space flights in the future .
the german-designed prototype was carried to a height of 2,400 meters by a helicopter .
it then glided back to earth without the use of a motor and without controls from the ground .
an onboard computer equipped with gps guided the phoenix to a perfect landing .
measuring just under 6 meters in length , phoenix is one-sixth the size of the planned hopper .
" everyone here is ecstatic , " johanna bergstroem-roos of the north european aerospace test range in kiruna , sweden , told the associated press .
" this gives us wind in our sails . "
a craft with artificial intelligence ?
but what really set the phoenix mission apart from others was the fact that it steered itself .
an onboard computer controlled the navigation of the craft by processing data from radar , laser-distance measurements and satellite navigation , which it then used to determine small changes of direction and altitude until it made its landing .
officials at eads space transportation also expressed elation .
" for the first time , we have proven that the automated landing of this type of aircraft is technically controllable , " said peter kyr , project manager for the phoenix program .
" this successful test flight is the decisive german contribution on the way to a future reusable space transporter , " said the firm 's president , josef kind .
the launcher of the future the european space agency and eads hope to complete development of hopper between 2015 and 2020 , when it would go into service as a replacement for the ariane 5 rocket , the workhorse launcher currently used by the european space program to send satellites and other payloads into orbit .
the hopper shuttle would fly payloads into space and then return to earth without any help from mission control .
the shuttle is being developed and constructed at eads ' bremen facilities .
so far , € 8.2 million has been invested in the project , with the city-state of bremen contributing € 4.3 million and an additional € 3.5 million coming from the german aerospace center .
three further tests are planned in the coming days. using data from the flights , researchers will optimize phoenix and prepare it for further tests at higher elevations .
drops are planned from as high as 25 kilometers using balloons or supersonic aircraft .
in the mid-term , eads also plans to outfit phoenix with its own engine .
before it is ready for prime time , the shuttle will have to be able to glide from an altitude of 130 kilometers . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links europe in space a dw-world special report on the european space program - from mars express to the aurora vision of manned space flights .

in 20 years , the vessel could shuttle satellites and humans to space . space researchers in bremen came a step closer this weekend to the creation of europe 's first reusable , unmanned space shuttle .
the so-called phoenix craft , a prototype of the future hopper space glider , landed safely at a testing ground after reaching speeds of 450 kilometers per hour in northern sweden on saturday .
bremen-based eads space transportation is developing the shuttle in the hopes that it will carry cargo and astronauts into space within the next 20 years .
the european space agency , which initiated the project , said the 90-second flight represents a further step towards europe 's possible manned space flights in the future .
the german-designed prototype was carried to a height of 2,400 meters by a helicopter .
it then glided back to earth without the use of a motor and without controls from the ground .
an onboard computer equipped with gps guided the phoenix to a perfect landing .
measuring just under 6 meters in length , phoenix is one-sixth the size of the planned hopper .
" everyone here is ecstatic , " johanna bergstroem-roos of the north european aerospace test range in kiruna , sweden , told the associated press .
" this gives us wind in our sails . "
a craft with artificial intelligence ?
but what really set the phoenix mission apart from others was the fact that it steered itself .
an onboard computer controlled the navigation of the craft by processing data from radar , laser-distance measurements and satellite navigation , which it then used to determine small changes of direction and altitude until it made its landing .
officials at eads space transportation also expressed elation .
" for the first time , we have proven that the automated landing of this type of aircraft is technically controllable , " said peter kyr , project manager for the phoenix program .
" this successful test flight is the decisive german contribution on the way to a future reusable space transporter , " said the firm 's president , josef kind .
the launcher of the future the european space agency and eads hope to complete development of hopper between 2015 and 2020 , when it would go into service as a replacement for the ariane 5 rocket , the workhorse launcher currently used by the european space program to send satellites and other payloads into orbit .
the hopper shuttle would fly payloads into space and then return to earth without any help from mission control .
the shuttle is being developed and constructed at eads ' bremen facilities .
so far , € 8.2 million has been invested in the project , with the city-state of bremen contributing € 4.3 million and an additional € 3.5 million coming from the german aerospace center .
three further tests are planned in the coming days. using data from the flights , researchers will optimize phoenix and prepare it for further tests at higher elevations .
drops are planned from as high as 25 kilometers using balloons or supersonic aircraft .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.05.2004 german police arrest ' sasser ' programmer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody likes a worm .
with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week . they have names like " slammer , " " blaster , " or even " sasser . "
very often they 're programmed by college or high school students .
and even though experts see the signature of amateurs in their work , they still manage to cause billions of dollars in damage in industrial nations .
last week it was the " sasser " worm that wriggled its way around the world , bringing computer networks to a crawl or complete halt .
the consequences : hours-long delays at british airways .
finland 's sampo bank took the precautionary measure of closing its 130 branches because the anti-virus software on its computers had n't been updated yet .
at the european commission in brussels , 1,200 computers were affected by sasser , leading a spokesman to describe it as a " serious problem . "
worse yet , the british coast guard was forced to abandon its electronic navigation system and instead pull out paper maps .
german police on saturday morning arrested the suspected " cyber terrorist " believed to have foisted sasser on the world .
the 18-year-old high school student , who hails from a small town near bremen , confessed to the crime after his arrest , officials said .
officials from the state office of criminal investigation in the state of lower saxony first searched the home of the boy 's parents before making the arrest .
he was later released on bail .
luck in misfortune fortunately , sasser was one of the less harmful varieties of its species .
the worm , which infected millions of computers , did n't cause any direct damage other than the fact that it made computers crash and stalled networks .
" the damage is difficult to estimate because nothing has actually been destroyed in the sense of the word , " said michael dickopf of the federal office for information technology security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
" only companies ' productivity was affected , their networks were slowed down . "
despite all the media attention it got , " sasser " caused far less damage than its predecessors .
" the situation was nowhere near as dramatic as last august , when ' blaster ' was going around , " said rainer link of the virus protection software maker trend micro .
and even blaster , a so-called super worm , was more like a baby worm compared to the " love bug . "
the consulting firm computer economics estimates that that virus caused as much as € 9 billion in damage .
but sasser is especially sneaky : it does n't spread itself as an e-mail attachment .
sasser instead takes advantage of a weakness in the windows operating system to automatically install itself on unsuspecting computers .
" in the worst-case scenarios , people go online and are infected within 30 seconds , " link said .
private users are especially vulnerable to the virus .
the only possibility for repairing the security hole that enables sasser to attack is to download a software patch from the microsoft web site .
but , complains michael dickopf of bsi , " most private users are lacking the security needs .
they do n't download those kinds of updates . "
most firms , on the other hand , reacted quickly to the warning and downloaded the patch .
in the end , the biggest problems were encountered at firms where the microsoft patch was incompatible with the company network .
competition of the worst kind lately , there 's been an alarming trend in the increasing speed with which viruses reach their victims .
" the number of attacks has increased unbelievably , " said trend micro 's link .
" it 's an entirely new dimension . "
worms like sasser , which do n't require the help of e-mail to spread across the internet have reached distribution rates that would have been unimaginable earlier .
the time span between viruses is also shrinking .
" it always was a kind of competition , " he said .
" the virus programmers see the new anti-virus programs and then they try to get around them .
that creates a whole new challenge for us . "
in the case of sasser , it only took two weeks .
on april 14 , microsoft issued a warning and by may 1 , the worm was already attacking . arend wulff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blackout - could it happen in germany ?

when the title contenders were being discussed in pre-season , bayern , borussia dortmund and vfb stuttgart came to the fore , but not many pundits would have wagered on a team eliminated in the intertoto cup by austrian minnows sv pasching .
however , bremen have gone 23 games unbeaten to defy the odds and topple bayern - who they finished 23 points behind last season - with some adventurous football this term .
" sometimes you have lows in football , " said bayern chief ottmar hitzfeld . " it can not just be running around celebrating all the time .
" i have congratulated thomas schaaf as bremen played the best football this season . "
schaaf claimed bremen would attack from the first whistle in bavaria and he was good to his word as the visitors swamped bayern in the opening exchanges .
bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn insisted bremen were feeling the pressure before the match but those words came back to haunt him on 19 minutes with a calamitous error .
brazilian ailton fed strike partner ivan klasnic but kahn seemed to have the situation in hand reaching the ball first before inexplicably fumbling , allowing croat klasnic to slot home into an empty net .
" it is ironic that kahn - one of our best players this season - made the mistake , " pointed out hitzfeld .
it has been a difficult time for the 34-year-old international keeper , who conceded five goals in germany 's 5-1 thrashing by romania in bucharest , and things did not improve .
french international johan micoud lobbed him magnificently seven minutes later to make it 2-0 .
" we dedicate this title to our fantastic fans , " added micoud .
then in the 35th minute ailton notched his 27th goal of a productive campaign , curling a 25-yard shot into the top corner past the despairing kahn .
the travelling contingent of bremen supporters were in a state of delirium .
dutch international roy makaay reduced the arrears on 56 minutes after bremen switched off but it was just a momentary lapse as bremen held their nerve and dethroned bayern as german champions .
the only consolation for bayern , who have ended the season empty-handed , was that third-placed stuttgart did not take advantage of their slip-up tasting a 2-1 defeat at sv hamburg .
felix magath 's side will be kicking themselves as they could have moved to within one point of munich with victory .
borussia dortmund 's chances of playing european football in 2004/05 suffered a blow following a surprise 6-2 thumping by struggling hertha berlin in the capital .

with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week . they have names like " slammer , " " blaster , " or even " sasser . "
very often they 're programmed by college or high school students .
and even though experts see the signature of amateurs in their work , they still manage to cause billions of dollars in damage in industrial nations .
last week it was the " sasser " worm that wriggled its way around the world , bringing computer networks to a crawl or complete halt .
the consequences : hours-long delays at british airways .
finland 's sampo bank took the precautionary measure of closing its 130 branches because the anti-virus software on its computers had n't been updated yet .
at the european commission in brussels , 1,200 computers were affected by sasser , leading a spokesman to describe it as a " serious problem . "
worse yet , the british coast guard was forced to abandon its electronic navigation system and instead pull out paper maps .
german police on saturday morning arrested the suspected " cyber terrorist " believed to have foisted sasser on the world .
the 18-year-old high school student , who hails from a small town near bremen , confessed to the crime after his arrest , officials said .
officials from the state office of criminal investigation in the state of lower saxony first searched the home of the boy 's parents before making the arrest .
he was later released on bail .
luck in misfortune fortunately , sasser was one of the less harmful varieties of its species .
the worm , which infected millions of computers , did n't cause any direct damage other than the fact that it made computers crash and stalled networks .
" the damage is difficult to estimate because nothing has actually been destroyed in the sense of the word , " said michael dickopf of the federal office for information technology security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
" only companies ' productivity was affected , their networks were slowed down . "
despite all the media attention it got , " sasser " caused far less damage than its predecessors .
" the situation was nowhere near as dramatic as last august , when ' blaster ' was going around , " said rainer link of the virus protection software maker trend micro .
and even blaster , a so-called super worm , was more like a baby worm compared to the " love bug . "
the consulting firm computer economics estimates that that virus caused as much as € 9 billion in damage .
but sasser is especially sneaky : it does n't spread itself as an e-mail attachment .
sasser instead takes advantage of a weakness in the windows operating system to automatically install itself on unsuspecting computers .
" in the worst-case scenarios , people go online and are infected within 30 seconds , " link said .
private users are especially vulnerable to the virus .
the only possibility for repairing the security hole that enables sasser to attack is to download a software patch from the microsoft web site .
but , complains michael dickopf of bsi , " most private users are lacking the security needs .
they do n't download those kinds of updates . "
most firms , on the other hand , reacted quickly to the warning and downloaded the patch .
in the end , the biggest problems were encountered at firms where the microsoft patch was incompatible with the company network .
competition of the worst kind lately , there 's been an alarming trend in the increasing speed with which viruses reach their victims .
" the number of attacks has increased unbelievably , " said trend micro 's link .
" it 's an entirely new dimension . "
worms like sasser , which do n't require the help of e-mail to spread across the internet have reached distribution rates that would have been unimaginable earlier .
the time span between viruses is also shrinking .
" it always was a kind of competition , " he said .
" the virus programmers see the new anti-virus programs and then they try to get around them .
that creates a whole new challenge for us . "
in the case of sasser , it only took two weeks .

in italy , the first-ever study on women in italian organized crime reveals that women are rising up the ranks to leadership positions .
this is both because the mafia is changing , and women are changing the mafia . from la dolce vita , the sweet life , to the malavita , the underworld , the growing presence of women is being felt everywhere in italy .
until recently , this was almost unthinkable .
the first woman arrested for " criminal association " was just five years ago , in 1999 .
police have known that women play a supporting role within the mafia : as mothers , wives , and daughters , they 've carried out minor tasks .
filling in for locked up hubbies occasionally , women have even stepped in to run things temporarily when their men have been jailed or murdered .
but a new study shows that women within the mafia are rising through the ranks and becoming bosses in their own right .
and it says that the italian judicial system should start paying closer attention .
ernesto savona of the catholic university of milan , one of the report ’ s authors , says criminal organizations are becoming more appealing to women .
" criminal organizations are changing .
they ’ re producing less violence .
less people are killed in palermo and columbia and in others in proportion to how many were killed before .

in 20 years , the vessel could shuttle satellites and humans to space . space researchers in bremen came a step closer this weekend to the creation of europe 's first reusable , unmanned space shuttle .
the so-called phoenix craft , a prototype of the future hopper space glider , landed safely at a testing ground after reaching speeds of 450 kilometers per hour in northern sweden on saturday .
bremen-based eads space transportation is developing the shuttle in the hopes that it will carry cargo and astronauts into space within the next 20 years .
the european space agency , which initiated the project , said the 90-second flight represents a further step towards europe 's possible manned space flights in the future .
the german-designed prototype was carried to a height of 2,400 meters by a helicopter .
it then glided back to earth without the use of a motor and without controls from the ground .
an onboard computer equipped with gps guided the phoenix to a perfect landing .
measuring just under 6 meters in length , phoenix is one-sixth the size of the planned hopper .
" everyone here is ecstatic , " johanna bergstroem-roos of the north european aerospace test range in kiruna , sweden , told the associated press .
" this gives us wind in our sails . "
a craft with artificial intelligence ?
but what really set the phoenix mission apart from others was the fact that it steered itself .
an onboard computer controlled the navigation of the craft by processing data from radar , laser-distance measurements and satellite navigation , which it then used to determine small changes of direction and altitude until it made its landing .
officials at eads space transportation also expressed elation .
" for the first time , we have proven that the automated landing of this type of aircraft is technically controllable , " said peter kyr , project manager for the phoenix program .
" this successful test flight is the decisive german contribution on the way to a future reusable space transporter , " said the firm 's president , josef kind .
the launcher of the future the european space agency and eads hope to complete development of hopper between 2015 and 2020 , when it would go into service as a replacement for the ariane 5 rocket , the workhorse launcher currently used by the european space program to send satellites and other payloads into orbit .
the hopper shuttle would fly payloads into space and then return to earth without any help from mission control .
the shuttle is being developed and constructed at eads ' bremen facilities .
so far , € 8.2 million has been invested in the project , with the city-state of bremen contributing € 4.3 million and an additional € 3.5 million coming from the german aerospace center .
three further tests are planned in the coming days. using data from the flights , researchers will optimize phoenix and prepare it for further tests at higher elevations .
drops are planned from as high as 25 kilometers using balloons or supersonic aircraft .
in the mid-term , eads also plans to outfit phoenix with its own engine .
before it is ready for prime time , the shuttle will have to be able to glide from an altitude of 130 kilometers . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links europe in space a dw-world special report on the european space program - from mars express to the aurora vision of manned space flights .

in 20 years , the vessel could shuttle satellites and humans to space . space researchers in bremen came a step closer this weekend to the creation of europe 's first reusable , unmanned space shuttle .
the so-called phoenix craft , a prototype of the future hopper space glider , landed safely at a testing ground after reaching speeds of 450 kilometers per hour in northern sweden on saturday .
bremen-based eads space transportation is developing the shuttle in the hopes that it will carry cargo and astronauts into space within the next 20 years .
the european space agency , which initiated the project , said the 90-second flight represents a further step towards europe 's possible manned space flights in the future .
the german-designed prototype was carried to a height of 2,400 meters by a helicopter .
it then glided back to earth without the use of a motor and without controls from the ground .
an onboard computer equipped with gps guided the phoenix to a perfect landing .
measuring just under 6 meters in length , phoenix is one-sixth the size of the planned hopper .
" everyone here is ecstatic , " johanna bergstroem-roos of the north european aerospace test range in kiruna , sweden , told the associated press .
" this gives us wind in our sails . "

in 20 years , the vessel could shuttle satellites and humans to space . space researchers in bremen came a step closer this weekend to the creation of europe 's first reusable , unmanned space shuttle .
the so-called phoenix craft , a prototype of the future hopper space glider , landed safely at a testing ground after reaching speeds of 450 kilometers per hour in northern sweden on saturday .
bremen-based eads space transportation is developing the shuttle in the hopes that it will carry cargo and astronauts into space within the next 20 years .
the european space agency , which initiated the project , said the 90-second flight represents a further step towards europe 's possible manned space flights in the future .
the german-designed prototype was carried to a height of 2,400 meters by a helicopter .
it then glided back to earth without the use of a motor and without controls from the ground .
an onboard computer equipped with gps guided the phoenix to a perfect landing .
measuring just under 6 meters in length , phoenix is one-sixth the size of the planned hopper .
" everyone here is ecstatic , " johanna bergstroem-roos of the north european aerospace test range in kiruna , sweden , told the associated press .
" this gives us wind in our sails . "

it is bremen 's fourth championship win in all following their triumphs in 1965 , 1988 and 1993 and will taste all the sweeter as it was clinched on bayern 's own patch .
" i think it is sensational what this team has achieved , " said a jubilant bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" the fact that uli hoeness -lrb- bayern general manager -rrb- congratulated us shows there is a mutual respect . "
bremen now have the chance of a league and cup double if they can defeat second division outfit alemannia aachen in the german cup final on may 26 in berlin .
a first-half goal blitz did the damage for bremen with croat ivan klasnic , frenchman johan micoud and brazilian ailton scoring inside 35 minutes .
when the title contenders were being discussed in pre-season , bayern , borussia dortmund and vfb stuttgart came to the fore , but not many pundits would have wagered on a team eliminated in the intertoto cup by austrian minnows sv pasching .
however , bremen have gone 23 games unbeaten to defy the odds and topple bayern - who they finished 23 points behind last season - with some adventurous football this term .
" sometimes you have lows in football , " said bayern chief ottmar hitzfeld . " it can not just be running around celebrating all the time .
" i have congratulated thomas schaaf as bremen played the best football this season . "
schaaf claimed bremen would attack from the first whistle in bavaria and he was good to his word as the visitors swamped bayern in the opening exchanges .
bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn insisted bremen were feeling the pressure before the match but those words came back to haunt him on 19 minutes with a calamitous error .
brazilian ailton fed strike partner ivan klasnic but kahn seemed to have the situation in hand reaching the ball first before inexplicably fumbling , allowing croat klasnic to slot home into an empty net .
" it is ironic that kahn - one of our best players this season - made the mistake , " pointed out hitzfeld .
it has been a difficult time for the 34-year-old international keeper , who conceded five goals in germany 's 5-1 thrashing by romania in bucharest , and things did not improve .
french international johan micoud lobbed him magnificently seven minutes later to make it 2-0 .
" we dedicate this title to our fantastic fans , " added micoud .
then in the 35th minute ailton notched his 27th goal of a productive campaign , curling a 25-yard shot into the top corner past the despairing kahn .
the travelling contingent of bremen supporters were in a state of delirium .
dutch international roy makaay reduced the arrears on 56 minutes after bremen switched off but it was just a momentary lapse as bremen held their nerve and dethroned bayern as german champions .
the only consolation for bayern , who have ended the season empty-handed , was that third-placed stuttgart did not take advantage of their slip-up tasting a 2-1 defeat at sv hamburg .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.05.2004 werder bremen clinch german championship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's players celebrate their upset defeat over fc bayern munchen the northern german city 's football team take the title after a sensational 3-1 win over bayer munich on saturday . werder bremen lifted their first german championship in 11 years with a sensational 3-1 win over reigning champions bayern munich at the olympic stadium on saturday . bremen move nine points ahead of holders bayern , who suffered their first home defeat of the season , with two games left to play .
it is bremen 's fourth championship win in all following their triumphs in 1965 , 1988 and 1993 and will taste all the sweeter as it was clinched on bayern 's own patch .
" i think it is sensational what this team has achieved , " said a jubilant bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" the fact that uli hoeness -lrb- bayern general manager -rrb- congratulated us shows there is a mutual respect . "
bremen now have the chance of a league and cup double if they can defeat second division outfit alemannia aachen in the german cup final on may 26 in berlin .
a first-half goal blitz did the damage for bremen with croat ivan klasnic , frenchman johan micoud and brazilian ailton scoring inside 35 minutes .
when the title contenders were being discussed in pre-season , bayern , borussia dortmund and vfb stuttgart came to the fore , but not many pundits would have wagered on a team eliminated in the intertoto cup by austrian minnows sv pasching .
however , bremen have gone 23 games unbeaten to defy the odds and topple bayern - who they finished 23 points behind last season - with some adventurous football this term .
" sometimes you have lows in football , " said bayern chief ottmar hitzfeld . " it can not just be running around celebrating all the time .
" i have congratulated thomas schaaf as bremen played the best football this season . "
schaaf claimed bremen would attack from the first whistle in bavaria and he was good to his word as the visitors swamped bayern in the opening exchanges .
bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn insisted bremen were feeling the pressure before the match but those words came back to haunt him on 19 minutes with a calamitous error .
brazilian ailton fed strike partner ivan klasnic but kahn seemed to have the situation in hand reaching the ball first before inexplicably fumbling , allowing croat klasnic to slot home into an empty net .
" it is ironic that kahn - one of our best players this season - made the mistake , " pointed out hitzfeld .
it has been a difficult time for the 34-year-old international keeper , who conceded five goals in germany 's 5-1 thrashing by romania in bucharest , and things did not improve .
french international johan micoud lobbed him magnificently seven minutes later to make it 2-0 .
" we dedicate this title to our fantastic fans , " added micoud .
then in the 35th minute ailton notched his 27th goal of a productive campaign , curling a 25-yard shot into the top corner past the despairing kahn .
the travelling contingent of bremen supporters were in a state of delirium .
dutch international roy makaay reduced the arrears on 56 minutes after bremen switched off but it was just a momentary lapse as bremen held their nerve and dethroned bayern as german champions .
the only consolation for bayern , who have ended the season empty-handed , was that third-placed stuttgart did not take advantage of their slip-up tasting a 2-1 defeat at sv hamburg .

it is bremen 's fourth championship win in all following their triumphs in 1965 , 1988 and 1993 and will taste all the sweeter as it was clinched on bayern 's own patch .
" i think it is sensational what this team has achieved , " said a jubilant bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" the fact that uli hoeness -lrb- bayern general manager -rrb- congratulated us shows there is a mutual respect . "
bremen now have the chance of a league and cup double if they can defeat second division outfit alemannia aachen in the german cup final on may 26 in berlin .
a first-half goal blitz did the damage for bremen with croat ivan klasnic , frenchman johan micoud and brazilian ailton scoring inside 35 minutes .
when the title contenders were being discussed in pre-season , bayern , borussia dortmund and vfb stuttgart came to the fore , but not many pundits would have wagered on a team eliminated in the intertoto cup by austrian minnows sv pasching .
however , bremen have gone 23 games unbeaten to defy the odds and topple bayern - who they finished 23 points behind last season - with some adventurous football this term .
" sometimes you have lows in football , " said bayern chief ottmar hitzfeld . " it can not just be running around celebrating all the time .
" i have congratulated thomas schaaf as bremen played the best football this season . "
schaaf claimed bremen would attack from the first whistle in bavaria and he was good to his word as the visitors swamped bayern in the opening exchanges .
bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn insisted bremen were feeling the pressure before the match but those words came back to haunt him on 19 minutes with a calamitous error .
brazilian ailton fed strike partner ivan klasnic but kahn seemed to have the situation in hand reaching the ball first before inexplicably fumbling , allowing croat klasnic to slot home into an empty net .
" it is ironic that kahn - one of our best players this season - made the mistake , " pointed out hitzfeld .
it has been a difficult time for the 34-year-old international keeper , who conceded five goals in germany 's 5-1 thrashing by romania in bucharest , and things did not improve .
french international johan micoud lobbed him magnificently seven minutes later to make it 2-0 .
" we dedicate this title to our fantastic fans , " added micoud .
then in the 35th minute ailton notched his 27th goal of a productive campaign , curling a 25-yard shot into the top corner past the despairing kahn .
the travelling contingent of bremen supporters were in a state of delirium .
dutch international roy makaay reduced the arrears on 56 minutes after bremen switched off but it was just a momentary lapse as bremen held their nerve and dethroned bayern as german champions .
the only consolation for bayern , who have ended the season empty-handed , was that third-placed stuttgart did not take advantage of their slip-up tasting a 2-1 defeat at sv hamburg .

with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week . they have names like " slammer , " " blaster , " or even " sasser . "
very often they 're programmed by college or high school students .
and even though experts see the signature of amateurs in their work , they still manage to cause billions of dollars in damage in industrial nations .
last week it was the " sasser " worm that wriggled its way around the world , bringing computer networks to a crawl or complete halt .
the consequences : hours-long delays at british airways .
finland 's sampo bank took the precautionary measure of closing its 130 branches because the anti-virus software on its computers had n't been updated yet .
at the european commission in brussels , 1,200 computers were affected by sasser , leading a spokesman to describe it as a " serious problem . "
worse yet , the british coast guard was forced to abandon its electronic navigation system and instead pull out paper maps .
german police on saturday morning arrested the suspected " cyber terrorist " believed to have foisted sasser on the world .
the 18-year-old high school student , who hails from a small town near bremen , confessed to the crime after his arrest , officials said .
officials from the state office of criminal investigation in the state of lower saxony first searched the home of the boy 's parents before making the arrest .
he was later released on bail .
luck in misfortune fortunately , sasser was one of the less harmful varieties of its species .
the worm , which infected millions of computers , did n't cause any direct damage other than the fact that it made computers crash and stalled networks .
" the damage is difficult to estimate because nothing has actually been destroyed in the sense of the word , " said michael dickopf of the federal office for information technology security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
" only companies ' productivity was affected , their networks were slowed down . "
despite all the media attention it got , " sasser " caused far less damage than its predecessors .
" the situation was nowhere near as dramatic as last august , when ' blaster ' was going around , " said rainer link of the virus protection software maker trend micro .
and even blaster , a so-called super worm , was more like a baby worm compared to the " love bug . "
the consulting firm computer economics estimates that that virus caused as much as € 9 billion in damage .
but sasser is especially sneaky : it does n't spread itself as an e-mail attachment .
sasser instead takes advantage of a weakness in the windows operating system to automatically install itself on unsuspecting computers .
" in the worst-case scenarios , people go online and are infected within 30 seconds , " link said .
private users are especially vulnerable to the virus .
the only possibility for repairing the security hole that enables sasser to attack is to download a software patch from the microsoft web site .
but , complains michael dickopf of bsi , " most private users are lacking the security needs .
they do n't download those kinds of updates . "
most firms , on the other hand , reacted quickly to the warning and downloaded the patch .
in the end , the biggest problems were encountered at firms where the microsoft patch was incompatible with the company network .
competition of the worst kind lately , there 's been an alarming trend in the increasing speed with which viruses reach their victims .
" the number of attacks has increased unbelievably , " said trend micro 's link .
" it 's an entirely new dimension . "
worms like sasser , which do n't require the help of e-mail to spread across the internet have reached distribution rates that would have been unimaginable earlier .
the time span between viruses is also shrinking .
" it always was a kind of competition , " he said .
" the virus programmers see the new anti-virus programs and then they try to get around them .
that creates a whole new challenge for us . "
in the case of sasser , it only took two weeks .
on april 14 , microsoft issued a warning and by may 1 , the worm was already attacking . arend wulff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blackout - could it happen in germany ?

with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week . they have names like " slammer , " " blaster , " or even " sasser . "
very often they 're programmed by college or high school students .
and even though experts see the signature of amateurs in their work , they still manage to cause billions of dollars in damage in industrial nations .
last week it was the " sasser " worm that wriggled its way around the world , bringing computer networks to a crawl or complete halt .
the consequences : hours-long delays at british airways .
finland 's sampo bank took the precautionary measure of closing its 130 branches because the anti-virus software on its computers had n't been updated yet .
at the european commission in brussels , 1,200 computers were affected by sasser , leading a spokesman to describe it as a " serious problem . "
worse yet , the british coast guard was forced to abandon its electronic navigation system and instead pull out paper maps .
german police on saturday morning arrested the suspected " cyber terrorist " believed to have foisted sasser on the world .
the 18-year-old high school student , who hails from a small town near bremen , confessed to the crime after his arrest , officials said .
officials from the state office of criminal investigation in the state of lower saxony first searched the home of the boy 's parents before making the arrest .
he was later released on bail .
luck in misfortune fortunately , sasser was one of the less harmful varieties of its species .
the worm , which infected millions of computers , did n't cause any direct damage other than the fact that it made computers crash and stalled networks .
" the damage is difficult to estimate because nothing has actually been destroyed in the sense of the word , " said michael dickopf of the federal office for information technology security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
" only companies ' productivity was affected , their networks were slowed down . "
despite all the media attention it got , " sasser " caused far less damage than its predecessors .
" the situation was nowhere near as dramatic as last august , when ' blaster ' was going around , " said rainer link of the virus protection software maker trend micro .
and even blaster , a so-called super worm , was more like a baby worm compared to the " love bug . "
the consulting firm computer economics estimates that that virus caused as much as € 9 billion in damage .
but sasser is especially sneaky : it does n't spread itself as an e-mail attachment .
sasser instead takes advantage of a weakness in the windows operating system to automatically install itself on unsuspecting computers .
" in the worst-case scenarios , people go online and are infected within 30 seconds , " link said .
private users are especially vulnerable to the virus .
the only possibility for repairing the security hole that enables sasser to attack is to download a software patch from the microsoft web site .
but , complains michael dickopf of bsi , " most private users are lacking the security needs .
they do n't download those kinds of updates . "
most firms , on the other hand , reacted quickly to the warning and downloaded the patch .
in the end , the biggest problems were encountered at firms where the microsoft patch was incompatible with the company network .
competition of the worst kind lately , there 's been an alarming trend in the increasing speed with which viruses reach their victims .
" the number of attacks has increased unbelievably , " said trend micro 's link .

in italy , the first-ever study on women in italian organized crime reveals that women are rising up the ranks to leadership positions .
this is both because the mafia is changing , and women are changing the mafia . from la dolce vita , the sweet life , to the malavita , the underworld , the growing presence of women is being felt everywhere in italy .
until recently , this was almost unthinkable .
the first woman arrested for " criminal association " was just five years ago , in 1999 .
police have known that women play a supporting role within the mafia : as mothers , wives , and daughters , they 've carried out minor tasks .
filling in for locked up hubbies occasionally , women have even stepped in to run things temporarily when their men have been jailed or murdered .
but a new study shows that women within the mafia are rising through the ranks and becoming bosses in their own right .
and it says that the italian judicial system should start paying closer attention .
ernesto savona of the catholic university of milan , one of the report ’ s authors , says criminal organizations are becoming more appealing to women .
" criminal organizations are changing .
they ’ re producing less violence .
less people are killed in palermo and columbia and in others in proportion to how many were killed before .
they ’ re transforming the hierarchical organization into a more flexible one .
that means you ’ ll get more women having managerial roles .
we call them ' sweet criminal organizations ' , " he told deutsche welle .
from hard crime to financial crime as underworld activities have shifted to financial crimes , violence has dropped .
organizations have also become less centralized .
" that you find women having managerial roles in small criminal organization shows that it 's very flexible and not hierarchical , " savona explains .
" especially juvenile gangs .
sometimes you find a woman who has the leadership in the organization . "
the evolution of women in the criminal world is exactly the same as that of women in the business world .
pierluigi vigna , who heads up italy ’ s national anti-mafia office , says that with politically motivated crimes , women are just as willing to kill as men .
mafia women , however , aren ’ t as willing when it comes to business .
the researchers say that ’ s because women find murder for profit harder to justify .
and their roles reflect this difference in values .
" they ’ re mainly found in areas that require a certain finesse , " vigna explains , " like money laundering rather than murder . "
while there are no statistics on the exact number of women in the italian mafia , the researchers say that more women in key positions are being arrested .
in april , a 28-year-old sicilian woman was found guilty of 50 percent ownership of a thriving underworld business .

in 20 years , the vessel could shuttle satellites and humans to space . space researchers in bremen came a step closer this weekend to the creation of europe 's first reusable , unmanned space shuttle .
the so-called phoenix craft , a prototype of the future hopper space glider , landed safely at a testing ground after reaching speeds of 450 kilometers per hour in northern sweden on saturday .
bremen-based eads space transportation is developing the shuttle in the hopes that it will carry cargo and astronauts into space within the next 20 years .
the european space agency , which initiated the project , said the 90-second flight represents a further step towards europe 's possible manned space flights in the future .
the german-designed prototype was carried to a height of 2,400 meters by a helicopter .
it then glided back to earth without the use of a motor and without controls from the ground .
an onboard computer equipped with gps guided the phoenix to a perfect landing .
measuring just under 6 meters in length , phoenix is one-sixth the size of the planned hopper .
" everyone here is ecstatic , " johanna bergstroem-roos of the north european aerospace test range in kiruna , sweden , told the associated press .
" this gives us wind in our sails . "
a craft with artificial intelligence ?
but what really set the phoenix mission apart from others was the fact that it steered itself .
an onboard computer controlled the navigation of the craft by processing data from radar , laser-distance measurements and satellite navigation , which it then used to determine small changes of direction and altitude until it made its landing .
officials at eads space transportation also expressed elation .
" for the first time , we have proven that the automated landing of this type of aircraft is technically controllable , " said peter kyr , project manager for the phoenix program .
" this successful test flight is the decisive german contribution on the way to a future reusable space transporter , " said the firm 's president , josef kind .
the launcher of the future the european space agency and eads hope to complete development of hopper between 2015 and 2020 , when it would go into service as a replacement for the ariane 5 rocket , the workhorse launcher currently used by the european space program to send satellites and other payloads into orbit .
the hopper shuttle would fly payloads into space and then return to earth without any help from mission control .
the shuttle is being developed and constructed at eads ' bremen facilities .
so far , € 8.2 million has been invested in the project , with the city-state of bremen contributing € 4.3 million and an additional € 3.5 million coming from the german aerospace center .
three further tests are planned in the coming days. using data from the flights , researchers will optimize phoenix and prepare it for further tests at higher elevations .
drops are planned from as high as 25 kilometers using balloons or supersonic aircraft .
in the mid-term , eads also plans to outfit phoenix with its own engine .
before it is ready for prime time , the shuttle will have to be able to glide from an altitude of 130 kilometers . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links europe in space a dw-world special report on the european space program - from mars express to the aurora vision of manned space flights .

in 20 years , the vessel could shuttle satellites and humans to space . space researchers in bremen came a step closer this weekend to the creation of europe 's first reusable , unmanned space shuttle .
the so-called phoenix craft , a prototype of the future hopper space glider , landed safely at a testing ground after reaching speeds of 450 kilometers per hour in northern sweden on saturday .
bremen-based eads space transportation is developing the shuttle in the hopes that it will carry cargo and astronauts into space within the next 20 years .
the european space agency , which initiated the project , said the 90-second flight represents a further step towards europe 's possible manned space flights in the future .
the german-designed prototype was carried to a height of 2,400 meters by a helicopter .
it then glided back to earth without the use of a motor and without controls from the ground .
an onboard computer equipped with gps guided the phoenix to a perfect landing .
measuring just under 6 meters in length , phoenix is one-sixth the size of the planned hopper .
" everyone here is ecstatic , " johanna bergstroem-roos of the north european aerospace test range in kiruna , sweden , told the associated press .
" this gives us wind in our sails . "
a craft with artificial intelligence ?
but what really set the phoenix mission apart from others was the fact that it steered itself .
an onboard computer controlled the navigation of the craft by processing data from radar , laser-distance measurements and satellite navigation , which it then used to determine small changes of direction and altitude until it made its landing .
officials at eads space transportation also expressed elation .
" for the first time , we have proven that the automated landing of this type of aircraft is technically controllable , " said peter kyr , project manager for the phoenix program .
" this successful test flight is the decisive german contribution on the way to a future reusable space transporter , " said the firm 's president , josef kind .
the launcher of the future the european space agency and eads hope to complete development of hopper between 2015 and 2020 , when it would go into service as a replacement for the ariane 5 rocket , the workhorse launcher currently used by the european space program to send satellites and other payloads into orbit .
the hopper shuttle would fly payloads into space and then return to earth without any help from mission control .
the shuttle is being developed and constructed at eads ' bremen facilities .
so far , € 8.2 million has been invested in the project , with the city-state of bremen contributing € 4.3 million and an additional € 3.5 million coming from the german aerospace center .

in italy , the first-ever study on women in italian organized crime reveals that women are rising up the ranks to leadership positions .
this is both because the mafia is changing , and women are changing the mafia . from la dolce vita , the sweet life , to the malavita , the underworld , the growing presence of women is being felt everywhere in italy .
until recently , this was almost unthinkable .
the first woman arrested for " criminal association " was just five years ago , in 1999 .
police have known that women play a supporting role within the mafia : as mothers , wives , and daughters , they 've carried out minor tasks .
filling in for locked up hubbies occasionally , women have even stepped in to run things temporarily when their men have been jailed or murdered .
but a new study shows that women within the mafia are rising through the ranks and becoming bosses in their own right .
and it says that the italian judicial system should start paying closer attention .
ernesto savona of the catholic university of milan , one of the report ’ s authors , says criminal organizations are becoming more appealing to women .
" criminal organizations are changing .
they ’ re producing less violence .
less people are killed in palermo and columbia and in others in proportion to how many were killed before .
they ’ re transforming the hierarchical organization into a more flexible one .
that means you ’ ll get more women having managerial roles .
we call them ' sweet criminal organizations ' , " he told deutsche welle .
from hard crime to financial crime as underworld activities have shifted to financial crimes , violence has dropped .
organizations have also become less centralized .
" that you find women having managerial roles in small criminal organization shows that it 's very flexible and not hierarchical , " savona explains .
" especially juvenile gangs .
sometimes you find a woman who has the leadership in the organization . "
the evolution of women in the criminal world is exactly the same as that of women in the business world .
pierluigi vigna , who heads up italy ’ s national anti-mafia office , says that with politically motivated crimes , women are just as willing to kill as men .
mafia women , however , aren ’ t as willing when it comes to business .
the researchers say that ’ s because women find murder for profit harder to justify .
and their roles reflect this difference in values .
" they ’ re mainly found in areas that require a certain finesse , " vigna explains , " like money laundering rather than murder . "
while there are no statistics on the exact number of women in the italian mafia , the researchers say that more women in key positions are being arrested .
in april , a 28-year-old sicilian woman was found guilty of 50 percent ownership of a thriving underworld business .
this may not be this kind of emancipation feminists had in mind , but it does show that women in italy need to be taken seriously in all facets of life . megan williams -lrb- dw-radio -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

in italy , the first-ever study on women in italian organized crime reveals that women are rising up the ranks to leadership positions .
this is both because the mafia is changing , and women are changing the mafia . from la dolce vita , the sweet life , to the malavita , the underworld , the growing presence of women is being felt everywhere in italy .
until recently , this was almost unthinkable .
the first woman arrested for " criminal association " was just five years ago , in 1999 .
police have known that women play a supporting role within the mafia : as mothers , wives , and daughters , they 've carried out minor tasks .
filling in for locked up hubbies occasionally , women have even stepped in to run things temporarily when their men have been jailed or murdered .
but a new study shows that women within the mafia are rising through the ranks and becoming bosses in their own right .
and it says that the italian judicial system should start paying closer attention .
ernesto savona of the catholic university of milan , one of the report ’ s authors , says criminal organizations are becoming more appealing to women .
" criminal organizations are changing .
they ’ re producing less violence .
less people are killed in palermo and columbia and in others in proportion to how many were killed before .
they ’ re transforming the hierarchical organization into a more flexible one .
that means you ’ ll get more women having managerial roles .
we call them ' sweet criminal organizations ' , " he told deutsche welle .
from hard crime to financial crime as underworld activities have shifted to financial crimes , violence has dropped .
organizations have also become less centralized .
" that you find women having managerial roles in small criminal organization shows that it 's very flexible and not hierarchical , " savona explains .
" especially juvenile gangs .
sometimes you find a woman who has the leadership in the organization . "
the evolution of women in the criminal world is exactly the same as that of women in the business world .
pierluigi vigna , who heads up italy ’ s national anti-mafia office , says that with politically motivated crimes , women are just as willing to kill as men .
mafia women , however , aren ’ t as willing when it comes to business .
the researchers say that ’ s because women find murder for profit harder to justify .
and their roles reflect this difference in values .

with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week . they have names like " slammer , " " blaster , " or even " sasser . "
very often they 're programmed by college or high school students .
and even though experts see the signature of amateurs in their work , they still manage to cause billions of dollars in damage in industrial nations .
last week it was the " sasser " worm that wriggled its way around the world , bringing computer networks to a crawl or complete halt .
the consequences : hours-long delays at british airways .
finland 's sampo bank took the precautionary measure of closing its 130 branches because the anti-virus software on its computers had n't been updated yet .
at the european commission in brussels , 1,200 computers were affected by sasser , leading a spokesman to describe it as a " serious problem . "
worse yet , the british coast guard was forced to abandon its electronic navigation system and instead pull out paper maps .
german police on saturday morning arrested the suspected " cyber terrorist " believed to have foisted sasser on the world .
the 18-year-old high school student , who hails from a small town near bremen , confessed to the crime after his arrest , officials said .
officials from the state office of criminal investigation in the state of lower saxony first searched the home of the boy 's parents before making the arrest .
he was later released on bail .
luck in misfortune fortunately , sasser was one of the less harmful varieties of its species .
the worm , which infected millions of computers , did n't cause any direct damage other than the fact that it made computers crash and stalled networks .
" the damage is difficult to estimate because nothing has actually been destroyed in the sense of the word , " said michael dickopf of the federal office for information technology security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
" only companies ' productivity was affected , their networks were slowed down . "
despite all the media attention it got , " sasser " caused far less damage than its predecessors .
" the situation was nowhere near as dramatic as last august , when ' blaster ' was going around , " said rainer link of the virus protection software maker trend micro .
and even blaster , a so-called super worm , was more like a baby worm compared to the " love bug . "
the consulting firm computer economics estimates that that virus caused as much as € 9 billion in damage .
but sasser is especially sneaky : it does n't spread itself as an e-mail attachment .
sasser instead takes advantage of a weakness in the windows operating system to automatically install itself on unsuspecting computers .
" in the worst-case scenarios , people go online and are infected within 30 seconds , " link said .
private users are especially vulnerable to the virus .
the only possibility for repairing the security hole that enables sasser to attack is to download a software patch from the microsoft web site .
but , complains michael dickopf of bsi , " most private users are lacking the security needs .
they do n't download those kinds of updates . "
most firms , on the other hand , reacted quickly to the warning and downloaded the patch .
in the end , the biggest problems were encountered at firms where the microsoft patch was incompatible with the company network .
competition of the worst kind lately , there 's been an alarming trend in the increasing speed with which viruses reach their victims .
" the number of attacks has increased unbelievably , " said trend micro 's link .
" it 's an entirely new dimension . "
worms like sasser , which do n't require the help of e-mail to spread across the internet have reached distribution rates that would have been unimaginable earlier .
the time span between viruses is also shrinking .
" it always was a kind of competition , " he said .
" the virus programmers see the new anti-virus programs and then they try to get around them .
that creates a whole new challenge for us . "
in the case of sasser , it only took two weeks .

finland 's sampo bank took the precautionary measure of closing its 130 branches because the anti-virus software on its computers had n't been updated yet .
at the european commission in brussels , 1,200 computers were affected by sasser , leading a spokesman to describe it as a " serious problem . "
worse yet , the british coast guard was forced to abandon its electronic navigation system and instead pull out paper maps .
german police on saturday morning arrested the suspected " cyber terrorist " believed to have foisted sasser on the world .
the 18-year-old high school student , who hails from a small town near bremen , confessed to the crime after his arrest , officials said .
officials from the state office of criminal investigation in the state of lower saxony first searched the home of the boy 's parents before making the arrest .
he was later released on bail .
luck in misfortune fortunately , sasser was one of the less harmful varieties of its species .
the worm , which infected millions of computers , did n't cause any direct damage other than the fact that it made computers crash and stalled networks .
" the damage is difficult to estimate because nothing has actually been destroyed in the sense of the word , " said michael dickopf of the federal office for information technology security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
" only companies ' productivity was affected , their networks were slowed down . "
despite all the media attention it got , " sasser " caused far less damage than its predecessors .
" the situation was nowhere near as dramatic as last august , when ' blaster ' was going around , " said rainer link of the virus protection software maker trend micro .
and even blaster , a so-called super worm , was more like a baby worm compared to the " love bug . "
the consulting firm computer economics estimates that that virus caused as much as € 9 billion in damage .
but sasser is especially sneaky : it does n't spread itself as an e-mail attachment .
sasser instead takes advantage of a weakness in the windows operating system to automatically install itself on unsuspecting computers .
" in the worst-case scenarios , people go online and are infected within 30 seconds , " link said .
private users are especially vulnerable to the virus .
the only possibility for repairing the security hole that enables sasser to attack is to download a software patch from the microsoft web site .
but , complains michael dickopf of bsi , " most private users are lacking the security needs .
they do n't download those kinds of updates . "
most firms , on the other hand , reacted quickly to the warning and downloaded the patch .
in the end , the biggest problems were encountered at firms where the microsoft patch was incompatible with the company network .
competition of the worst kind lately , there 's been an alarming trend in the increasing speed with which viruses reach their victims .
" the number of attacks has increased unbelievably , " said trend micro 's link .
" it 's an entirely new dimension . "
worms like sasser , which do n't require the help of e-mail to spread across the internet have reached distribution rates that would have been unimaginable earlier .
the time span between viruses is also shrinking .
" it always was a kind of competition , " he said .
" the virus programmers see the new anti-virus programs and then they try to get around them .
that creates a whole new challenge for us . "
in the case of sasser , it only took two weeks .
on april 14 , microsoft issued a warning and by may 1 , the worm was already attacking . arend wulff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blackout - could it happen in germany ?

it is bremen 's fourth championship win in all following their triumphs in 1965 , 1988 and 1993 and will taste all the sweeter as it was clinched on bayern 's own patch .
" i think it is sensational what this team has achieved , " said a jubilant bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" the fact that uli hoeness -lrb- bayern general manager -rrb- congratulated us shows there is a mutual respect . "
bremen now have the chance of a league and cup double if they can defeat second division outfit alemannia aachen in the german cup final on may 26 in berlin .
a first-half goal blitz did the damage for bremen with croat ivan klasnic , frenchman johan micoud and brazilian ailton scoring inside 35 minutes .
when the title contenders were being discussed in pre-season , bayern , borussia dortmund and vfb stuttgart came to the fore , but not many pundits would have wagered on a team eliminated in the intertoto cup by austrian minnows sv pasching .
however , bremen have gone 23 games unbeaten to defy the odds and topple bayern - who they finished 23 points behind last season - with some adventurous football this term .
" sometimes you have lows in football , " said bayern chief ottmar hitzfeld . " it can not just be running around celebrating all the time .
" i have congratulated thomas schaaf as bremen played the best football this season . "
schaaf claimed bremen would attack from the first whistle in bavaria and he was good to his word as the visitors swamped bayern in the opening exchanges .
bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn insisted bremen were feeling the pressure before the match but those words came back to haunt him on 19 minutes with a calamitous error .
brazilian ailton fed strike partner ivan klasnic but kahn seemed to have the situation in hand reaching the ball first before inexplicably fumbling , allowing croat klasnic to slot home into an empty net .
" it is ironic that kahn - one of our best players this season - made the mistake , " pointed out hitzfeld .
it has been a difficult time for the 34-year-old international keeper , who conceded five goals in germany 's 5-1 thrashing by romania in bucharest , and things did not improve .
french international johan micoud lobbed him magnificently seven minutes later to make it 2-0 .
" we dedicate this title to our fantastic fans , " added micoud .
then in the 35th minute ailton notched his 27th goal of a productive campaign , curling a 25-yard shot into the top corner past the despairing kahn .
the travelling contingent of bremen supporters were in a state of delirium .
dutch international roy makaay reduced the arrears on 56 minutes after bremen switched off but it was just a momentary lapse as bremen held their nerve and dethroned bayern as german champions .
the only consolation for bayern , who have ended the season empty-handed , was that third-placed stuttgart did not take advantage of their slip-up tasting a 2-1 defeat at sv hamburg .

with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week . they have names like " slammer , " " blaster , " or even " sasser . "
very often they 're programmed by college or high school students .
and even though experts see the signature of amateurs in their work , they still manage to cause billions of dollars in damage in industrial nations .
last week it was the " sasser " worm that wriggled its way around the world , bringing computer networks to a crawl or complete halt .
the consequences : hours-long delays at british airways .
finland 's sampo bank took the precautionary measure of closing its 130 branches because the anti-virus software on its computers had n't been updated yet .
at the european commission in brussels , 1,200 computers were affected by sasser , leading a spokesman to describe it as a " serious problem . "

it is bremen 's fourth championship win in all following their triumphs in 1965 , 1988 and 1993 and will taste all the sweeter as it was clinched on bayern 's own patch .
" i think it is sensational what this team has achieved , " said a jubilant bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" the fact that uli hoeness -lrb- bayern general manager -rrb- congratulated us shows there is a mutual respect . "
bremen now have the chance of a league and cup double if they can defeat second division outfit alemannia aachen in the german cup final on may 26 in berlin .
a first-half goal blitz did the damage for bremen with croat ivan klasnic , frenchman johan micoud and brazilian ailton scoring inside 35 minutes .
when the title contenders were being discussed in pre-season , bayern , borussia dortmund and vfb stuttgart came to the fore , but not many pundits would have wagered on a team eliminated in the intertoto cup by austrian minnows sv pasching .
however , bremen have gone 23 games unbeaten to defy the odds and topple bayern - who they finished 23 points behind last season - with some adventurous football this term .
" sometimes you have lows in football , " said bayern chief ottmar hitzfeld . " it can not just be running around celebrating all the time .
" i have congratulated thomas schaaf as bremen played the best football this season . "
schaaf claimed bremen would attack from the first whistle in bavaria and he was good to his word as the visitors swamped bayern in the opening exchanges .
bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn insisted bremen were feeling the pressure before the match but those words came back to haunt him on 19 minutes with a calamitous error .
brazilian ailton fed strike partner ivan klasnic but kahn seemed to have the situation in hand reaching the ball first before inexplicably fumbling , allowing croat klasnic to slot home into an empty net .
" it is ironic that kahn - one of our best players this season - made the mistake , " pointed out hitzfeld .
it has been a difficult time for the 34-year-old international keeper , who conceded five goals in germany 's 5-1 thrashing by romania in bucharest , and things did not improve .
french international johan micoud lobbed him magnificently seven minutes later to make it 2-0 .
" we dedicate this title to our fantastic fans , " added micoud .
then in the 35th minute ailton notched his 27th goal of a productive campaign , curling a 25-yard shot into the top corner past the despairing kahn .
the travelling contingent of bremen supporters were in a state of delirium .
dutch international roy makaay reduced the arrears on 56 minutes after bremen switched off but it was just a momentary lapse as bremen held their nerve and dethroned bayern as german champions .
the only consolation for bayern , who have ended the season empty-handed , was that third-placed stuttgart did not take advantage of their slip-up tasting a 2-1 defeat at sv hamburg .
felix magath 's side will be kicking themselves as they could have moved to within one point of munich with victory .
borussia dortmund 's chances of playing european football in 2004/05 suffered a blow following a surprise 6-2 thumping by struggling hertha berlin in the capital .

a first-half goal blitz did the damage for bremen with croat ivan klasnic , frenchman johan micoud and brazilian ailton scoring inside 35 minutes .
when the title contenders were being discussed in pre-season , bayern , borussia dortmund and vfb stuttgart came to the fore , but not many pundits would have wagered on a team eliminated in the intertoto cup by austrian minnows sv pasching .
however , bremen have gone 23 games unbeaten to defy the odds and topple bayern - who they finished 23 points behind last season - with some adventurous football this term .
" sometimes you have lows in football , " said bayern chief ottmar hitzfeld . " it can not just be running around celebrating all the time .
" i have congratulated thomas schaaf as bremen played the best football this season . "
schaaf claimed bremen would attack from the first whistle in bavaria and he was good to his word as the visitors swamped bayern in the opening exchanges .
bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn insisted bremen were feeling the pressure before the match but those words came back to haunt him on 19 minutes with a calamitous error .
brazilian ailton fed strike partner ivan klasnic but kahn seemed to have the situation in hand reaching the ball first before inexplicably fumbling , allowing croat klasnic to slot home into an empty net .
" it is ironic that kahn - one of our best players this season - made the mistake , " pointed out hitzfeld .
it has been a difficult time for the 34-year-old international keeper , who conceded five goals in germany 's 5-1 thrashing by romania in bucharest , and things did not improve .
french international johan micoud lobbed him magnificently seven minutes later to make it 2-0 .
" we dedicate this title to our fantastic fans , " added micoud .
then in the 35th minute ailton notched his 27th goal of a productive campaign , curling a 25-yard shot into the top corner past the despairing kahn .
the travelling contingent of bremen supporters were in a state of delirium .
dutch international roy makaay reduced the arrears on 56 minutes after bremen switched off but it was just a momentary lapse as bremen held their nerve and dethroned bayern as german champions .
the only consolation for bayern , who have ended the season empty-handed , was that third-placed stuttgart did not take advantage of their slip-up tasting a 2-1 defeat at sv hamburg .

in 20 years , the vessel could shuttle satellites and humans to space . space researchers in bremen came a step closer this weekend to the creation of europe 's first reusable , unmanned space shuttle .
the so-called phoenix craft , a prototype of the future hopper space glider , landed safely at a testing ground after reaching speeds of 450 kilometers per hour in northern sweden on saturday .
bremen-based eads space transportation is developing the shuttle in the hopes that it will carry cargo and astronauts into space within the next 20 years .
the european space agency , which initiated the project , said the 90-second flight represents a further step towards europe 's possible manned space flights in the future .
the german-designed prototype was carried to a height of 2,400 meters by a helicopter .
it then glided back to earth without the use of a motor and without controls from the ground .
an onboard computer equipped with gps guided the phoenix to a perfect landing .
measuring just under 6 meters in length , phoenix is one-sixth the size of the planned hopper .
" everyone here is ecstatic , " johanna bergstroem-roos of the north european aerospace test range in kiruna , sweden , told the associated press .
" this gives us wind in our sails . "
a craft with artificial intelligence ?
but what really set the phoenix mission apart from others was the fact that it steered itself .
an onboard computer controlled the navigation of the craft by processing data from radar , laser-distance measurements and satellite navigation , which it then used to determine small changes of direction and altitude until it made its landing .
officials at eads space transportation also expressed elation .
" for the first time , we have proven that the automated landing of this type of aircraft is technically controllable , " said peter kyr , project manager for the phoenix program .
" this successful test flight is the decisive german contribution on the way to a future reusable space transporter , " said the firm 's president , josef kind .
the launcher of the future the european space agency and eads hope to complete development of hopper between 2015 and 2020 , when it would go into service as a replacement for the ariane 5 rocket , the workhorse launcher currently used by the european space program to send satellites and other payloads into orbit .
the hopper shuttle would fly payloads into space and then return to earth without any help from mission control .
the shuttle is being developed and constructed at eads ' bremen facilities .
so far , € 8.2 million has been invested in the project , with the city-state of bremen contributing € 4.3 million and an additional € 3.5 million coming from the german aerospace center .
three further tests are planned in the coming days. using data from the flights , researchers will optimize phoenix and prepare it for further tests at higher elevations .
drops are planned from as high as 25 kilometers using balloons or supersonic aircraft .
in the mid-term , eads also plans to outfit phoenix with its own engine .
before it is ready for prime time , the shuttle will have to be able to glide from an altitude of 130 kilometers . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links europe in space a dw-world special report on the european space program - from mars express to the aurora vision of manned space flights .

in 20 years , the vessel could shuttle satellites and humans to space . space researchers in bremen came a step closer this weekend to the creation of europe 's first reusable , unmanned space shuttle .
the so-called phoenix craft , a prototype of the future hopper space glider , landed safely at a testing ground after reaching speeds of 450 kilometers per hour in northern sweden on saturday .
bremen-based eads space transportation is developing the shuttle in the hopes that it will carry cargo and astronauts into space within the next 20 years .
the european space agency , which initiated the project , said the 90-second flight represents a further step towards europe 's possible manned space flights in the future .
the german-designed prototype was carried to a height of 2,400 meters by a helicopter .
it then glided back to earth without the use of a motor and without controls from the ground .
an onboard computer equipped with gps guided the phoenix to a perfect landing .
measuring just under 6 meters in length , phoenix is one-sixth the size of the planned hopper .
" everyone here is ecstatic , " johanna bergstroem-roos of the north european aerospace test range in kiruna , sweden , told the associated press .
" this gives us wind in our sails . "
a craft with artificial intelligence ?
but what really set the phoenix mission apart from others was the fact that it steered itself .
an onboard computer controlled the navigation of the craft by processing data from radar , laser-distance measurements and satellite navigation , which it then used to determine small changes of direction and altitude until it made its landing .
officials at eads space transportation also expressed elation .
" for the first time , we have proven that the automated landing of this type of aircraft is technically controllable , " said peter kyr , project manager for the phoenix program .
" this successful test flight is the decisive german contribution on the way to a future reusable space transporter , " said the firm 's president , josef kind .
the launcher of the future the european space agency and eads hope to complete development of hopper between 2015 and 2020 , when it would go into service as a replacement for the ariane 5 rocket , the workhorse launcher currently used by the european space program to send satellites and other payloads into orbit .
the hopper shuttle would fly payloads into space and then return to earth without any help from mission control .
the shuttle is being developed and constructed at eads ' bremen facilities .
so far , € 8.2 million has been invested in the project , with the city-state of bremen contributing € 4.3 million and an additional € 3.5 million coming from the german aerospace center .
three further tests are planned in the coming days. using data from the flights , researchers will optimize phoenix and prepare it for further tests at higher elevations .
drops are planned from as high as 25 kilometers using balloons or supersonic aircraft .
in the mid-term , eads also plans to outfit phoenix with its own engine .
before it is ready for prime time , the shuttle will have to be able to glide from an altitude of 130 kilometers . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links europe in space a dw-world special report on the european space program - from mars express to the aurora vision of manned space flights .

in italy , the first-ever study on women in italian organized crime reveals that women are rising up the ranks to leadership positions .
this is both because the mafia is changing , and women are changing the mafia . from la dolce vita , the sweet life , to the malavita , the underworld , the growing presence of women is being felt everywhere in italy .
until recently , this was almost unthinkable .
the first woman arrested for " criminal association " was just five years ago , in 1999 .
police have known that women play a supporting role within the mafia : as mothers , wives , and daughters , they 've carried out minor tasks .
filling in for locked up hubbies occasionally , women have even stepped in to run things temporarily when their men have been jailed or murdered .
but a new study shows that women within the mafia are rising through the ranks and becoming bosses in their own right .
and it says that the italian judicial system should start paying closer attention .
ernesto savona of the catholic university of milan , one of the report ’ s authors , says criminal organizations are becoming more appealing to women .
" criminal organizations are changing .
they ’ re producing less violence .
less people are killed in palermo and columbia and in others in proportion to how many were killed before .
they ’ re transforming the hierarchical organization into a more flexible one .
that means you ’ ll get more women having managerial roles .
we call them ' sweet criminal organizations ' , " he told deutsche welle .
from hard crime to financial crime as underworld activities have shifted to financial crimes , violence has dropped .
organizations have also become less centralized .
" that you find women having managerial roles in small criminal organization shows that it 's very flexible and not hierarchical , " savona explains .
" especially juvenile gangs .
sometimes you find a woman who has the leadership in the organization . "
the evolution of women in the criminal world is exactly the same as that of women in the business world .
pierluigi vigna , who heads up italy ’ s national anti-mafia office , says that with politically motivated crimes , women are just as willing to kill as men .
mafia women , however , aren ’ t as willing when it comes to business .
the researchers say that ’ s because women find murder for profit harder to justify .
and their roles reflect this difference in values .
" they ’ re mainly found in areas that require a certain finesse , " vigna explains , " like money laundering rather than murder . "
while there are no statistics on the exact number of women in the italian mafia , the researchers say that more women in key positions are being arrested .
in april , a 28-year-old sicilian woman was found guilty of 50 percent ownership of a thriving underworld business .
this may not be this kind of emancipation feminists had in mind , but it does show that women in italy need to be taken seriously in all facets of life . megan williams -lrb- dw-radio -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

in italy , the first-ever study on women in italian organized crime reveals that women are rising up the ranks to leadership positions .
this is both because the mafia is changing , and women are changing the mafia . from la dolce vita , the sweet life , to the malavita , the underworld , the growing presence of women is being felt everywhere in italy .
until recently , this was almost unthinkable .
the first woman arrested for " criminal association " was just five years ago , in 1999 .
police have known that women play a supporting role within the mafia : as mothers , wives , and daughters , they 've carried out minor tasks .
filling in for locked up hubbies occasionally , women have even stepped in to run things temporarily when their men have been jailed or murdered .
but a new study shows that women within the mafia are rising through the ranks and becoming bosses in their own right .
and it says that the italian judicial system should start paying closer attention .
ernesto savona of the catholic university of milan , one of the report ’ s authors , says criminal organizations are becoming more appealing to women .
" criminal organizations are changing .
they ’ re producing less violence .
less people are killed in palermo and columbia and in others in proportion to how many were killed before .
they ’ re transforming the hierarchical organization into a more flexible one .
that means you ’ ll get more women having managerial roles .
we call them ' sweet criminal organizations ' , " he told deutsche welle .
from hard crime to financial crime as underworld activities have shifted to financial crimes , violence has dropped .
organizations have also become less centralized .
" that you find women having managerial roles in small criminal organization shows that it 's very flexible and not hierarchical , " savona explains .
" especially juvenile gangs .
sometimes you find a woman who has the leadership in the organization . "
the evolution of women in the criminal world is exactly the same as that of women in the business world .
pierluigi vigna , who heads up italy ’ s national anti-mafia office , says that with politically motivated crimes , women are just as willing to kill as men .
mafia women , however , aren ’ t as willing when it comes to business .
the researchers say that ’ s because women find murder for profit harder to justify .
and their roles reflect this difference in values .
" they ’ re mainly found in areas that require a certain finesse , " vigna explains , " like money laundering rather than murder . "
while there are no statistics on the exact number of women in the italian mafia , the researchers say that more women in key positions are being arrested .
in april , a 28-year-old sicilian woman was found guilty of 50 percent ownership of a thriving underworld business .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga review 2003/04 another easy bundesliga title for bayern ?
tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.05.2004 werder bremen clinch german championship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's players celebrate their upset defeat over fc bayern munchen the northern german city 's football team take the title after a sensational 3-1 win over bayer munich on saturday . werder bremen lifted their first german championship in 11 years with a sensational 3-1 win over reigning champions bayern munich at the olympic stadium on saturday . bremen move nine points ahead of holders bayern , who suffered their first home defeat of the season , with two games left to play .
it is bremen 's fourth championship win in all following their triumphs in 1965 , 1988 and 1993 and will taste all the sweeter as it was clinched on bayern 's own patch .
" i think it is sensational what this team has achieved , " said a jubilant bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" the fact that uli hoeness -lrb- bayern general manager -rrb- congratulated us shows there is a mutual respect . "
bremen now have the chance of a league and cup double if they can defeat second division outfit alemannia aachen in the german cup final on may 26 in berlin .
a first-half goal blitz did the damage for bremen with croat ivan klasnic , frenchman johan micoud and brazilian ailton scoring inside 35 minutes .
when the title contenders were being discussed in pre-season , bayern , borussia dortmund and vfb stuttgart came to the fore , but not many pundits would have wagered on a team eliminated in the intertoto cup by austrian minnows sv pasching .
however , bremen have gone 23 games unbeaten to defy the odds and topple bayern - who they finished 23 points behind last season - with some adventurous football this term .
" sometimes you have lows in football , " said bayern chief ottmar hitzfeld . " it can not just be running around celebrating all the time .
" i have congratulated thomas schaaf as bremen played the best football this season . "
schaaf claimed bremen would attack from the first whistle in bavaria and he was good to his word as the visitors swamped bayern in the opening exchanges .
bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn insisted bremen were feeling the pressure before the match but those words came back to haunt him on 19 minutes with a calamitous error .
brazilian ailton fed strike partner ivan klasnic but kahn seemed to have the situation in hand reaching the ball first before inexplicably fumbling , allowing croat klasnic to slot home into an empty net .
" it is ironic that kahn - one of our best players this season - made the mistake , " pointed out hitzfeld .
it has been a difficult time for the 34-year-old international keeper , who conceded five goals in germany 's 5-1 thrashing by romania in bucharest , and things did not improve .
french international johan micoud lobbed him magnificently seven minutes later to make it 2-0 .
" we dedicate this title to our fantastic fans , " added micoud .
then in the 35th minute ailton notched his 27th goal of a productive campaign , curling a 25-yard shot into the top corner past the despairing kahn .
the travelling contingent of bremen supporters were in a state of delirium .
dutch international roy makaay reduced the arrears on 56 minutes after bremen switched off but it was just a momentary lapse as bremen held their nerve and dethroned bayern as german champions .
the only consolation for bayern , who have ended the season empty-handed , was that third-placed stuttgart did not take advantage of their slip-up tasting a 2-1 defeat at sv hamburg .
felix magath 's side will be kicking themselves as they could have moved to within one point of munich with victory .
borussia dortmund 's chances of playing european football in 2004/05 suffered a blow following a surprise 6-2 thumping by struggling hertha berlin in the capital .

with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week . they have names like " slammer , " " blaster , " or even " sasser . "
very often they 're programmed by college or high school students .
and even though experts see the signature of amateurs in their work , they still manage to cause billions of dollars in damage in industrial nations .
last week it was the " sasser " worm that wriggled its way around the world , bringing computer networks to a crawl or complete halt .
the consequences : hours-long delays at british airways .
finland 's sampo bank took the precautionary measure of closing its 130 branches because the anti-virus software on its computers had n't been updated yet .
at the european commission in brussels , 1,200 computers were affected by sasser , leading a spokesman to describe it as a " serious problem . "
worse yet , the british coast guard was forced to abandon its electronic navigation system and instead pull out paper maps .
german police on saturday morning arrested the suspected " cyber terrorist " believed to have foisted sasser on the world .
the 18-year-old high school student , who hails from a small town near bremen , confessed to the crime after his arrest , officials said .
officials from the state office of criminal investigation in the state of lower saxony first searched the home of the boy 's parents before making the arrest .
he was later released on bail .
luck in misfortune fortunately , sasser was one of the less harmful varieties of its species .
the worm , which infected millions of computers , did n't cause any direct damage other than the fact that it made computers crash and stalled networks .
" the damage is difficult to estimate because nothing has actually been destroyed in the sense of the word , " said michael dickopf of the federal office for information technology security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
" only companies ' productivity was affected , their networks were slowed down . "
despite all the media attention it got , " sasser " caused far less damage than its predecessors .
" the situation was nowhere near as dramatic as last august , when ' blaster ' was going around , " said rainer link of the virus protection software maker trend micro .
and even blaster , a so-called super worm , was more like a baby worm compared to the " love bug . "
the consulting firm computer economics estimates that that virus caused as much as € 9 billion in damage .
but sasser is especially sneaky : it does n't spread itself as an e-mail attachment .
sasser instead takes advantage of a weakness in the windows operating system to automatically install itself on unsuspecting computers .
" in the worst-case scenarios , people go online and are infected within 30 seconds , " link said .
private users are especially vulnerable to the virus .
the only possibility for repairing the security hole that enables sasser to attack is to download a software patch from the microsoft web site .
but , complains michael dickopf of bsi , " most private users are lacking the security needs .
they do n't download those kinds of updates . "
most firms , on the other hand , reacted quickly to the warning and downloaded the patch .
in the end , the biggest problems were encountered at firms where the microsoft patch was incompatible with the company network .
competition of the worst kind lately , there 's been an alarming trend in the increasing speed with which viruses reach their victims .
" the number of attacks has increased unbelievably , " said trend micro 's link .
" it 's an entirely new dimension . "
worms like sasser , which do n't require the help of e-mail to spread across the internet have reached distribution rates that would have been unimaginable earlier .
the time span between viruses is also shrinking .
" it always was a kind of competition , " he said .
" the virus programmers see the new anti-virus programs and then they try to get around them .
that creates a whole new challenge for us . "
in the case of sasser , it only took two weeks .

with the arrest of an 18-year-old high school student , police believe they have found the man behind a computer virus that brought businesses and government offices around europe to a halt last week . they have names like " slammer , " " blaster , " or even " sasser . "
very often they 're programmed by college or high school students .
and even though experts see the signature of amateurs in their work , they still manage to cause billions of dollars in damage in industrial nations .
last week it was the " sasser " worm that wriggled its way around the world , bringing computer networks to a crawl or complete halt .
the consequences : hours-long delays at british airways .
finland 's sampo bank took the precautionary measure of closing its 130 branches because the anti-virus software on its computers had n't been updated yet .
at the european commission in brussels , 1,200 computers were affected by sasser , leading a spokesman to describe it as a " serious problem . "
worse yet , the british coast guard was forced to abandon its electronic navigation system and instead pull out paper maps .
german police on saturday morning arrested the suspected " cyber terrorist " believed to have foisted sasser on the world .
the 18-year-old high school student , who hails from a small town near bremen , confessed to the crime after his arrest , officials said .
officials from the state office of criminal investigation in the state of lower saxony first searched the home of the boy 's parents before making the arrest .
he was later released on bail .
luck in misfortune fortunately , sasser was one of the less harmful varieties of its species .
the worm , which infected millions of computers , did n't cause any direct damage other than the fact that it made computers crash and stalled networks .
" the damage is difficult to estimate because nothing has actually been destroyed in the sense of the word , " said michael dickopf of the federal office for information technology security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
" only companies ' productivity was affected , their networks were slowed down . "
despite all the media attention it got , " sasser " caused far less damage than its predecessors .
" the situation was nowhere near as dramatic as last august , when ' blaster ' was going around , " said rainer link of the virus protection software maker trend micro .
and even blaster , a so-called super worm , was more like a baby worm compared to the " love bug . "
the consulting firm computer economics estimates that that virus caused as much as € 9 billion in damage .
but sasser is especially sneaky : it does n't spread itself as an e-mail attachment .
sasser instead takes advantage of a weakness in the windows operating system to automatically install itself on unsuspecting computers .
" in the worst-case scenarios , people go online and are infected within 30 seconds , " link said .
private users are especially vulnerable to the virus .
the only possibility for repairing the security hole that enables sasser to attack is to download a software patch from the microsoft web site .
but , complains michael dickopf of bsi , " most private users are lacking the security needs .
they do n't download those kinds of updates . "
most firms , on the other hand , reacted quickly to the warning and downloaded the patch .
in the end , the biggest problems were encountered at firms where the microsoft patch was incompatible with the company network .
competition of the worst kind lately , there 's been an alarming trend in the increasing speed with which viruses reach their victims .
" the number of attacks has increased unbelievably , " said trend micro 's link .
" it 's an entirely new dimension . "
worms like sasser , which do n't require the help of e-mail to spread across the internet have reached distribution rates that would have been unimaginable earlier .
the time span between viruses is also shrinking .
" it always was a kind of competition , " he said .
" the virus programmers see the new anti-virus programs and then they try to get around them .
that creates a whole new challenge for us . "
in the case of sasser , it only took two weeks .
on april 14 , microsoft issued a warning and by may 1 , the worm was already attacking . arend wulff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blackout - could it happen in germany ?

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.05.2004 werder bremen clinch german championship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's players celebrate their upset defeat over fc bayern munchen the northern german city 's football team take the title after a sensational 3-1 win over bayer munich on saturday . werder bremen lifted their first german championship in 11 years with a sensational 3-1 win over reigning champions bayern munich at the olympic stadium on saturday . bremen move nine points ahead of holders bayern , who suffered their first home defeat of the season , with two games left to play .
it is bremen 's fourth championship win in all following their triumphs in 1965 , 1988 and 1993 and will taste all the sweeter as it was clinched on bayern 's own patch .
" i think it is sensational what this team has achieved , " said a jubilant bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" the fact that uli hoeness -lrb- bayern general manager -rrb- congratulated us shows there is a mutual respect . "
bremen now have the chance of a league and cup double if they can defeat second division outfit alemannia aachen in the german cup final on may 26 in berlin .
a first-half goal blitz did the damage for bremen with croat ivan klasnic , frenchman johan micoud and brazilian ailton scoring inside 35 minutes .
when the title contenders were being discussed in pre-season , bayern , borussia dortmund and vfb stuttgart came to the fore , but not many pundits would have wagered on a team eliminated in the intertoto cup by austrian minnows sv pasching .
however , bremen have gone 23 games unbeaten to defy the odds and topple bayern - who they finished 23 points behind last season - with some adventurous football this term .
" sometimes you have lows in football , " said bayern chief ottmar hitzfeld . " it can not just be running around celebrating all the time .
" i have congratulated thomas schaaf as bremen played the best football this season . "
schaaf claimed bremen would attack from the first whistle in bavaria and he was good to his word as the visitors swamped bayern in the opening exchanges .
bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn insisted bremen were feeling the pressure before the match but those words came back to haunt him on 19 minutes with a calamitous error .
brazilian ailton fed strike partner ivan klasnic but kahn seemed to have the situation in hand reaching the ball first before inexplicably fumbling , allowing croat klasnic to slot home into an empty net .
" it is ironic that kahn - one of our best players this season - made the mistake , " pointed out hitzfeld .
it has been a difficult time for the 34-year-old international keeper , who conceded five goals in germany 's 5-1 thrashing by romania in bucharest , and things did not improve .
french international johan micoud lobbed him magnificently seven minutes later to make it 2-0 .
" we dedicate this title to our fantastic fans , " added micoud .
then in the 35th minute ailton notched his 27th goal of a productive campaign , curling a 25-yard shot into the top corner past the despairing kahn .
the travelling contingent of bremen supporters were in a state of delirium .
dutch international roy makaay reduced the arrears on 56 minutes after bremen switched off but it was just a momentary lapse as bremen held their nerve and dethroned bayern as german champions .
the only consolation for bayern , who have ended the season empty-handed , was that third-placed stuttgart did not take advantage of their slip-up tasting a 2-1 defeat at sv hamburg .
felix magath 's side will be kicking themselves as they could have moved to within one point of munich with victory .
borussia dortmund 's chances of playing european football in 2004/05 suffered a blow following a surprise 6-2 thumping by struggling hertha berlin in the capital .

it is bremen 's fourth championship win in all following their triumphs in 1965 , 1988 and 1993 and will taste all the sweeter as it was clinched on bayern 's own patch .
" i think it is sensational what this team has achieved , " said a jubilant bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" the fact that uli hoeness -lrb- bayern general manager -rrb- congratulated us shows there is a mutual respect . "
bremen now have the chance of a league and cup double if they can defeat second division outfit alemannia aachen in the german cup final on may 26 in berlin .
a first-half goal blitz did the damage for bremen with croat ivan klasnic , frenchman johan micoud and brazilian ailton scoring inside 35 minutes .
when the title contenders were being discussed in pre-season , bayern , borussia dortmund and vfb stuttgart came to the fore , but not many pundits would have wagered on a team eliminated in the intertoto cup by austrian minnows sv pasching .
however , bremen have gone 23 games unbeaten to defy the odds and topple bayern - who they finished 23 points behind last season - with some adventurous football this term .
" sometimes you have lows in football , " said bayern chief ottmar hitzfeld . " it can not just be running around celebrating all the time .
" i have congratulated thomas schaaf as bremen played the best football this season . "
schaaf claimed bremen would attack from the first whistle in bavaria and he was good to his word as the visitors swamped bayern in the opening exchanges .
bayern captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn insisted bremen were feeling the pressure before the match but those words came back to haunt him on 19 minutes with a calamitous error .
brazilian ailton fed strike partner ivan klasnic but kahn seemed to have the situation in hand reaching the ball first before inexplicably fumbling , allowing croat klasnic to slot home into an empty net .
" it is ironic that kahn - one of our best players this season - made the mistake , " pointed out hitzfeld .
it has been a difficult time for the 34-year-old international keeper , who conceded five goals in germany 's 5-1 thrashing by romania in bucharest , and things did not improve .
french international johan micoud lobbed him magnificently seven minutes later to make it 2-0 .
" we dedicate this title to our fantastic fans , " added micoud .
then in the 35th minute ailton notched his 27th goal of a productive campaign , curling a 25-yard shot into the top corner past the despairing kahn .
the travelling contingent of bremen supporters were in a state of delirium .
dutch international roy makaay reduced the arrears on 56 minutes after bremen switched off but it was just a momentary lapse as bremen held their nerve and dethroned bayern as german champions .
the only consolation for bayern , who have ended the season empty-handed , was that third-placed stuttgart did not take advantage of their slip-up tasting a 2-1 defeat at sv hamburg .

bbc news online take a look back at his long career .
alan bennett remains one of britain 's most popular and prolific authors and playwrights .
his rise to fame began in 1960 when he appeared at the edinburgh festival alongside dudley moore , peter cooke and jonathan miller .
they performed a satirical revue , called beyond the fringe , which bennett also co-wrote .
the show was so popular that it went on to become a massive success playing to packed houses in london and on broadway in new york .
writing for the stage was the direction his early career took , but it was not long before leeds-born bennett also turned his attention to television .
bennett starred in on the margin with virginia stride and john sergeant with his observant eye for the absurdities of modern life and a sharp ear for dialogue , his work transferred easily and effectively onto the screen , with some of his best ever work written for the small screen .
the critically acclaimed bbc series on the margin began in 1966 and effortlessly weaved satire into apparently innocuous comedy sketches , poems and songs .
but it was his talking heads monologues for bbc television in the late 1980s which propelled bennett into the national consciousness .
his gripping stories of sedate suburban existence combined with his ability to reach out and touch every human emotion made compelling anecdotes .
highlights of the first series in 1987 included thora hird in a cream cracker under the settee and a chip in the sugar , the role that bennett himself played .
' incomparable ' peter hepple , theatre critic for the stage , told bbc news online bennett 's character-driven monologues were his masterpiece .
he said : " bennett 's stage plays are extremely appealing , not only to lovers of the theatre , but to people who just like his work .
" he is an intellectual , but not an intellectual writer and very down to earth with it .
thora hird won a bafta for a cream cracker under the settee " people can relate to his character-driven stories because they are based on real life .
" the lady in the van was based on a woman who actually who lived in a van in his street for 15 years .
" i do n't think there is anyone who can write like him .
he is incomparable to anyone else . "
bennett 's collection of prose writings and reminiscences , called writing home , went on to become a bestseller .
and during the 1990s , his vivid adaptation of wind in the willows , which received rave reviews at the national theatre , was dramatised for bbc radio 4 .
more recently , ten autobiographical monologues , in a series called telling tales , were also broadcast on radio 4 .
they featured snapshots of childhood memories from his schooldays to life as an undergraduate in oxford .
but despite his successes in later life , the son of a yorkshire butcher came from more humble beginnings .
beyond the fringe launched the careers of all its stars born in leeds on 9 may 1934 to working-class parents , bennett was a pupil at leeds modern school and went on to win a scholarship to study at exeter college , oxford at 20 .
after getting a first-class degree , his appeared destined for life as a history don , but the roaring success of beyond the fringe took him down a different path .
but bennett never lost his common touch or sense of roots that has defined his distinguished work and taken him to the top of his profession .
one of his greatest achievements came with his 1991 play the madness of george iii which was a critical and box office hit .
three years later , his adaptation for the big screen was equally lauded with an oscar nomination .
as he begins his 71st year , his new play the history boys returns to his yorkshire roots .
set in a grammar school in the early 1980s , the nostalgic play opens at the national theatre on 19 may .

bbc news online take a look back at his long career .
alan bennett remains one of britain 's most popular and prolific authors and playwrights .
his rise to fame began in 1960 when he appeared at the edinburgh festival alongside dudley moore , peter cooke and jonathan miller .
they performed a satirical revue , called beyond the fringe , which bennett also co-wrote .
the show was so popular that it went on to become a massive success playing to packed houses in london and on broadway in new york .
writing for the stage was the direction his early career took , but it was not long before leeds-born bennett also turned his attention to television .
bennett starred in on the margin with virginia stride and john sergeant with his observant eye for the absurdities of modern life and a sharp ear for dialogue , his work transferred easily and effectively onto the screen , with some of his best ever work written for the small screen .
the critically acclaimed bbc series on the margin began in 1966 and effortlessly weaved satire into apparently innocuous comedy sketches , poems and songs .
but it was his talking heads monologues for bbc television in the late 1980s which propelled bennett into the national consciousness .
his gripping stories of sedate suburban existence combined with his ability to reach out and touch every human emotion made compelling anecdotes .
highlights of the first series in 1987 included thora hird in a cream cracker under the settee and a chip in the sugar , the role that bennett himself played .
' incomparable ' peter hepple , theatre critic for the stage , told bbc news online bennett 's character-driven monologues were his masterpiece .
he said : " bennett 's stage plays are extremely appealing , not only to lovers of the theatre , but to people who just like his work .

millions of people in the coastal city are being left without water supplies for twelve hours every night between 1700 and 0500 .
the restrictions are likely to last through peru 's winter until december .
peru 's state-run water company , sedapal , was forced to restrict its supplies because of exceptionally low rainfall in the andes .
lima is on the edge of the pacific ocean , but the coastal strip is desert and the city 's eight million people get their water from the mountains over 160km -lrb- 100 miles -rrb- away .
sedapal president jorge villacorta said water levels in the high altitude reservoirs had fallen to 165 million cubic metres , 120 million less than in a normal year .
mr villacorta said people in lima currently used twice as much as the world health organisation deems necessary for personal use .
but he knows it is not just up to the city 's population to reduce the amount of water they use .
sedapal also needs to reduce its so-called non-revenue water - the 38 % of its supplies that is lost mainly through leakage and illegal use .
poor worst affected " people need to lose less and leak less water in their houses , " mr villacorta said .
" we need a hundred more wells and we need to build our famous new reservoir project , called marcapomacocha 2 , which will bring an additional 6.5 cubic metres a second .
so we need to consolidate supply and optimise demand . "
around five million people in lima have cisterns and tanks .
this means they usually have an uninterrupted supply of water , even when the main taps are turned off during the night , when demand for water is at its lowest .
that still leaves three million people without water for twelve hours at a time .
the majority of them are the city 's poor .
" it 's very bad for us until december .
the government needs to provide us with a solution , " said one resident .
" when we 've got water , we mostly use it to bathe for hygiene purposes , but without water , what are we supposed to do ? " asked another .
mr villacorta says sedapal is planning to equip lima with hundreds of new wells and build another reservoir to catch the rains further up the mountains .
but with more droughts predicted for next year , lima 's residents could be in for another testing time .

millions of people in the coastal city are being left without water supplies for twelve hours every night between 1700 and 0500 .
the restrictions are likely to last through peru 's winter until december .
peru 's state-run water company , sedapal , was forced to restrict its supplies because of exceptionally low rainfall in the andes .
lima is on the edge of the pacific ocean , but the coastal strip is desert and the city 's eight million people get their water from the mountains over 160km -lrb- 100 miles -rrb- away .
sedapal president jorge villacorta said water levels in the high altitude reservoirs had fallen to 165 million cubic metres , 120 million less than in a normal year .
mr villacorta said people in lima currently used twice as much as the world health organisation deems necessary for personal use .
but he knows it is not just up to the city 's population to reduce the amount of water they use .
sedapal also needs to reduce its so-called non-revenue water - the 38 % of its supplies that is lost mainly through leakage and illegal use .
poor worst affected " people need to lose less and leak less water in their houses , " mr villacorta said .
" we need a hundred more wells and we need to build our famous new reservoir project , called marcapomacocha 2 , which will bring an additional 6.5 cubic metres a second .
so we need to consolidate supply and optimise demand . "
around five million people in lima have cisterns and tanks .
this means they usually have an uninterrupted supply of water , even when the main taps are turned off during the night , when demand for water is at its lowest .
that still leaves three million people without water for twelve hours at a time .
the majority of them are the city 's poor .
" it 's very bad for us until december .
the government needs to provide us with a solution , " said one resident .
" when we 've got water , we mostly use it to bathe for hygiene purposes , but without water , what are we supposed to do ? " asked another .
mr villacorta says sedapal is planning to equip lima with hundreds of new wells and build another reservoir to catch the rains further up the mountains .
but with more droughts predicted for next year , lima 's residents could be in for another testing time .

officials said one boat was found with protected fish on board , and that another had cut loose a net just before they boarded the vessel .
fisheries officials say the net was was illegal , as its mesh was too small under international regulations .
the net was retrieved after a 30-hour search of the ocean floor in the grand banks area of the north atlantic .
canada 's department of fisheries and oceans said 65 % of the fish found in the net were from species protected under a fishing moratorium " namely cod , american plaice and red fish " .
' serious infractions ' fisheries and oceans minister geoff regan said the net from the ship , the brites , " provides clear and tangible evidence of serious fishing infractions " .
the ministry showed pictures of the net and its catch on its website .
the ship 's portuguese captain says the net got stuck on the bottom of the ocean and broke off shortly before canadian fisheries officers boarded the vessel .
these irresponsible actions have a harmful impact on the health of fishery resources and the communities that rely on them here in canada and in other fishing nations canadian fisheries minister geoff regan the canadians say the net was clearly cut .
but portugal rejected the claims at the highest level .
" there were no irregularities , " said foreign minister teresa gouveia .
the brites was one of seven ships inspected last week just outside canada 's 200-mile waters .
another vessel was cited for two violations , including fishing for banned species .
enforcement within its waters , canada has strictly enforced a fishing moratorium for cod and other endangered fish .
the bbc 's lee carter says canada has often protested to the european union and the governments of spain and portugal that its vessels routinely break the rules in the north atlantic .
mr regan said commercial fishing for cod and american plaice has been banned for a decade because stocks were so weak in the grand banks .
" i can not stress enough the damage caused by foreign overfishing , " he said .
" these irresponsible actions have a harmful impact on the health of fishery resources and the communities that rely on them here in canada and in other fishing nations . "

officers from central scotland police , strathclyde police and northern constabulary will be stopping motorcyclists at tyndrum .
it is an area which is very popular with bike enthusiasts .
speed checks will be done , riders who travel inappropriately will be stopped and machines will be checked for small , hard-to-read registration plates .
the exercise follows the recent death of a 32-year-old motorcyclist after a crash with three other bikes last month on the stirling - dumbarton road .
the biker was left with serious injuries and later died in hospital .
the issue of registration plates , which are made purposely small so speed cameras can not read them , has traditionally been dealt with through the vehicle defect rectification scheme .
it allowed offenders the opportunity to rectify the offence within 21 days to avoid prosecution .
our aim is to make the community as safe as possible and the message is clear - if you choose to break the law then you will be dealt with accordingly inspector graeme allan central scotland police however , this process was not working and the policy was changed to allow police officers to issue £ 30 fixed penalty tickets .
the police will also make checks for stolen bikes and equipment and for those already convicted of road traffic offences .
central scotland police covers several hundred square miles of rural area , stretching from strathblane to tyndrum which includes some of the most popular motorcycling routes in the central belt .
inspector graeme allan , from the force 's road policing unit , said : " we welcome all responsible motorcyclists and other road users .
" unfortunately we have had to deal with more than our fair share of injury and fatal motorcycle road crashes in recent years .
" we have also had an increase in the numbers of motorcyclists travelling at high speeds and riding in an inappropriate manner and we are keen to get the safety message out there in an effort to reduce accidents .
additional training " we will do this using both education and enforcement . "
also in operation this summer is the bikesafe scotland campaign which actively encourages motorcyclists to participate in additional training , particularly if someone is a complete beginner or is coming back to motorcycling after an absence .
all of scotland 's police forces will be involved in that campaign .
inspector allan added : " we appreciate the majority of motorcyclists in our area act in a responsible law abiding manner and it is the ' minority ' that spoil it for the majority .
it is this ' minority ' that we will target in terms of law enforcement .
" our communities rely on the large numbers of visitors that come here to enjoy themselves and we welcome them all .
" our aim is to make the community as safe as possible and the message is clear - if you choose to break the law then you will be dealt with accordingly . "
