the difficulty of letting go was largely the result of the d-mark 's success story .
the first d-mark bills printed for the currency reform caused an immensely dynamic boom in postwar germany .
the currency reform , the deutsche mark and the so-called " economic miracle " in the 1950s and ' 60s are inextricably linked to each other in the minds of the germans . in the beginning , germany profited from the fact that other countries viewed the deutsche mark with distrust and that it was chronically undervalued for years .
that helped the german economy achieve huge success in exports and led to full employment and a labor shortage that resulted in recruiting guest workers from greece , portugal , turkey and other southern european countries - practically inconceivable today . legendary stability and for 50 years the deutsche mark survived many a storm , including the oil price shocks during the 1970s and the two-digit salary increases demanded by trade unions that wanted to ensure workers profited as much as possible from the new prosperity .

the euro has neither made cars nor washing machines more expensive - at the most it 's effected food , drink and some services .

and they can enjoy much cheaper holidays in countries using the us dollar or that tie their currencies to the dollar - though this has less to do with the strong euros than with the weak dollar . spurring reliability all in all , germans consider the mark history , and they do just fine with the euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an audi assembly line in györ , hungary with one exception .

but instead of focusing on innovation , quality and efficiency they seem to have shifted the rat race to wages , working hours and working conditions more and more germans are expected to work longer hours for less money to preserve their jobs .

now , as you know , we have n't found little green men on the red planet .
but this year , a mars rover took a small step on the planet 's soil and made a giant leap for mars exploration : very strong evidence that , in the past , at least part of mars was " drenched with water . "
that means mars was the kind of place , maybe like that back bottom shelf of your refrigerator , where life might have had a chance to flourish .
the mars rover , from nasa , is called " opportunity " , and at the max planck institute for chemistry -lrb- mpic -rrb- , in mainz , germany , scientists built the machine which measured the chemical composition of dust and stones where opportunity rolled .
it 's named the alpha particle x-ray spectrometer , but you can just call it apxs , or the " good nose " -lrb- spürnase -rrb- , as they call it in mainz .
here 's a picture ; the good nose is the round piece staring out from the rover .
bildunterschrift : mars apxs this friendly looking little machine can handle some tough environments , like rocky outcroppings on the martian surface below -500c .
to tell us about the chemistry of mars , the good nose sends out alpha particles and x-rays and senses the characteristic x-rays that are scattered back from the dust or rocks .
you 'll hear more about those when you click on the audio interview below with dr. lugmair , whose group at the mpic built the apxs .
one of the objects that the good nose sniffed at were the so-called " blueberries " – those are small berry-shaped rocks which were found in a depression on a martian rock , called the " berry bowl " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mars blueberries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mars blueberries closeup it turned out that inside the " blueberries " , there was something that you would n't find in real blueberries : hematite , a kind of iron mineral .
where there 's hematite , there 's probably been water .
if you want to know why , dr. günter lugmair will tell you – and about how the good nose found it and other interesting objects . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german science weekly highlight -11 seeing your cells in multicolour www-links max planck society for the advancement of the sciences for more on this and other research , visit the english language homepage of the max planck society nasa mars rover missions to the nasa homepage of the mars rover missions 9799 dw-tv europe live people and politics - the political magazine we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

none of the members had 100 percent immunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former goalie coach sepp maier -lrb- back -rrb- got his pink slip for taking sides in keeper feud he tossed long-time goalkeeping coach , sepp maier , who had sided with number one keeper , oliver kahn , in his public feud with rival jens lehmann .
keeping true to form in the rejuvenation process , klinsmann hired his teammate from the 1996 european cup champions , andreas köpke , to take over as goalie trainer .
meanwhile kahn had to hand over the captain 's armband to midfielder micahel ballack . " king kahn 's " undisputed standing as the top goalkeeper was also thrown into doubt , although it is still unclear who could threaten him .
lehmann is sitting on the bench at his club arsenal london , and many think stuttgart 's timo hilderbrand is too young . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didi hamann could be a victim of klinsmann 's youth craze veterans like dieter hamann and oliver neuville -lrb- both 31 -rrb- have completely fallen off the radar screen , having yet to play a match under klinsmann . " certainly they still have a chance , " klinsmann told a news conference , only then to sign the players ' death sentence on the squad by saying the " fact of the matter is that the players who have recently been on the team have a slight advantage . " bring in the new what is bad news for the experienced players is good news for young talent like patrick owomoyela , per mertesacker , frank fahrenhorst , roberth huth , thomas hitzlsperger .
klinsmann has given them the chance to prove themselves on the field . with so many changes , casual spectators need a roster in their hand to know who 's who on the team .
in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung , klinsmann said there are 30-35 candidates and cuts for the world cup squad will be tough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans listen even when former great franz beckenbauer is speaking with a shoe despite a great start for klinsmann 's team - five wins , one draw and the loss to south korea - it would be an exaggeration to say this team is up there with the best .
in his column for the tabloid bild , former german great franz beckenbauer cautioned against getting too euphoric .
after all , the match against brazil was the only one against a strong opponent . klinsmann , the eternal optimist , thinks differently .
when asked by the süddeutsche where germany stood internationally , he responded that his team was among the top six to eight teams .
but then such enthusiasm comes easily when he spends his christmas holidays in the california sun while his players return to cold and dreary germany . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsi 's squad dismantles thais the german national soccer team ended its three-game asian tour with an easy 5-1 victory over thailand .

but experts said that the eu neglects the victims . frattini was responding to a report by a panel of experts on people smuggling who recommended improved coordination between national and eu level authorities . " we are obliged to pursue human trafficking from a moral as well as a security perspective , " the former italian foreign minister said .
" trafficking of human beings is a crime which often acts as a door to other serious crimes , such as … trafficking in drugs , firearms , prostitution , money laundering and other forms of organized crime , " he added . but the panel of experts the eu commissioned to examine the issue accused the bloc of concentrating solely on the process of trafficking and failing to address where the demand stems from .
merely pursuing smugglers was not enough , said the head of the panel , marjan wijers . " if we look at international human rights law , states not only have a duty to prevent and punish trafficking as a violation of human rights , but also to provide the victims with adequate remedies , wijers said .
" up until now states have predominantly concentrated on measures in the area of crime control and migration policies rather than on victim assistance and protection .
to effectively tackle trafficking this imbalance needs to be redressed . "
kidnapped and helpless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini the victims are often utterly dependent on their employers as they are unable to legally apply for residence permits , wijers said .
entire industries rely on the illegal workers who are kept as slaves , she said .
the authorities should develop witness protection programs for victims willing to testify against traffickers and national referral mechanisms to identify victims . the eu has already committed to an international convention against human trafficking , and frattini said he would draft concrete plans for action early next year . he cited intelligence and police information as identifying a growing demand for underage girls .

so , klinsi , as he ’ s affectionately called , went to work .
new players , new tactics and a new mentality were part of his game strategy . before the friendly with brazil in september , he called in a fitness trainer from the us to consult with the players , a first on the national squad .

but western countries , including germany , have vested interests in the matter .
critics say that 's clouded judgment of russia . while the forced dismantling of yukos by the kremlin has shaken many western investors ' confidence in russia as a place to do business , government officials even this month confirmed that berlin is actively encouraging german energy companies to invest in the russian energy sector .
german firms are already there .

in a complex series of behind-the-scenes shuffling since yukos ' main unit , yuganskneftegaz , went on the auction block on sunday , gazprom or another kremlin-linked firm is thought by many analysts to likely be the future owner of yukos ' prize asset , which is responsible for 10 percent of the country 's crude oil output . " russia represents a huge opportunity and we germans have privileged access to the market , " bernd pfaffenbach , germany 's deputy economics minister , told financial times deutschland last week .

" russia is an enormously important market in which german companies must be present .

he said schröder was well aware of the machinations on the part of moscow to gain control of yukos , but that he had turned a blind eye since criticism would not be in the best interests of german energy concerns . amsterdam also levelled criticism against deutsche bank and dresdner bank , accusing them and other multinationals of a willingness to help finance the forced dismantlement of yukos .

" if one compares how many jews were murdered in the holocaust and how many have immigrated and could still come - the relations speak for themselves , " the head of the central council of jews in germany told reuters wednesday .
" in public , the discussion comes across as if germany had been flooded with jewish immigrants in recent years , " he said .
" since 1989 around 190,000 jews have immigrated to germany , and it is n't expected that hundreds of thousands more will come . "

on paper the japanese , under a former brazilian superstar , stood even higher -lrb- 17th -rrb- in the world rankings than the germans -lrb- 19th -rrb- .
that , however , shows how flawed ranking systems can be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany -lrb- in red -rrb- played with gusto against asian champs japan despite arriving just two days before in yokohama , germany played strongly .
midfielder michael ballack was anxious to run on the pitch of the world cup final stadium from two years ago .
then he had to watch from the sidelines because he had received a second yellow card in the semifinal against south korea . it was a match of firsts since the german coach is still experimenting with possible lineups during the long march to world cup 2006 .
defenders patrick owomoyela and christian schulz made their debuts on the national team .
owomoyela made a good impression , schulz less so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's goalkeeper seigo narazaki , right , looks dejected as germany 's michael ballack celebrates his first goal under jürgen klinsmann particularly satisfying to klinsmann was that ballack played with zeal and imagination in a strong second half .
the bayern munich playmaker was rewarded with his first goal under the new coach .
striker miroslav klose scored twice more as germany surprisingly walked over the asian champion , 3-0 . klinsmann noted afterwards that there was a clear difference between the two sides .
even better , the record of the german team since jürgen klinsmann took over for rudi völler in july stood at four wins and one draw . first loss for coach klinsmann the euphoria of yokohama would become dismay at pusan three days later .
on sunday , the germans suffered defeat at the hands of south korea , the team that they had beaten to advance to the finals of the world cup in 2002 . ballack took a beating in the match , the victim of numerous fouls committed by aggressive south korean players .
nevertheless , he managed to score another goal which knotted the game 1-1 but failed to convert a penalty kick late in the game that would have tied the game 2-2 .
the second half was all south korea as it began to look like germany were suffering from jet lag .
ballack recognized that they were " penalized " for the mistakes made in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea -lrb- in red -rrb- won more head ball duels - and the match , 3-1 klinsmann put things into perspective , even praising the team for permanently attacking .
characteristic of the optimistic coach , he said it was most important to get back on track in the thailand match .
they succeeded in doing this . the national squad will have time to think about their performance on the long plane ride back to germany .
they beat japan and thailand , but lost their first-ever match to an asian opponent on sunday against south korea .
klinsmann has made an indelible mark on the german national team , something not just any coach can say . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de toothless lions fall to klinsi 's red army jürgen klinsmann enjoyed his first home win as german manager when his team , newly decked out in a red change strip , defeated 10-man cameroon 3-0 in a friendly match in leipzig on wednesday .

jürgen klinsmann 's squad returns home having won two games and losing one . after their 3-1 loss to south korea on sunday , coach jürgen klinsmann gave several of his first-string players a break , most notably goalie oliver kahn and midfield playmaker michael ballack .

thailand put a bit of fear into the germans at one point by pulling to within just one goal in the 57th minute on a goal by striker chaikamdee sarayoot . the match was played primarily in one direction — that of the thai goal .
thailand 's coach , former german national player siggi held , can thank his goalkeeper kosin hathairattanakool that the final score was not more lopsided .

strikers asamoah und thomas brdaric gave away clear chances .
bastian schweinsteiger 's direct kick hit the crossbar . finally , 11 minutes before the half , kuranyi broke the scoreless tie after a thai player lost the ball to him outside the penalty area .
four minutes later , asamoah lofted a cross to kuranyi who headed the ball into the goal .
that seemed to be all that the germans needed to take apart the team ranked 79th in the world . podolski scores first goals for germany in the second half , brdaric hit metal and then thailand struck .
friedrich nonchalantly lost a ball at midfield and the thais raced downfield leaving keeper hildebrand without a chance .
klinsmann then brought in lukas podolski who revived the germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arne friedrich -lrb- right -rrb- wore captain 's armband for first time his two goals , his first on the national team , certainly raised his stock of claiming a spot on the world cup 2006 squad .

jürgen klinsmann 's squad returns home having won two games and losing one . after their 3-1 loss to south korea on sunday , coach jürgen klinsmann gave several of his first-string players a break , most notably goalie oliver kahn and midfield playmaker michael ballack .
on tuesday , the reserves put in an impressive performance against a hopelessly undermanned thailand winning 5-1 . the goals came from kevin kuranyi -lrb- 34th and 38th minute -rrb- , lukas podolski -lrb- 73rd and 89th -rrb- as well as gerald asamoah -lrb- 84th minute -rrb- .
thailand put a bit of fear into the germans at one point by pulling to within just one goal in the 57th minute on a goal by striker chaikamdee sarayoot . the match was played primarily in one direction — that of the thai goal .
thailand 's coach , former german national player siggi held , can thank his goalkeeper kosin hathairattanakool that the final score was not more lopsided .
after the game , held expressed his irritation by saying that his team did not do what he has drilled into them on the practice field . missed opportunities in the first 30 minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi -lrb- right -rrb- found the net twice against thailand german coach jürgen klinsmann was more relaxed in the post-match interview .

strikers asamoah und thomas brdaric gave away clear chances .
bastian schweinsteiger 's direct kick hit the crossbar . finally , 11 minutes before the half , kuranyi broke the scoreless tie after a thai player lost the ball to him outside the penalty area .
four minutes later , asamoah lofted a cross to kuranyi who headed the ball into the goal .
that seemed to be all that the germans needed to take apart the team ranked 79th in the world . podolski scores first goals for germany in the second half , brdaric hit metal and then thailand struck .
friedrich nonchalantly lost a ball at midfield and the thais raced downfield leaving keeper hildebrand without a chance .
klinsmann then brought in lukas podolski who revived the germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arne friedrich -lrb- right -rrb- wore captain 's armband for first time his two goals , his first on the national team , certainly raised his stock of claiming a spot on the world cup 2006 squad .

jürgen klinsmann 's squad returns home having won two games and losing one . after their 3-1 loss to south korea on sunday , coach jürgen klinsmann gave several of his first-string players a break , most notably goalie oliver kahn and midfield playmaker michael ballack .
on tuesday , the reserves put in an impressive performance against a hopelessly undermanned thailand winning 5-1 . the goals came from kevin kuranyi -lrb- 34th and 38th minute -rrb- , lukas podolski -lrb- 73rd and 89th -rrb- as well as gerald asamoah -lrb- 84th minute -rrb- .
thailand put a bit of fear into the germans at one point by pulling to within just one goal in the 57th minute on a goal by striker chaikamdee sarayoot . the match was played primarily in one direction — that of the thai goal .
thailand 's coach , former german national player siggi held , can thank his goalkeeper kosin hathairattanakool that the final score was not more lopsided .

four minutes later , asamoah lofted a cross to kuranyi who headed the ball into the goal .
that seemed to be all that the germans needed to take apart the team ranked 79th in the world . podolski scores first goals for germany in the second half , brdaric hit metal and then thailand struck .
friedrich nonchalantly lost a ball at midfield and the thais raced downfield leaving keeper hildebrand without a chance .
klinsmann then brought in lukas podolski who revived the germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arne friedrich -lrb- right -rrb- wore captain 's armband for first time his two goals , his first on the national team , certainly raised his stock of claiming a spot on the world cup 2006 squad .

" if one compares how many jews were murdered in the holocaust and how many have immigrated and could still come - the relations speak for themselves , " the head of the central council of jews in germany told reuters wednesday .
" in public , the discussion comes across as if germany had been flooded with jewish immigrants in recent years , " he said .
" since 1989 around 190,000 jews have immigrated to germany , and it is n't expected that hundreds of thousands more will come . "
aiding integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : synagogue in berlin 's rykestrasse according to news reports , the new regulations will only allow jews from cis countries to immigrate to germany if they are under 45 years of age , speak german , can show an invitation from a german jewish community and can prove that they will not live from social welfare .
the changes are meant to improve the integration of the immigrants , who some say show too little readiness to become part of german society .
the new rules are in keeping with those applied to other immigrant groups . in 1991 , germany introduced quotas for jews immigrating from cis countries .
the immigrants were expected to strengthen germany 's jewish communities that in the wake of the holocaust only counted around 30,000 members .
however , only 83,000 of those who immigrated since then officially joined the jewish community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily spiegel criticized the interior ministry for informing the central council of jews in germany - over which he presides - about the changes at such a late date .
the changes must be approved by germany 's federal states and would come into effect in 2006 . otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- confirmed wednesday after a discussion with spiegel that he had - as in the past - promised no changes would be made to the immigration regulations for jews without the central council 's agreement . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to limit immigration of russian jews germany plans to stop offering unlimited immigration to jews from russia and eastern europe starting jan .

" if one compares how many jews were murdered in the holocaust and how many have immigrated and could still come - the relations speak for themselves , " the head of the central council of jews in germany told reuters wednesday .
" in public , the discussion comes across as if germany had been flooded with jewish immigrants in recent years , " he said .
" since 1989 around 190,000 jews have immigrated to germany , and it is n't expected that hundreds of thousands more will come . "
aiding integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : synagogue in berlin 's rykestrasse according to news reports , the new regulations will only allow jews from cis countries to immigrate to germany if they are under 45 years of age , speak german , can show an invitation from a german jewish community and can prove that they will not live from social welfare .
the changes are meant to improve the integration of the immigrants , who some say show too little readiness to become part of german society .
the new rules are in keeping with those applied to other immigrant groups . in 1991 , germany introduced quotas for jews immigrating from cis countries .
the immigrants were expected to strengthen germany 's jewish communities that in the wake of the holocaust only counted around 30,000 members .
however , only 83,000 of those who immigrated since then officially joined the jewish community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily spiegel criticized the interior ministry for informing the central council of jews in germany - over which he presides - about the changes at such a late date .
the changes must be approved by germany 's federal states and would come into effect in 2006 . otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- confirmed wednesday after a discussion with spiegel that he had - as in the past - promised no changes would be made to the immigration regulations for jews without the central council 's agreement . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to limit immigration of russian jews germany plans to stop offering unlimited immigration to jews from russia and eastern europe starting jan .

the difficulty of letting go was largely the result of the d-mark 's success story .
the first d-mark bills printed for the currency reform caused an immensely dynamic boom in postwar germany .
the currency reform , the deutsche mark and the so-called " economic miracle " in the 1950s and ' 60s are inextricably linked to each other in the minds of the germans . in the beginning , germany profited from the fact that other countries viewed the deutsche mark with distrust and that it was chronically undervalued for years .
that helped the german economy achieve huge success in exports and led to full employment and a labor shortage that resulted in recruiting guest workers from greece , portugal , turkey and other southern european countries - practically inconceivable today . legendary stability and for 50 years the deutsche mark survived many a storm , including the oil price shocks during the 1970s and the two-digit salary increases demanded by trade unions that wanted to ensure workers profited as much as possible from the new prosperity .
things like that are hard on any currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche marks -lrb- left -rrb- still , the german central bank always managed to maintain the currency 's stability and to stem inflation .
thanks to the bundesbank 's constitutional independence - a model for the european central bank - it not only kept the mark stable but also turned it into a leading currency that , along with the dollar , was recognized worldwide the germans were n't proud of their black-red-gold flag or the eagle in their national emblem , but they were proud of the mark .
many other europeans found it easier to give up their national currency for the euro possibly because they secretly hoped to inherit some of the d-mark 's legendary stability .
and since euro cash was introduced into circulation on jan .
1 , 2002 , the currency has remained surprisingly stable .
the euro has neither made cars nor washing machines more expensive - at the most it 's effected food , drink and some services .
due to the current weakness of the dollar , europeans are much less effected than people in other parts of the world by the exorbitant price hikes for crude oil , steel and other raw materials .
and they can enjoy much cheaper holidays in countries using the us dollar or that tie their currencies to the dollar - though this has less to do with the strong euros than with the weak dollar . spurring reliability all in all , germans consider the mark history , and they do just fine with the euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an audi assembly line in györ , hungary with one exception .

they called the strong deutsche mark an " innovation whip . " today european firms are in a similar situation with the strong euro and the comparatively high level of european incomes .
but instead of focusing on innovation , quality and efficiency they seem to have shifted the rat race to wages , working hours and working conditions more and more germans are expected to work longer hours for less money to preserve their jobs .
at the same time , it seems apparent that western europe can not win against the low wages and weak currencies of the competition from eastern europe or asia . the strong euro ca n't be blamed for this futile race .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.12.2004 opinion : has the euro changed anything ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the single currency was introduced in 12 countries in 2002 many germans still calculate prices in marks and those who have less money in their wallets than three years ago - when the new currency was introduced - wonder whether the euro is to blame . it was harder for the germans to say goodbye to the deutsche mark three years ago than it was for other europeans to take leave of their national currencies .
the difficulty of letting go was largely the result of the d-mark 's success story .
the first d-mark bills printed for the currency reform caused an immensely dynamic boom in postwar germany .
the currency reform , the deutsche mark and the so-called " economic miracle " in the 1950s and ' 60s are inextricably linked to each other in the minds of the germans . in the beginning , germany profited from the fact that other countries viewed the deutsche mark with distrust and that it was chronically undervalued for years .
that helped the german economy achieve huge success in exports and led to full employment and a labor shortage that resulted in recruiting guest workers from greece , portugal , turkey and other southern european countries - practically inconceivable today . legendary stability and for 50 years the deutsche mark survived many a storm , including the oil price shocks during the 1970s and the two-digit salary increases demanded by trade unions that wanted to ensure workers profited as much as possible from the new prosperity .
things like that are hard on any currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche marks -lrb- left -rrb- still , the german central bank always managed to maintain the currency 's stability and to stem inflation .
thanks to the bundesbank 's constitutional independence - a model for the european central bank - it not only kept the mark stable but also turned it into a leading currency that , along with the dollar , was recognized worldwide the germans were n't proud of their black-red-gold flag or the eagle in their national emblem , but they were proud of the mark .
many other europeans found it easier to give up their national currency for the euro possibly because they secretly hoped to inherit some of the d-mark 's legendary stability .
and since euro cash was introduced into circulation on jan .
1 , 2002 , the currency has remained surprisingly stable .
the euro has neither made cars nor washing machines more expensive - at the most it 's effected food , drink and some services .
due to the current weakness of the dollar , europeans are much less effected than people in other parts of the world by the exorbitant price hikes for crude oil , steel and other raw materials .
and they can enjoy much cheaper holidays in countries using the us dollar or that tie their currencies to the dollar - though this has less to do with the strong euros than with the weak dollar . spurring reliability all in all , germans consider the mark history , and they do just fine with the euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an audi assembly line in györ , hungary with one exception .
german companies used to be obliged to justify their high world market prices - caused by the highly valued d-mark and high wages - through innovation , efficiency , quality and reliability .
they called the strong deutsche mark an " innovation whip . " today european firms are in a similar situation with the strong euro and the comparatively high level of european incomes .
but instead of focusing on innovation , quality and efficiency they seem to have shifted the rat race to wages , working hours and working conditions more and more germans are expected to work longer hours for less money to preserve their jobs .
at the same time , it seems apparent that western europe can not win against the low wages and weak currencies of the competition from eastern europe or asia . the strong euro ca n't be blamed for this futile race .
rather , what 's needed is innovation and quality - like in the old days of the strong d-mark rolf wenkel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the strong euro 's hidden pleasures as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout .

on paper the japanese , under a former brazilian superstar , stood even higher -lrb- 17th -rrb- in the world rankings than the germans -lrb- 19th -rrb- .
that , however , shows how flawed ranking systems can be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany -lrb- in red -rrb- played with gusto against asian champs japan despite arriving just two days before in yokohama , germany played strongly .
midfielder michael ballack was anxious to run on the pitch of the world cup final stadium from two years ago .
then he had to watch from the sidelines because he had received a second yellow card in the semifinal against south korea . it was a match of firsts since the german coach is still experimenting with possible lineups during the long march to world cup 2006 .
defenders patrick owomoyela and christian schulz made their debuts on the national team .
owomoyela made a good impression , schulz less so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's goalkeeper seigo narazaki , right , looks dejected as germany 's michael ballack celebrates his first goal under jürgen klinsmann particularly satisfying to klinsmann was that ballack played with zeal and imagination in a strong second half .
the bayern munich playmaker was rewarded with his first goal under the new coach .
striker miroslav klose scored twice more as germany surprisingly walked over the asian champion , 3-0 . klinsmann noted afterwards that there was a clear difference between the two sides .
even better , the record of the german team since jürgen klinsmann took over for rudi völler in july stood at four wins and one draw . first loss for coach klinsmann the euphoria of yokohama would become dismay at pusan three days later .
on sunday , the germans suffered defeat at the hands of south korea , the team that they had beaten to advance to the finals of the world cup in 2002 . ballack took a beating in the match , the victim of numerous fouls committed by aggressive south korean players .
nevertheless , he managed to score another goal which knotted the game 1-1 but failed to convert a penalty kick late in the game that would have tied the game 2-2 .
the second half was all south korea as it began to look like germany were suffering from jet lag .
ballack recognized that they were " penalized " for the mistakes made in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea -lrb- in red -rrb- won more head ball duels - and the match , 3-1 klinsmann put things into perspective , even praising the team for permanently attacking .
characteristic of the optimistic coach , he said it was most important to get back on track in the thailand match .
they succeeded in doing this . the national squad will have time to think about their performance on the long plane ride back to germany .
they beat japan and thailand , but lost their first-ever match to an asian opponent on sunday against south korea .
klinsmann has made an indelible mark on the german national team , something not just any coach can say . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de toothless lions fall to klinsi 's red army jürgen klinsmann enjoyed his first home win as german manager when his team , newly decked out in a red change strip , defeated 10-man cameroon 3-0 in a friendly match in leipzig on wednesday .

jürgen klinsmann 's squad returns home having won two games and losing one . after their 3-1 loss to south korea on sunday , coach jürgen klinsmann gave several of his first-string players a break , most notably goalie oliver kahn and midfield playmaker michael ballack .
on tuesday , the reserves put in an impressive performance against a hopelessly undermanned thailand winning 5-1 . the goals came from kevin kuranyi -lrb- 34th and 38th minute -rrb- , lukas podolski -lrb- 73rd and 89th -rrb- as well as gerald asamoah -lrb- 84th minute -rrb- .
thailand put a bit of fear into the germans at one point by pulling to within just one goal in the 57th minute on a goal by striker chaikamdee sarayoot . the match was played primarily in one direction — that of the thai goal .
thailand 's coach , former german national player siggi held , can thank his goalkeeper kosin hathairattanakool that the final score was not more lopsided .
after the game , held expressed his irritation by saying that his team did not do what he has drilled into them on the practice field . missed opportunities in the first 30 minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi -lrb- right -rrb- found the net twice against thailand german coach jürgen klinsmann was more relaxed in the post-match interview .
on german public television , he complimented the team for pushing forward the whole match .

strikers asamoah und thomas brdaric gave away clear chances .
bastian schweinsteiger 's direct kick hit the crossbar . finally , 11 minutes before the half , kuranyi broke the scoreless tie after a thai player lost the ball to him outside the penalty area .
four minutes later , asamoah lofted a cross to kuranyi who headed the ball into the goal .
that seemed to be all that the germans needed to take apart the team ranked 79th in the world . podolski scores first goals for germany in the second half , brdaric hit metal and then thailand struck .
friedrich nonchalantly lost a ball at midfield and the thais raced downfield leaving keeper hildebrand without a chance .
klinsmann then brought in lukas podolski who revived the germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arne friedrich -lrb- right -rrb- wore captain 's armband for first time his two goals , his first on the national team , certainly raised his stock of claiming a spot on the world cup 2006 squad .

after the asian tour , it 's time to take a look at just what the former international striker has accomplished since august . when jürgen klinsmann was appointed national coach five months ago , experts and fans were wondering if the german soccer federation had n't gone a little mad .
the former international striker who helped lead germany to victory in the 1990 world cup had almost no coaching experience .
aside from spending his time assisting with an american soccer franchise in los angeles , klinsmann didn ’ t really have much coaching clout to his name . but the soccer federation dfb was in search of a new national head .
the former coach , rudi völler , had just thrown in the towel after a devastating showing at the european championships in june , and many people thought it was time for some old-fashioned discipline to come in and whip the tired team into shape . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birds of a feather - coach and former striker klinsmann with goal-shooter kevin kuranyi the candidates from the old school , most notably greek national coach and euro 2004 champ otto rehhagel and former bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld , had rejected offers to take over the squad .
with world cup 2006 taking place in germany , the dfb began looking further a field . that ’ s when german soccer big-wigs focused on klinsmann .
it was time to bring in some california sunshine .
and everyone agreed : optimism is one quality not lacking in klinsmann 's personality . a firm believer in miracles soccer ’ s sunny boy came to germany and immediately made waves .
" i know that the fans in our country have one wish - to win the 2006 world cup .
that is also my aim , " klinsmann told the media at his first press conference . but he quickly realized and admitted to the public that the nation ’ s no. 1 goal could not be achieved with the squad that showed up at the euro 2004 , or at least not with their attitude .
so , klinsi , as he ’ s affectionately called , went to work .
new players , new tactics and a new mentality were part of his game strategy . before the friendly with brazil in september , he called in a fitness trainer from the us to consult with the players , a first on the national squad .
he also started bringing on new players , which caused more than a few eyebrows to rise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's red uniforms part of new team mentality klinsmann wanted to form the team according to his wishes .
he told the german sports press agency , sid , that he and his assistant coach , joachim löw , and team manager , oliver bierhoff , wanted to create a new basic philosophy and convey it to the players .
in addition , klinsmann firmly believed that a new team identity would help germany reach the ambitious goal of raising the world cup trophy in 2006 . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsi 's squad dismantles thais the german national soccer team ended its three-game asian tour with an easy 5-1 victory over thailand .

jürgen klinsmann 's squad returns home having won two games and losing one . after their 3-1 loss to south korea on sunday , coach jürgen klinsmann gave several of his first-string players a break , most notably goalie oliver kahn and midfield playmaker michael ballack .
on tuesday , the reserves put in an impressive performance against a hopelessly undermanned thailand winning 5-1 . the goals came from kevin kuranyi -lrb- 34th and 38th minute -rrb- , lukas podolski -lrb- 73rd and 89th -rrb- as well as gerald asamoah -lrb- 84th minute -rrb- .
thailand put a bit of fear into the germans at one point by pulling to within just one goal in the 57th minute on a goal by striker chaikamdee sarayoot . the match was played primarily in one direction — that of the thai goal .
thailand 's coach , former german national player siggi held , can thank his goalkeeper kosin hathairattanakool that the final score was not more lopsided .
after the game , held expressed his irritation by saying that his team did not do what he has drilled into them on the practice field . missed opportunities in the first 30 minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi -lrb- right -rrb- found the net twice against thailand german coach jürgen klinsmann was more relaxed in the post-match interview .
on german public television , he complimented the team for pushing forward the whole match .
in the first half-hour of the game , though , he must have been raging inside . compared to sunday 's match , there was lots of room for both teams to develop their games , particularly on the german side .
strikers asamoah und thomas brdaric gave away clear chances .
bastian schweinsteiger 's direct kick hit the crossbar . finally , 11 minutes before the half , kuranyi broke the scoreless tie after a thai player lost the ball to him outside the penalty area .
four minutes later , asamoah lofted a cross to kuranyi who headed the ball into the goal .
that seemed to be all that the germans needed to take apart the team ranked 79th in the world . podolski scores first goals for germany in the second half , brdaric hit metal and then thailand struck .
friedrich nonchalantly lost a ball at midfield and the thais raced downfield leaving keeper hildebrand without a chance .
klinsmann then brought in lukas podolski who revived the germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arne friedrich -lrb- right -rrb- wore captain 's armband for first time his two goals , his first on the national team , certainly raised his stock of claiming a spot on the world cup 2006 squad .

none of the members had 100 percent immunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former goalie coach sepp maier -lrb- back -rrb- got his pink slip for taking sides in keeper feud he tossed long-time goalkeeping coach , sepp maier , who had sided with number one keeper , oliver kahn , in his public feud with rival jens lehmann .
keeping true to form in the rejuvenation process , klinsmann hired his teammate from the 1996 european cup champions , andreas köpke , to take over as goalie trainer .
meanwhile kahn had to hand over the captain 's armband to midfielder micahel ballack . " king kahn 's " undisputed standing as the top goalkeeper was also thrown into doubt , although it is still unclear who could threaten him .
lehmann is sitting on the bench at his club arsenal london , and many think stuttgart 's timo hilderbrand is too young . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : didi hamann could be a victim of klinsmann 's youth craze veterans like dieter hamann and oliver neuville -lrb- both 31 -rrb- have completely fallen off the radar screen , having yet to play a match under klinsmann . " certainly they still have a chance , " klinsmann told a news conference , only then to sign the players ' death sentence on the squad by saying the " fact of the matter is that the players who have recently been on the team have a slight advantage . " bring in the new what is bad news for the experienced players is good news for young talent like patrick owomoyela , per mertesacker , frank fahrenhorst , roberth huth , thomas hitzlsperger .
klinsmann has given them the chance to prove themselves on the field . with so many changes , casual spectators need a roster in their hand to know who 's who on the team .
in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung , klinsmann said there are 30-35 candidates and cuts for the world cup squad will be tough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans listen even when former great franz beckenbauer is speaking with a shoe despite a great start for klinsmann 's team - five wins , one draw and the loss to south korea - it would be an exaggeration to say this team is up there with the best .
in his column for the tabloid bild , former german great franz beckenbauer cautioned against getting too euphoric .
after all , the match against brazil was the only one against a strong opponent . klinsmann , the eternal optimist , thinks differently .
when asked by the süddeutsche where germany stood internationally , he responded that his team was among the top six to eight teams .
but then such enthusiasm comes easily when he spends his christmas holidays in the california sun while his players return to cold and dreary germany . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsi 's squad dismantles thais the german national soccer team ended its three-game asian tour with an easy 5-1 victory over thailand .

jürgen klinsmann 's squad returns home having won two games and losing one . after their 3-1 loss to south korea on sunday , coach jürgen klinsmann gave several of his first-string players a break , most notably goalie oliver kahn and midfield playmaker michael ballack .
on tuesday , the reserves put in an impressive performance against a hopelessly undermanned thailand winning 5-1 . the goals came from kevin kuranyi -lrb- 34th and 38th minute -rrb- , lukas podolski -lrb- 73rd and 89th -rrb- as well as gerald asamoah -lrb- 84th minute -rrb- .
thailand put a bit of fear into the germans at one point by pulling to within just one goal in the 57th minute on a goal by striker chaikamdee sarayoot . the match was played primarily in one direction — that of the thai goal .
thailand 's coach , former german national player siggi held , can thank his goalkeeper kosin hathairattanakool that the final score was not more lopsided .

in the first half-hour of the game , though , he must have been raging inside . compared to sunday 's match , there was lots of room for both teams to develop their games , particularly on the german side .
strikers asamoah und thomas brdaric gave away clear chances .
bastian schweinsteiger 's direct kick hit the crossbar . finally , 11 minutes before the half , kuranyi broke the scoreless tie after a thai player lost the ball to him outside the penalty area .
four minutes later , asamoah lofted a cross to kuranyi who headed the ball into the goal .
that seemed to be all that the germans needed to take apart the team ranked 79th in the world . podolski scores first goals for germany in the second half , brdaric hit metal and then thailand struck .
friedrich nonchalantly lost a ball at midfield and the thais raced downfield leaving keeper hildebrand without a chance .

but western countries , including germany , have vested interests in the matter .
critics say that 's clouded judgment of russia . while the forced dismantling of yukos by the kremlin has shaken many western investors ' confidence in russia as a place to do business , government officials even this month confirmed that berlin is actively encouraging german energy companies to invest in the russian energy sector .
german firms are already there .
e.on , a german utility , has through its subsidiary ruhrgas a 6 percent stake in gazprom , the state natural gas monopoly .
in a complex series of behind-the-scenes shuffling since yukos ' main unit , yuganskneftegaz , went on the auction block on sunday , gazprom or another kremlin-linked firm is thought by many analysts to likely be the future owner of yukos ' prize asset , which is responsible for 10 percent of the country 's crude oil output . " russia represents a huge opportunity and we germans have privileged access to the market , " bernd pfaffenbach , germany 's deputy economics minister , told financial times deutschland last week .
" there are signs that we might even be able to play a role in exploration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on , along with rwe , another leading energy group , told the paper they are considering expanding their interests in russia and would take another look at the assets of yukos after the auction . keen to do business the german government has shown eagerness to enter into business with russia .
chancellor gerhard schröder has announced a " strategic partnership " with russia , hoping to secure access for german companies to russia 's market and energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on a recent two-day visit to germany by russian president vladimir putin , schröder and the russian leader , who have a warm , personal relationship , talked extensively about strengthening business ties between the two countries .
germany energy chiefs regularly accompany schröder on trips he makes to russia . " trade between germany and russia is developing very dynamically , " schröder said on monday during putin 's visit to germany .
" russia is an enormously important market in which german companies must be present . " harsh criticism statements like these made during the controversy over yukos and the trips with energy executives has led critics , even those in schröder 's own party , to argue that the chancellor has focused on market access at the expense on other issues such as human rights in chechnya or putin 's one-time backing of viktor yanukovych , the ukrainian prime minister and disputed winner of the presidential election there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky robert amsterdam , a canadian lawyer representing mikhail khodorkovsy , the yukos ' founder who is currently in jail on charges of tax evasion , accused schröder of supporting the " breach of law " on the part of the russian government regarding the embattled oil giant .
he said schröder was well aware of the machinations on the part of moscow to gain control of yukos , but that he had turned a blind eye since criticism would not be in the best interests of german energy concerns . amsterdam also levelled criticism against deutsche bank and dresdner bank , accusing them and other multinationals of a willingness to help finance the forced dismantlement of yukos .
the two german banks , along with abn amro , bnp paribas , calyon and j.p. morgan , were to lend gazprom the billions needed to buy the yuganskneftegaz unit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's state-owned oil company rosneft 's headquarters on the moscow river in the end , however , the banks backed out of the deal and russia sold yuganskneftegaz to a previously unheard-of company , baikal finance group , which days later was bought by the russian state oil firm rosneft .
rosneft 's chairman , igor sechin , is a close associate of vladimir putin and doubles as deputy head of the kremlin administration . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany bound to russia over energy policy germany is dependent on russia for some 40 percent of its natural gas , and the amount is set to grow , experts warn .
at the same time , promising energy resources in central asia are being neglected .

3 , 2004 -rrb- schröder not worried about yukos affair in moscow for a one-day visit to boost german-russian business ties , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised russian president vladimir putin 's economic reform course and said he had faith in russia 's judicial system .

but experts said that the eu neglects the victims . frattini was responding to a report by a panel of experts on people smuggling who recommended improved coordination between national and eu level authorities . " we are obliged to pursue human trafficking from a moral as well as a security perspective , " the former italian foreign minister said .
" trafficking of human beings is a crime which often acts as a door to other serious crimes , such as … trafficking in drugs , firearms , prostitution , money laundering and other forms of organized crime , " he added . but the panel of experts the eu commissioned to examine the issue accused the bloc of concentrating solely on the process of trafficking and failing to address where the demand stems from .
merely pursuing smugglers was not enough , said the head of the panel , marjan wijers . " if we look at international human rights law , states not only have a duty to prevent and punish trafficking as a violation of human rights , but also to provide the victims with adequate remedies , wijers said .
" up until now states have predominantly concentrated on measures in the area of crime control and migration policies rather than on victim assistance and protection .
to effectively tackle trafficking this imbalance needs to be redressed . "

entire industries rely on the illegal workers who are kept as slaves , she said .
the authorities should develop witness protection programs for victims willing to testify against traffickers and national referral mechanisms to identify victims . the eu has already committed to an international convention against human trafficking , and frattini said he would draft concrete plans for action early next year . he cited intelligence and police information as identifying a growing demand for underage girls .
women from eastern europe , particularly ukraine , moldova , romania and bulgaria continue to make up the largest number of victims , while a considerable amount came from nigeria and were brought to britain and italy .
kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina are the centers of activity for smugglers , he said . the eu took issue with romania and bulgaria over human trafficking in recently completed accession talks with the countries , and now bucharest and sofia have to take action , frattini said . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping victims of human trafficking dreams of a better life often end in a brothel for the victims of human trafficking , with the people smugglers and slave traders who bring them there making a lucrative living from their misery .

now , as you know , we have n't found little green men on the red planet .
but this year , a mars rover took a small step on the planet 's soil and made a giant leap for mars exploration : very strong evidence that , in the past , at least part of mars was " drenched with water . "
that means mars was the kind of place , maybe like that back bottom shelf of your refrigerator , where life might have had a chance to flourish .
the mars rover , from nasa , is called " opportunity " , and at the max planck institute for chemistry -lrb- mpic -rrb- , in mainz , germany , scientists built the machine which measured the chemical composition of dust and stones where opportunity rolled .
it 's named the alpha particle x-ray spectrometer , but you can just call it apxs , or the " good nose " -lrb- spürnase -rrb- , as they call it in mainz .
here 's a picture ; the good nose is the round piece staring out from the rover .
bildunterschrift : mars apxs this friendly looking little machine can handle some tough environments , like rocky outcroppings on the martian surface below -500c .
to tell us about the chemistry of mars , the good nose sends out alpha particles and x-rays and senses the characteristic x-rays that are scattered back from the dust or rocks .
you 'll hear more about those when you click on the audio interview below with dr. lugmair , whose group at the mpic built the apxs .
one of the objects that the good nose sniffed at were the so-called " blueberries " – those are small berry-shaped rocks which were found in a depression on a martian rock , called the " berry bowl " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mars blueberries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mars blueberries closeup it turned out that inside the " blueberries " , there was something that you would n't find in real blueberries : hematite , a kind of iron mineral .

now , as you know , we have n't found little green men on the red planet .
but this year , a mars rover took a small step on the planet 's soil and made a giant leap for mars exploration : very strong evidence that , in the past , at least part of mars was " drenched with water . "
that means mars was the kind of place , maybe like that back bottom shelf of your refrigerator , where life might have had a chance to flourish .
the mars rover , from nasa , is called " opportunity " , and at the max planck institute for chemistry -lrb- mpic -rrb- , in mainz , germany , scientists built the machine which measured the chemical composition of dust and stones where opportunity rolled .
it 's named the alpha particle x-ray spectrometer , but you can just call it apxs , or the " good nose " -lrb- spürnase -rrb- , as they call it in mainz .

but western countries , including germany , have vested interests in the matter .
critics say that 's clouded judgment of russia . while the forced dismantling of yukos by the kremlin has shaken many western investors ' confidence in russia as a place to do business , government officials even this month confirmed that berlin is actively encouraging german energy companies to invest in the russian energy sector .
german firms are already there .
e.on , a german utility , has through its subsidiary ruhrgas a 6 percent stake in gazprom , the state natural gas monopoly .
in a complex series of behind-the-scenes shuffling since yukos ' main unit , yuganskneftegaz , went on the auction block on sunday , gazprom or another kremlin-linked firm is thought by many analysts to likely be the future owner of yukos ' prize asset , which is responsible for 10 percent of the country 's crude oil output . " russia represents a huge opportunity and we germans have privileged access to the market , " bernd pfaffenbach , germany 's deputy economics minister , told financial times deutschland last week .

germany energy chiefs regularly accompany schröder on trips he makes to russia . " trade between germany and russia is developing very dynamically , " schröder said on monday during putin 's visit to germany .
" russia is an enormously important market in which german companies must be present . " harsh criticism statements like these made during the controversy over yukos and the trips with energy executives has led critics , even those in schröder 's own party , to argue that the chancellor has focused on market access at the expense on other issues such as human rights in chechnya or putin 's one-time backing of viktor yanukovych , the ukrainian prime minister and disputed winner of the presidential election there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky robert amsterdam , a canadian lawyer representing mikhail khodorkovsy , the yukos ' founder who is currently in jail on charges of tax evasion , accused schröder of supporting the " breach of law " on the part of the russian government regarding the embattled oil giant .
he said schröder was well aware of the machinations on the part of moscow to gain control of yukos , but that he had turned a blind eye since criticism would not be in the best interests of german energy concerns . amsterdam also levelled criticism against deutsche bank and dresdner bank , accusing them and other multinationals of a willingness to help finance the forced dismantlement of yukos .

the difficulty of letting go was largely the result of the d-mark 's success story .
the first d-mark bills printed for the currency reform caused an immensely dynamic boom in postwar germany .
the currency reform , the deutsche mark and the so-called " economic miracle " in the 1950s and ' 60s are inextricably linked to each other in the minds of the germans . in the beginning , germany profited from the fact that other countries viewed the deutsche mark with distrust and that it was chronically undervalued for years .
that helped the german economy achieve huge success in exports and led to full employment and a labor shortage that resulted in recruiting guest workers from greece , portugal , turkey and other southern european countries - practically inconceivable today . legendary stability and for 50 years the deutsche mark survived many a storm , including the oil price shocks during the 1970s and the two-digit salary increases demanded by trade unions that wanted to ensure workers profited as much as possible from the new prosperity .

many other europeans found it easier to give up their national currency for the euro possibly because they secretly hoped to inherit some of the d-mark 's legendary stability .
and since euro cash was introduced into circulation on jan .

the euro has neither made cars nor washing machines more expensive - at the most it 's effected food , drink and some services .
due to the current weakness of the dollar , europeans are much less effected than people in other parts of the world by the exorbitant price hikes for crude oil , steel and other raw materials .
and they can enjoy much cheaper holidays in countries using the us dollar or that tie their currencies to the dollar - though this has less to do with the strong euros than with the weak dollar . spurring reliability all in all , germans consider the mark history , and they do just fine with the euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an audi assembly line in györ , hungary with one exception .
german companies used to be obliged to justify their high world market prices - caused by the highly valued d-mark and high wages - through innovation , efficiency , quality and reliability .
they called the strong deutsche mark an " innovation whip . " today european firms are in a similar situation with the strong euro and the comparatively high level of european incomes .
but instead of focusing on innovation , quality and efficiency they seem to have shifted the rat race to wages , working hours and working conditions more and more germans are expected to work longer hours for less money to preserve their jobs .
at the same time , it seems apparent that western europe can not win against the low wages and weak currencies of the competition from eastern europe or asia . the strong euro ca n't be blamed for this futile race .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.12.2004 opinion : has the euro changed anything ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the single currency was introduced in 12 countries in 2002 many germans still calculate prices in marks and those who have less money in their wallets than three years ago - when the new currency was introduced - wonder whether the euro is to blame . it was harder for the germans to say goodbye to the deutsche mark three years ago than it was for other europeans to take leave of their national currencies .
the difficulty of letting go was largely the result of the d-mark 's success story .
the first d-mark bills printed for the currency reform caused an immensely dynamic boom in postwar germany .
the currency reform , the deutsche mark and the so-called " economic miracle " in the 1950s and ' 60s are inextricably linked to each other in the minds of the germans . in the beginning , germany profited from the fact that other countries viewed the deutsche mark with distrust and that it was chronically undervalued for years .
that helped the german economy achieve huge success in exports and led to full employment and a labor shortage that resulted in recruiting guest workers from greece , portugal , turkey and other southern european countries - practically inconceivable today . legendary stability and for 50 years the deutsche mark survived many a storm , including the oil price shocks during the 1970s and the two-digit salary increases demanded by trade unions that wanted to ensure workers profited as much as possible from the new prosperity .
things like that are hard on any currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche marks -lrb- left -rrb- still , the german central bank always managed to maintain the currency 's stability and to stem inflation .
thanks to the bundesbank 's constitutional independence - a model for the european central bank - it not only kept the mark stable but also turned it into a leading currency that , along with the dollar , was recognized worldwide the germans were n't proud of their black-red-gold flag or the eagle in their national emblem , but they were proud of the mark .
many other europeans found it easier to give up their national currency for the euro possibly because they secretly hoped to inherit some of the d-mark 's legendary stability .
and since euro cash was introduced into circulation on jan .
1 , 2002 , the currency has remained surprisingly stable .
the euro has neither made cars nor washing machines more expensive - at the most it 's effected food , drink and some services .
due to the current weakness of the dollar , europeans are much less effected than people in other parts of the world by the exorbitant price hikes for crude oil , steel and other raw materials .
and they can enjoy much cheaper holidays in countries using the us dollar or that tie their currencies to the dollar - though this has less to do with the strong euros than with the weak dollar . spurring reliability all in all , germans consider the mark history , and they do just fine with the euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an audi assembly line in györ , hungary with one exception .
german companies used to be obliged to justify their high world market prices - caused by the highly valued d-mark and high wages - through innovation , efficiency , quality and reliability .
they called the strong deutsche mark an " innovation whip . " today european firms are in a similar situation with the strong euro and the comparatively high level of european incomes .
but instead of focusing on innovation , quality and efficiency they seem to have shifted the rat race to wages , working hours and working conditions more and more germans are expected to work longer hours for less money to preserve their jobs .
at the same time , it seems apparent that western europe can not win against the low wages and weak currencies of the competition from eastern europe or asia . the strong euro ca n't be blamed for this futile race .
rather , what 's needed is innovation and quality - like in the old days of the strong d-mark rolf wenkel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the strong euro 's hidden pleasures as the euro rises and european leaders fret , american expats and european tourists are reaping the benefits of the currency 's new clout .

now , as you know , we have n't found little green men on the red planet .
but this year , a mars rover took a small step on the planet 's soil and made a giant leap for mars exploration : very strong evidence that , in the past , at least part of mars was " drenched with water . "
that means mars was the kind of place , maybe like that back bottom shelf of your refrigerator , where life might have had a chance to flourish .
the mars rover , from nasa , is called " opportunity " , and at the max planck institute for chemistry -lrb- mpic -rrb- , in mainz , germany , scientists built the machine which measured the chemical composition of dust and stones where opportunity rolled .
it 's named the alpha particle x-ray spectrometer , but you can just call it apxs , or the " good nose " -lrb- spürnase -rrb- , as they call it in mainz .
here 's a picture ; the good nose is the round piece staring out from the rover .
bildunterschrift : mars apxs this friendly looking little machine can handle some tough environments , like rocky outcroppings on the martian surface below -500c .
to tell us about the chemistry of mars , the good nose sends out alpha particles and x-rays and senses the characteristic x-rays that are scattered back from the dust or rocks .

now , as you know , we have n't found little green men on the red planet .
but this year , a mars rover took a small step on the planet 's soil and made a giant leap for mars exploration : very strong evidence that , in the past , at least part of mars was " drenched with water . "
that means mars was the kind of place , maybe like that back bottom shelf of your refrigerator , where life might have had a chance to flourish .
the mars rover , from nasa , is called " opportunity " , and at the max planck institute for chemistry -lrb- mpic -rrb- , in mainz , germany , scientists built the machine which measured the chemical composition of dust and stones where opportunity rolled .
it 's named the alpha particle x-ray spectrometer , but you can just call it apxs , or the " good nose " -lrb- spürnase -rrb- , as they call it in mainz .
here 's a picture ; the good nose is the round piece staring out from the rover .
bildunterschrift : mars apxs this friendly looking little machine can handle some tough environments , like rocky outcroppings on the martian surface below -500c .
to tell us about the chemistry of mars , the good nose sends out alpha particles and x-rays and senses the characteristic x-rays that are scattered back from the dust or rocks .
you 'll hear more about those when you click on the audio interview below with dr. lugmair , whose group at the mpic built the apxs .
one of the objects that the good nose sniffed at were the so-called " blueberries " – those are small berry-shaped rocks which were found in a depression on a martian rock , called the " berry bowl " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.12.2004 experts criticize eu over human trafficking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the eu needs to focus more on human trafficking 's victims eu justice commissioner franco frattini announced wednesday the bloc would intensify efforts to stop human trafficking .
but experts said that the eu neglects the victims . frattini was responding to a report by a panel of experts on people smuggling who recommended improved coordination between national and eu level authorities . " we are obliged to pursue human trafficking from a moral as well as a security perspective , " the former italian foreign minister said .
" trafficking of human beings is a crime which often acts as a door to other serious crimes , such as … trafficking in drugs , firearms , prostitution , money laundering and other forms of organized crime , " he added . but the panel of experts the eu commissioned to examine the issue accused the bloc of concentrating solely on the process of trafficking and failing to address where the demand stems from .
merely pursuing smugglers was not enough , said the head of the panel , marjan wijers . " if we look at international human rights law , states not only have a duty to prevent and punish trafficking as a violation of human rights , but also to provide the victims with adequate remedies , wijers said .
" up until now states have predominantly concentrated on measures in the area of crime control and migration policies rather than on victim assistance and protection .
to effectively tackle trafficking this imbalance needs to be redressed . "
kidnapped and helpless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini the victims are often utterly dependent on their employers as they are unable to legally apply for residence permits , wijers said .
entire industries rely on the illegal workers who are kept as slaves , she said .
the authorities should develop witness protection programs for victims willing to testify against traffickers and national referral mechanisms to identify victims . the eu has already committed to an international convention against human trafficking , and frattini said he would draft concrete plans for action early next year . he cited intelligence and police information as identifying a growing demand for underage girls .
women from eastern europe , particularly ukraine , moldova , romania and bulgaria continue to make up the largest number of victims , while a considerable amount came from nigeria and were brought to britain and italy .
kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina are the centers of activity for smugglers , he said . the eu took issue with romania and bulgaria over human trafficking in recently completed accession talks with the countries , and now bucharest and sofia have to take action , frattini said . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping victims of human trafficking dreams of a better life often end in a brothel for the victims of human trafficking , with the people smugglers and slave traders who bring them there making a lucrative living from their misery .

on paper the japanese , under a former brazilian superstar , stood even higher -lrb- 17th -rrb- in the world rankings than the germans -lrb- 19th -rrb- .
that , however , shows how flawed ranking systems can be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany -lrb- in red -rrb- played with gusto against asian champs japan despite arriving just two days before in yokohama , germany played strongly .
midfielder michael ballack was anxious to run on the pitch of the world cup final stadium from two years ago .
then he had to watch from the sidelines because he had received a second yellow card in the semifinal against south korea . it was a match of firsts since the german coach is still experimenting with possible lineups during the long march to world cup 2006 .
defenders patrick owomoyela and christian schulz made their debuts on the national team .
owomoyela made a good impression , schulz less so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's goalkeeper seigo narazaki , right , looks dejected as germany 's michael ballack celebrates his first goal under jürgen klinsmann particularly satisfying to klinsmann was that ballack played with zeal and imagination in a strong second half .
the bayern munich playmaker was rewarded with his first goal under the new coach .
striker miroslav klose scored twice more as germany surprisingly walked over the asian champion , 3-0 . klinsmann noted afterwards that there was a clear difference between the two sides .
even better , the record of the german team since jürgen klinsmann took over for rudi völler in july stood at four wins and one draw . first loss for coach klinsmann the euphoria of yokohama would become dismay at pusan three days later .
on sunday , the germans suffered defeat at the hands of south korea , the team that they had beaten to advance to the finals of the world cup in 2002 . ballack took a beating in the match , the victim of numerous fouls committed by aggressive south korean players .
nevertheless , he managed to score another goal which knotted the game 1-1 but failed to convert a penalty kick late in the game that would have tied the game 2-2 .
the second half was all south korea as it began to look like germany were suffering from jet lag .
ballack recognized that they were " penalized " for the mistakes made in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea -lrb- in red -rrb- won more head ball duels - and the match , 3-1 klinsmann put things into perspective , even praising the team for permanently attacking .
characteristic of the optimistic coach , he said it was most important to get back on track in the thailand match .
they succeeded in doing this . the national squad will have time to think about their performance on the long plane ride back to germany .
they beat japan and thailand , but lost their first-ever match to an asian opponent on sunday against south korea .

but western countries , including germany , have vested interests in the matter .
critics say that 's clouded judgment of russia . while the forced dismantling of yukos by the kremlin has shaken many western investors ' confidence in russia as a place to do business , government officials even this month confirmed that berlin is actively encouraging german energy companies to invest in the russian energy sector .
german firms are already there .
e.on , a german utility , has through its subsidiary ruhrgas a 6 percent stake in gazprom , the state natural gas monopoly .
in a complex series of behind-the-scenes shuffling since yukos ' main unit , yuganskneftegaz , went on the auction block on sunday , gazprom or another kremlin-linked firm is thought by many analysts to likely be the future owner of yukos ' prize asset , which is responsible for 10 percent of the country 's crude oil output . " russia represents a huge opportunity and we germans have privileged access to the market , " bernd pfaffenbach , germany 's deputy economics minister , told financial times deutschland last week .
" there are signs that we might even be able to play a role in exploration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on , along with rwe , another leading energy group , told the paper they are considering expanding their interests in russia and would take another look at the assets of yukos after the auction . keen to do business the german government has shown eagerness to enter into business with russia .
chancellor gerhard schröder has announced a " strategic partnership " with russia , hoping to secure access for german companies to russia 's market and energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on a recent two-day visit to germany by russian president vladimir putin , schröder and the russian leader , who have a warm , personal relationship , talked extensively about strengthening business ties between the two countries .
germany energy chiefs regularly accompany schröder on trips he makes to russia . " trade between germany and russia is developing very dynamically , " schröder said on monday during putin 's visit to germany .
" russia is an enormously important market in which german companies must be present . " harsh criticism statements like these made during the controversy over yukos and the trips with energy executives has led critics , even those in schröder 's own party , to argue that the chancellor has focused on market access at the expense on other issues such as human rights in chechnya or putin 's one-time backing of viktor yanukovych , the ukrainian prime minister and disputed winner of the presidential election there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky robert amsterdam , a canadian lawyer representing mikhail khodorkovsy , the yukos ' founder who is currently in jail on charges of tax evasion , accused schröder of supporting the " breach of law " on the part of the russian government regarding the embattled oil giant .
he said schröder was well aware of the machinations on the part of moscow to gain control of yukos , but that he had turned a blind eye since criticism would not be in the best interests of german energy concerns . amsterdam also levelled criticism against deutsche bank and dresdner bank , accusing them and other multinationals of a willingness to help finance the forced dismantlement of yukos .
the two german banks , along with abn amro , bnp paribas , calyon and j.p. morgan , were to lend gazprom the billions needed to buy the yuganskneftegaz unit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's state-owned oil company rosneft 's headquarters on the moscow river in the end , however , the banks backed out of the deal and russia sold yuganskneftegaz to a previously unheard-of company , baikal finance group , which days later was bought by the russian state oil firm rosneft .

on paper the japanese , under a former brazilian superstar , stood even higher -lrb- 17th -rrb- in the world rankings than the germans -lrb- 19th -rrb- .
that , however , shows how flawed ranking systems can be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany -lrb- in red -rrb- played with gusto against asian champs japan despite arriving just two days before in yokohama , germany played strongly .
midfielder michael ballack was anxious to run on the pitch of the world cup final stadium from two years ago .
then he had to watch from the sidelines because he had received a second yellow card in the semifinal against south korea . it was a match of firsts since the german coach is still experimenting with possible lineups during the long march to world cup 2006 .
defenders patrick owomoyela and christian schulz made their debuts on the national team .
owomoyela made a good impression , schulz less so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's goalkeeper seigo narazaki , right , looks dejected as germany 's michael ballack celebrates his first goal under jürgen klinsmann particularly satisfying to klinsmann was that ballack played with zeal and imagination in a strong second half .
the bayern munich playmaker was rewarded with his first goal under the new coach .
striker miroslav klose scored twice more as germany surprisingly walked over the asian champion , 3-0 . klinsmann noted afterwards that there was a clear difference between the two sides .
even better , the record of the german team since jürgen klinsmann took over for rudi völler in july stood at four wins and one draw . first loss for coach klinsmann the euphoria of yokohama would become dismay at pusan three days later .
on sunday , the germans suffered defeat at the hands of south korea , the team that they had beaten to advance to the finals of the world cup in 2002 . ballack took a beating in the match , the victim of numerous fouls committed by aggressive south korean players .
nevertheless , he managed to score another goal which knotted the game 1-1 but failed to convert a penalty kick late in the game that would have tied the game 2-2 .
the second half was all south korea as it began to look like germany were suffering from jet lag .
ballack recognized that they were " penalized " for the mistakes made in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea -lrb- in red -rrb- won more head ball duels - and the match , 3-1 klinsmann put things into perspective , even praising the team for permanently attacking .
characteristic of the optimistic coach , he said it was most important to get back on track in the thailand match .
they succeeded in doing this . the national squad will have time to think about their performance on the long plane ride back to germany .
they beat japan and thailand , but lost their first-ever match to an asian opponent on sunday against south korea .

on paper the japanese , under a former brazilian superstar , stood even higher -lrb- 17th -rrb- in the world rankings than the germans -lrb- 19th -rrb- .
that , however , shows how flawed ranking systems can be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany -lrb- in red -rrb- played with gusto against asian champs japan despite arriving just two days before in yokohama , germany played strongly .
midfielder michael ballack was anxious to run on the pitch of the world cup final stadium from two years ago .
then he had to watch from the sidelines because he had received a second yellow card in the semifinal against south korea . it was a match of firsts since the german coach is still experimenting with possible lineups during the long march to world cup 2006 .
defenders patrick owomoyela and christian schulz made their debuts on the national team .
owomoyela made a good impression , schulz less so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's goalkeeper seigo narazaki , right , looks dejected as germany 's michael ballack celebrates his first goal under jürgen klinsmann particularly satisfying to klinsmann was that ballack played with zeal and imagination in a strong second half .
the bayern munich playmaker was rewarded with his first goal under the new coach .
striker miroslav klose scored twice more as germany surprisingly walked over the asian champion , 3-0 . klinsmann noted afterwards that there was a clear difference between the two sides .
even better , the record of the german team since jürgen klinsmann took over for rudi völler in july stood at four wins and one draw . first loss for coach klinsmann the euphoria of yokohama would become dismay at pusan three days later .
on sunday , the germans suffered defeat at the hands of south korea , the team that they had beaten to advance to the finals of the world cup in 2002 . ballack took a beating in the match , the victim of numerous fouls committed by aggressive south korean players .
nevertheless , he managed to score another goal which knotted the game 1-1 but failed to convert a penalty kick late in the game that would have tied the game 2-2 .
the second half was all south korea as it began to look like germany were suffering from jet lag .
ballack recognized that they were " penalized " for the mistakes made in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea -lrb- in red -rrb- won more head ball duels - and the match , 3-1 klinsmann put things into perspective , even praising the team for permanently attacking .
characteristic of the optimistic coach , he said it was most important to get back on track in the thailand match .
they succeeded in doing this . the national squad will have time to think about their performance on the long plane ride back to germany .
they beat japan and thailand , but lost their first-ever match to an asian opponent on sunday against south korea .

jürgen klinsmann 's squad returns home having won two games and losing one . after their 3-1 loss to south korea on sunday , coach jürgen klinsmann gave several of his first-string players a break , most notably goalie oliver kahn and midfield playmaker michael ballack .
on tuesday , the reserves put in an impressive performance against a hopelessly undermanned thailand winning 5-1 . the goals came from kevin kuranyi -lrb- 34th and 38th minute -rrb- , lukas podolski -lrb- 73rd and 89th -rrb- as well as gerald asamoah -lrb- 84th minute -rrb- .
thailand put a bit of fear into the germans at one point by pulling to within just one goal in the 57th minute on a goal by striker chaikamdee sarayoot . the match was played primarily in one direction — that of the thai goal .
thailand 's coach , former german national player siggi held , can thank his goalkeeper kosin hathairattanakool that the final score was not more lopsided .
after the game , held expressed his irritation by saying that his team did not do what he has drilled into them on the practice field . missed opportunities in the first 30 minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi -lrb- right -rrb- found the net twice against thailand german coach jürgen klinsmann was more relaxed in the post-match interview .
on german public television , he complimented the team for pushing forward the whole match .
in the first half-hour of the game , though , he must have been raging inside . compared to sunday 's match , there was lots of room for both teams to develop their games , particularly on the german side .
strikers asamoah und thomas brdaric gave away clear chances .
bastian schweinsteiger 's direct kick hit the crossbar . finally , 11 minutes before the half , kuranyi broke the scoreless tie after a thai player lost the ball to him outside the penalty area .
four minutes later , asamoah lofted a cross to kuranyi who headed the ball into the goal .
that seemed to be all that the germans needed to take apart the team ranked 79th in the world . podolski scores first goals for germany in the second half , brdaric hit metal and then thailand struck .
friedrich nonchalantly lost a ball at midfield and the thais raced downfield leaving keeper hildebrand without a chance .
klinsmann then brought in lukas podolski who revived the germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arne friedrich -lrb- right -rrb- wore captain 's armband for first time his two goals , his first on the national team , certainly raised his stock of claiming a spot on the world cup 2006 squad .

after the asian tour , it 's time to take a look at just what the former international striker has accomplished since august . when jürgen klinsmann was appointed national coach five months ago , experts and fans were wondering if the german soccer federation had n't gone a little mad .
the former international striker who helped lead germany to victory in the 1990 world cup had almost no coaching experience .
aside from spending his time assisting with an american soccer franchise in los angeles , klinsmann didn ’ t really have much coaching clout to his name . but the soccer federation dfb was in search of a new national head .
the former coach , rudi völler , had just thrown in the towel after a devastating showing at the european championships in june , and many people thought it was time for some old-fashioned discipline to come in and whip the tired team into shape . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birds of a feather - coach and former striker klinsmann with goal-shooter kevin kuranyi the candidates from the old school , most notably greek national coach and euro 2004 champ otto rehhagel and former bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld , had rejected offers to take over the squad .
with world cup 2006 taking place in germany , the dfb began looking further a field . that ’ s when german soccer big-wigs focused on klinsmann .
it was time to bring in some california sunshine .
and everyone agreed : optimism is one quality not lacking in klinsmann 's personality . a firm believer in miracles soccer ’ s sunny boy came to germany and immediately made waves .
" i know that the fans in our country have one wish - to win the 2006 world cup .
that is also my aim , " klinsmann told the media at his first press conference . but he quickly realized and admitted to the public that the nation ’ s no. 1 goal could not be achieved with the squad that showed up at the euro 2004 , or at least not with their attitude .
so , klinsi , as he ’ s affectionately called , went to work .
new players , new tactics and a new mentality were part of his game strategy . before the friendly with brazil in september , he called in a fitness trainer from the us to consult with the players , a first on the national squad .
he also started bringing on new players , which caused more than a few eyebrows to rise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's red uniforms part of new team mentality klinsmann wanted to form the team according to his wishes .
he told the german sports press agency , sid , that he and his assistant coach , joachim löw , and team manager , oliver bierhoff , wanted to create a new basic philosophy and convey it to the players .
in addition , klinsmann firmly believed that a new team identity would help germany reach the ambitious goal of raising the world cup trophy in 2006 . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsi 's squad dismantles thais the german national soccer team ended its three-game asian tour with an easy 5-1 victory over thailand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.12.2004 experts criticize eu over human trafficking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the eu needs to focus more on human trafficking 's victims eu justice commissioner franco frattini announced wednesday the bloc would intensify efforts to stop human trafficking .
but experts said that the eu neglects the victims . frattini was responding to a report by a panel of experts on people smuggling who recommended improved coordination between national and eu level authorities . " we are obliged to pursue human trafficking from a moral as well as a security perspective , " the former italian foreign minister said .
" trafficking of human beings is a crime which often acts as a door to other serious crimes , such as … trafficking in drugs , firearms , prostitution , money laundering and other forms of organized crime , " he added . but the panel of experts the eu commissioned to examine the issue accused the bloc of concentrating solely on the process of trafficking and failing to address where the demand stems from .
merely pursuing smugglers was not enough , said the head of the panel , marjan wijers . " if we look at international human rights law , states not only have a duty to prevent and punish trafficking as a violation of human rights , but also to provide the victims with adequate remedies , wijers said .
" up until now states have predominantly concentrated on measures in the area of crime control and migration policies rather than on victim assistance and protection .
to effectively tackle trafficking this imbalance needs to be redressed . "
kidnapped and helpless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini the victims are often utterly dependent on their employers as they are unable to legally apply for residence permits , wijers said .
entire industries rely on the illegal workers who are kept as slaves , she said .
the authorities should develop witness protection programs for victims willing to testify against traffickers and national referral mechanisms to identify victims . the eu has already committed to an international convention against human trafficking , and frattini said he would draft concrete plans for action early next year . he cited intelligence and police information as identifying a growing demand for underage girls .
women from eastern europe , particularly ukraine , moldova , romania and bulgaria continue to make up the largest number of victims , while a considerable amount came from nigeria and were brought to britain and italy .
kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina are the centers of activity for smugglers , he said . the eu took issue with romania and bulgaria over human trafficking in recently completed accession talks with the countries , and now bucharest and sofia have to take action , frattini said . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping victims of human trafficking dreams of a better life often end in a brothel for the victims of human trafficking , with the people smugglers and slave traders who bring them there making a lucrative living from their misery .

after the asian tour , it 's time to take a look at just what the former international striker has accomplished since august . when jürgen klinsmann was appointed national coach five months ago , experts and fans were wondering if the german soccer federation had n't gone a little mad .
the former international striker who helped lead germany to victory in the 1990 world cup had almost no coaching experience .
aside from spending his time assisting with an american soccer franchise in los angeles , klinsmann didn ’ t really have much coaching clout to his name . but the soccer federation dfb was in search of a new national head .

it was time to bring in some california sunshine .
and everyone agreed : optimism is one quality not lacking in klinsmann 's personality . a firm believer in miracles soccer ’ s sunny boy came to germany and immediately made waves .

jürgen klinsmann 's squad returns home having won two games and losing one . after their 3-1 loss to south korea on sunday , coach jürgen klinsmann gave several of his first-string players a break , most notably goalie oliver kahn and midfield playmaker michael ballack .
on tuesday , the reserves put in an impressive performance against a hopelessly undermanned thailand winning 5-1 . the goals came from kevin kuranyi -lrb- 34th and 38th minute -rrb- , lukas podolski -lrb- 73rd and 89th -rrb- as well as gerald asamoah -lrb- 84th minute -rrb- .
thailand put a bit of fear into the germans at one point by pulling to within just one goal in the 57th minute on a goal by striker chaikamdee sarayoot . the match was played primarily in one direction — that of the thai goal .
thailand 's coach , former german national player siggi held , can thank his goalkeeper kosin hathairattanakool that the final score was not more lopsided .
after the game , held expressed his irritation by saying that his team did not do what he has drilled into them on the practice field . missed opportunities in the first 30 minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi -lrb- right -rrb- found the net twice against thailand german coach jürgen klinsmann was more relaxed in the post-match interview .
on german public television , he complimented the team for pushing forward the whole match .
in the first half-hour of the game , though , he must have been raging inside . compared to sunday 's match , there was lots of room for both teams to develop their games , particularly on the german side .
strikers asamoah und thomas brdaric gave away clear chances .
bastian schweinsteiger 's direct kick hit the crossbar . finally , 11 minutes before the half , kuranyi broke the scoreless tie after a thai player lost the ball to him outside the penalty area .
four minutes later , asamoah lofted a cross to kuranyi who headed the ball into the goal .
that seemed to be all that the germans needed to take apart the team ranked 79th in the world . podolski scores first goals for germany in the second half , brdaric hit metal and then thailand struck .
friedrich nonchalantly lost a ball at midfield and the thais raced downfield leaving keeper hildebrand without a chance .
klinsmann then brought in lukas podolski who revived the germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arne friedrich -lrb- right -rrb- wore captain 's armband for first time his two goals , his first on the national team , certainly raised his stock of claiming a spot on the world cup 2006 squad .

jürgen klinsmann 's squad returns home having won two games and losing one . after their 3-1 loss to south korea on sunday , coach jürgen klinsmann gave several of his first-string players a break , most notably goalie oliver kahn and midfield playmaker michael ballack .
on tuesday , the reserves put in an impressive performance against a hopelessly undermanned thailand winning 5-1 . the goals came from kevin kuranyi -lrb- 34th and 38th minute -rrb- , lukas podolski -lrb- 73rd and 89th -rrb- as well as gerald asamoah -lrb- 84th minute -rrb- .
thailand put a bit of fear into the germans at one point by pulling to within just one goal in the 57th minute on a goal by striker chaikamdee sarayoot . the match was played primarily in one direction — that of the thai goal .
thailand 's coach , former german national player siggi held , can thank his goalkeeper kosin hathairattanakool that the final score was not more lopsided .
after the game , held expressed his irritation by saying that his team did not do what he has drilled into them on the practice field . missed opportunities in the first 30 minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi -lrb- right -rrb- found the net twice against thailand german coach jürgen klinsmann was more relaxed in the post-match interview .
on german public television , he complimented the team for pushing forward the whole match .
in the first half-hour of the game , though , he must have been raging inside . compared to sunday 's match , there was lots of room for both teams to develop their games , particularly on the german side .
strikers asamoah und thomas brdaric gave away clear chances .
bastian schweinsteiger 's direct kick hit the crossbar . finally , 11 minutes before the half , kuranyi broke the scoreless tie after a thai player lost the ball to him outside the penalty area .
four minutes later , asamoah lofted a cross to kuranyi who headed the ball into the goal .
that seemed to be all that the germans needed to take apart the team ranked 79th in the world . podolski scores first goals for germany in the second half , brdaric hit metal and then thailand struck .
friedrich nonchalantly lost a ball at midfield and the thais raced downfield leaving keeper hildebrand without a chance .
klinsmann then brought in lukas podolski who revived the germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arne friedrich -lrb- right -rrb- wore captain 's armband for first time his two goals , his first on the national team , certainly raised his stock of claiming a spot on the world cup 2006 squad . " i just wanted to go in there and play a good game , " said the cologne striker .
that he did .

after the asian tour , it 's time to take a look at just what the former international striker has accomplished since august . when jürgen klinsmann was appointed national coach five months ago , experts and fans were wondering if the german soccer federation had n't gone a little mad .
the former international striker who helped lead germany to victory in the 1990 world cup had almost no coaching experience .
aside from spending his time assisting with an american soccer franchise in los angeles , klinsmann didn ’ t really have much coaching clout to his name . but the soccer federation dfb was in search of a new national head .
the former coach , rudi völler , had just thrown in the towel after a devastating showing at the european championships in june , and many people thought it was time for some old-fashioned discipline to come in and whip the tired team into shape . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birds of a feather - coach and former striker klinsmann with goal-shooter kevin kuranyi the candidates from the old school , most notably greek national coach and euro 2004 champ otto rehhagel and former bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld , had rejected offers to take over the squad .
with world cup 2006 taking place in germany , the dfb began looking further a field . that ’ s when german soccer big-wigs focused on klinsmann .
it was time to bring in some california sunshine .
and everyone agreed : optimism is one quality not lacking in klinsmann 's personality . a firm believer in miracles soccer ’ s sunny boy came to germany and immediately made waves .
" i know that the fans in our country have one wish - to win the 2006 world cup .
that is also my aim , " klinsmann told the media at his first press conference . but he quickly realized and admitted to the public that the nation ’ s no. 1 goal could not be achieved with the squad that showed up at the euro 2004 , or at least not with their attitude .
so , klinsi , as he ’ s affectionately called , went to work .
new players , new tactics and a new mentality were part of his game strategy . before the friendly with brazil in september , he called in a fitness trainer from the us to consult with the players , a first on the national squad .
he also started bringing on new players , which caused more than a few eyebrows to rise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's red uniforms part of new team mentality klinsmann wanted to form the team according to his wishes .
he told the german sports press agency , sid , that he and his assistant coach , joachim löw , and team manager , oliver bierhoff , wanted to create a new basic philosophy and convey it to the players .
in addition , klinsmann firmly believed that a new team identity would help germany reach the ambitious goal of raising the world cup trophy in 2006 . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsi 's squad dismantles thais the german national soccer team ended its three-game asian tour with an easy 5-1 victory over thailand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.12.2004 blinded by energy interests ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say germany is ignoring moscow 's heavy-handed tactics moscow insists the controversy over oil company yukos is an internal affair .
but western countries , including germany , have vested interests in the matter .
critics say that 's clouded judgment of russia . while the forced dismantling of yukos by the kremlin has shaken many western investors ' confidence in russia as a place to do business , government officials even this month confirmed that berlin is actively encouraging german energy companies to invest in the russian energy sector .
german firms are already there .
e.on , a german utility , has through its subsidiary ruhrgas a 6 percent stake in gazprom , the state natural gas monopoly .
in a complex series of behind-the-scenes shuffling since yukos ' main unit , yuganskneftegaz , went on the auction block on sunday , gazprom or another kremlin-linked firm is thought by many analysts to likely be the future owner of yukos ' prize asset , which is responsible for 10 percent of the country 's crude oil output . " russia represents a huge opportunity and we germans have privileged access to the market , " bernd pfaffenbach , germany 's deputy economics minister , told financial times deutschland last week .
" there are signs that we might even be able to play a role in exploration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on , along with rwe , another leading energy group , told the paper they are considering expanding their interests in russia and would take another look at the assets of yukos after the auction . keen to do business the german government has shown eagerness to enter into business with russia .
chancellor gerhard schröder has announced a " strategic partnership " with russia , hoping to secure access for german companies to russia 's market and energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on a recent two-day visit to germany by russian president vladimir putin , schröder and the russian leader , who have a warm , personal relationship , talked extensively about strengthening business ties between the two countries .
germany energy chiefs regularly accompany schröder on trips he makes to russia . " trade between germany and russia is developing very dynamically , " schröder said on monday during putin 's visit to germany .
" russia is an enormously important market in which german companies must be present . " harsh criticism statements like these made during the controversy over yukos and the trips with energy executives has led critics , even those in schröder 's own party , to argue that the chancellor has focused on market access at the expense on other issues such as human rights in chechnya or putin 's one-time backing of viktor yanukovych , the ukrainian prime minister and disputed winner of the presidential election there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky robert amsterdam , a canadian lawyer representing mikhail khodorkovsy , the yukos ' founder who is currently in jail on charges of tax evasion , accused schröder of supporting the " breach of law " on the part of the russian government regarding the embattled oil giant .
he said schröder was well aware of the machinations on the part of moscow to gain control of yukos , but that he had turned a blind eye since criticism would not be in the best interests of german energy concerns . amsterdam also levelled criticism against deutsche bank and dresdner bank , accusing them and other multinationals of a willingness to help finance the forced dismantlement of yukos .
the two german banks , along with abn amro , bnp paribas , calyon and j.p. morgan , were to lend gazprom the billions needed to buy the yuganskneftegaz unit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's state-owned oil company rosneft 's headquarters on the moscow river in the end , however , the banks backed out of the deal and russia sold yuganskneftegaz to a previously unheard-of company , baikal finance group , which days later was bought by the russian state oil firm rosneft .
rosneft 's chairman , igor sechin , is a close associate of vladimir putin and doubles as deputy head of the kremlin administration . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany bound to russia over energy policy germany is dependent on russia for some 40 percent of its natural gas , and the amount is set to grow , experts warn .

but western countries , including germany , have vested interests in the matter .
critics say that 's clouded judgment of russia . while the forced dismantling of yukos by the kremlin has shaken many western investors ' confidence in russia as a place to do business , government officials even this month confirmed that berlin is actively encouraging german energy companies to invest in the russian energy sector .
german firms are already there .
e.on , a german utility , has through its subsidiary ruhrgas a 6 percent stake in gazprom , the state natural gas monopoly .
in a complex series of behind-the-scenes shuffling since yukos ' main unit , yuganskneftegaz , went on the auction block on sunday , gazprom or another kremlin-linked firm is thought by many analysts to likely be the future owner of yukos ' prize asset , which is responsible for 10 percent of the country 's crude oil output . " russia represents a huge opportunity and we germans have privileged access to the market , " bernd pfaffenbach , germany 's deputy economics minister , told financial times deutschland last week .
" there are signs that we might even be able to play a role in exploration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on , along with rwe , another leading energy group , told the paper they are considering expanding their interests in russia and would take another look at the assets of yukos after the auction . keen to do business the german government has shown eagerness to enter into business with russia .
chancellor gerhard schröder has announced a " strategic partnership " with russia , hoping to secure access for german companies to russia 's market and energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on a recent two-day visit to germany by russian president vladimir putin , schröder and the russian leader , who have a warm , personal relationship , talked extensively about strengthening business ties between the two countries .
germany energy chiefs regularly accompany schröder on trips he makes to russia . " trade between germany and russia is developing very dynamically , " schröder said on monday during putin 's visit to germany .
" russia is an enormously important market in which german companies must be present . " harsh criticism statements like these made during the controversy over yukos and the trips with energy executives has led critics , even those in schröder 's own party , to argue that the chancellor has focused on market access at the expense on other issues such as human rights in chechnya or putin 's one-time backing of viktor yanukovych , the ukrainian prime minister and disputed winner of the presidential election there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky robert amsterdam , a canadian lawyer representing mikhail khodorkovsy , the yukos ' founder who is currently in jail on charges of tax evasion , accused schröder of supporting the " breach of law " on the part of the russian government regarding the embattled oil giant .
he said schröder was well aware of the machinations on the part of moscow to gain control of yukos , but that he had turned a blind eye since criticism would not be in the best interests of german energy concerns . amsterdam also levelled criticism against deutsche bank and dresdner bank , accusing them and other multinationals of a willingness to help finance the forced dismantlement of yukos .
the two german banks , along with abn amro , bnp paribas , calyon and j.p. morgan , were to lend gazprom the billions needed to buy the yuganskneftegaz unit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's state-owned oil company rosneft 's headquarters on the moscow river in the end , however , the banks backed out of the deal and russia sold yuganskneftegaz to a previously unheard-of company , baikal finance group , which days later was bought by the russian state oil firm rosneft .
rosneft 's chairman , igor sechin , is a close associate of vladimir putin and doubles as deputy head of the kremlin administration . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany bound to russia over energy policy germany is dependent on russia for some 40 percent of its natural gas , and the amount is set to grow , experts warn .

but experts said that the eu neglects the victims . frattini was responding to a report by a panel of experts on people smuggling who recommended improved coordination between national and eu level authorities . " we are obliged to pursue human trafficking from a moral as well as a security perspective , " the former italian foreign minister said .
" trafficking of human beings is a crime which often acts as a door to other serious crimes , such as … trafficking in drugs , firearms , prostitution , money laundering and other forms of organized crime , " he added . but the panel of experts the eu commissioned to examine the issue accused the bloc of concentrating solely on the process of trafficking and failing to address where the demand stems from .
merely pursuing smugglers was not enough , said the head of the panel , marjan wijers . " if we look at international human rights law , states not only have a duty to prevent and punish trafficking as a violation of human rights , but also to provide the victims with adequate remedies , wijers said .
" up until now states have predominantly concentrated on measures in the area of crime control and migration policies rather than on victim assistance and protection .
to effectively tackle trafficking this imbalance needs to be redressed . "
kidnapped and helpless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini the victims are often utterly dependent on their employers as they are unable to legally apply for residence permits , wijers said .
entire industries rely on the illegal workers who are kept as slaves , she said .
the authorities should develop witness protection programs for victims willing to testify against traffickers and national referral mechanisms to identify victims . the eu has already committed to an international convention against human trafficking , and frattini said he would draft concrete plans for action early next year . he cited intelligence and police information as identifying a growing demand for underage girls .
women from eastern europe , particularly ukraine , moldova , romania and bulgaria continue to make up the largest number of victims , while a considerable amount came from nigeria and were brought to britain and italy .
kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina are the centers of activity for smugglers , he said . the eu took issue with romania and bulgaria over human trafficking in recently completed accession talks with the countries , and now bucharest and sofia have to take action , frattini said . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping victims of human trafficking dreams of a better life often end in a brothel for the victims of human trafficking , with the people smugglers and slave traders who bring them there making a lucrative living from their misery .

" if one compares how many jews were murdered in the holocaust and how many have immigrated and could still come - the relations speak for themselves , " the head of the central council of jews in germany told reuters wednesday .
" in public , the discussion comes across as if germany had been flooded with jewish immigrants in recent years , " he said .
" since 1989 around 190,000 jews have immigrated to germany , and it is n't expected that hundreds of thousands more will come . "
aiding integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : synagogue in berlin 's rykestrasse according to news reports , the new regulations will only allow jews from cis countries to immigrate to germany if they are under 45 years of age , speak german , can show an invitation from a german jewish community and can prove that they will not live from social welfare .
the changes are meant to improve the integration of the immigrants , who some say show too little readiness to become part of german society .
the new rules are in keeping with those applied to other immigrant groups . in 1991 , germany introduced quotas for jews immigrating from cis countries .
the immigrants were expected to strengthen germany 's jewish communities that in the wake of the holocaust only counted around 30,000 members .
however , only 83,000 of those who immigrated since then officially joined the jewish community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily spiegel criticized the interior ministry for informing the central council of jews in germany - over which he presides - about the changes at such a late date .
the changes must be approved by germany 's federal states and would come into effect in 2006 . otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- confirmed wednesday after a discussion with spiegel that he had - as in the past - promised no changes would be made to the immigration regulations for jews without the central council 's agreement . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to limit immigration of russian jews germany plans to stop offering unlimited immigration to jews from russia and eastern europe starting jan .

striker miroslav klose scored twice more as germany surprisingly walked over the asian champion , 3-0 . klinsmann noted afterwards that there was a clear difference between the two sides .
even better , the record of the german team since jürgen klinsmann took over for rudi völler in july stood at four wins and one draw . first loss for coach klinsmann the euphoria of yokohama would become dismay at pusan three days later .
on sunday , the germans suffered defeat at the hands of south korea , the team that they had beaten to advance to the finals of the world cup in 2002 . ballack took a beating in the match , the victim of numerous fouls committed by aggressive south korean players .
nevertheless , he managed to score another goal which knotted the game 1-1 but failed to convert a penalty kick late in the game that would have tied the game 2-2 .
the second half was all south korea as it began to look like germany were suffering from jet lag .
ballack recognized that they were " penalized " for the mistakes made in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea -lrb- in red -rrb- won more head ball duels - and the match , 3-1 klinsmann put things into perspective , even praising the team for permanently attacking .

now , as you know , we have n't found little green men on the red planet .

that means mars was the kind of place , maybe like that back bottom shelf of your refrigerator , where life might have had a chance to flourish .
the mars rover , from nasa , is called " opportunity " , and at the max planck institute for chemistry -lrb- mpic -rrb- , in mainz , germany , scientists built the machine which measured the chemical composition of dust and stones where opportunity rolled .
it 's named the alpha particle x-ray spectrometer , but you can just call it apxs , or the " good nose " -lrb- spürnase -rrb- , as they call it in mainz .
here 's a picture ; the good nose is the round piece staring out from the rover .
bildunterschrift : mars apxs this friendly looking little machine can handle some tough environments , like rocky outcroppings on the martian surface below -500c .
to tell us about the chemistry of mars , the good nose sends out alpha particles and x-rays and senses the characteristic x-rays that are scattered back from the dust or rocks .
you 'll hear more about those when you click on the audio interview below with dr. lugmair , whose group at the mpic built the apxs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.12.2004 blinded by energy interests ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say germany is ignoring moscow 's heavy-handed tactics moscow insists the controversy over oil company yukos is an internal affair .
but western countries , including germany , have vested interests in the matter .
critics say that 's clouded judgment of russia . while the forced dismantling of yukos by the kremlin has shaken many western investors ' confidence in russia as a place to do business , government officials even this month confirmed that berlin is actively encouraging german energy companies to invest in the russian energy sector .
german firms are already there .
e.on , a german utility , has through its subsidiary ruhrgas a 6 percent stake in gazprom , the state natural gas monopoly .
in a complex series of behind-the-scenes shuffling since yukos ' main unit , yuganskneftegaz , went on the auction block on sunday , gazprom or another kremlin-linked firm is thought by many analysts to likely be the future owner of yukos ' prize asset , which is responsible for 10 percent of the country 's crude oil output . " russia represents a huge opportunity and we germans have privileged access to the market , " bernd pfaffenbach , germany 's deputy economics minister , told financial times deutschland last week .
" there are signs that we might even be able to play a role in exploration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on , along with rwe , another leading energy group , told the paper they are considering expanding their interests in russia and would take another look at the assets of yukos after the auction . keen to do business the german government has shown eagerness to enter into business with russia .
chancellor gerhard schröder has announced a " strategic partnership " with russia , hoping to secure access for german companies to russia 's market and energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on a recent two-day visit to germany by russian president vladimir putin , schröder and the russian leader , who have a warm , personal relationship , talked extensively about strengthening business ties between the two countries .
germany energy chiefs regularly accompany schröder on trips he makes to russia . " trade between germany and russia is developing very dynamically , " schröder said on monday during putin 's visit to germany .

the bayern munich playmaker was rewarded with his first goal under the new coach .
striker miroslav klose scored twice more as germany surprisingly walked over the asian champion , 3-0 . klinsmann noted afterwards that there was a clear difference between the two sides .
even better , the record of the german team since jürgen klinsmann took over for rudi völler in july stood at four wins and one draw . first loss for coach klinsmann the euphoria of yokohama would become dismay at pusan three days later .
on sunday , the germans suffered defeat at the hands of south korea , the team that they had beaten to advance to the finals of the world cup in 2002 . ballack took a beating in the match , the victim of numerous fouls committed by aggressive south korean players .
nevertheless , he managed to score another goal which knotted the game 1-1 but failed to convert a penalty kick late in the game that would have tied the game 2-2 .
the second half was all south korea as it began to look like germany were suffering from jet lag .
ballack recognized that they were " penalized " for the mistakes made in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea -lrb- in red -rrb- won more head ball duels - and the match , 3-1 klinsmann put things into perspective , even praising the team for permanently attacking .
characteristic of the optimistic coach , he said it was most important to get back on track in the thailand match .
they succeeded in doing this . the national squad will have time to think about their performance on the long plane ride back to germany .

after the asian tour , it 's time to take a look at just what the former international striker has accomplished since august . when jürgen klinsmann was appointed national coach five months ago , experts and fans were wondering if the german soccer federation had n't gone a little mad .
the former international striker who helped lead germany to victory in the 1990 world cup had almost no coaching experience .
aside from spending his time assisting with an american soccer franchise in los angeles , klinsmann didn ’ t really have much coaching clout to his name . but the soccer federation dfb was in search of a new national head .
the former coach , rudi völler , had just thrown in the towel after a devastating showing at the european championships in june , and many people thought it was time for some old-fashioned discipline to come in and whip the tired team into shape . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birds of a feather - coach and former striker klinsmann with goal-shooter kevin kuranyi the candidates from the old school , most notably greek national coach and euro 2004 champ otto rehhagel and former bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld , had rejected offers to take over the squad .
with world cup 2006 taking place in germany , the dfb began looking further a field . that ’ s when german soccer big-wigs focused on klinsmann .
it was time to bring in some california sunshine .
and everyone agreed : optimism is one quality not lacking in klinsmann 's personality . a firm believer in miracles soccer ’ s sunny boy came to germany and immediately made waves .
" i know that the fans in our country have one wish - to win the 2006 world cup .
that is also my aim , " klinsmann told the media at his first press conference . but he quickly realized and admitted to the public that the nation ’ s no. 1 goal could not be achieved with the squad that showed up at the euro 2004 , or at least not with their attitude .
so , klinsi , as he ’ s affectionately called , went to work .
new players , new tactics and a new mentality were part of his game strategy . before the friendly with brazil in september , he called in a fitness trainer from the us to consult with the players , a first on the national squad .
he also started bringing on new players , which caused more than a few eyebrows to rise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's red uniforms part of new team mentality klinsmann wanted to form the team according to his wishes .
he told the german sports press agency , sid , that he and his assistant coach , joachim löw , and team manager , oliver bierhoff , wanted to create a new basic philosophy and convey it to the players .
in addition , klinsmann firmly believed that a new team identity would help germany reach the ambitious goal of raising the world cup trophy in 2006 . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsi 's squad dismantles thais the german national soccer team ended its three-game asian tour with an easy 5-1 victory over thailand .

the difficulty of letting go was largely the result of the d-mark 's success story .
the first d-mark bills printed for the currency reform caused an immensely dynamic boom in postwar germany .
the currency reform , the deutsche mark and the so-called " economic miracle " in the 1950s and ' 60s are inextricably linked to each other in the minds of the germans . in the beginning , germany profited from the fact that other countries viewed the deutsche mark with distrust and that it was chronically undervalued for years .
that helped the german economy achieve huge success in exports and led to full employment and a labor shortage that resulted in recruiting guest workers from greece , portugal , turkey and other southern european countries - practically inconceivable today . legendary stability and for 50 years the deutsche mark survived many a storm , including the oil price shocks during the 1970s and the two-digit salary increases demanded by trade unions that wanted to ensure workers profited as much as possible from the new prosperity .
things like that are hard on any currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche marks -lrb- left -rrb- still , the german central bank always managed to maintain the currency 's stability and to stem inflation .
thanks to the bundesbank 's constitutional independence - a model for the european central bank - it not only kept the mark stable but also turned it into a leading currency that , along with the dollar , was recognized worldwide the germans were n't proud of their black-red-gold flag or the eagle in their national emblem , but they were proud of the mark .
many other europeans found it easier to give up their national currency for the euro possibly because they secretly hoped to inherit some of the d-mark 's legendary stability .
and since euro cash was introduced into circulation on jan .
1 , 2002 , the currency has remained surprisingly stable .
the euro has neither made cars nor washing machines more expensive - at the most it 's effected food , drink and some services .
due to the current weakness of the dollar , europeans are much less effected than people in other parts of the world by the exorbitant price hikes for crude oil , steel and other raw materials .
and they can enjoy much cheaper holidays in countries using the us dollar or that tie their currencies to the dollar - though this has less to do with the strong euros than with the weak dollar . spurring reliability all in all , germans consider the mark history , and they do just fine with the euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an audi assembly line in györ , hungary with one exception .
german companies used to be obliged to justify their high world market prices - caused by the highly valued d-mark and high wages - through innovation , efficiency , quality and reliability .
they called the strong deutsche mark an " innovation whip . " today european firms are in a similar situation with the strong euro and the comparatively high level of european incomes .
but instead of focusing on innovation , quality and efficiency they seem to have shifted the rat race to wages , working hours and working conditions more and more germans are expected to work longer hours for less money to preserve their jobs .
at the same time , it seems apparent that western europe can not win against the low wages and weak currencies of the competition from eastern europe or asia . the strong euro ca n't be blamed for this futile race .

things like that are hard on any currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche marks -lrb- left -rrb- still , the german central bank always managed to maintain the currency 's stability and to stem inflation .
thanks to the bundesbank 's constitutional independence - a model for the european central bank - it not only kept the mark stable but also turned it into a leading currency that , along with the dollar , was recognized worldwide the germans were n't proud of their black-red-gold flag or the eagle in their national emblem , but they were proud of the mark .
many other europeans found it easier to give up their national currency for the euro possibly because they secretly hoped to inherit some of the d-mark 's legendary stability .
and since euro cash was introduced into circulation on jan .
1 , 2002 , the currency has remained surprisingly stable .
the euro has neither made cars nor washing machines more expensive - at the most it 's effected food , drink and some services .
due to the current weakness of the dollar , europeans are much less effected than people in other parts of the world by the exorbitant price hikes for crude oil , steel and other raw materials .
and they can enjoy much cheaper holidays in countries using the us dollar or that tie their currencies to the dollar - though this has less to do with the strong euros than with the weak dollar . spurring reliability all in all , germans consider the mark history , and they do just fine with the euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an audi assembly line in györ , hungary with one exception .
german companies used to be obliged to justify their high world market prices - caused by the highly valued d-mark and high wages - through innovation , efficiency , quality and reliability .
they called the strong deutsche mark an " innovation whip . " today european firms are in a similar situation with the strong euro and the comparatively high level of european incomes .
but instead of focusing on innovation , quality and efficiency they seem to have shifted the rat race to wages , working hours and working conditions more and more germans are expected to work longer hours for less money to preserve their jobs .
at the same time , it seems apparent that western europe can not win against the low wages and weak currencies of the competition from eastern europe or asia . the strong euro ca n't be blamed for this futile race .

after the asian tour , it 's time to take a look at just what the former international striker has accomplished since august . when jürgen klinsmann was appointed national coach five months ago , experts and fans were wondering if the german soccer federation had n't gone a little mad .
the former international striker who helped lead germany to victory in the 1990 world cup had almost no coaching experience .
aside from spending his time assisting with an american soccer franchise in los angeles , klinsmann didn ’ t really have much coaching clout to his name . but the soccer federation dfb was in search of a new national head .

the difficulty of letting go was largely the result of the d-mark 's success story .
the first d-mark bills printed for the currency reform caused an immensely dynamic boom in postwar germany .
the currency reform , the deutsche mark and the so-called " economic miracle " in the 1950s and ' 60s are inextricably linked to each other in the minds of the germans . in the beginning , germany profited from the fact that other countries viewed the deutsche mark with distrust and that it was chronically undervalued for years .
that helped the german economy achieve huge success in exports and led to full employment and a labor shortage that resulted in recruiting guest workers from greece , portugal , turkey and other southern european countries - practically inconceivable today . legendary stability and for 50 years the deutsche mark survived many a storm , including the oil price shocks during the 1970s and the two-digit salary increases demanded by trade unions that wanted to ensure workers profited as much as possible from the new prosperity .
things like that are hard on any currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche marks -lrb- left -rrb- still , the german central bank always managed to maintain the currency 's stability and to stem inflation .
thanks to the bundesbank 's constitutional independence - a model for the european central bank - it not only kept the mark stable but also turned it into a leading currency that , along with the dollar , was recognized worldwide the germans were n't proud of their black-red-gold flag or the eagle in their national emblem , but they were proud of the mark .
many other europeans found it easier to give up their national currency for the euro possibly because they secretly hoped to inherit some of the d-mark 's legendary stability .
and since euro cash was introduced into circulation on jan .
1 , 2002 , the currency has remained surprisingly stable .
the euro has neither made cars nor washing machines more expensive - at the most it 's effected food , drink and some services .
due to the current weakness of the dollar , europeans are much less effected than people in other parts of the world by the exorbitant price hikes for crude oil , steel and other raw materials .
and they can enjoy much cheaper holidays in countries using the us dollar or that tie their currencies to the dollar - though this has less to do with the strong euros than with the weak dollar . spurring reliability all in all , germans consider the mark history , and they do just fine with the euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an audi assembly line in györ , hungary with one exception .
german companies used to be obliged to justify their high world market prices - caused by the highly valued d-mark and high wages - through innovation , efficiency , quality and reliability .
they called the strong deutsche mark an " innovation whip . " today european firms are in a similar situation with the strong euro and the comparatively high level of european incomes .
but instead of focusing on innovation , quality and efficiency they seem to have shifted the rat race to wages , working hours and working conditions more and more germans are expected to work longer hours for less money to preserve their jobs .
at the same time , it seems apparent that western europe can not win against the low wages and weak currencies of the competition from eastern europe or asia . the strong euro ca n't be blamed for this futile race .

jürgen klinsmann 's squad returns home having won two games and losing one . after their 3-1 loss to south korea on sunday , coach jürgen klinsmann gave several of his first-string players a break , most notably goalie oliver kahn and midfield playmaker michael ballack .
on tuesday , the reserves put in an impressive performance against a hopelessly undermanned thailand winning 5-1 . the goals came from kevin kuranyi -lrb- 34th and 38th minute -rrb- , lukas podolski -lrb- 73rd and 89th -rrb- as well as gerald asamoah -lrb- 84th minute -rrb- .
thailand put a bit of fear into the germans at one point by pulling to within just one goal in the 57th minute on a goal by striker chaikamdee sarayoot . the match was played primarily in one direction — that of the thai goal .
thailand 's coach , former german national player siggi held , can thank his goalkeeper kosin hathairattanakool that the final score was not more lopsided .
after the game , held expressed his irritation by saying that his team did not do what he has drilled into them on the practice field . missed opportunities in the first 30 minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi -lrb- right -rrb- found the net twice against thailand german coach jürgen klinsmann was more relaxed in the post-match interview .
on german public television , he complimented the team for pushing forward the whole match .
in the first half-hour of the game , though , he must have been raging inside . compared to sunday 's match , there was lots of room for both teams to develop their games , particularly on the german side .
strikers asamoah und thomas brdaric gave away clear chances .
bastian schweinsteiger 's direct kick hit the crossbar . finally , 11 minutes before the half , kuranyi broke the scoreless tie after a thai player lost the ball to him outside the penalty area .
four minutes later , asamoah lofted a cross to kuranyi who headed the ball into the goal .
that seemed to be all that the germans needed to take apart the team ranked 79th in the world . podolski scores first goals for germany in the second half , brdaric hit metal and then thailand struck .
friedrich nonchalantly lost a ball at midfield and the thais raced downfield leaving keeper hildebrand without a chance .
klinsmann then brought in lukas podolski who revived the germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arne friedrich -lrb- right -rrb- wore captain 's armband for first time his two goals , his first on the national team , certainly raised his stock of claiming a spot on the world cup 2006 squad .

jürgen klinsmann 's squad returns home having won two games and losing one . after their 3-1 loss to south korea on sunday , coach jürgen klinsmann gave several of his first-string players a break , most notably goalie oliver kahn and midfield playmaker michael ballack .
on tuesday , the reserves put in an impressive performance against a hopelessly undermanned thailand winning 5-1 . the goals came from kevin kuranyi -lrb- 34th and 38th minute -rrb- , lukas podolski -lrb- 73rd and 89th -rrb- as well as gerald asamoah -lrb- 84th minute -rrb- .
thailand put a bit of fear into the germans at one point by pulling to within just one goal in the 57th minute on a goal by striker chaikamdee sarayoot . the match was played primarily in one direction — that of the thai goal .
thailand 's coach , former german national player siggi held , can thank his goalkeeper kosin hathairattanakool that the final score was not more lopsided .
after the game , held expressed his irritation by saying that his team did not do what he has drilled into them on the practice field . missed opportunities in the first 30 minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi -lrb- right -rrb- found the net twice against thailand german coach jürgen klinsmann was more relaxed in the post-match interview .
on german public television , he complimented the team for pushing forward the whole match .
in the first half-hour of the game , though , he must have been raging inside . compared to sunday 's match , there was lots of room for both teams to develop their games , particularly on the german side .
strikers asamoah und thomas brdaric gave away clear chances .
bastian schweinsteiger 's direct kick hit the crossbar . finally , 11 minutes before the half , kuranyi broke the scoreless tie after a thai player lost the ball to him outside the penalty area .
four minutes later , asamoah lofted a cross to kuranyi who headed the ball into the goal .
that seemed to be all that the germans needed to take apart the team ranked 79th in the world . podolski scores first goals for germany in the second half , brdaric hit metal and then thailand struck .
friedrich nonchalantly lost a ball at midfield and the thais raced downfield leaving keeper hildebrand without a chance .
klinsmann then brought in lukas podolski who revived the germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arne friedrich -lrb- right -rrb- wore captain 's armband for first time his two goals , his first on the national team , certainly raised his stock of claiming a spot on the world cup 2006 squad .

however , the company sought to play down the move as a ploy to win over lse . " our staff is made up of people from more than 30 different countries and english is already used as a language of common practice , " a spokeswoman said .
it has been decided that english will be deutsche börse 's corporate language from the start of january .

but experts said that the eu neglects the victims . frattini was responding to a report by a panel of experts on people smuggling who recommended improved coordination between national and eu level authorities . " we are obliged to pursue human trafficking from a moral as well as a security perspective , " the former italian foreign minister said .
" trafficking of human beings is a crime which often acts as a door to other serious crimes , such as … trafficking in drugs , firearms , prostitution , money laundering and other forms of organized crime , " he added . but the panel of experts the eu commissioned to examine the issue accused the bloc of concentrating solely on the process of trafficking and failing to address where the demand stems from .
merely pursuing smugglers was not enough , said the head of the panel , marjan wijers . " if we look at international human rights law , states not only have a duty to prevent and punish trafficking as a violation of human rights , but also to provide the victims with adequate remedies , wijers said .
" up until now states have predominantly concentrated on measures in the area of crime control and migration policies rather than on victim assistance and protection .
to effectively tackle trafficking this imbalance needs to be redressed . "

the authorities should develop witness protection programs for victims willing to testify against traffickers and national referral mechanisms to identify victims . the eu has already committed to an international convention against human trafficking , and frattini said he would draft concrete plans for action early next year . he cited intelligence and police information as identifying a growing demand for underage girls .
women from eastern europe , particularly ukraine , moldova , romania and bulgaria continue to make up the largest number of victims , while a considerable amount came from nigeria and were brought to britain and italy .

jürgen klinsmann 's squad returns home having won two games and losing one . after their 3-1 loss to south korea on sunday , coach jürgen klinsmann gave several of his first-string players a break , most notably goalie oliver kahn and midfield playmaker michael ballack .
on tuesday , the reserves put in an impressive performance against a hopelessly undermanned thailand winning 5-1 . the goals came from kevin kuranyi -lrb- 34th and 38th minute -rrb- , lukas podolski -lrb- 73rd and 89th -rrb- as well as gerald asamoah -lrb- 84th minute -rrb- .
thailand put a bit of fear into the germans at one point by pulling to within just one goal in the 57th minute on a goal by striker chaikamdee sarayoot . the match was played primarily in one direction — that of the thai goal .
thailand 's coach , former german national player siggi held , can thank his goalkeeper kosin hathairattanakool that the final score was not more lopsided .
after the game , held expressed his irritation by saying that his team did not do what he has drilled into them on the practice field . missed opportunities in the first 30 minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi -lrb- right -rrb- found the net twice against thailand german coach jürgen klinsmann was more relaxed in the post-match interview .
on german public television , he complimented the team for pushing forward the whole match .
in the first half-hour of the game , though , he must have been raging inside . compared to sunday 's match , there was lots of room for both teams to develop their games , particularly on the german side .
strikers asamoah und thomas brdaric gave away clear chances .
bastian schweinsteiger 's direct kick hit the crossbar . finally , 11 minutes before the half , kuranyi broke the scoreless tie after a thai player lost the ball to him outside the penalty area .
four minutes later , asamoah lofted a cross to kuranyi who headed the ball into the goal .
that seemed to be all that the germans needed to take apart the team ranked 79th in the world . podolski scores first goals for germany in the second half , brdaric hit metal and then thailand struck .
friedrich nonchalantly lost a ball at midfield and the thais raced downfield leaving keeper hildebrand without a chance .
klinsmann then brought in lukas podolski who revived the germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arne friedrich -lrb- right -rrb- wore captain 's armband for first time his two goals , his first on the national team , certainly raised his stock of claiming a spot on the world cup 2006 squad . " i just wanted to go in there and play a good game , " said the cologne striker .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.12.2004 experts criticize eu over human trafficking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the eu needs to focus more on human trafficking 's victims eu justice commissioner franco frattini announced wednesday the bloc would intensify efforts to stop human trafficking .
but experts said that the eu neglects the victims . frattini was responding to a report by a panel of experts on people smuggling who recommended improved coordination between national and eu level authorities . " we are obliged to pursue human trafficking from a moral as well as a security perspective , " the former italian foreign minister said .
" trafficking of human beings is a crime which often acts as a door to other serious crimes , such as … trafficking in drugs , firearms , prostitution , money laundering and other forms of organized crime , " he added . but the panel of experts the eu commissioned to examine the issue accused the bloc of concentrating solely on the process of trafficking and failing to address where the demand stems from .
merely pursuing smugglers was not enough , said the head of the panel , marjan wijers . " if we look at international human rights law , states not only have a duty to prevent and punish trafficking as a violation of human rights , but also to provide the victims with adequate remedies , wijers said .
" up until now states have predominantly concentrated on measures in the area of crime control and migration policies rather than on victim assistance and protection .
to effectively tackle trafficking this imbalance needs to be redressed . "
kidnapped and helpless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini the victims are often utterly dependent on their employers as they are unable to legally apply for residence permits , wijers said .
entire industries rely on the illegal workers who are kept as slaves , she said .
the authorities should develop witness protection programs for victims willing to testify against traffickers and national referral mechanisms to identify victims . the eu has already committed to an international convention against human trafficking , and frattini said he would draft concrete plans for action early next year . he cited intelligence and police information as identifying a growing demand for underage girls .
women from eastern europe , particularly ukraine , moldova , romania and bulgaria continue to make up the largest number of victims , while a considerable amount came from nigeria and were brought to britain and italy .
kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina are the centers of activity for smugglers , he said . the eu took issue with romania and bulgaria over human trafficking in recently completed accession talks with the countries , and now bucharest and sofia have to take action , frattini said . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping victims of human trafficking dreams of a better life often end in a brothel for the victims of human trafficking , with the people smugglers and slave traders who bring them there making a lucrative living from their misery .

jürgen klinsmann 's squad returns home having won two games and losing one . after their 3-1 loss to south korea on sunday , coach jürgen klinsmann gave several of his first-string players a break , most notably goalie oliver kahn and midfield playmaker michael ballack .
on tuesday , the reserves put in an impressive performance against a hopelessly undermanned thailand winning 5-1 . the goals came from kevin kuranyi -lrb- 34th and 38th minute -rrb- , lukas podolski -lrb- 73rd and 89th -rrb- as well as gerald asamoah -lrb- 84th minute -rrb- .
thailand put a bit of fear into the germans at one point by pulling to within just one goal in the 57th minute on a goal by striker chaikamdee sarayoot . the match was played primarily in one direction — that of the thai goal .

strikers asamoah und thomas brdaric gave away clear chances .
bastian schweinsteiger 's direct kick hit the crossbar . finally , 11 minutes before the half , kuranyi broke the scoreless tie after a thai player lost the ball to him outside the penalty area .
four minutes later , asamoah lofted a cross to kuranyi who headed the ball into the goal .
that seemed to be all that the germans needed to take apart the team ranked 79th in the world . podolski scores first goals for germany in the second half , brdaric hit metal and then thailand struck .
friedrich nonchalantly lost a ball at midfield and the thais raced downfield leaving keeper hildebrand without a chance .
klinsmann then brought in lukas podolski who revived the germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arne friedrich -lrb- right -rrb- wore captain 's armband for first time his two goals , his first on the national team , certainly raised his stock of claiming a spot on the world cup 2006 squad .

on paper the japanese , under a former brazilian superstar , stood even higher -lrb- 17th -rrb- in the world rankings than the germans -lrb- 19th -rrb- .
that , however , shows how flawed ranking systems can be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany -lrb- in red -rrb- played with gusto against asian champs japan despite arriving just two days before in yokohama , germany played strongly .
midfielder michael ballack was anxious to run on the pitch of the world cup final stadium from two years ago .
then he had to watch from the sidelines because he had received a second yellow card in the semifinal against south korea . it was a match of firsts since the german coach is still experimenting with possible lineups during the long march to world cup 2006 .
defenders patrick owomoyela and christian schulz made their debuts on the national team .
owomoyela made a good impression , schulz less so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's goalkeeper seigo narazaki , right , looks dejected as germany 's michael ballack celebrates his first goal under jürgen klinsmann particularly satisfying to klinsmann was that ballack played with zeal and imagination in a strong second half .
the bayern munich playmaker was rewarded with his first goal under the new coach .
striker miroslav klose scored twice more as germany surprisingly walked over the asian champion , 3-0 . klinsmann noted afterwards that there was a clear difference between the two sides .
even better , the record of the german team since jürgen klinsmann took over for rudi völler in july stood at four wins and one draw . first loss for coach klinsmann the euphoria of yokohama would become dismay at pusan three days later .
on sunday , the germans suffered defeat at the hands of south korea , the team that they had beaten to advance to the finals of the world cup in 2002 . ballack took a beating in the match , the victim of numerous fouls committed by aggressive south korean players .
nevertheless , he managed to score another goal which knotted the game 1-1 but failed to convert a penalty kick late in the game that would have tied the game 2-2 .
the second half was all south korea as it began to look like germany were suffering from jet lag .
ballack recognized that they were " penalized " for the mistakes made in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea -lrb- in red -rrb- won more head ball duels - and the match , 3-1 klinsmann put things into perspective , even praising the team for permanently attacking .
characteristic of the optimistic coach , he said it was most important to get back on track in the thailand match .
they succeeded in doing this . the national squad will have time to think about their performance on the long plane ride back to germany .
they beat japan and thailand , but lost their first-ever match to an asian opponent on sunday against south korea .
klinsmann has made an indelible mark on the german national team , something not just any coach can say . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de toothless lions fall to klinsi 's red army jürgen klinsmann enjoyed his first home win as german manager when his team , newly decked out in a red change strip , defeated 10-man cameroon 3-0 in a friendly match in leipzig on wednesday .

jürgen klinsmann 's squad returns home having won two games and losing one . after their 3-1 loss to south korea on sunday , coach jürgen klinsmann gave several of his first-string players a break , most notably goalie oliver kahn and midfield playmaker michael ballack .
on tuesday , the reserves put in an impressive performance against a hopelessly undermanned thailand winning 5-1 . the goals came from kevin kuranyi -lrb- 34th and 38th minute -rrb- , lukas podolski -lrb- 73rd and 89th -rrb- as well as gerald asamoah -lrb- 84th minute -rrb- .
thailand put a bit of fear into the germans at one point by pulling to within just one goal in the 57th minute on a goal by striker chaikamdee sarayoot . the match was played primarily in one direction — that of the thai goal .
thailand 's coach , former german national player siggi held , can thank his goalkeeper kosin hathairattanakool that the final score was not more lopsided .
after the game , held expressed his irritation by saying that his team did not do what he has drilled into them on the practice field . missed opportunities in the first 30 minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi -lrb- right -rrb- found the net twice against thailand german coach jürgen klinsmann was more relaxed in the post-match interview .
on german public television , he complimented the team for pushing forward the whole match .
in the first half-hour of the game , though , he must have been raging inside . compared to sunday 's match , there was lots of room for both teams to develop their games , particularly on the german side .
strikers asamoah und thomas brdaric gave away clear chances .
bastian schweinsteiger 's direct kick hit the crossbar . finally , 11 minutes before the half , kuranyi broke the scoreless tie after a thai player lost the ball to him outside the penalty area .
four minutes later , asamoah lofted a cross to kuranyi who headed the ball into the goal .
that seemed to be all that the germans needed to take apart the team ranked 79th in the world . podolski scores first goals for germany in the second half , brdaric hit metal and then thailand struck .
friedrich nonchalantly lost a ball at midfield and the thais raced downfield leaving keeper hildebrand without a chance .
klinsmann then brought in lukas podolski who revived the germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arne friedrich -lrb- right -rrb- wore captain 's armband for first time his two goals , his first on the national team , certainly raised his stock of claiming a spot on the world cup 2006 squad .

jürgen klinsmann 's squad returns home having won two games and losing one . after their 3-1 loss to south korea on sunday , coach jürgen klinsmann gave several of his first-string players a break , most notably goalie oliver kahn and midfield playmaker michael ballack .
on tuesday , the reserves put in an impressive performance against a hopelessly undermanned thailand winning 5-1 . the goals came from kevin kuranyi -lrb- 34th and 38th minute -rrb- , lukas podolski -lrb- 73rd and 89th -rrb- as well as gerald asamoah -lrb- 84th minute -rrb- .
thailand put a bit of fear into the germans at one point by pulling to within just one goal in the 57th minute on a goal by striker chaikamdee sarayoot . the match was played primarily in one direction — that of the thai goal .
thailand 's coach , former german national player siggi held , can thank his goalkeeper kosin hathairattanakool that the final score was not more lopsided .
after the game , held expressed his irritation by saying that his team did not do what he has drilled into them on the practice field . missed opportunities in the first 30 minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi -lrb- right -rrb- found the net twice against thailand german coach jürgen klinsmann was more relaxed in the post-match interview .
on german public television , he complimented the team for pushing forward the whole match .
in the first half-hour of the game , though , he must have been raging inside . compared to sunday 's match , there was lots of room for both teams to develop their games , particularly on the german side .
strikers asamoah und thomas brdaric gave away clear chances .
bastian schweinsteiger 's direct kick hit the crossbar . finally , 11 minutes before the half , kuranyi broke the scoreless tie after a thai player lost the ball to him outside the penalty area .
four minutes later , asamoah lofted a cross to kuranyi who headed the ball into the goal .
that seemed to be all that the germans needed to take apart the team ranked 79th in the world . podolski scores first goals for germany in the second half , brdaric hit metal and then thailand struck .
friedrich nonchalantly lost a ball at midfield and the thais raced downfield leaving keeper hildebrand without a chance .
klinsmann then brought in lukas podolski who revived the germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arne friedrich -lrb- right -rrb- wore captain 's armband for first time his two goals , his first on the national team , certainly raised his stock of claiming a spot on the world cup 2006 squad .

but experts said that the eu neglects the victims . frattini was responding to a report by a panel of experts on people smuggling who recommended improved coordination between national and eu level authorities . " we are obliged to pursue human trafficking from a moral as well as a security perspective , " the former italian foreign minister said .
" trafficking of human beings is a crime which often acts as a door to other serious crimes , such as … trafficking in drugs , firearms , prostitution , money laundering and other forms of organized crime , " he added . but the panel of experts the eu commissioned to examine the issue accused the bloc of concentrating solely on the process of trafficking and failing to address where the demand stems from .
merely pursuing smugglers was not enough , said the head of the panel , marjan wijers . " if we look at international human rights law , states not only have a duty to prevent and punish trafficking as a violation of human rights , but also to provide the victims with adequate remedies , wijers said .
" up until now states have predominantly concentrated on measures in the area of crime control and migration policies rather than on victim assistance and protection .
to effectively tackle trafficking this imbalance needs to be redressed . "
kidnapped and helpless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini the victims are often utterly dependent on their employers as they are unable to legally apply for residence permits , wijers said .
entire industries rely on the illegal workers who are kept as slaves , she said .
the authorities should develop witness protection programs for victims willing to testify against traffickers and national referral mechanisms to identify victims . the eu has already committed to an international convention against human trafficking , and frattini said he would draft concrete plans for action early next year . he cited intelligence and police information as identifying a growing demand for underage girls .
women from eastern europe , particularly ukraine , moldova , romania and bulgaria continue to make up the largest number of victims , while a considerable amount came from nigeria and were brought to britain and italy .
kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina are the centers of activity for smugglers , he said . the eu took issue with romania and bulgaria over human trafficking in recently completed accession talks with the countries , and now bucharest and sofia have to take action , frattini said . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping victims of human trafficking dreams of a better life often end in a brothel for the victims of human trafficking , with the people smugglers and slave traders who bring them there making a lucrative living from their misery .

" if one compares how many jews were murdered in the holocaust and how many have immigrated and could still come - the relations speak for themselves , " the head of the central council of jews in germany told reuters wednesday .
" in public , the discussion comes across as if germany had been flooded with jewish immigrants in recent years , " he said .
" since 1989 around 190,000 jews have immigrated to germany , and it is n't expected that hundreds of thousands more will come . "

the changes are meant to improve the integration of the immigrants , who some say show too little readiness to become part of german society .
the new rules are in keeping with those applied to other immigrant groups . in 1991 , germany introduced quotas for jews immigrating from cis countries .
the immigrants were expected to strengthen germany 's jewish communities that in the wake of the holocaust only counted around 30,000 members .
however , only 83,000 of those who immigrated since then officially joined the jewish community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily spiegel criticized the interior ministry for informing the central council of jews in germany - over which he presides - about the changes at such a late date .

after the asian tour , it 's time to take a look at just what the former international striker has accomplished since august . when jürgen klinsmann was appointed national coach five months ago , experts and fans were wondering if the german soccer federation had n't gone a little mad .
the former international striker who helped lead germany to victory in the 1990 world cup had almost no coaching experience .
aside from spending his time assisting with an american soccer franchise in los angeles , klinsmann didn ’ t really have much coaching clout to his name . but the soccer federation dfb was in search of a new national head .
the former coach , rudi völler , had just thrown in the towel after a devastating showing at the european championships in june , and many people thought it was time for some old-fashioned discipline to come in and whip the tired team into shape . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birds of a feather - coach and former striker klinsmann with goal-shooter kevin kuranyi the candidates from the old school , most notably greek national coach and euro 2004 champ otto rehhagel and former bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld , had rejected offers to take over the squad .
with world cup 2006 taking place in germany , the dfb began looking further a field . that ’ s when german soccer big-wigs focused on klinsmann .
it was time to bring in some california sunshine .
and everyone agreed : optimism is one quality not lacking in klinsmann 's personality . a firm believer in miracles soccer ’ s sunny boy came to germany and immediately made waves .
" i know that the fans in our country have one wish - to win the 2006 world cup .
that is also my aim , " klinsmann told the media at his first press conference . but he quickly realized and admitted to the public that the nation ’ s no. 1 goal could not be achieved with the squad that showed up at the euro 2004 , or at least not with their attitude .
so , klinsi , as he ’ s affectionately called , went to work .
new players , new tactics and a new mentality were part of his game strategy . before the friendly with brazil in september , he called in a fitness trainer from the us to consult with the players , a first on the national squad .
he also started bringing on new players , which caused more than a few eyebrows to rise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's red uniforms part of new team mentality klinsmann wanted to form the team according to his wishes .
he told the german sports press agency , sid , that he and his assistant coach , joachim löw , and team manager , oliver bierhoff , wanted to create a new basic philosophy and convey it to the players .
in addition , klinsmann firmly believed that a new team identity would help germany reach the ambitious goal of raising the world cup trophy in 2006 . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : klinsi 's squad dismantles thais the german national soccer team ended its three-game asian tour with an easy 5-1 victory over thailand .

the welsh assembly government has already voted for a ban but it does not yet have the power to make it law .
moves are already under way to give the assembly these powers , potentially by 2007 .
cardiff north mp julie morgan is due to introduce a private member 's bill next month to try to speed the process .
bma welsh secretary dr richard lewis said he wanted members to ask their mps to back ms morgan .
welsh secretary peter hain has told the bma that the public health bill , due before parliament , will contain a clause allowing the welsh assembly to pass its own secondary legislation .
but the body , which represents doctors in all medical discplines , said that would not happen before 2007 .
if nobody tells mps and ams anything they do n't tend to do anything , but if they get a rush of letters asking them to do something they probably would dr dai lloyd , am dr lewis said : " we believe that such a wait is unacceptable and we are urging doctors working in wales to write to their mp to support julie morgan 's private member 's bill in january . "
if her smoking in public places -lrb- wales -rrb- bill is passed , it could give the assembly the opportunity to impose a ban before england .
a ban on smoking in any enclosed public space is already in force in the irish republic and a similar one will come into force in scotland in 2006 .
dr dai lloyd , a gp and plaid am for south wales west am , said : " i would n't have thought there would be much of a problem in getting doctors to write letters .
" if nobody tells mps and ams anything they do n't tend to do anything , but if they get a rush of letters asking them to do something they probably would . "

the usdaw trade union said shop workers should be able to enjoy a break with their families .
msp karen whitefield wants to ensure only those whose roles are essential are at work over the festive season .
in recent years , more stores have been opening on traditional holidays , with some starting their end-of-year sale on christmas day or new year 's day .

ms whitefield has been taking her message to the streets " the early evidence shows quite clearly that the vast majority of people believe that shop workers should be given these two special days to spend with friends and family . "
usdaw general secretary john hannett added : " christmas day and new year 's day are special days for everyone in scotland and the fact that shops do not open is an important part of making them special .
they are largely collective days of rest .
" we want people to tell karen , through her consultation , whether they want the special nature of these days to remain , or whether they want them to become like any other trading day , with shops open for business as usual . "

rosneft said it has bought 100 % of baikal finance group in a move that would give russia a tighter grip over its booming oil industry .
baikal was the surprise buyer of oil and gas giant yukos 's main production division at a forced auction on sunday .
rosneft would now control an extra 11 % of russia 's total crude oil output .
a spokesman for the company said that the acquisition is part of its plan to build a " balanced , national energy corporation . "
complex web the latest announcement comes after more than a year of wrangling that has pushed yukos , one of russia 's biggest companies to the brink of collapse .
the russian government put yukos 's yuganskneftegas subsidiary up for sale last week after hitting the company with a $ 27bn -lrb- £ 14bn -rrb- bill for back taxes and fines . "
you can not sue the russian government " eric kraus , sovlink securities analysts say that yukos 's legal attempts to block the auction by filing for bankruptcy protection in the us are probably what caused this week 's cloak-and-dagger dealings .
gazprom , the company originally tipped to buy yuganskneftegas , was banned from taking part in the auction by a us court injunction .
by selling the yukos unit to little-known baikal and then to rosneft , russia is able to circumvent a host of tricky legal landmines , analysts said .
" you can not sue the russian government , " said eric kraus , a strategist at moscow 's sovlink securities .
" the russian government has sovereign immunity . "
" the government is renationalising yuganskneftegas . "
far from over even so , analysts reckon that the saga still has a long way to go .
the rosneft announcement came just hours after yukos accused gazprom of illegally taking part in sunday 's auction .
it has said it will be seeking damages of $ 20bn .
the claim was made at the latest hearing in the us bankruptcy court in houston , texas , where yukos , had filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .
if found in contempt of the us court order blocking the auction , gazprom could face having foreign assets seized .
yukos ' lawyers had also been expected to try to have baikal 's assets frozen .
lawyers claimed the auction was illegal because yukos - with an office in houston - had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were under the protection of us law which has worldwide jurisdiction .
further muddying the waters is a merger between rosneft and gazprom which authorities have said will go ahead as planned .

the rosneft announcement came just hours after yukos accused gazprom of illegally taking part in sunday 's auction .
it has said it will be seeking damages of $ 20bn .
the claim was made at the latest hearing in the us bankruptcy court in houston , texas , where yukos , had filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .
if found in contempt of the us court order blocking the auction , gazprom could face having foreign assets seized .
yukos ' lawyers had also been expected to try to have baikal 's assets frozen .
lawyers claimed the auction was illegal because yukos - with an office in houston - had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were under the protection of us law which has worldwide jurisdiction .
further muddying the waters is a merger between rosneft and gazprom which authorities have said will go ahead as planned .

rosneft said it has bought 100 % of baikal finance group in a move that would give russia a tighter grip over its booming oil industry .
baikal was the surprise buyer of oil and gas giant yukos 's main production division at a forced auction on sunday .
rosneft would now control an extra 11 % of russia 's total crude oil output .
a spokesman for the company said that the acquisition is part of its plan to build a " balanced , national energy corporation . "
complex web the latest announcement comes after more than a year of wrangling that has pushed yukos , one of russia 's biggest companies to the brink of collapse .
the russian government put yukos 's yuganskneftegas subsidiary up for sale last week after hitting the company with a $ 27bn -lrb- £ 14bn -rrb- bill for back taxes and fines .
you can not sue the russian government eric kraus , sovlink securities analysts say that yukos 's legal attempts to block the auction by filing for bankruptcy protection in the us are probably what caused this week 's cloak-and-dagger dealings .
gazprom , the company originally tipped to buy yuganskneftegas , was banned from taking part in the auction by a us court injunction .
by selling the yukos unit to little-known baikal and then to rosneft , russia is able to circumvent a host of tricky legal landmines , analysts said .
" you can not sue the russian government , " said eric kraus , a strategist at moscow 's sovlink securities .
" the russian government has sovereign immunity . "

despite the spine-chilling temperatures chris ruocco , 60 , and his friends went swimming in hampstead ponds .
" christmas swims are very sociable events with wine and mince pies and i take my trumpet along and play carols by the side of the pond , " he said .
" it really makes you feel good and certainly wakes you up . "
as a member of the highgate lifebuoys he is one of a few who swim in the north london ponds all year round .
the group , founded in 1903 , run a christmas day race which has only been cancelled twice when the ice was too thick to break .
nothing ever stops us .
it 's worse when the air temperature is much colder than the water temperature and there 's a film of ice on the water mr ruocco in the winter of 1964 mr ruocco said the swimmers were undeterred by the conditions .
" it was solid ice so we had to swim in an area 20ft by 10f , " he said .
" nothing ever stops us .
it 's worse when the air temperature is much colder than the water temperature and there 's a film of ice on the water .
" when you dive in , it does n't matter how quick you are , by the time you 've gone under the water the ice forms over the hole again before you come up . "
the festive event remains ever popular , with about 200 people taking part last year .
but health and safety regulations mean they can no longer swim when it is icy .
people have been bathing in the ponds since the 1860s up to 200,000 people use the ponds every year which have been a popular spot for swimmers since the 1860s .
mr ruocco began swimming in the pond at the age of 10 , when he was a member of the st pancras boxing club .
" i loved it so much i used to go there instead of school , " he said .
mr ruocco now owns a tailor 's shop in kentish town , north london , and has dressed the likes of wham , bananarama and spandau ballet , but continues to swim everyday .
" it 's beautiful , you can swim and see the sky which is the most beautiful thing you can do , " he said .
but this " cherished " tradition is under threat .
the corporation of london , which manages the ponds , is proposing to charge an entry fee or close one or all three to cut costs .
lifeguards at the pond cost the corporation £ 500,000 a year the corporation spends up to £ 500,000 a year on lifeguards , water quality testing , control equipment and maintenance costs .
the hampstead heath management committee said the ponds are a " wonderful and cherished tradition " but are their most expensive recreational facility .
mr ruocco said : " people have swum here for 100 years , most days , in all weathers , and we are fiercely proud of our tradition and we aim to keep it that way .
" they should n't even be considering closing the ponds , this is the last thing they should do . "
the corporation of london management committee is due to meet on 21 february to decide the future of the ponds .

earlier this month the a11 and a47 were left off transport minister david jamieson 's priority list of roads to receive a share of £ 700m .
but the transport secretary alistair darling has now written to charles clarke to say the a11 has now been included in a programme for 2007 .
a norfolk county council spokeswoman said it was the first step to a fully-dualled a11 .
council leader alison king said : " there was a real sense of outrage when , quite out of the blue , the two a11 schemes -lrb- attleborough bypass and thetford to fiveways -rrb- were dropped from the programme , along with dualling the a47 from blofield to north burlingham . "
more campaigns ms king said the u-turn comes just over a week after the council wrote to the transport secretary protesting that norfolk had been left in the " slow lane " .
" there can be no doubt that by uniting with one voice norfolk has gained this partial change of heart , " she added .
but ms king says the council will continue campaigning for the thetford to fiveways dualling to be put back into the programme .
" the a11 is one of the key strategic routes into norfolk .
completing the dualling of the route is vital to the economic future of the county , so we can not let it rest , " she said .
