but conflicts of interests and privacy issues , especially in germany , are undermining investigations . just days after european investigators called for " sharper tools " and better intelligence-sharing in the war on terror , germany 's attempts to adhere to these calls has come up against a brick wall of the government 's making . interior minister otto schily , who addressed a security conference in wiesbaden on tuesday , told those attending that he was confident of forcing through constitutional changes to give the federal crime office - the bundeskriminalamt or bka - more " preventive powers , " including those which would allow german security forces to tap suspects ' telephones . but by thursday , schily was left frustrated at the unwillingness of the german government to reform the security services .
powers which would give the bka the ability to mount the increasingly sensitive and intrusive investigations schily recommends in the fight against terrorism would have to be agreed upon by the government , a course of action it is not willing to take at the moment . schily 's plan to create a central terror suspect database is also causing controversy .
the federal police and intelligence services have already had their headquarters moved to berlin as part of a drive to improve coordination , an initial part of the plan to centralize information on suspected muslim extremists . false accusation fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rights of germany 's three million muslims could be compromised .
but the creation of a central database for muslim fundamentalists is controversial , both with germany 's more than three million muslims and with privacy watchdogs .
federal data protection commissioner peter schaar told the security conference this week that muslims considered to be " extremists " must not be listed in such a database unless there was concrete evidence of links to terrorism . however , tensions were increased when top intelligence officials countered that view , claiming suspects could always be removed later if terrorist involvement was ruled out .
" we should n't let -lrb- militants -rrb- exploit our freedom and data protection rules , " said rüdiger von fritsch , deputy head of the foreign intelligence agency . the privacy issue aside , the creation of a centralized intelligence agency has increased tensions between the government and the16 german states , all of which have their own police and security forces .
at the moment , each of the german states is responsible for its own investigations into terrorist activities , something schily wants to reform in a bid to compile a nationwide network of efficient data collection and exchange under a bka banner . conflict with germany hindering process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking at the security conference , bka chief jörg ziercke -lrb- photo , with schily -rrb- said that the current situation often forced the agency to take a back seat to police forces in the federal states . " if we receive highly sensitive threat information , we do n't want to get into long discussions with the states on whether they have the resources to launch surveillance if i have the resources to do that myself , " he told journalists . the german bickering highlighted the problems facing the eu countries in the fight against terrorism in regard to speed of investigation and action . french investigating magistrate jean-louis bruguiere told the conference that the bureaucracy was undoing a lot of the good work being undertaken by european investigations .
" we must act in real time , " he told the conference .
" very often it takes much too long for appropriate action to be taken .

yet , progress may not be as swift as british prime minister tony blair and his foreign secretary , jack straw , would wish .
they both reacted to george w. bush ’ s electoral triumph by declaring that the most pressing political challenge in the world today is to get the two sides back round the negotiating table .
the incapacitation of the palestinian leader will add credence to that view , the paper opined .
the guardian , from london , said arafat is " the father of the nation but not yet the father of the palestinian state . "
it wrote that 40 years on from the age of british de-colonization , he is the last man who can claim that status .
the paper recalled that arafat had to win recognition of the fact that there was such a thing as a palestinian nation at all .
" to move from defensive consolidation and start to build a nation was nigh impossible .
that arafat managed to do it and retain the affection of his people , not just as a symbol of independence but as a respected and approachable human being , is a tribute of his greatness . " the paris daily liberation wrote that yasser arafat ’ s death will usher in a dangerous phase for the palestinians .
his death might mean the birth of a new arab myth , but the immediate and burning question is whether palestine will survive arafat .
will his orphans manage to unite in a different way than through his symbol ? liberation ’ s compatriot le figaro , while praising arafat as one of the great figures of the 20th century , wonders whether he really wanted peace .
the former terrorist , who became the elected president of the palestinian authority , was during his entire life an expert at playing a double game .
he was so unpredictable that it was hard to know whether he was always acting in the interest of his people or in his own interest , the paper said . us president george w. bush 's election victory still gives commentators plenty of food for thought .
germany ’ s berliner zeitung wrote that there is little room for optimism in the analysis of washington ’ s future policies , but that for the political practice it is indispensable .
for without transatlantic cooperation there will never be a peace process in the middle east that deserves that name , and it will be even harder to slow down the spread of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
in addition , the berlin daily said , if america and europe feud , it reduces the western democracies effect on the rest of the world and weakens the fight against terrorism . incoming european commission president jose barroso tried to end the political crisis in the european union on thursday by unveiling his new team of commissioners after the european parliament had last month expressed concerns about a number of candidates , including italy ’ s rocco buttiglione .
commenting on his replacement with italian foreign minister franco frattini , the rome-based newspaper il messaggero write : " it took almost a month - dominated by negotiations , international squabbles and even crusades from other eras .

barroso waits to replace prodi incoming eu executive head jose manuel barroso said friday he hopes for " clear " approval when eu lawmakers finally vote on his new team later this month , to end an unprecedented state of limbo in brussels . barroso was speaking after the european union parliament , which threatened the eu with crisis last month by blocking barroso 's first-choice line-up for the new european commission , set a new date of november 18 for a confidence vote . " i am very satisfied by the general reaction ...
i hope to have a strong vote , clear majority vote for the commission in the interests of the union , " barroso said after talks with party leaders in the eu legislative assembly . barroso was forced to withdraw his first-choice team on october 27 after eu lawmakers in strasbourg threatened to veto it notably over the inclusion of controversial italian nominee rocco buttiglione . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's rocco buttiglione .
buttiglione , who was nominated for the sensitive justice portfolio , had infuriated meps by describing homosexuality as a " sin " and saying that women should stay at home to have babies . barroso , portugal 's former prime minister , should have taken up his brussels job on november 1 .
outgoing commission chief romano prodi is staying on as a caretaker in the meantime . party leaders agree on date the new vote date was set by party group leaders after talks with barroso , who unveiled a reshuffled commission team at a two-day eu summit in brussels . confirmation hearings for three newly-designated nominees will be held on november 15 and 16 at the parliament , which will be holding its next monthly plenary session in strasbourg , sources said . the head of the socialist group in the eu assembly , which was the driving force behind last week 's veto threat , said friday he favored a swift resolution to the standoff .

" new commission nominees confirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's foreign minister franco frattini .
barroso had pledged to make a " limited " reshuffle to win parliament 's support , and his reformed line-up included two new members and one swap of portfolio .
he confirmed that italian foreign minister franco frattini was nominated to replace buttiglione .
frattini will also serve as one of five vice presidents of the commission . barroso said that latvia 's new nominee andris piebalgs will replace ingrida udre , who also failed to win eu lawmakers ' backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andris piebalgs .
but piebalgs will not take over the tax brief offered to udre , instead swapping that position for the energy portfolio first given to hungary 's laszlo kovacs , who was deemed unimpressive on that brief . kroes retains barroso support barroso stood by his controversial choice for competition commissioner , dutch minister neelie kroes , who has faced charges of conflict of interest in the key brief overseeing corporate takeovers and state aid decisions . prodi , who has delayed his return to italian politics to stay on in his brussels office , welcomed the breakthrough on his successor 's team .

iyad allawi had asked the the eu to " open a new chapter " and overcome divisions caused by the iraq war . despite having irked several eu leaders by describing states that opposed the us-led war in iraq as " spectators , " iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi successfully appealed for greater unity on iraq .

the move was heavily criticized by the media , and the country 's head of state horst köhler even wrote to chancellor gerhard schröder asking him to reconsider the move .
speaking in brussels friday , the chancellor regretfully withdrew the plan , citing lack of political support .
loud opposition the plan by german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel to rid the country of one of its work holidays was met with loud opposition - from within the government as well as political opponents .
the trouble started when the two social democrats proposed a plan to move the october 3 german unity day holiday - one of up to 16 national holidays - to a sunday , thereby gaining an extra day of work .
eichel introduced the plan as part of his new austerity measures , arguing it would potentially provide a 0.1 percent increase in gdp , and attendant tax revenue increases .
economics minister wolfgang clement said the move would bring in additional income of € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
a question of soul ?
but opponents to the idea retorted that to strike the national holiday was " unpatriotic , " akin to attacking the soul of the nation , referring to the overriding historical importance of the division and reunification of east and west .
" i wonder about the soul of a nation whose government plans such a thing , " lothar de maizere , east germany 's last prime minister , told german tv broadcaster ard .
the situation heated up further german president horst köhler wrote a letter to schröder in which he opposed the plan .
" taking october 3 as a symbol for the reunification of germany in peace and freedom is important for the future of our country , and should be retained , " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper quoted köhler as writing .
there could be better ways " to find an additional work day in order to take part in the consolidation of the country 's finances . "
done deal ?
but schröder parried back with a letter to köhler , according to mass-circulation daily bild .
he wrote that unity day is indeed very important , but added , " reunification was an extreme burden on our economy .
unity must be completed , and the number of holidays must be reduced . "
he finished by saying he was open to meeting with köhler to discuss better options .
despite the raging opposition , clement said that the plan " is not -lrb- just -rrb- an idea ; it will be carried out . "
and spd chief franz müntefering backed him up , telling the press that even if the opposition refuses to go along with the plan , " then we will go it alone . "
indeed , germany 's bundestag , the lower house of parliament , could make the change unilaterally .
the holiday was created by the german unity pact of 1990 , a federal law , and amending it would not require ratification by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament which represents the states .
opposition - from both sides but just because the government can pull it off , does n't mean people have to like it - not even members of the ruling party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.11.2004 german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily 's call for security reform in germany fell on deaf ears european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .
but conflicts of interests and privacy issues , especially in germany , are undermining investigations . just days after european investigators called for " sharper tools " and better intelligence-sharing in the war on terror , germany 's attempts to adhere to these calls has come up against a brick wall of the government 's making . interior minister otto schily , who addressed a security conference in wiesbaden on tuesday , told those attending that he was confident of forcing through constitutional changes to give the federal crime office - the bundeskriminalamt or bka - more " preventive powers , " including those which would allow german security forces to tap suspects ' telephones . but by thursday , schily was left frustrated at the unwillingness of the german government to reform the security services .
powers which would give the bka the ability to mount the increasingly sensitive and intrusive investigations schily recommends in the fight against terrorism would have to be agreed upon by the government , a course of action it is not willing to take at the moment . schily 's plan to create a central terror suspect database is also causing controversy .
the federal police and intelligence services have already had their headquarters moved to berlin as part of a drive to improve coordination , an initial part of the plan to centralize information on suspected muslim extremists . false accusation fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rights of germany 's three million muslims could be compromised .
but the creation of a central database for muslim fundamentalists is controversial , both with germany 's more than three million muslims and with privacy watchdogs .
federal data protection commissioner peter schaar told the security conference this week that muslims considered to be " extremists " must not be listed in such a database unless there was concrete evidence of links to terrorism . however , tensions were increased when top intelligence officials countered that view , claiming suspects could always be removed later if terrorist involvement was ruled out .
" we should n't let -lrb- militants -rrb- exploit our freedom and data protection rules , " said rüdiger von fritsch , deputy head of the foreign intelligence agency . the privacy issue aside , the creation of a centralized intelligence agency has increased tensions between the government and the16 german states , all of which have their own police and security forces .

loud opposition the plan by german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel to rid the country of one of its work holidays was met with loud opposition - from within the government as well as political opponents .
the trouble started when the two social democrats proposed a plan to move the october 3 german unity day holiday - one of up to 16 national holidays - to a sunday , thereby gaining an extra day of work .
eichel introduced the plan as part of his new austerity measures , arguing it would potentially provide a 0.1 percent increase in gdp , and attendant tax revenue increases .
economics minister wolfgang clement said the move would bring in additional income of € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .

" taking october 3 as a symbol for the reunification of germany in peace and freedom is important for the future of our country , and should be retained , " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper quoted köhler as writing .
there could be better ways " to find an additional work day in order to take part in the consolidation of the country 's finances . "

he wrote that unity day is indeed very important , but added , " reunification was an extreme burden on our economy .
unity must be completed , and the number of holidays must be reduced . "
he finished by saying he was open to meeting with köhler to discuss better options .
despite the raging opposition , clement said that the plan " is not -lrb- just -rrb- an idea ; it will be carried out . "

but opponents to the idea retorted that to strike the national holiday was " unpatriotic , " akin to attacking the soul of the nation , referring to the overriding historical importance of the division and reunification of east and west .
" i wonder about the soul of a nation whose government plans such a thing , " lothar de maizere , east germany 's last prime minister , told german tv broadcaster ard .
the situation heated up further german president horst köhler wrote a letter to schröder in which he opposed the plan .
" taking october 3 as a symbol for the reunification of germany in peace and freedom is important for the future of our country , and should be retained , " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper quoted köhler as writing .
there could be better ways " to find an additional work day in order to take part in the consolidation of the country 's finances . "
done deal ?
but schröder parried back with a letter to köhler , according to mass-circulation daily bild .
he wrote that unity day is indeed very important , but added , " reunification was an extreme burden on our economy .
unity must be completed , and the number of holidays must be reduced . "
he finished by saying he was open to meeting with köhler to discuss better options .
despite the raging opposition , clement said that the plan " is not -lrb- just -rrb- an idea ; it will be carried out . "
and spd chief franz müntefering backed him up , telling the press that even if the opposition refuses to go along with the plan , " then we will go it alone . "
indeed , germany 's bundestag , the lower house of parliament , could make the change unilaterally .
the holiday was created by the german unity pact of 1990 , a federal law , and amending it would not require ratification by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament which represents the states .
opposition - from both sides but just because the government can pull it off , does n't mean people have to like it - not even members of the ruling party .
bundestag president wolfgang thierse , schleswig-holstein premier heide simonis , bremen mayor henning scherf , green party parliamentary group leader krista sager - all have openly criticized the plan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.11.2004 eichel presents eu-friendly budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can eichel 's plan really keep the deficit in check ?
revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years . german finance minister hans eichel presented his plan to make up for an unexpected € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12.9 billion -rrb- budget shortfall and bring the german economy in line with eu stability criteria thursday .
to this end , the minister said , he plans a pay freeze for civil servants , an additional workday for all germans , and securitization of deutsche post and deutsche telekom pensions , along with several other measures .
the package met with criticism from many quarters , and the plan to get rid of a key german holiday unleashed a political firestorm .
mineral oil , tobacco to blame tax revenues for 2004-2005 fell some € 4.8 billion short of previous forecasts .
in addition , the budget needed to be adjusted for an additional € 3 billion in spending on the job market .
the federal government will be hit especially hard by the measures ; the individual states got off relatively lightly , and local governments even got additional funds .
eichel blamed the lower-than-expected tax revenues on reduced mineral-oil and tobacco taxes , whereby local governments booked " superb increases in commercial taxes , " the finance ministry told news agencies .
despite the decline , the ministry said the government " is still holding on to its 2005 goal of having a budget deficit that will again return to below " the 3 percent euro-zone criteria .
controversial plan a big part of the government 's plan to plug the hole in its finances will be achieved by selling off pension liabilities at deutsche post and deutsche telekom , two semi-private companies .
many post and telekom workers are effectively civil servants , and their retirements must therefore be paid by the state .
in compensation , the two companies are supposed to pay into eichel 's coffers € 18 billion .
the state will then convert these expected revenues into securities and sell them to investors , generating a further € 5.5 billion .
the part of the plan that has generated the most controversy was the move by eichel and german chancellor gerhard schröder to shift the day of german unity holiday from oct .
3 to the first sunday in october .
the government calculated that the extra day of work each year is worth annual gdp growth of 0.1 percent , that is , increased tax revenue .
critics speak out criticism of the plan came from opposition politicians as well as affected organizations .
the german civil servants association , deutscher beamtenbund , objected vociferously to the plan .
the group 's head , peter heesen , said such a move would endanger the implementation of the reform package previously agreed to with interior minister otto schily .
heesen also noted that civil servants already accepted benefits cuts as well as longer work hours in 2004 .
also strongly opposed to the plan to meet the eu criteria was the bdb association of german banks .
" the consolidation of federal finances is an urgent task facing germany , " bdb head manfred weber told news agencies in berlin .
" but the proposal that the government submitted is just a quick fix . "
while group said moving a holiday could indeed help long term growth , it criticized the plan for pushing current debt off to future budgets .
this is not a good solution for the current structural problems , weber said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu lodges " tank tourism " complaint germany 's political opposition is calling for fast and effective measures to combat so-called " tank tourism , " which sees germans flooding across borders to fill up their cars with cheaper gasoline .

revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years . german finance minister hans eichel presented his plan to make up for an unexpected € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12.9 billion -rrb- budget shortfall and bring the german economy in line with eu stability criteria thursday .
to this end , the minister said , he plans a pay freeze for civil servants , an additional workday for all germans , and securitization of deutsche post and deutsche telekom pensions , along with several other measures .
the package met with criticism from many quarters , and the plan to get rid of a key german holiday unleashed a political firestorm .
mineral oil , tobacco to blame tax revenues for 2004-2005 fell some € 4.8 billion short of previous forecasts .
in addition , the budget needed to be adjusted for an additional € 3 billion in spending on the job market .
the federal government will be hit especially hard by the measures ; the individual states got off relatively lightly , and local governments even got additional funds .
eichel blamed the lower-than-expected tax revenues on reduced mineral-oil and tobacco taxes , whereby local governments booked " superb increases in commercial taxes , " the finance ministry told news agencies .
despite the decline , the ministry said the government " is still holding on to its 2005 goal of having a budget deficit that will again return to below " the 3 percent euro-zone criteria .
controversial plan a big part of the government 's plan to plug the hole in its finances will be achieved by selling off pension liabilities at deutsche post and deutsche telekom , two semi-private companies .
many post and telekom workers are effectively civil servants , and their retirements must therefore be paid by the state .
in compensation , the two companies are supposed to pay into eichel 's coffers € 18 billion .
the state will then convert these expected revenues into securities and sell them to investors , generating a further € 5.5 billion .
the part of the plan that has generated the most controversy was the move by eichel and german chancellor gerhard schröder to shift the day of german unity holiday from oct .
3 to the first sunday in october .
the government calculated that the extra day of work each year is worth annual gdp growth of 0.1 percent , that is , increased tax revenue .
critics speak out criticism of the plan came from opposition politicians as well as affected organizations .
the german civil servants association , deutscher beamtenbund , objected vociferously to the plan .
the group 's head , peter heesen , said such a move would endanger the implementation of the reform package previously agreed to with interior minister otto schily .
heesen also noted that civil servants already accepted benefits cuts as well as longer work hours in 2004 .
also strongly opposed to the plan to meet the eu criteria was the bdb association of german banks .
" the consolidation of federal finances is an urgent task facing germany , " bdb head manfred weber told news agencies in berlin .
" but the proposal that the government submitted is just a quick fix . "
while group said moving a holiday could indeed help long term growth , it criticized the plan for pushing current debt off to future budgets .
this is not a good solution for the current structural problems , weber said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu lodges " tank tourism " complaint germany 's political opposition is calling for fast and effective measures to combat so-called " tank tourism , " which sees germans flooding across borders to fill up their cars with cheaper gasoline .

revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years . german finance minister hans eichel presented his plan to make up for an unexpected € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12.9 billion -rrb- budget shortfall and bring the german economy in line with eu stability criteria thursday .
to this end , the minister said , he plans a pay freeze for civil servants , an additional workday for all germans , and securitization of deutsche post and deutsche telekom pensions , along with several other measures .
the package met with criticism from many quarters , and the plan to get rid of a key german holiday unleashed a political firestorm .
mineral oil , tobacco to blame tax revenues for 2004-2005 fell some € 4.8 billion short of previous forecasts .
in addition , the budget needed to be adjusted for an additional € 3 billion in spending on the job market .
the federal government will be hit especially hard by the measures ; the individual states got off relatively lightly , and local governments even got additional funds .
eichel blamed the lower-than-expected tax revenues on reduced mineral-oil and tobacco taxes , whereby local governments booked " superb increases in commercial taxes , " the finance ministry told news agencies .
despite the decline , the ministry said the government " is still holding on to its 2005 goal of having a budget deficit that will again return to below " the 3 percent euro-zone criteria .
controversial plan a big part of the government 's plan to plug the hole in its finances will be achieved by selling off pension liabilities at deutsche post and deutsche telekom , two semi-private companies .
many post and telekom workers are effectively civil servants , and their retirements must therefore be paid by the state .
in compensation , the two companies are supposed to pay into eichel 's coffers € 18 billion .
the state will then convert these expected revenues into securities and sell them to investors , generating a further € 5.5 billion .
the part of the plan that has generated the most controversy was the move by eichel and german chancellor gerhard schröder to shift the day of german unity holiday from oct .
3 to the first sunday in october .
the government calculated that the extra day of work each year is worth annual gdp growth of 0.1 percent , that is , increased tax revenue .
critics speak out criticism of the plan came from opposition politicians as well as affected organizations .
the german civil servants association , deutscher beamtenbund , objected vociferously to the plan .
the group 's head , peter heesen , said such a move would endanger the implementation of the reform package previously agreed to with interior minister otto schily .
heesen also noted that civil servants already accepted benefits cuts as well as longer work hours in 2004 .
also strongly opposed to the plan to meet the eu criteria was the bdb association of german banks .
" the consolidation of federal finances is an urgent task facing germany , " bdb head manfred weber told news agencies in berlin .
" but the proposal that the government submitted is just a quick fix . "
while group said moving a holiday could indeed help long term growth , it criticized the plan for pushing current debt off to future budgets .
this is not a good solution for the current structural problems , weber said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu lodges " tank tourism " complaint germany 's political opposition is calling for fast and effective measures to combat so-called " tank tourism , " which sees germans flooding across borders to fill up their cars with cheaper gasoline .

but conflicts of interests and privacy issues , especially in germany , are undermining investigations . just days after european investigators called for " sharper tools " and better intelligence-sharing in the war on terror , germany 's attempts to adhere to these calls has come up against a brick wall of the government 's making . interior minister otto schily , who addressed a security conference in wiesbaden on tuesday , told those attending that he was confident of forcing through constitutional changes to give the federal crime office - the bundeskriminalamt or bka - more " preventive powers , " including those which would allow german security forces to tap suspects ' telephones . but by thursday , schily was left frustrated at the unwillingness of the german government to reform the security services .
powers which would give the bka the ability to mount the increasingly sensitive and intrusive investigations schily recommends in the fight against terrorism would have to be agreed upon by the government , a course of action it is not willing to take at the moment . schily 's plan to create a central terror suspect database is also causing controversy .
the federal police and intelligence services have already had their headquarters moved to berlin as part of a drive to improve coordination , an initial part of the plan to centralize information on suspected muslim extremists . false accusation fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rights of germany 's three million muslims could be compromised .
but the creation of a central database for muslim fundamentalists is controversial , both with germany 's more than three million muslims and with privacy watchdogs .
federal data protection commissioner peter schaar told the security conference this week that muslims considered to be " extremists " must not be listed in such a database unless there was concrete evidence of links to terrorism . however , tensions were increased when top intelligence officials countered that view , claiming suspects could always be removed later if terrorist involvement was ruled out .
" we should n't let -lrb- militants -rrb- exploit our freedom and data protection rules , " said rüdiger von fritsch , deputy head of the foreign intelligence agency . the privacy issue aside , the creation of a centralized intelligence agency has increased tensions between the government and the16 german states , all of which have their own police and security forces .

" if we receive highly sensitive threat information , we do n't want to get into long discussions with the states on whether they have the resources to launch surveillance if i have the resources to do that myself , " he told journalists . the german bickering highlighted the problems facing the eu countries in the fight against terrorism in regard to speed of investigation and action . french investigating magistrate jean-louis bruguiere told the conference that the bureaucracy was undoing a lot of the good work being undertaken by european investigations .

" we are now back on track .
we need to get back to work quickly , " barroso told a news conference after presenting his slightly modified line-up to eu leaders . the most high-profile change is that of the future justice and security chief .
barroso said italian foreign minister franco frattini would replace rocco buttiglione , whose conservative views on homosexuality and the role of women stirred anger among many eu parliamentarians and threatened to derail the entire commission . barroso also announced that laszlo kovacs of hungary would switch from energy to taxation and a new latvian nominee , andris piebalgs , would take the energy portfolio .

on the eve of the two-day summit which will include talks with iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi , the eu pledged to overhaul transatlantic links strained to the breaking point during the president 's first term .
both eu and us officials said they hoped bush 's second term would start out on a much better note and bring the two regions closer together again .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , who holds the eu 's rotating presidency , sent a personal letter of congratulation to bush .
" the united states and the european union are linked by strong cultural , economic and political ties , and by our shared values ...
the presidency is confident that this relationship will be further deepened and strengthened under the new administration , " it said .
iraq on the agenda eu nations have been deeply split over us policy in iraq , with britain spearheading support for the war while germany and france staunchly opposed military intervention .
only recently has the bloc begun overcoming those differences to work for the shattered country 's reconstruction .
on tuesday eu foreign ministers agreed to a package of financial and logistical support initiatives for iraq ahead of the country 's elections planned for january .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot said the deal showed that the eu was " united again " after its iraq rift .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi a meeting with iraqi interim leader allawi on friday will help further shore up common eu support for bolstering iraq 's struggling democracy .
economic focus in addition to foreign policy issues , the 25 eu leaders are expected to focus on a report by former dutch prime minister wim kok on the so-called lisbon agenda , the bloc 's grand plan launched in 2000 to make europe the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .
the report paints a gloomy future , warning that " too many targets promise to be seriously missed . "
nonetheless eu leaders are likely to express renewed commitment to the economic goals and examine ways to press ahead with market-oriented reforms in the face of new enlargement prospects and current difficulties in bringing the 10 newest accession states up to an economic par with the rest of the bloc .

" we are now back on track .
we need to get back to work quickly , " barroso told a news conference after presenting his slightly modified line-up to eu leaders . the most high-profile change is that of the future justice and security chief .
barroso said italian foreign minister franco frattini would replace rocco buttiglione , whose conservative views on homosexuality and the role of women stirred anger among many eu parliamentarians and threatened to derail the entire commission . barroso also announced that laszlo kovacs of hungary would switch from energy to taxation and a new latvian nominee , andris piebalgs , would take the energy portfolio .

on the eve of the two-day summit which will include talks with iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi , the eu pledged to overhaul transatlantic links strained to the breaking point during the president 's first term .
both eu and us officials said they hoped bush 's second term would start out on a much better note and bring the two regions closer together again .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , who holds the eu 's rotating presidency , sent a personal letter of congratulation to bush .
" the united states and the european union are linked by strong cultural , economic and political ties , and by our shared values ...
the presidency is confident that this relationship will be further deepened and strengthened under the new administration , " it said .
iraq on the agenda eu nations have been deeply split over us policy in iraq , with britain spearheading support for the war while germany and france staunchly opposed military intervention .
only recently has the bloc begun overcoming those differences to work for the shattered country 's reconstruction .
on tuesday eu foreign ministers agreed to a package of financial and logistical support initiatives for iraq ahead of the country 's elections planned for january .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot said the deal showed that the eu was " united again " after its iraq rift .

the report paints a gloomy future , warning that " too many targets promise to be seriously missed . "
nonetheless eu leaders are likely to express renewed commitment to the economic goals and examine ways to press ahead with market-oriented reforms in the face of new enlargement prospects and current difficulties in bringing the 10 newest accession states up to an economic par with the rest of the bloc .

" we are now back on track .
we need to get back to work quickly , " barroso told a news conference after presenting his slightly modified line-up to eu leaders . the most high-profile change is that of the future justice and security chief .
barroso said italian foreign minister franco frattini would replace rocco buttiglione , whose conservative views on homosexuality and the role of women stirred anger among many eu parliamentarians and threatened to derail the entire commission . barroso also announced that laszlo kovacs of hungary would switch from energy to taxation and a new latvian nominee , andris piebalgs , would take the energy portfolio .
another controversial nominee , neelie kroes from the netherlands , would be retained as competition commissioner . us-eu future meeting at european union headquarters in brussels a day after president george bush was re-elected to the white house , leaders from the 25 member states were just as focused on the future path of us-eu relations as on the set economic agenda .
on the eve of the two-day summit which will include talks with iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi , the eu pledged to overhaul transatlantic links strained to the breaking point during the president 's first term .
both eu and us officials said they hoped bush 's second term would start out on a much better note and bring the two regions closer together again .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , who holds the eu 's rotating presidency , sent a personal letter of congratulation to bush .
" the united states and the european union are linked by strong cultural , economic and political ties , and by our shared values ...
the presidency is confident that this relationship will be further deepened and strengthened under the new administration , " it said .
iraq on the agenda eu nations have been deeply split over us policy in iraq , with britain spearheading support for the war while germany and france staunchly opposed military intervention .
only recently has the bloc begun overcoming those differences to work for the shattered country 's reconstruction .
on tuesday eu foreign ministers agreed to a package of financial and logistical support initiatives for iraq ahead of the country 's elections planned for january .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot said the deal showed that the eu was " united again " after its iraq rift .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi a meeting with iraqi interim leader allawi on friday will help further shore up common eu support for bolstering iraq 's struggling democracy .
economic focus in addition to foreign policy issues , the 25 eu leaders are expected to focus on a report by former dutch prime minister wim kok on the so-called lisbon agenda , the bloc 's grand plan launched in 2000 to make europe the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .
the report paints a gloomy future , warning that " too many targets promise to be seriously missed . "
nonetheless eu leaders are likely to express renewed commitment to the economic goals and examine ways to press ahead with market-oriented reforms in the face of new enlargement prospects and current difficulties in bringing the 10 newest accession states up to an economic par with the rest of the bloc .
many leaders will also be looking towards the summit as a good opportunity to resolve the crisis that was sparked last week when incoming european commission chief jose manuel barroso was forced to withdraw his proposed executive team due to protests by eu lawmakers . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in emotional speech , kerry concedes defeat in a gracious speech before supporters a clearly emotional senator john kerry conceded defeat and urged the country to find " common cause .

the pact commits the developed nations to cut overall emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2008-12 , by curbing use of coal , oil and natural gas and introducing cleaner energies like solar and wind power .

revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years . german finance minister hans eichel presented his plan to make up for an unexpected € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12.9 billion -rrb- budget shortfall and bring the german economy in line with eu stability criteria thursday .
to this end , the minister said , he plans a pay freeze for civil servants , an additional workday for all germans , and securitization of deutsche post and deutsche telekom pensions , along with several other measures .
the package met with criticism from many quarters , and the plan to get rid of a key german holiday unleashed a political firestorm .
mineral oil , tobacco to blame tax revenues for 2004-2005 fell some € 4.8 billion short of previous forecasts .
in addition , the budget needed to be adjusted for an additional € 3 billion in spending on the job market .
the federal government will be hit especially hard by the measures ; the individual states got off relatively lightly , and local governments even got additional funds .
eichel blamed the lower-than-expected tax revenues on reduced mineral-oil and tobacco taxes , whereby local governments booked " superb increases in commercial taxes , " the finance ministry told news agencies .
despite the decline , the ministry said the government " is still holding on to its 2005 goal of having a budget deficit that will again return to below " the 3 percent euro-zone criteria .
controversial plan a big part of the government 's plan to plug the hole in its finances will be achieved by selling off pension liabilities at deutsche post and deutsche telekom , two semi-private companies .
many post and telekom workers are effectively civil servants , and their retirements must therefore be paid by the state .
in compensation , the two companies are supposed to pay into eichel 's coffers € 18 billion .
the state will then convert these expected revenues into securities and sell them to investors , generating a further € 5.5 billion .
the part of the plan that has generated the most controversy was the move by eichel and german chancellor gerhard schröder to shift the day of german unity holiday from oct .
3 to the first sunday in october .
the government calculated that the extra day of work each year is worth annual gdp growth of 0.1 percent , that is , increased tax revenue .
critics speak out criticism of the plan came from opposition politicians as well as affected organizations .
the german civil servants association , deutscher beamtenbund , objected vociferously to the plan .
the group 's head , peter heesen , said such a move would endanger the implementation of the reform package previously agreed to with interior minister otto schily .
heesen also noted that civil servants already accepted benefits cuts as well as longer work hours in 2004 .
also strongly opposed to the plan to meet the eu criteria was the bdb association of german banks .
" the consolidation of federal finances is an urgent task facing germany , " bdb head manfred weber told news agencies in berlin .
" but the proposal that the government submitted is just a quick fix . "
while group said moving a holiday could indeed help long term growth , it criticized the plan for pushing current debt off to future budgets .
this is not a good solution for the current structural problems , weber said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu lodges " tank tourism " complaint germany 's political opposition is calling for fast and effective measures to combat so-called " tank tourism , " which sees germans flooding across borders to fill up their cars with cheaper gasoline .

revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years . german finance minister hans eichel presented his plan to make up for an unexpected € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12.9 billion -rrb- budget shortfall and bring the german economy in line with eu stability criteria thursday .
to this end , the minister said , he plans a pay freeze for civil servants , an additional workday for all germans , and securitization of deutsche post and deutsche telekom pensions , along with several other measures .
the package met with criticism from many quarters , and the plan to get rid of a key german holiday unleashed a political firestorm .
mineral oil , tobacco to blame tax revenues for 2004-2005 fell some € 4.8 billion short of previous forecasts .
in addition , the budget needed to be adjusted for an additional € 3 billion in spending on the job market .
the federal government will be hit especially hard by the measures ; the individual states got off relatively lightly , and local governments even got additional funds .
eichel blamed the lower-than-expected tax revenues on reduced mineral-oil and tobacco taxes , whereby local governments booked " superb increases in commercial taxes , " the finance ministry told news agencies .
despite the decline , the ministry said the government " is still holding on to its 2005 goal of having a budget deficit that will again return to below " the 3 percent euro-zone criteria .
controversial plan a big part of the government 's plan to plug the hole in its finances will be achieved by selling off pension liabilities at deutsche post and deutsche telekom , two semi-private companies .
many post and telekom workers are effectively civil servants , and their retirements must therefore be paid by the state .
in compensation , the two companies are supposed to pay into eichel 's coffers € 18 billion .
the state will then convert these expected revenues into securities and sell them to investors , generating a further € 5.5 billion .
the part of the plan that has generated the most controversy was the move by eichel and german chancellor gerhard schröder to shift the day of german unity holiday from oct .
3 to the first sunday in october .
the government calculated that the extra day of work each year is worth annual gdp growth of 0.1 percent , that is , increased tax revenue .
critics speak out criticism of the plan came from opposition politicians as well as affected organizations .
the german civil servants association , deutscher beamtenbund , objected vociferously to the plan .
the group 's head , peter heesen , said such a move would endanger the implementation of the reform package previously agreed to with interior minister otto schily .
heesen also noted that civil servants already accepted benefits cuts as well as longer work hours in 2004 .
also strongly opposed to the plan to meet the eu criteria was the bdb association of german banks .

barroso waits to replace prodi incoming eu executive head jose manuel barroso said friday he hopes for " clear " approval when eu lawmakers finally vote on his new team later this month , to end an unprecedented state of limbo in brussels . barroso was speaking after the european union parliament , which threatened the eu with crisis last month by blocking barroso 's first-choice line-up for the new european commission , set a new date of november 18 for a confidence vote . " i am very satisfied by the general reaction ...
i hope to have a strong vote , clear majority vote for the commission in the interests of the union , " barroso said after talks with party leaders in the eu legislative assembly . barroso was forced to withdraw his first-choice team on october 27 after eu lawmakers in strasbourg threatened to veto it notably over the inclusion of controversial italian nominee rocco buttiglione . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's rocco buttiglione .
buttiglione , who was nominated for the sensitive justice portfolio , had infuriated meps by describing homosexuality as a " sin " and saying that women should stay at home to have babies . barroso , portugal 's former prime minister , should have taken up his brussels job on november 1 .
outgoing commission chief romano prodi is staying on as a caretaker in the meantime . party leaders agree on date the new vote date was set by party group leaders after talks with barroso , who unveiled a reshuffled commission team at a two-day eu summit in brussels . confirmation hearings for three newly-designated nominees will be held on november 15 and 16 at the parliament , which will be holding its next monthly plenary session in strasbourg , sources said . the head of the socialist group in the eu assembly , which was the driving force behind last week 's veto threat , said friday he favored a swift resolution to the standoff .
" we prefer a result as early as possible , " said martin schulz , although adding that " if colleagues of other parties believe more time is needed , i 'm not going to get into a fight . " new commission nominees confirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's foreign minister franco frattini .
barroso had pledged to make a " limited " reshuffle to win parliament 's support , and his reformed line-up included two new members and one swap of portfolio .
he confirmed that italian foreign minister franco frattini was nominated to replace buttiglione .
frattini will also serve as one of five vice presidents of the commission . barroso said that latvia 's new nominee andris piebalgs will replace ingrida udre , who also failed to win eu lawmakers ' backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andris piebalgs .
but piebalgs will not take over the tax brief offered to udre , instead swapping that position for the energy portfolio first given to hungary 's laszlo kovacs , who was deemed unimpressive on that brief . kroes retains barroso support barroso stood by his controversial choice for competition commissioner , dutch minister neelie kroes , who has faced charges of conflict of interest in the key brief overseeing corporate takeovers and state aid decisions . prodi , who has delayed his return to italian politics to stay on in his brussels office , welcomed the breakthrough on his successor 's team .

yet , progress may not be as swift as british prime minister tony blair and his foreign secretary , jack straw , would wish .
they both reacted to george w. bush ’ s electoral triumph by declaring that the most pressing political challenge in the world today is to get the two sides back round the negotiating table .
the incapacitation of the palestinian leader will add credence to that view , the paper opined .
the guardian , from london , said arafat is " the father of the nation but not yet the father of the palestinian state . "
it wrote that 40 years on from the age of british de-colonization , he is the last man who can claim that status .
the paper recalled that arafat had to win recognition of the fact that there was such a thing as a palestinian nation at all .
" to move from defensive consolidation and start to build a nation was nigh impossible .
that arafat managed to do it and retain the affection of his people , not just as a symbol of independence but as a respected and approachable human being , is a tribute of his greatness . " the paris daily liberation wrote that yasser arafat ’ s death will usher in a dangerous phase for the palestinians .
his death might mean the birth of a new arab myth , but the immediate and burning question is whether palestine will survive arafat .
will his orphans manage to unite in a different way than through his symbol ? liberation ’ s compatriot le figaro , while praising arafat as one of the great figures of the 20th century , wonders whether he really wanted peace .
the former terrorist , who became the elected president of the palestinian authority , was during his entire life an expert at playing a double game .
he was so unpredictable that it was hard to know whether he was always acting in the interest of his people or in his own interest , the paper said . us president george w. bush 's election victory still gives commentators plenty of food for thought .
germany ’ s berliner zeitung wrote that there is little room for optimism in the analysis of washington ’ s future policies , but that for the political practice it is indispensable .
for without transatlantic cooperation there will never be a peace process in the middle east that deserves that name , and it will be even harder to slow down the spread of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
in addition , the berlin daily said , if america and europe feud , it reduces the western democracies effect on the rest of the world and weakens the fight against terrorism . incoming european commission president jose barroso tried to end the political crisis in the european union on thursday by unveiling his new team of commissioners after the european parliament had last month expressed concerns about a number of candidates , including italy ’ s rocco buttiglione .
commenting on his replacement with italian foreign minister franco frattini , the rome-based newspaper il messaggero write : " it took almost a month - dominated by negotiations , international squabbles and even crusades from other eras .
now it seems we have made it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.11.2004 german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily 's call for security reform in germany fell on deaf ears european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .
but conflicts of interests and privacy issues , especially in germany , are undermining investigations . just days after european investigators called for " sharper tools " and better intelligence-sharing in the war on terror , germany 's attempts to adhere to these calls has come up against a brick wall of the government 's making . interior minister otto schily , who addressed a security conference in wiesbaden on tuesday , told those attending that he was confident of forcing through constitutional changes to give the federal crime office - the bundeskriminalamt or bka - more " preventive powers , " including those which would allow german security forces to tap suspects ' telephones . but by thursday , schily was left frustrated at the unwillingness of the german government to reform the security services .
powers which would give the bka the ability to mount the increasingly sensitive and intrusive investigations schily recommends in the fight against terrorism would have to be agreed upon by the government , a course of action it is not willing to take at the moment . schily 's plan to create a central terror suspect database is also causing controversy .
the federal police and intelligence services have already had their headquarters moved to berlin as part of a drive to improve coordination , an initial part of the plan to centralize information on suspected muslim extremists . false accusation fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rights of germany 's three million muslims could be compromised .
but the creation of a central database for muslim fundamentalists is controversial , both with germany 's more than three million muslims and with privacy watchdogs .
federal data protection commissioner peter schaar told the security conference this week that muslims considered to be " extremists " must not be listed in such a database unless there was concrete evidence of links to terrorism . however , tensions were increased when top intelligence officials countered that view , claiming suspects could always be removed later if terrorist involvement was ruled out .
" we should n't let -lrb- militants -rrb- exploit our freedom and data protection rules , " said rüdiger von fritsch , deputy head of the foreign intelligence agency . the privacy issue aside , the creation of a centralized intelligence agency has increased tensions between the government and the16 german states , all of which have their own police and security forces .
at the moment , each of the german states is responsible for its own investigations into terrorist activities , something schily wants to reform in a bid to compile a nationwide network of efficient data collection and exchange under a bka banner . conflict with germany hindering process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking at the security conference , bka chief jörg ziercke -lrb- photo , with schily -rrb- said that the current situation often forced the agency to take a back seat to police forces in the federal states . " if we receive highly sensitive threat information , we do n't want to get into long discussions with the states on whether they have the resources to launch surveillance if i have the resources to do that myself , " he told journalists . the german bickering highlighted the problems facing the eu countries in the fight against terrorism in regard to speed of investigation and action . french investigating magistrate jean-louis bruguiere told the conference that the bureaucracy was undoing a lot of the good work being undertaken by european investigations .
" we must act in real time , " he told the conference .
" very often it takes much too long for appropriate action to be taken .
we must position ourselves so a house search can be carried out within the hour . " european initiatives suffering europe 's struggle to overhaul anti-terrorism cooperation since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 in the united states has been hampered partly by the reluctance of security services to circulate intelligence information in a european union of 25 countries for fear of compromising sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creation of a smoothly aligned europe-wide network of investigative organizations gained importance after the madrid train bombings on march 11 this year . " we can not deal with this threat on a local or national level ...
it 's about pooling and sharing intelligence on a cross-agency basis , " bruguiere said . agencies like the eu police body europol had " not reached their full potential yet , " he added .

but conflicts of interests and privacy issues , especially in germany , are undermining investigations . just days after european investigators called for " sharper tools " and better intelligence-sharing in the war on terror , germany 's attempts to adhere to these calls has come up against a brick wall of the government 's making . interior minister otto schily , who addressed a security conference in wiesbaden on tuesday , told those attending that he was confident of forcing through constitutional changes to give the federal crime office - the bundeskriminalamt or bka - more " preventive powers , " including those which would allow german security forces to tap suspects ' telephones . but by thursday , schily was left frustrated at the unwillingness of the german government to reform the security services .
powers which would give the bka the ability to mount the increasingly sensitive and intrusive investigations schily recommends in the fight against terrorism would have to be agreed upon by the government , a course of action it is not willing to take at the moment . schily 's plan to create a central terror suspect database is also causing controversy .

but the creation of a central database for muslim fundamentalists is controversial , both with germany 's more than three million muslims and with privacy watchdogs .

" we should n't let -lrb- militants -rrb- exploit our freedom and data protection rules , " said rüdiger von fritsch , deputy head of the foreign intelligence agency . the privacy issue aside , the creation of a centralized intelligence agency has increased tensions between the government and the16 german states , all of which have their own police and security forces .

" if we receive highly sensitive threat information , we do n't want to get into long discussions with the states on whether they have the resources to launch surveillance if i have the resources to do that myself , " he told journalists . the german bickering highlighted the problems facing the eu countries in the fight against terrorism in regard to speed of investigation and action . french investigating magistrate jean-louis bruguiere told the conference that the bureaucracy was undoing a lot of the good work being undertaken by european investigations .

" scrapping the oct .
3 holiday is no longer being pursued , " social democrat spokesman lars kühn said friday .
the move was heavily criticized by the media , and the country 's head of state horst köhler even wrote to chancellor gerhard schröder asking him to reconsider the move .
speaking in brussels friday , the chancellor regretfully withdrew the plan , citing lack of political support .
loud opposition the plan by german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel to rid the country of one of its work holidays was met with loud opposition - from within the government as well as political opponents .
the trouble started when the two social democrats proposed a plan to move the october 3 german unity day holiday - one of up to 16 national holidays - to a sunday , thereby gaining an extra day of work .
eichel introduced the plan as part of his new austerity measures , arguing it would potentially provide a 0.1 percent increase in gdp , and attendant tax revenue increases .
economics minister wolfgang clement said the move would bring in additional income of € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
a question of soul ?
but opponents to the idea retorted that to strike the national holiday was " unpatriotic , " akin to attacking the soul of the nation , referring to the overriding historical importance of the division and reunification of east and west .
" i wonder about the soul of a nation whose government plans such a thing , " lothar de maizere , east germany 's last prime minister , told german tv broadcaster ard .
the situation heated up further german president horst köhler wrote a letter to schröder in which he opposed the plan .
" taking october 3 as a symbol for the reunification of germany in peace and freedom is important for the future of our country , and should be retained , " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper quoted köhler as writing .
there could be better ways " to find an additional work day in order to take part in the consolidation of the country 's finances . "
done deal ?
but schröder parried back with a letter to köhler , according to mass-circulation daily bild .
he wrote that unity day is indeed very important , but added , " reunification was an extreme burden on our economy .
unity must be completed , and the number of holidays must be reduced . "
he finished by saying he was open to meeting with köhler to discuss better options .
despite the raging opposition , clement said that the plan " is not -lrb- just -rrb- an idea ; it will be carried out . "
and spd chief franz müntefering backed him up , telling the press that even if the opposition refuses to go along with the plan , " then we will go it alone . "
indeed , germany 's bundestag , the lower house of parliament , could make the change unilaterally .
the holiday was created by the german unity pact of 1990 , a federal law , and amending it would not require ratification by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament which represents the states .
opposition - from both sides but just because the government can pull it off , does n't mean people have to like it - not even members of the ruling party .
bundestag president wolfgang thierse , schleswig-holstein premier heide simonis , bremen mayor henning scherf , green party parliamentary group leader krista sager - all have openly criticized the plan .
and the opposition , of course , has been anything but quiet .
cdu secretary general laurenz meyer called the suggestion " unpatriotic . "
the idea shows that " this government does not have a positive attitude toward german unity and to the emotions that are tied to the event , " meyer told the kieler nachrichten newspaper .
the leaders of key opposition parties cdu and csu , angela merkel and edmund stoiber , accused the government of " forgetting history . "
in turn , spd secretary general klaus uwe benneter retorted , " it was the policies made under the leadership of spd leader willy brandt that made reunification possible . "
economists were less divided over the issue , since for the most part they dismissed the move as being likely to have little effect .

3 holiday is no longer being pursued , " social democrat spokesman lars kühn said friday .
the move was heavily criticized by the media , and the country 's head of state horst köhler even wrote to chancellor gerhard schröder asking him to reconsider the move .
speaking in brussels friday , the chancellor regretfully withdrew the plan , citing lack of political support .
loud opposition the plan by german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel to rid the country of one of its work holidays was met with loud opposition - from within the government as well as political opponents .
the trouble started when the two social democrats proposed a plan to move the october 3 german unity day holiday - one of up to 16 national holidays - to a sunday , thereby gaining an extra day of work .
eichel introduced the plan as part of his new austerity measures , arguing it would potentially provide a 0.1 percent increase in gdp , and attendant tax revenue increases .
economics minister wolfgang clement said the move would bring in additional income of € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
a question of soul ?
but opponents to the idea retorted that to strike the national holiday was " unpatriotic , " akin to attacking the soul of the nation , referring to the overriding historical importance of the division and reunification of east and west .
" i wonder about the soul of a nation whose government plans such a thing , " lothar de maizere , east germany 's last prime minister , told german tv broadcaster ard .
the situation heated up further german president horst köhler wrote a letter to schröder in which he opposed the plan .
" taking october 3 as a symbol for the reunification of germany in peace and freedom is important for the future of our country , and should be retained , " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper quoted köhler as writing .
there could be better ways " to find an additional work day in order to take part in the consolidation of the country 's finances . "
done deal ?
but schröder parried back with a letter to köhler , according to mass-circulation daily bild .
he wrote that unity day is indeed very important , but added , " reunification was an extreme burden on our economy .
unity must be completed , and the number of holidays must be reduced . "
he finished by saying he was open to meeting with köhler to discuss better options .
despite the raging opposition , clement said that the plan " is not -lrb- just -rrb- an idea ; it will be carried out . "
and spd chief franz müntefering backed him up , telling the press that even if the opposition refuses to go along with the plan , " then we will go it alone . "
indeed , germany 's bundestag , the lower house of parliament , could make the change unilaterally .
the holiday was created by the german unity pact of 1990 , a federal law , and amending it would not require ratification by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament which represents the states .
opposition - from both sides but just because the government can pull it off , does n't mean people have to like it - not even members of the ruling party .

in turn , spd secretary general klaus uwe benneter retorted , " it was the policies made under the leadership of spd leader willy brandt that made reunification possible . "
economists were less divided over the issue , since for the most part they dismissed the move as being likely to have little effect .

yet , progress may not be as swift as british prime minister tony blair and his foreign secretary , jack straw , would wish .
they both reacted to george w. bush ’ s electoral triumph by declaring that the most pressing political challenge in the world today is to get the two sides back round the negotiating table .
the incapacitation of the palestinian leader will add credence to that view , the paper opined .
the guardian , from london , said arafat is " the father of the nation but not yet the father of the palestinian state . "
it wrote that 40 years on from the age of british de-colonization , he is the last man who can claim that status .
the paper recalled that arafat had to win recognition of the fact that there was such a thing as a palestinian nation at all .
" to move from defensive consolidation and start to build a nation was nigh impossible .
that arafat managed to do it and retain the affection of his people , not just as a symbol of independence but as a respected and approachable human being , is a tribute of his greatness . " the paris daily liberation wrote that yasser arafat ’ s death will usher in a dangerous phase for the palestinians .
his death might mean the birth of a new arab myth , but the immediate and burning question is whether palestine will survive arafat .
will his orphans manage to unite in a different way than through his symbol ? liberation ’ s compatriot le figaro , while praising arafat as one of the great figures of the 20th century , wonders whether he really wanted peace .
the former terrorist , who became the elected president of the palestinian authority , was during his entire life an expert at playing a double game .
he was so unpredictable that it was hard to know whether he was always acting in the interest of his people or in his own interest , the paper said . us president george w. bush 's election victory still gives commentators plenty of food for thought .
germany ’ s berliner zeitung wrote that there is little room for optimism in the analysis of washington ’ s future policies , but that for the political practice it is indispensable .
for without transatlantic cooperation there will never be a peace process in the middle east that deserves that name , and it will be even harder to slow down the spread of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
in addition , the berlin daily said , if america and europe feud , it reduces the western democracies effect on the rest of the world and weakens the fight against terrorism . incoming european commission president jose barroso tried to end the political crisis in the european union on thursday by unveiling his new team of commissioners after the european parliament had last month expressed concerns about a number of candidates , including italy ’ s rocco buttiglione .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.11.2004 eichel presents eu-friendly budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can eichel 's plan really keep the deficit in check ?
revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years . german finance minister hans eichel presented his plan to make up for an unexpected € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12.9 billion -rrb- budget shortfall and bring the german economy in line with eu stability criteria thursday .
to this end , the minister said , he plans a pay freeze for civil servants , an additional workday for all germans , and securitization of deutsche post and deutsche telekom pensions , along with several other measures .
the package met with criticism from many quarters , and the plan to get rid of a key german holiday unleashed a political firestorm .
mineral oil , tobacco to blame tax revenues for 2004-2005 fell some € 4.8 billion short of previous forecasts .
in addition , the budget needed to be adjusted for an additional € 3 billion in spending on the job market .
the federal government will be hit especially hard by the measures ; the individual states got off relatively lightly , and local governments even got additional funds .
eichel blamed the lower-than-expected tax revenues on reduced mineral-oil and tobacco taxes , whereby local governments booked " superb increases in commercial taxes , " the finance ministry told news agencies .
despite the decline , the ministry said the government " is still holding on to its 2005 goal of having a budget deficit that will again return to below " the 3 percent euro-zone criteria .
controversial plan a big part of the government 's plan to plug the hole in its finances will be achieved by selling off pension liabilities at deutsche post and deutsche telekom , two semi-private companies .
many post and telekom workers are effectively civil servants , and their retirements must therefore be paid by the state .
in compensation , the two companies are supposed to pay into eichel 's coffers € 18 billion .
the state will then convert these expected revenues into securities and sell them to investors , generating a further € 5.5 billion .
the part of the plan that has generated the most controversy was the move by eichel and german chancellor gerhard schröder to shift the day of german unity holiday from oct .
3 to the first sunday in october .
the government calculated that the extra day of work each year is worth annual gdp growth of 0.1 percent , that is , increased tax revenue .
critics speak out criticism of the plan came from opposition politicians as well as affected organizations .
the german civil servants association , deutscher beamtenbund , objected vociferously to the plan .
the group 's head , peter heesen , said such a move would endanger the implementation of the reform package previously agreed to with interior minister otto schily .
heesen also noted that civil servants already accepted benefits cuts as well as longer work hours in 2004 .
also strongly opposed to the plan to meet the eu criteria was the bdb association of german banks .
" the consolidation of federal finances is an urgent task facing germany , " bdb head manfred weber told news agencies in berlin .
" but the proposal that the government submitted is just a quick fix . "
while group said moving a holiday could indeed help long term growth , it criticized the plan for pushing current debt off to future budgets .
this is not a good solution for the current structural problems , weber said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu lodges " tank tourism " complaint germany 's political opposition is calling for fast and effective measures to combat so-called " tank tourism , " which sees germans flooding across borders to fill up their cars with cheaper gasoline .

iyad allawi had asked the the eu to " open a new chapter " and overcome divisions caused by the iraq war . despite having irked several eu leaders by describing states that opposed the us-led war in iraq as " spectators , " iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi successfully appealed for greater unity on iraq .
in a day of talks aimed at drumming up financial and other support from nato and the european union , allawi stressed that time is of the essence . " there is a real battle in iraq today , " he said .
" delays measured even in hours and days can cost lives . " the new eu aid package consists of an extra € 16.5 million -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- cash for elections due in january , support for developing iraq 's justice system , and help for a united nations protection force to oversee the elections . both nato and the eu were plunged into crisis by last year 's iraq conflict , in both cases pitting an anti-war grouping spearheaded by france and germany against pro-war countries . and despite agreements on the need to help rebuild the conflict-scarred country , tensions have lingered , with the anti-war camp refusing to send any military forces to iraq . " slip of the tongue " the tensions resurfaced in brussels after allawi urged " spectator " states to engage in iraq , notably angering france , whose president , jacques chirac , left early and missed an eu lunch with allawi - even if aides said it was not a snub . german chancellor gerhard schröder called allawi 's comment " a slip of the tongue " and said he would remind him that germany is training iraqi police and military in the united arab emirates and had offered to write off a substantial amount of iraqi debt . allawi also complained about plans by european countries such as hungary and the netherlands to withdraw their troops from the us-led coalition in iraq .
he said " we all need to close ranks and defeat terrorism " and urged eu countries to keep troops in iraq . eu congratulates bush meanwhile , british prime minister tony blair urged european leaders to accept us president george w. bush 's re-election , commenting that some eu leaders were in a " state of denial . " in a draft joint statement , eu leaders congratulated president bush , and said they look forward to working closely with him and his administration to " combine efforts , including in multilateral institutions , to promote the rule of law and create a just , democratic and secure world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder and president bush have put their differences aside chancellor schröder told a news conference in brussels that he personally telephoned bush on friday to congratulate him . the two leaders went for months without speaking after schröder based his re-election campaign on opposition to the war in iraq .

barroso waits to replace prodi incoming eu executive head jose manuel barroso said friday he hopes for " clear " approval when eu lawmakers finally vote on his new team later this month , to end an unprecedented state of limbo in brussels . barroso was speaking after the european union parliament , which threatened the eu with crisis last month by blocking barroso 's first-choice line-up for the new european commission , set a new date of november 18 for a confidence vote . " i am very satisfied by the general reaction ...
i hope to have a strong vote , clear majority vote for the commission in the interests of the union , " barroso said after talks with party leaders in the eu legislative assembly . barroso was forced to withdraw his first-choice team on october 27 after eu lawmakers in strasbourg threatened to veto it notably over the inclusion of controversial italian nominee rocco buttiglione . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's rocco buttiglione .
buttiglione , who was nominated for the sensitive justice portfolio , had infuriated meps by describing homosexuality as a " sin " and saying that women should stay at home to have babies . barroso , portugal 's former prime minister , should have taken up his brussels job on november 1 .
outgoing commission chief romano prodi is staying on as a caretaker in the meantime . party leaders agree on date the new vote date was set by party group leaders after talks with barroso , who unveiled a reshuffled commission team at a two-day eu summit in brussels . confirmation hearings for three newly-designated nominees will be held on november 15 and 16 at the parliament , which will be holding its next monthly plenary session in strasbourg , sources said . the head of the socialist group in the eu assembly , which was the driving force behind last week 's veto threat , said friday he favored a swift resolution to the standoff .
" we prefer a result as early as possible , " said martin schulz , although adding that " if colleagues of other parties believe more time is needed , i 'm not going to get into a fight . " new commission nominees confirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's foreign minister franco frattini .
barroso had pledged to make a " limited " reshuffle to win parliament 's support , and his reformed line-up included two new members and one swap of portfolio .
he confirmed that italian foreign minister franco frattini was nominated to replace buttiglione .
frattini will also serve as one of five vice presidents of the commission . barroso said that latvia 's new nominee andris piebalgs will replace ingrida udre , who also failed to win eu lawmakers ' backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andris piebalgs .
but piebalgs will not take over the tax brief offered to udre , instead swapping that position for the energy portfolio first given to hungary 's laszlo kovacs , who was deemed unimpressive on that brief . kroes retains barroso support barroso stood by his controversial choice for competition commissioner , dutch minister neelie kroes , who has faced charges of conflict of interest in the key brief overseeing corporate takeovers and state aid decisions . prodi , who has delayed his return to italian politics to stay on in his brussels office , welcomed the breakthrough on his successor 's team .

" i am very satisfied by the general reaction ...
i hope to have a strong vote , clear majority vote for the commission in the interests of the union , " barroso said after talks with party leaders in the eu legislative assembly . barroso was forced to withdraw his first-choice team on october 27 after eu lawmakers in strasbourg threatened to veto it notably over the inclusion of controversial italian nominee rocco buttiglione . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's rocco buttiglione .
buttiglione , who was nominated for the sensitive justice portfolio , had infuriated meps by describing homosexuality as a " sin " and saying that women should stay at home to have babies . barroso , portugal 's former prime minister , should have taken up his brussels job on november 1 .
outgoing commission chief romano prodi is staying on as a caretaker in the meantime . party leaders agree on date the new vote date was set by party group leaders after talks with barroso , who unveiled a reshuffled commission team at a two-day eu summit in brussels . confirmation hearings for three newly-designated nominees will be held on november 15 and 16 at the parliament , which will be holding its next monthly plenary session in strasbourg , sources said . the head of the socialist group in the eu assembly , which was the driving force behind last week 's veto threat , said friday he favored a swift resolution to the standoff .

" new commission nominees confirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's foreign minister franco frattini .
barroso had pledged to make a " limited " reshuffle to win parliament 's support , and his reformed line-up included two new members and one swap of portfolio .
he confirmed that italian foreign minister franco frattini was nominated to replace buttiglione .
frattini will also serve as one of five vice presidents of the commission . barroso said that latvia 's new nominee andris piebalgs will replace ingrida udre , who also failed to win eu lawmakers ' backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andris piebalgs .

loud opposition the plan by german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel to rid the country of one of its work holidays was met with loud opposition - from within the government as well as political opponents .
the trouble started when the two social democrats proposed a plan to move the october 3 german unity day holiday - one of up to 16 national holidays - to a sunday , thereby gaining an extra day of work .
eichel introduced the plan as part of his new austerity measures , arguing it would potentially provide a 0.1 percent increase in gdp , and attendant tax revenue increases .
economics minister wolfgang clement said the move would bring in additional income of € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
a question of soul ?

" i wonder about the soul of a nation whose government plans such a thing , " lothar de maizere , east germany 's last prime minister , told german tv broadcaster ard .
the situation heated up further german president horst köhler wrote a letter to schröder in which he opposed the plan .
" taking october 3 as a symbol for the reunification of germany in peace and freedom is important for the future of our country , and should be retained , " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper quoted köhler as writing .
there could be better ways " to find an additional work day in order to take part in the consolidation of the country 's finances . "
done deal ?
but schröder parried back with a letter to köhler , according to mass-circulation daily bild .
he wrote that unity day is indeed very important , but added , " reunification was an extreme burden on our economy .
unity must be completed , and the number of holidays must be reduced . "
he finished by saying he was open to meeting with köhler to discuss better options .
despite the raging opposition , clement said that the plan " is not -lrb- just -rrb- an idea ; it will be carried out . "
and spd chief franz müntefering backed him up , telling the press that even if the opposition refuses to go along with the plan , " then we will go it alone . "
indeed , germany 's bundestag , the lower house of parliament , could make the change unilaterally .
the holiday was created by the german unity pact of 1990 , a federal law , and amending it would not require ratification by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament which represents the states .
opposition - from both sides but just because the government can pull it off , does n't mean people have to like it - not even members of the ruling party .
bundestag president wolfgang thierse , schleswig-holstein premier heide simonis , bremen mayor henning scherf , green party parliamentary group leader krista sager - all have openly criticized the plan .

the trouble started when the two social democrats proposed a plan to move the october 3 german unity day holiday - one of up to 16 national holidays - to a sunday , thereby gaining an extra day of work .
eichel introduced the plan as part of his new austerity measures , arguing it would potentially provide a 0.1 percent increase in gdp , and attendant tax revenue increases .
economics minister wolfgang clement said the move would bring in additional income of € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
a question of soul ?
but opponents to the idea retorted that to strike the national holiday was " unpatriotic , " akin to attacking the soul of the nation , referring to the overriding historical importance of the division and reunification of east and west .
" i wonder about the soul of a nation whose government plans such a thing , " lothar de maizere , east germany 's last prime minister , told german tv broadcaster ard .
the situation heated up further german president horst köhler wrote a letter to schröder in which he opposed the plan .
" taking october 3 as a symbol for the reunification of germany in peace and freedom is important for the future of our country , and should be retained , " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper quoted köhler as writing .
there could be better ways " to find an additional work day in order to take part in the consolidation of the country 's finances . "
done deal ?
but schröder parried back with a letter to köhler , according to mass-circulation daily bild .
he wrote that unity day is indeed very important , but added , " reunification was an extreme burden on our economy .
unity must be completed , and the number of holidays must be reduced . "
he finished by saying he was open to meeting with köhler to discuss better options .
despite the raging opposition , clement said that the plan " is not -lrb- just -rrb- an idea ; it will be carried out . "
and spd chief franz müntefering backed him up , telling the press that even if the opposition refuses to go along with the plan , " then we will go it alone . "
indeed , germany 's bundestag , the lower house of parliament , could make the change unilaterally .
the holiday was created by the german unity pact of 1990 , a federal law , and amending it would not require ratification by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament which represents the states .

bundestag president wolfgang thierse , schleswig-holstein premier heide simonis , bremen mayor henning scherf , green party parliamentary group leader krista sager - all have openly criticized the plan .

" we are now back on track .
we need to get back to work quickly , " barroso told a news conference after presenting his slightly modified line-up to eu leaders . the most high-profile change is that of the future justice and security chief .
barroso said italian foreign minister franco frattini would replace rocco buttiglione , whose conservative views on homosexuality and the role of women stirred anger among many eu parliamentarians and threatened to derail the entire commission . barroso also announced that laszlo kovacs of hungary would switch from energy to taxation and a new latvian nominee , andris piebalgs , would take the energy portfolio .
another controversial nominee , neelie kroes from the netherlands , would be retained as competition commissioner . us-eu future meeting at european union headquarters in brussels a day after president george bush was re-elected to the white house , leaders from the 25 member states were just as focused on the future path of us-eu relations as on the set economic agenda .
on the eve of the two-day summit which will include talks with iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi , the eu pledged to overhaul transatlantic links strained to the breaking point during the president 's first term .
both eu and us officials said they hoped bush 's second term would start out on a much better note and bring the two regions closer together again .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , who holds the eu 's rotating presidency , sent a personal letter of congratulation to bush .
" the united states and the european union are linked by strong cultural , economic and political ties , and by our shared values ...
the presidency is confident that this relationship will be further deepened and strengthened under the new administration , " it said .
iraq on the agenda eu nations have been deeply split over us policy in iraq , with britain spearheading support for the war while germany and france staunchly opposed military intervention .
only recently has the bloc begun overcoming those differences to work for the shattered country 's reconstruction .
on tuesday eu foreign ministers agreed to a package of financial and logistical support initiatives for iraq ahead of the country 's elections planned for january .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot said the deal showed that the eu was " united again " after its iraq rift .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi a meeting with iraqi interim leader allawi on friday will help further shore up common eu support for bolstering iraq 's struggling democracy .
economic focus in addition to foreign policy issues , the 25 eu leaders are expected to focus on a report by former dutch prime minister wim kok on the so-called lisbon agenda , the bloc 's grand plan launched in 2000 to make europe the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .
the report paints a gloomy future , warning that " too many targets promise to be seriously missed . "
nonetheless eu leaders are likely to express renewed commitment to the economic goals and examine ways to press ahead with market-oriented reforms in the face of new enlargement prospects and current difficulties in bringing the 10 newest accession states up to an economic par with the rest of the bloc .
many leaders will also be looking towards the summit as a good opportunity to resolve the crisis that was sparked last week when incoming european commission chief jose manuel barroso was forced to withdraw his proposed executive team due to protests by eu lawmakers . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in emotional speech , kerry concedes defeat in a gracious speech before supporters a clearly emotional senator john kerry conceded defeat and urged the country to find " common cause .

" we are now back on track .
we need to get back to work quickly , " barroso told a news conference after presenting his slightly modified line-up to eu leaders . the most high-profile change is that of the future justice and security chief .
barroso said italian foreign minister franco frattini would replace rocco buttiglione , whose conservative views on homosexuality and the role of women stirred anger among many eu parliamentarians and threatened to derail the entire commission . barroso also announced that laszlo kovacs of hungary would switch from energy to taxation and a new latvian nominee , andris piebalgs , would take the energy portfolio .

on the eve of the two-day summit which will include talks with iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi , the eu pledged to overhaul transatlantic links strained to the breaking point during the president 's first term .
both eu and us officials said they hoped bush 's second term would start out on a much better note and bring the two regions closer together again .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , who holds the eu 's rotating presidency , sent a personal letter of congratulation to bush .
" the united states and the european union are linked by strong cultural , economic and political ties , and by our shared values ...
the presidency is confident that this relationship will be further deepened and strengthened under the new administration , " it said .
iraq on the agenda eu nations have been deeply split over us policy in iraq , with britain spearheading support for the war while germany and france staunchly opposed military intervention .
only recently has the bloc begun overcoming those differences to work for the shattered country 's reconstruction .
on tuesday eu foreign ministers agreed to a package of financial and logistical support initiatives for iraq ahead of the country 's elections planned for january .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot said the deal showed that the eu was " united again " after its iraq rift .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi a meeting with iraqi interim leader allawi on friday will help further shore up common eu support for bolstering iraq 's struggling democracy .

the report paints a gloomy future , warning that " too many targets promise to be seriously missed . "
nonetheless eu leaders are likely to express renewed commitment to the economic goals and examine ways to press ahead with market-oriented reforms in the face of new enlargement prospects and current difficulties in bringing the 10 newest accession states up to an economic par with the rest of the bloc .

revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years . german finance minister hans eichel presented his plan to make up for an unexpected € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12.9 billion -rrb- budget shortfall and bring the german economy in line with eu stability criteria thursday .
to this end , the minister said , he plans a pay freeze for civil servants , an additional workday for all germans , and securitization of deutsche post and deutsche telekom pensions , along with several other measures .
the package met with criticism from many quarters , and the plan to get rid of a key german holiday unleashed a political firestorm .
mineral oil , tobacco to blame tax revenues for 2004-2005 fell some € 4.8 billion short of previous forecasts .
in addition , the budget needed to be adjusted for an additional € 3 billion in spending on the job market .
the federal government will be hit especially hard by the measures ; the individual states got off relatively lightly , and local governments even got additional funds .
eichel blamed the lower-than-expected tax revenues on reduced mineral-oil and tobacco taxes , whereby local governments booked " superb increases in commercial taxes , " the finance ministry told news agencies .
despite the decline , the ministry said the government " is still holding on to its 2005 goal of having a budget deficit that will again return to below " the 3 percent euro-zone criteria .
controversial plan a big part of the government 's plan to plug the hole in its finances will be achieved by selling off pension liabilities at deutsche post and deutsche telekom , two semi-private companies .
many post and telekom workers are effectively civil servants , and their retirements must therefore be paid by the state .
in compensation , the two companies are supposed to pay into eichel 's coffers € 18 billion .
the state will then convert these expected revenues into securities and sell them to investors , generating a further € 5.5 billion .
the part of the plan that has generated the most controversy was the move by eichel and german chancellor gerhard schröder to shift the day of german unity holiday from oct .
3 to the first sunday in october .
the government calculated that the extra day of work each year is worth annual gdp growth of 0.1 percent , that is , increased tax revenue .
critics speak out criticism of the plan came from opposition politicians as well as affected organizations .
the german civil servants association , deutscher beamtenbund , objected vociferously to the plan .
the group 's head , peter heesen , said such a move would endanger the implementation of the reform package previously agreed to with interior minister otto schily .
heesen also noted that civil servants already accepted benefits cuts as well as longer work hours in 2004 .
also strongly opposed to the plan to meet the eu criteria was the bdb association of german banks .
" the consolidation of federal finances is an urgent task facing germany , " bdb head manfred weber told news agencies in berlin .
" but the proposal that the government submitted is just a quick fix . "
while group said moving a holiday could indeed help long term growth , it criticized the plan for pushing current debt off to future budgets .
this is not a good solution for the current structural problems , weber said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu lodges " tank tourism " complaint germany 's political opposition is calling for fast and effective measures to combat so-called " tank tourism , " which sees germans flooding across borders to fill up their cars with cheaper gasoline .

revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years . german finance minister hans eichel presented his plan to make up for an unexpected € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12.9 billion -rrb- budget shortfall and bring the german economy in line with eu stability criteria thursday .
to this end , the minister said , he plans a pay freeze for civil servants , an additional workday for all germans , and securitization of deutsche post and deutsche telekom pensions , along with several other measures .
the package met with criticism from many quarters , and the plan to get rid of a key german holiday unleashed a political firestorm .
mineral oil , tobacco to blame tax revenues for 2004-2005 fell some € 4.8 billion short of previous forecasts .
in addition , the budget needed to be adjusted for an additional € 3 billion in spending on the job market .
the federal government will be hit especially hard by the measures ; the individual states got off relatively lightly , and local governments even got additional funds .
eichel blamed the lower-than-expected tax revenues on reduced mineral-oil and tobacco taxes , whereby local governments booked " superb increases in commercial taxes , " the finance ministry told news agencies .
despite the decline , the ministry said the government " is still holding on to its 2005 goal of having a budget deficit that will again return to below " the 3 percent euro-zone criteria .
controversial plan a big part of the government 's plan to plug the hole in its finances will be achieved by selling off pension liabilities at deutsche post and deutsche telekom , two semi-private companies .
many post and telekom workers are effectively civil servants , and their retirements must therefore be paid by the state .
in compensation , the two companies are supposed to pay into eichel 's coffers € 18 billion .
the state will then convert these expected revenues into securities and sell them to investors , generating a further € 5.5 billion .
the part of the plan that has generated the most controversy was the move by eichel and german chancellor gerhard schröder to shift the day of german unity holiday from oct .
3 to the first sunday in october .
the government calculated that the extra day of work each year is worth annual gdp growth of 0.1 percent , that is , increased tax revenue .
critics speak out criticism of the plan came from opposition politicians as well as affected organizations .
the german civil servants association , deutscher beamtenbund , objected vociferously to the plan .
the group 's head , peter heesen , said such a move would endanger the implementation of the reform package previously agreed to with interior minister otto schily .
heesen also noted that civil servants already accepted benefits cuts as well as longer work hours in 2004 .
also strongly opposed to the plan to meet the eu criteria was the bdb association of german banks .
" the consolidation of federal finances is an urgent task facing germany , " bdb head manfred weber told news agencies in berlin .
" but the proposal that the government submitted is just a quick fix . "
while group said moving a holiday could indeed help long term growth , it criticized the plan for pushing current debt off to future budgets .
this is not a good solution for the current structural problems , weber said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu lodges " tank tourism " complaint germany 's political opposition is calling for fast and effective measures to combat so-called " tank tourism , " which sees germans flooding across borders to fill up their cars with cheaper gasoline .

" we are now back on track .
we need to get back to work quickly , " barroso told a news conference after presenting his slightly modified line-up to eu leaders . the most high-profile change is that of the future justice and security chief .
barroso said italian foreign minister franco frattini would replace rocco buttiglione , whose conservative views on homosexuality and the role of women stirred anger among many eu parliamentarians and threatened to derail the entire commission . barroso also announced that laszlo kovacs of hungary would switch from energy to taxation and a new latvian nominee , andris piebalgs , would take the energy portfolio .
another controversial nominee , neelie kroes from the netherlands , would be retained as competition commissioner . us-eu future meeting at european union headquarters in brussels a day after president george bush was re-elected to the white house , leaders from the 25 member states were just as focused on the future path of us-eu relations as on the set economic agenda .
on the eve of the two-day summit which will include talks with iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi , the eu pledged to overhaul transatlantic links strained to the breaking point during the president 's first term .
both eu and us officials said they hoped bush 's second term would start out on a much better note and bring the two regions closer together again .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , who holds the eu 's rotating presidency , sent a personal letter of congratulation to bush .
" the united states and the european union are linked by strong cultural , economic and political ties , and by our shared values ...
the presidency is confident that this relationship will be further deepened and strengthened under the new administration , " it said .
iraq on the agenda eu nations have been deeply split over us policy in iraq , with britain spearheading support for the war while germany and france staunchly opposed military intervention .
only recently has the bloc begun overcoming those differences to work for the shattered country 's reconstruction .
on tuesday eu foreign ministers agreed to a package of financial and logistical support initiatives for iraq ahead of the country 's elections planned for january .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot said the deal showed that the eu was " united again " after its iraq rift .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi a meeting with iraqi interim leader allawi on friday will help further shore up common eu support for bolstering iraq 's struggling democracy .
economic focus in addition to foreign policy issues , the 25 eu leaders are expected to focus on a report by former dutch prime minister wim kok on the so-called lisbon agenda , the bloc 's grand plan launched in 2000 to make europe the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .
the report paints a gloomy future , warning that " too many targets promise to be seriously missed . "
nonetheless eu leaders are likely to express renewed commitment to the economic goals and examine ways to press ahead with market-oriented reforms in the face of new enlargement prospects and current difficulties in bringing the 10 newest accession states up to an economic par with the rest of the bloc .
many leaders will also be looking towards the summit as a good opportunity to resolve the crisis that was sparked last week when incoming european commission chief jose manuel barroso was forced to withdraw his proposed executive team due to protests by eu lawmakers . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in emotional speech , kerry concedes defeat in a gracious speech before supporters a clearly emotional senator john kerry conceded defeat and urged the country to find " common cause .

barroso waits to replace prodi incoming eu executive head jose manuel barroso said friday he hopes for " clear " approval when eu lawmakers finally vote on his new team later this month , to end an unprecedented state of limbo in brussels . barroso was speaking after the european union parliament , which threatened the eu with crisis last month by blocking barroso 's first-choice line-up for the new european commission , set a new date of november 18 for a confidence vote . " i am very satisfied by the general reaction ...
i hope to have a strong vote , clear majority vote for the commission in the interests of the union , " barroso said after talks with party leaders in the eu legislative assembly . barroso was forced to withdraw his first-choice team on october 27 after eu lawmakers in strasbourg threatened to veto it notably over the inclusion of controversial italian nominee rocco buttiglione . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's rocco buttiglione .
buttiglione , who was nominated for the sensitive justice portfolio , had infuriated meps by describing homosexuality as a " sin " and saying that women should stay at home to have babies . barroso , portugal 's former prime minister , should have taken up his brussels job on november 1 .
outgoing commission chief romano prodi is staying on as a caretaker in the meantime . party leaders agree on date the new vote date was set by party group leaders after talks with barroso , who unveiled a reshuffled commission team at a two-day eu summit in brussels . confirmation hearings for three newly-designated nominees will be held on november 15 and 16 at the parliament , which will be holding its next monthly plenary session in strasbourg , sources said . the head of the socialist group in the eu assembly , which was the driving force behind last week 's veto threat , said friday he favored a swift resolution to the standoff .
" we prefer a result as early as possible , " said martin schulz , although adding that " if colleagues of other parties believe more time is needed , i 'm not going to get into a fight . " new commission nominees confirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's foreign minister franco frattini .
barroso had pledged to make a " limited " reshuffle to win parliament 's support , and his reformed line-up included two new members and one swap of portfolio .
he confirmed that italian foreign minister franco frattini was nominated to replace buttiglione .
frattini will also serve as one of five vice presidents of the commission . barroso said that latvia 's new nominee andris piebalgs will replace ingrida udre , who also failed to win eu lawmakers ' backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andris piebalgs .
but piebalgs will not take over the tax brief offered to udre , instead swapping that position for the energy portfolio first given to hungary 's laszlo kovacs , who was deemed unimpressive on that brief . kroes retains barroso support barroso stood by his controversial choice for competition commissioner , dutch minister neelie kroes , who has faced charges of conflict of interest in the key brief overseeing corporate takeovers and state aid decisions . prodi , who has delayed his return to italian politics to stay on in his brussels office , welcomed the breakthrough on his successor 's team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.11.2004 german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily 's call for security reform in germany fell on deaf ears european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .
but conflicts of interests and privacy issues , especially in germany , are undermining investigations . just days after european investigators called for " sharper tools " and better intelligence-sharing in the war on terror , germany 's attempts to adhere to these calls has come up against a brick wall of the government 's making . interior minister otto schily , who addressed a security conference in wiesbaden on tuesday , told those attending that he was confident of forcing through constitutional changes to give the federal crime office - the bundeskriminalamt or bka - more " preventive powers , " including those which would allow german security forces to tap suspects ' telephones . but by thursday , schily was left frustrated at the unwillingness of the german government to reform the security services .
powers which would give the bka the ability to mount the increasingly sensitive and intrusive investigations schily recommends in the fight against terrorism would have to be agreed upon by the government , a course of action it is not willing to take at the moment . schily 's plan to create a central terror suspect database is also causing controversy .
the federal police and intelligence services have already had their headquarters moved to berlin as part of a drive to improve coordination , an initial part of the plan to centralize information on suspected muslim extremists . false accusation fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rights of germany 's three million muslims could be compromised .
but the creation of a central database for muslim fundamentalists is controversial , both with germany 's more than three million muslims and with privacy watchdogs .
federal data protection commissioner peter schaar told the security conference this week that muslims considered to be " extremists " must not be listed in such a database unless there was concrete evidence of links to terrorism . however , tensions were increased when top intelligence officials countered that view , claiming suspects could always be removed later if terrorist involvement was ruled out .
" we should n't let -lrb- militants -rrb- exploit our freedom and data protection rules , " said rüdiger von fritsch , deputy head of the foreign intelligence agency . the privacy issue aside , the creation of a centralized intelligence agency has increased tensions between the government and the16 german states , all of which have their own police and security forces .
at the moment , each of the german states is responsible for its own investigations into terrorist activities , something schily wants to reform in a bid to compile a nationwide network of efficient data collection and exchange under a bka banner . conflict with germany hindering process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking at the security conference , bka chief jörg ziercke -lrb- photo , with schily -rrb- said that the current situation often forced the agency to take a back seat to police forces in the federal states . " if we receive highly sensitive threat information , we do n't want to get into long discussions with the states on whether they have the resources to launch surveillance if i have the resources to do that myself , " he told journalists . the german bickering highlighted the problems facing the eu countries in the fight against terrorism in regard to speed of investigation and action . french investigating magistrate jean-louis bruguiere told the conference that the bureaucracy was undoing a lot of the good work being undertaken by european investigations .
" we must act in real time , " he told the conference .
" very often it takes much too long for appropriate action to be taken .
we must position ourselves so a house search can be carried out within the hour . " european initiatives suffering europe 's struggle to overhaul anti-terrorism cooperation since the attacks of sept .

" we can not deal with this threat on a local or national level ...
it 's about pooling and sharing intelligence on a cross-agency basis , " bruguiere said . agencies like the eu police body europol had " not reached their full potential yet , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.11.2004 iraq dominates eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iyad allawi 's presence in brussels was n't without controversy the eu answered an appeal by iraq 's interim leader on friday by pledging new funds to support iraqi elections .
iyad allawi had asked the the eu to " open a new chapter " and overcome divisions caused by the iraq war . despite having irked several eu leaders by describing states that opposed the us-led war in iraq as " spectators , " iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi successfully appealed for greater unity on iraq .
in a day of talks aimed at drumming up financial and other support from nato and the european union , allawi stressed that time is of the essence . " there is a real battle in iraq today , " he said .
" delays measured even in hours and days can cost lives . " the new eu aid package consists of an extra € 16.5 million -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- cash for elections due in january , support for developing iraq 's justice system , and help for a united nations protection force to oversee the elections . both nato and the eu were plunged into crisis by last year 's iraq conflict , in both cases pitting an anti-war grouping spearheaded by france and germany against pro-war countries . and despite agreements on the need to help rebuild the conflict-scarred country , tensions have lingered , with the anti-war camp refusing to send any military forces to iraq . " slip of the tongue " the tensions resurfaced in brussels after allawi urged " spectator " states to engage in iraq , notably angering france , whose president , jacques chirac , left early and missed an eu lunch with allawi - even if aides said it was not a snub . german chancellor gerhard schröder called allawi 's comment " a slip of the tongue " and said he would remind him that germany is training iraqi police and military in the united arab emirates and had offered to write off a substantial amount of iraqi debt . allawi also complained about plans by european countries such as hungary and the netherlands to withdraw their troops from the us-led coalition in iraq .
he said " we all need to close ranks and defeat terrorism " and urged eu countries to keep troops in iraq . eu congratulates bush meanwhile , british prime minister tony blair urged european leaders to accept us president george w. bush 's re-election , commenting that some eu leaders were in a " state of denial . " in a draft joint statement , eu leaders congratulated president bush , and said they look forward to working closely with him and his administration to " combine efforts , including in multilateral institutions , to promote the rule of law and create a just , democratic and secure world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder and president bush have put their differences aside chancellor schröder told a news conference in brussels that he personally telephoned bush on friday to congratulate him . the two leaders went for months without speaking after schröder based his re-election campaign on opposition to the war in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.11.2004 eichel presents eu-friendly budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can eichel 's plan really keep the deficit in check ?
revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years . german finance minister hans eichel presented his plan to make up for an unexpected € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12.9 billion -rrb- budget shortfall and bring the german economy in line with eu stability criteria thursday .
to this end , the minister said , he plans a pay freeze for civil servants , an additional workday for all germans , and securitization of deutsche post and deutsche telekom pensions , along with several other measures .
the package met with criticism from many quarters , and the plan to get rid of a key german holiday unleashed a political firestorm .
mineral oil , tobacco to blame tax revenues for 2004-2005 fell some € 4.8 billion short of previous forecasts .
in addition , the budget needed to be adjusted for an additional € 3 billion in spending on the job market .
the federal government will be hit especially hard by the measures ; the individual states got off relatively lightly , and local governments even got additional funds .
eichel blamed the lower-than-expected tax revenues on reduced mineral-oil and tobacco taxes , whereby local governments booked " superb increases in commercial taxes , " the finance ministry told news agencies .
despite the decline , the ministry said the government " is still holding on to its 2005 goal of having a budget deficit that will again return to below " the 3 percent euro-zone criteria .
controversial plan a big part of the government 's plan to plug the hole in its finances will be achieved by selling off pension liabilities at deutsche post and deutsche telekom , two semi-private companies .
many post and telekom workers are effectively civil servants , and their retirements must therefore be paid by the state .
in compensation , the two companies are supposed to pay into eichel 's coffers € 18 billion .
the state will then convert these expected revenues into securities and sell them to investors , generating a further € 5.5 billion .
the part of the plan that has generated the most controversy was the move by eichel and german chancellor gerhard schröder to shift the day of german unity holiday from oct .
3 to the first sunday in october .
the government calculated that the extra day of work each year is worth annual gdp growth of 0.1 percent , that is , increased tax revenue .
critics speak out criticism of the plan came from opposition politicians as well as affected organizations .
the german civil servants association , deutscher beamtenbund , objected vociferously to the plan .
the group 's head , peter heesen , said such a move would endanger the implementation of the reform package previously agreed to with interior minister otto schily .
heesen also noted that civil servants already accepted benefits cuts as well as longer work hours in 2004 .
also strongly opposed to the plan to meet the eu criteria was the bdb association of german banks .
" the consolidation of federal finances is an urgent task facing germany , " bdb head manfred weber told news agencies in berlin .
" but the proposal that the government submitted is just a quick fix . "
while group said moving a holiday could indeed help long term growth , it criticized the plan for pushing current debt off to future budgets .
this is not a good solution for the current structural problems , weber said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu lodges " tank tourism " complaint germany 's political opposition is calling for fast and effective measures to combat so-called " tank tourism , " which sees germans flooding across borders to fill up their cars with cheaper gasoline .

revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years . german finance minister hans eichel presented his plan to make up for an unexpected € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12.9 billion -rrb- budget shortfall and bring the german economy in line with eu stability criteria thursday .
to this end , the minister said , he plans a pay freeze for civil servants , an additional workday for all germans , and securitization of deutsche post and deutsche telekom pensions , along with several other measures .
the package met with criticism from many quarters , and the plan to get rid of a key german holiday unleashed a political firestorm .
mineral oil , tobacco to blame tax revenues for 2004-2005 fell some € 4.8 billion short of previous forecasts .
in addition , the budget needed to be adjusted for an additional € 3 billion in spending on the job market .
the federal government will be hit especially hard by the measures ; the individual states got off relatively lightly , and local governments even got additional funds .
eichel blamed the lower-than-expected tax revenues on reduced mineral-oil and tobacco taxes , whereby local governments booked " superb increases in commercial taxes , " the finance ministry told news agencies .
despite the decline , the ministry said the government " is still holding on to its 2005 goal of having a budget deficit that will again return to below " the 3 percent euro-zone criteria .
controversial plan a big part of the government 's plan to plug the hole in its finances will be achieved by selling off pension liabilities at deutsche post and deutsche telekom , two semi-private companies .
many post and telekom workers are effectively civil servants , and their retirements must therefore be paid by the state .
in compensation , the two companies are supposed to pay into eichel 's coffers € 18 billion .
the state will then convert these expected revenues into securities and sell them to investors , generating a further € 5.5 billion .
the part of the plan that has generated the most controversy was the move by eichel and german chancellor gerhard schröder to shift the day of german unity holiday from oct .
3 to the first sunday in october .
the government calculated that the extra day of work each year is worth annual gdp growth of 0.1 percent , that is , increased tax revenue .
critics speak out criticism of the plan came from opposition politicians as well as affected organizations .
the german civil servants association , deutscher beamtenbund , objected vociferously to the plan .
the group 's head , peter heesen , said such a move would endanger the implementation of the reform package previously agreed to with interior minister otto schily .
heesen also noted that civil servants already accepted benefits cuts as well as longer work hours in 2004 .
also strongly opposed to the plan to meet the eu criteria was the bdb association of german banks .
" the consolidation of federal finances is an urgent task facing germany , " bdb head manfred weber told news agencies in berlin .
" but the proposal that the government submitted is just a quick fix . "
while group said moving a holiday could indeed help long term growth , it criticized the plan for pushing current debt off to future budgets .

iyad allawi had asked the the eu to " open a new chapter " and overcome divisions caused by the iraq war . despite having irked several eu leaders by describing states that opposed the us-led war in iraq as " spectators , " iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi successfully appealed for greater unity on iraq .
in a day of talks aimed at drumming up financial and other support from nato and the european union , allawi stressed that time is of the essence . " there is a real battle in iraq today , " he said .
" delays measured even in hours and days can cost lives . " the new eu aid package consists of an extra € 16.5 million -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- cash for elections due in january , support for developing iraq 's justice system , and help for a united nations protection force to oversee the elections . both nato and the eu were plunged into crisis by last year 's iraq conflict , in both cases pitting an anti-war grouping spearheaded by france and germany against pro-war countries . and despite agreements on the need to help rebuild the conflict-scarred country , tensions have lingered , with the anti-war camp refusing to send any military forces to iraq . " slip of the tongue " the tensions resurfaced in brussels after allawi urged " spectator " states to engage in iraq , notably angering france , whose president , jacques chirac , left early and missed an eu lunch with allawi - even if aides said it was not a snub . german chancellor gerhard schröder called allawi 's comment " a slip of the tongue " and said he would remind him that germany is training iraqi police and military in the united arab emirates and had offered to write off a substantial amount of iraqi debt . allawi also complained about plans by european countries such as hungary and the netherlands to withdraw their troops from the us-led coalition in iraq .
he said " we all need to close ranks and defeat terrorism " and urged eu countries to keep troops in iraq . eu congratulates bush meanwhile , british prime minister tony blair urged european leaders to accept us president george w. bush 's re-election , commenting that some eu leaders were in a " state of denial . " in a draft joint statement , eu leaders congratulated president bush , and said they look forward to working closely with him and his administration to " combine efforts , including in multilateral institutions , to promote the rule of law and create a just , democratic and secure world . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder and president bush have put their differences aside chancellor schröder told a news conference in brussels that he personally telephoned bush on friday to congratulate him . the two leaders went for months without speaking after schröder based his re-election campaign on opposition to the war in iraq .

according to kremlin officials , russia 's ratification of the treaty will become effective three months after putin has notified the un of the move .
backed by 126 countries , the climate pact is aimed at curbing global warming and can now come into force early next year , 90 days after the russian ratification documents are filed with the un .
us not on board the treaty was adopted at a un conference on climate change in 1997 , but the us , which accounts for 36 percent of emissions and is the world 's number-one emitter of greenhouse gases , pulled out in 2001 , making the treaty dependent on russian ratification .
the pact commits the developed nations to cut overall emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2008-12 , by curbing use of coal , oil and natural gas and introducing cleaner energies like solar and wind power .
to come into force , the it needed to be ratified by countries accounting for at least 55 percent of developed nations ' greenhouse gas emissions .
russia accounts for 17 percent of world emissions .
as he begins his second presidential term , george w. bush has signalled no intention of changing washington 's bullish stance on kyoto .

revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years . german finance minister hans eichel presented his plan to make up for an unexpected € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12.9 billion -rrb- budget shortfall and bring the german economy in line with eu stability criteria thursday .
to this end , the minister said , he plans a pay freeze for civil servants , an additional workday for all germans , and securitization of deutsche post and deutsche telekom pensions , along with several other measures .
the package met with criticism from many quarters , and the plan to get rid of a key german holiday unleashed a political firestorm .
mineral oil , tobacco to blame tax revenues for 2004-2005 fell some € 4.8 billion short of previous forecasts .
in addition , the budget needed to be adjusted for an additional € 3 billion in spending on the job market .
the federal government will be hit especially hard by the measures ; the individual states got off relatively lightly , and local governments even got additional funds .
eichel blamed the lower-than-expected tax revenues on reduced mineral-oil and tobacco taxes , whereby local governments booked " superb increases in commercial taxes , " the finance ministry told news agencies .
despite the decline , the ministry said the government " is still holding on to its 2005 goal of having a budget deficit that will again return to below " the 3 percent euro-zone criteria .
controversial plan a big part of the government 's plan to plug the hole in its finances will be achieved by selling off pension liabilities at deutsche post and deutsche telekom , two semi-private companies .
many post and telekom workers are effectively civil servants , and their retirements must therefore be paid by the state .
in compensation , the two companies are supposed to pay into eichel 's coffers € 18 billion .
the state will then convert these expected revenues into securities and sell them to investors , generating a further € 5.5 billion .
the part of the plan that has generated the most controversy was the move by eichel and german chancellor gerhard schröder to shift the day of german unity holiday from oct .
3 to the first sunday in october .
the government calculated that the extra day of work each year is worth annual gdp growth of 0.1 percent , that is , increased tax revenue .
critics speak out criticism of the plan came from opposition politicians as well as affected organizations .
the german civil servants association , deutscher beamtenbund , objected vociferously to the plan .
the group 's head , peter heesen , said such a move would endanger the implementation of the reform package previously agreed to with interior minister otto schily .
heesen also noted that civil servants already accepted benefits cuts as well as longer work hours in 2004 .
also strongly opposed to the plan to meet the eu criteria was the bdb association of german banks .
" the consolidation of federal finances is an urgent task facing germany , " bdb head manfred weber told news agencies in berlin .
" but the proposal that the government submitted is just a quick fix . "
while group said moving a holiday could indeed help long term growth , it criticized the plan for pushing current debt off to future budgets .
this is not a good solution for the current structural problems , weber said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu lodges " tank tourism " complaint germany 's political opposition is calling for fast and effective measures to combat so-called " tank tourism , " which sees germans flooding across borders to fill up their cars with cheaper gasoline .

" there 's a window now to introduce real movement in the process , " sources said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler the social democrat 's foreign policy expert , gernot erler -lrb- photo -rrb- , has also called on israel to allow a fresh start to peace talks .
in an interview with die zeit , erler said there were two constructive things germany could do at this critical juncture . patience and empathy the first , he said , was to demonstrate patience and empathy with palestinians , who are preparing for the difficult transition phase that is almost certain to follow arafat 's death . " we need to recognize arafat 's enormous symbolic importance , " erler said .
" he has embodied as no one else has , the entire suffering , and also the entire hope of the palestinian people . " the second thing germany can do , said erler , is to work with both the israeli and us government to restart the peace process .
he added that in german foreign minister joschka fischer , germany has someone with the potential to act as a liaison during the coming transition . " the foreign minister has so far been able to earn the trust of both the israeli and palestinian leadership , " said erler .
" now , he just needs to wait for the hour when he will be needed . " mixed view of arafat the german government has long had a mixed view of arafat .
unlike the bush administration , germany never totally boycotted dealings with the controversial palestinian leader , in recognition of his enormous influence .
but in recent years , he 's been regarded in berlin as part of the problem rather than part of the solution . " arafat might be part of the problem , but the bigger problem is the israeli government , " said the head of the german institute for middle east studies , udo steinberg . steinberg said he fears there could be an outbreak of violence in the wake of arafat 's death .
the most important question right now , he added , is who will decide on what action security forces are permitted to take . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : will palestine survive arafat ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.11.2004 european press review : will palestine survive arafat ? palestinian president yasser arafat 's critical health condition was the focus of numerous european editorials on friday . britain ’ s the daily telegraph suggested that yasser arafat ’ s critical condition could open the door to the revival of peace talks between the israelis and palestinians .
yet , progress may not be as swift as british prime minister tony blair and his foreign secretary , jack straw , would wish .
they both reacted to george w. bush ’ s electoral triumph by declaring that the most pressing political challenge in the world today is to get the two sides back round the negotiating table .
the incapacitation of the palestinian leader will add credence to that view , the paper opined .
the guardian , from london , said arafat is " the father of the nation but not yet the father of the palestinian state . "
it wrote that 40 years on from the age of british de-colonization , he is the last man who can claim that status .
the paper recalled that arafat had to win recognition of the fact that there was such a thing as a palestinian nation at all .
" to move from defensive consolidation and start to build a nation was nigh impossible .
that arafat managed to do it and retain the affection of his people , not just as a symbol of independence but as a respected and approachable human being , is a tribute of his greatness . " the paris daily liberation wrote that yasser arafat ’ s death will usher in a dangerous phase for the palestinians .
his death might mean the birth of a new arab myth , but the immediate and burning question is whether palestine will survive arafat .
will his orphans manage to unite in a different way than through his symbol ? liberation ’ s compatriot le figaro , while praising arafat as one of the great figures of the 20th century , wonders whether he really wanted peace .
the former terrorist , who became the elected president of the palestinian authority , was during his entire life an expert at playing a double game .
he was so unpredictable that it was hard to know whether he was always acting in the interest of his people or in his own interest , the paper said . us president george w. bush 's election victory still gives commentators plenty of food for thought .
germany ’ s berliner zeitung wrote that there is little room for optimism in the analysis of washington ’ s future policies , but that for the political practice it is indispensable .
for without transatlantic cooperation there will never be a peace process in the middle east that deserves that name , and it will be even harder to slow down the spread of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
in addition , the berlin daily said , if america and europe feud , it reduces the western democracies effect on the rest of the world and weakens the fight against terrorism . incoming european commission president jose barroso tried to end the political crisis in the european union on thursday by unveiling his new team of commissioners after the european parliament had last month expressed concerns about a number of candidates , including italy ’ s rocco buttiglione .
commenting on his replacement with italian foreign minister franco frattini , the rome-based newspaper il messaggero write : " it took almost a month - dominated by negotiations , international squabbles and even crusades from other eras .
now it seems we have made it .
everywhere you look approval and widespread praise .
one begins to wonder why we couldn ’ t have got there much sooner . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but conflicts of interests and privacy issues , especially in germany , are undermining investigations . just days after european investigators called for " sharper tools " and better intelligence-sharing in the war on terror , germany 's attempts to adhere to these calls has come up against a brick wall of the government 's making . interior minister otto schily , who addressed a security conference in wiesbaden on tuesday , told those attending that he was confident of forcing through constitutional changes to give the federal crime office - the bundeskriminalamt or bka - more " preventive powers , " including those which would allow german security forces to tap suspects ' telephones . but by thursday , schily was left frustrated at the unwillingness of the german government to reform the security services .
powers which would give the bka the ability to mount the increasingly sensitive and intrusive investigations schily recommends in the fight against terrorism would have to be agreed upon by the government , a course of action it is not willing to take at the moment . schily 's plan to create a central terror suspect database is also causing controversy .

" we should n't let -lrb- militants -rrb- exploit our freedom and data protection rules , " said rüdiger von fritsch , deputy head of the foreign intelligence agency . the privacy issue aside , the creation of a centralized intelligence agency has increased tensions between the government and the16 german states , all of which have their own police and security forces .

but conflicts of interests and privacy issues , especially in germany , are undermining investigations . just days after european investigators called for " sharper tools " and better intelligence-sharing in the war on terror , germany 's attempts to adhere to these calls has come up against a brick wall of the government 's making . interior minister otto schily , who addressed a security conference in wiesbaden on tuesday , told those attending that he was confident of forcing through constitutional changes to give the federal crime office - the bundeskriminalamt or bka - more " preventive powers , " including those which would allow german security forces to tap suspects ' telephones . but by thursday , schily was left frustrated at the unwillingness of the german government to reform the security services .
powers which would give the bka the ability to mount the increasingly sensitive and intrusive investigations schily recommends in the fight against terrorism would have to be agreed upon by the government , a course of action it is not willing to take at the moment . schily 's plan to create a central terror suspect database is also causing controversy .
the federal police and intelligence services have already had their headquarters moved to berlin as part of a drive to improve coordination , an initial part of the plan to centralize information on suspected muslim extremists . false accusation fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rights of germany 's three million muslims could be compromised .
but the creation of a central database for muslim fundamentalists is controversial , both with germany 's more than three million muslims and with privacy watchdogs .
federal data protection commissioner peter schaar told the security conference this week that muslims considered to be " extremists " must not be listed in such a database unless there was concrete evidence of links to terrorism . however , tensions were increased when top intelligence officials countered that view , claiming suspects could always be removed later if terrorist involvement was ruled out .
" we should n't let -lrb- militants -rrb- exploit our freedom and data protection rules , " said rüdiger von fritsch , deputy head of the foreign intelligence agency . the privacy issue aside , the creation of a centralized intelligence agency has increased tensions between the government and the16 german states , all of which have their own police and security forces .
at the moment , each of the german states is responsible for its own investigations into terrorist activities , something schily wants to reform in a bid to compile a nationwide network of efficient data collection and exchange under a bka banner . conflict with germany hindering process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking at the security conference , bka chief jörg ziercke -lrb- photo , with schily -rrb- said that the current situation often forced the agency to take a back seat to police forces in the federal states . " if we receive highly sensitive threat information , we do n't want to get into long discussions with the states on whether they have the resources to launch surveillance if i have the resources to do that myself , " he told journalists . the german bickering highlighted the problems facing the eu countries in the fight against terrorism in regard to speed of investigation and action . french investigating magistrate jean-louis bruguiere told the conference that the bureaucracy was undoing a lot of the good work being undertaken by european investigations .
" we must act in real time , " he told the conference .
" very often it takes much too long for appropriate action to be taken .
we must position ourselves so a house search can be carried out within the hour . " european initiatives suffering europe 's struggle to overhaul anti-terrorism cooperation since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 in the united states has been hampered partly by the reluctance of security services to circulate intelligence information in a european union of 25 countries for fear of compromising sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creation of a smoothly aligned europe-wide network of investigative organizations gained importance after the madrid train bombings on march 11 this year . " we can not deal with this threat on a local or national level ...
it 's about pooling and sharing intelligence on a cross-agency basis , " bruguiere said . agencies like the eu police body europol had " not reached their full potential yet , " he added .

loud opposition the plan by german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel to rid the country of one of its work holidays was met with loud opposition - from within the government as well as political opponents .
the trouble started when the two social democrats proposed a plan to move the october 3 german unity day holiday - one of up to 16 national holidays - to a sunday , thereby gaining an extra day of work .
eichel introduced the plan as part of his new austerity measures , arguing it would potentially provide a 0.1 percent increase in gdp , and attendant tax revenue increases .
economics minister wolfgang clement said the move would bring in additional income of € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .

" taking october 3 as a symbol for the reunification of germany in peace and freedom is important for the future of our country , and should be retained , " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper quoted köhler as writing .
there could be better ways " to find an additional work day in order to take part in the consolidation of the country 's finances . "

but schröder parried back with a letter to köhler , according to mass-circulation daily bild .
he wrote that unity day is indeed very important , but added , " reunification was an extreme burden on our economy .
unity must be completed , and the number of holidays must be reduced . "
he finished by saying he was open to meeting with köhler to discuss better options .

" scrapping the oct .
3 holiday is no longer being pursued , " social democrat spokesman lars kühn said friday .
the move was heavily criticized by the media , and the country 's head of state horst köhler even wrote to chancellor gerhard schröder asking him to reconsider the move .
speaking in brussels friday , the chancellor regretfully withdrew the plan , citing lack of political support .
loud opposition the plan by german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel to rid the country of one of its work holidays was met with loud opposition - from within the government as well as political opponents .
the trouble started when the two social democrats proposed a plan to move the october 3 german unity day holiday - one of up to 16 national holidays - to a sunday , thereby gaining an extra day of work .
eichel introduced the plan as part of his new austerity measures , arguing it would potentially provide a 0.1 percent increase in gdp , and attendant tax revenue increases .
economics minister wolfgang clement said the move would bring in additional income of € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
a question of soul ?
but opponents to the idea retorted that to strike the national holiday was " unpatriotic , " akin to attacking the soul of the nation , referring to the overriding historical importance of the division and reunification of east and west .
" i wonder about the soul of a nation whose government plans such a thing , " lothar de maizere , east germany 's last prime minister , told german tv broadcaster ard .
the situation heated up further german president horst köhler wrote a letter to schröder in which he opposed the plan .
" taking october 3 as a symbol for the reunification of germany in peace and freedom is important for the future of our country , and should be retained , " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper quoted köhler as writing .
there could be better ways " to find an additional work day in order to take part in the consolidation of the country 's finances . "
done deal ?
but schröder parried back with a letter to köhler , according to mass-circulation daily bild .
he wrote that unity day is indeed very important , but added , " reunification was an extreme burden on our economy .
unity must be completed , and the number of holidays must be reduced . "
he finished by saying he was open to meeting with köhler to discuss better options .
despite the raging opposition , clement said that the plan " is not -lrb- just -rrb- an idea ; it will be carried out . "

revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years . german finance minister hans eichel presented his plan to make up for an unexpected € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12.9 billion -rrb- budget shortfall and bring the german economy in line with eu stability criteria thursday .
to this end , the minister said , he plans a pay freeze for civil servants , an additional workday for all germans , and securitization of deutsche post and deutsche telekom pensions , along with several other measures .
the package met with criticism from many quarters , and the plan to get rid of a key german holiday unleashed a political firestorm .
mineral oil , tobacco to blame tax revenues for 2004-2005 fell some € 4.8 billion short of previous forecasts .
in addition , the budget needed to be adjusted for an additional € 3 billion in spending on the job market .
the federal government will be hit especially hard by the measures ; the individual states got off relatively lightly , and local governments even got additional funds .
eichel blamed the lower-than-expected tax revenues on reduced mineral-oil and tobacco taxes , whereby local governments booked " superb increases in commercial taxes , " the finance ministry told news agencies .
despite the decline , the ministry said the government " is still holding on to its 2005 goal of having a budget deficit that will again return to below " the 3 percent euro-zone criteria .
controversial plan a big part of the government 's plan to plug the hole in its finances will be achieved by selling off pension liabilities at deutsche post and deutsche telekom , two semi-private companies .
many post and telekom workers are effectively civil servants , and their retirements must therefore be paid by the state .
in compensation , the two companies are supposed to pay into eichel 's coffers € 18 billion .
the state will then convert these expected revenues into securities and sell them to investors , generating a further € 5.5 billion .
the part of the plan that has generated the most controversy was the move by eichel and german chancellor gerhard schröder to shift the day of german unity holiday from oct .
3 to the first sunday in october .
the government calculated that the extra day of work each year is worth annual gdp growth of 0.1 percent , that is , increased tax revenue .
critics speak out criticism of the plan came from opposition politicians as well as affected organizations .
the german civil servants association , deutscher beamtenbund , objected vociferously to the plan .
the group 's head , peter heesen , said such a move would endanger the implementation of the reform package previously agreed to with interior minister otto schily .

also strongly opposed to the plan to meet the eu criteria was the bdb association of german banks .
" the consolidation of federal finances is an urgent task facing germany , " bdb head manfred weber told news agencies in berlin .

" we are now back on track .
we need to get back to work quickly , " barroso told a news conference after presenting his slightly modified line-up to eu leaders . the most high-profile change is that of the future justice and security chief .
barroso said italian foreign minister franco frattini would replace rocco buttiglione , whose conservative views on homosexuality and the role of women stirred anger among many eu parliamentarians and threatened to derail the entire commission . barroso also announced that laszlo kovacs of hungary would switch from energy to taxation and a new latvian nominee , andris piebalgs , would take the energy portfolio .
another controversial nominee , neelie kroes from the netherlands , would be retained as competition commissioner . us-eu future meeting at european union headquarters in brussels a day after president george bush was re-elected to the white house , leaders from the 25 member states were just as focused on the future path of us-eu relations as on the set economic agenda .
on the eve of the two-day summit which will include talks with iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi , the eu pledged to overhaul transatlantic links strained to the breaking point during the president 's first term .
both eu and us officials said they hoped bush 's second term would start out on a much better note and bring the two regions closer together again .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , who holds the eu 's rotating presidency , sent a personal letter of congratulation to bush .
" the united states and the european union are linked by strong cultural , economic and political ties , and by our shared values ...
the presidency is confident that this relationship will be further deepened and strengthened under the new administration , " it said .
iraq on the agenda eu nations have been deeply split over us policy in iraq , with britain spearheading support for the war while germany and france staunchly opposed military intervention .
only recently has the bloc begun overcoming those differences to work for the shattered country 's reconstruction .
on tuesday eu foreign ministers agreed to a package of financial and logistical support initiatives for iraq ahead of the country 's elections planned for january .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot said the deal showed that the eu was " united again " after its iraq rift .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi a meeting with iraqi interim leader allawi on friday will help further shore up common eu support for bolstering iraq 's struggling democracy .
economic focus in addition to foreign policy issues , the 25 eu leaders are expected to focus on a report by former dutch prime minister wim kok on the so-called lisbon agenda , the bloc 's grand plan launched in 2000 to make europe the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .
the report paints a gloomy future , warning that " too many targets promise to be seriously missed . "
nonetheless eu leaders are likely to express renewed commitment to the economic goals and examine ways to press ahead with market-oriented reforms in the face of new enlargement prospects and current difficulties in bringing the 10 newest accession states up to an economic par with the rest of the bloc .
many leaders will also be looking towards the summit as a good opportunity to resolve the crisis that was sparked last week when incoming european commission chief jose manuel barroso was forced to withdraw his proposed executive team due to protests by eu lawmakers . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in emotional speech , kerry concedes defeat in a gracious speech before supporters a clearly emotional senator john kerry conceded defeat and urged the country to find " common cause .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.11.2004 european press review : will palestine survive arafat ? palestinian president yasser arafat 's critical health condition was the focus of numerous european editorials on friday . britain ’ s the daily telegraph suggested that yasser arafat ’ s critical condition could open the door to the revival of peace talks between the israelis and palestinians .
yet , progress may not be as swift as british prime minister tony blair and his foreign secretary , jack straw , would wish .
they both reacted to george w. bush ’ s electoral triumph by declaring that the most pressing political challenge in the world today is to get the two sides back round the negotiating table .
the incapacitation of the palestinian leader will add credence to that view , the paper opined .
the guardian , from london , said arafat is " the father of the nation but not yet the father of the palestinian state . "
it wrote that 40 years on from the age of british de-colonization , he is the last man who can claim that status .
the paper recalled that arafat had to win recognition of the fact that there was such a thing as a palestinian nation at all .
" to move from defensive consolidation and start to build a nation was nigh impossible .
that arafat managed to do it and retain the affection of his people , not just as a symbol of independence but as a respected and approachable human being , is a tribute of his greatness . " the paris daily liberation wrote that yasser arafat ’ s death will usher in a dangerous phase for the palestinians .
his death might mean the birth of a new arab myth , but the immediate and burning question is whether palestine will survive arafat .
will his orphans manage to unite in a different way than through his symbol ? liberation ’ s compatriot le figaro , while praising arafat as one of the great figures of the 20th century , wonders whether he really wanted peace .
the former terrorist , who became the elected president of the palestinian authority , was during his entire life an expert at playing a double game .
he was so unpredictable that it was hard to know whether he was always acting in the interest of his people or in his own interest , the paper said . us president george w. bush 's election victory still gives commentators plenty of food for thought .
germany ’ s berliner zeitung wrote that there is little room for optimism in the analysis of washington ’ s future policies , but that for the political practice it is indispensable .
for without transatlantic cooperation there will never be a peace process in the middle east that deserves that name , and it will be even harder to slow down the spread of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
in addition , the berlin daily said , if america and europe feud , it reduces the western democracies effect on the rest of the world and weakens the fight against terrorism . incoming european commission president jose barroso tried to end the political crisis in the european union on thursday by unveiling his new team of commissioners after the european parliament had last month expressed concerns about a number of candidates , including italy ’ s rocco buttiglione .
commenting on his replacement with italian foreign minister franco frattini , the rome-based newspaper il messaggero write : " it took almost a month - dominated by negotiations , international squabbles and even crusades from other eras .
now it seems we have made it .
everywhere you look approval and widespread praise .
one begins to wonder why we couldn ’ t have got there much sooner . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

yet , progress may not be as swift as british prime minister tony blair and his foreign secretary , jack straw , would wish .
they both reacted to george w. bush ’ s electoral triumph by declaring that the most pressing political challenge in the world today is to get the two sides back round the negotiating table .
the incapacitation of the palestinian leader will add credence to that view , the paper opined .
the guardian , from london , said arafat is " the father of the nation but not yet the father of the palestinian state . "
it wrote that 40 years on from the age of british de-colonization , he is the last man who can claim that status .
the paper recalled that arafat had to win recognition of the fact that there was such a thing as a palestinian nation at all .
" to move from defensive consolidation and start to build a nation was nigh impossible .
that arafat managed to do it and retain the affection of his people , not just as a symbol of independence but as a respected and approachable human being , is a tribute of his greatness . " the paris daily liberation wrote that yasser arafat ’ s death will usher in a dangerous phase for the palestinians .
his death might mean the birth of a new arab myth , but the immediate and burning question is whether palestine will survive arafat .
will his orphans manage to unite in a different way than through his symbol ? liberation ’ s compatriot le figaro , while praising arafat as one of the great figures of the 20th century , wonders whether he really wanted peace .
the former terrorist , who became the elected president of the palestinian authority , was during his entire life an expert at playing a double game .
he was so unpredictable that it was hard to know whether he was always acting in the interest of his people or in his own interest , the paper said . us president george w. bush 's election victory still gives commentators plenty of food for thought .
germany ’ s berliner zeitung wrote that there is little room for optimism in the analysis of washington ’ s future policies , but that for the political practice it is indispensable .
for without transatlantic cooperation there will never be a peace process in the middle east that deserves that name , and it will be even harder to slow down the spread of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
in addition , the berlin daily said , if america and europe feud , it reduces the western democracies effect on the rest of the world and weakens the fight against terrorism . incoming european commission president jose barroso tried to end the political crisis in the european union on thursday by unveiling his new team of commissioners after the european parliament had last month expressed concerns about a number of candidates , including italy ’ s rocco buttiglione .
commenting on his replacement with italian foreign minister franco frattini , the rome-based newspaper il messaggero write : " it took almost a month - dominated by negotiations , international squabbles and even crusades from other eras .

but conflicts of interests and privacy issues , especially in germany , are undermining investigations . just days after european investigators called for " sharper tools " and better intelligence-sharing in the war on terror , germany 's attempts to adhere to these calls has come up against a brick wall of the government 's making . interior minister otto schily , who addressed a security conference in wiesbaden on tuesday , told those attending that he was confident of forcing through constitutional changes to give the federal crime office - the bundeskriminalamt or bka - more " preventive powers , " including those which would allow german security forces to tap suspects ' telephones . but by thursday , schily was left frustrated at the unwillingness of the german government to reform the security services .
powers which would give the bka the ability to mount the increasingly sensitive and intrusive investigations schily recommends in the fight against terrorism would have to be agreed upon by the government , a course of action it is not willing to take at the moment . schily 's plan to create a central terror suspect database is also causing controversy .
the federal police and intelligence services have already had their headquarters moved to berlin as part of a drive to improve coordination , an initial part of the plan to centralize information on suspected muslim extremists . false accusation fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rights of germany 's three million muslims could be compromised .
but the creation of a central database for muslim fundamentalists is controversial , both with germany 's more than three million muslims and with privacy watchdogs .
federal data protection commissioner peter schaar told the security conference this week that muslims considered to be " extremists " must not be listed in such a database unless there was concrete evidence of links to terrorism . however , tensions were increased when top intelligence officials countered that view , claiming suspects could always be removed later if terrorist involvement was ruled out .
" we should n't let -lrb- militants -rrb- exploit our freedom and data protection rules , " said rüdiger von fritsch , deputy head of the foreign intelligence agency . the privacy issue aside , the creation of a centralized intelligence agency has increased tensions between the government and the16 german states , all of which have their own police and security forces .
at the moment , each of the german states is responsible for its own investigations into terrorist activities , something schily wants to reform in a bid to compile a nationwide network of efficient data collection and exchange under a bka banner . conflict with germany hindering process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking at the security conference , bka chief jörg ziercke -lrb- photo , with schily -rrb- said that the current situation often forced the agency to take a back seat to police forces in the federal states . " if we receive highly sensitive threat information , we do n't want to get into long discussions with the states on whether they have the resources to launch surveillance if i have the resources to do that myself , " he told journalists . the german bickering highlighted the problems facing the eu countries in the fight against terrorism in regard to speed of investigation and action . french investigating magistrate jean-louis bruguiere told the conference that the bureaucracy was undoing a lot of the good work being undertaken by european investigations .
" we must act in real time , " he told the conference .
" very often it takes much too long for appropriate action to be taken .
we must position ourselves so a house search can be carried out within the hour . " european initiatives suffering europe 's struggle to overhaul anti-terrorism cooperation since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 in the united states has been hampered partly by the reluctance of security services to circulate intelligence information in a european union of 25 countries for fear of compromising sources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the creation of a smoothly aligned europe-wide network of investigative organizations gained importance after the madrid train bombings on march 11 this year . " we can not deal with this threat on a local or national level ...
it 's about pooling and sharing intelligence on a cross-agency basis , " bruguiere said . agencies like the eu police body europol had " not reached their full potential yet , " he added .

but conflicts of interests and privacy issues , especially in germany , are undermining investigations . just days after european investigators called for " sharper tools " and better intelligence-sharing in the war on terror , germany 's attempts to adhere to these calls has come up against a brick wall of the government 's making . interior minister otto schily , who addressed a security conference in wiesbaden on tuesday , told those attending that he was confident of forcing through constitutional changes to give the federal crime office - the bundeskriminalamt or bka - more " preventive powers , " including those which would allow german security forces to tap suspects ' telephones . but by thursday , schily was left frustrated at the unwillingness of the german government to reform the security services .
powers which would give the bka the ability to mount the increasingly sensitive and intrusive investigations schily recommends in the fight against terrorism would have to be agreed upon by the government , a course of action it is not willing to take at the moment . schily 's plan to create a central terror suspect database is also causing controversy .
the federal police and intelligence services have already had their headquarters moved to berlin as part of a drive to improve coordination , an initial part of the plan to centralize information on suspected muslim extremists . false accusation fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rights of germany 's three million muslims could be compromised .
but the creation of a central database for muslim fundamentalists is controversial , both with germany 's more than three million muslims and with privacy watchdogs .
federal data protection commissioner peter schaar told the security conference this week that muslims considered to be " extremists " must not be listed in such a database unless there was concrete evidence of links to terrorism . however , tensions were increased when top intelligence officials countered that view , claiming suspects could always be removed later if terrorist involvement was ruled out .
" we should n't let -lrb- militants -rrb- exploit our freedom and data protection rules , " said rüdiger von fritsch , deputy head of the foreign intelligence agency . the privacy issue aside , the creation of a centralized intelligence agency has increased tensions between the government and the16 german states , all of which have their own police and security forces .

" scrapping the oct .
3 holiday is no longer being pursued , " social democrat spokesman lars kühn said friday .
the move was heavily criticized by the media , and the country 's head of state horst köhler even wrote to chancellor gerhard schröder asking him to reconsider the move .
speaking in brussels friday , the chancellor regretfully withdrew the plan , citing lack of political support .
loud opposition the plan by german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel to rid the country of one of its work holidays was met with loud opposition - from within the government as well as political opponents .
the trouble started when the two social democrats proposed a plan to move the october 3 german unity day holiday - one of up to 16 national holidays - to a sunday , thereby gaining an extra day of work .
eichel introduced the plan as part of his new austerity measures , arguing it would potentially provide a 0.1 percent increase in gdp , and attendant tax revenue increases .
economics minister wolfgang clement said the move would bring in additional income of € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
a question of soul ?
but opponents to the idea retorted that to strike the national holiday was " unpatriotic , " akin to attacking the soul of the nation , referring to the overriding historical importance of the division and reunification of east and west .
" i wonder about the soul of a nation whose government plans such a thing , " lothar de maizere , east germany 's last prime minister , told german tv broadcaster ard .
the situation heated up further german president horst köhler wrote a letter to schröder in which he opposed the plan .
" taking october 3 as a symbol for the reunification of germany in peace and freedom is important for the future of our country , and should be retained , " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper quoted köhler as writing .
there could be better ways " to find an additional work day in order to take part in the consolidation of the country 's finances . "
done deal ?
but schröder parried back with a letter to köhler , according to mass-circulation daily bild .
he wrote that unity day is indeed very important , but added , " reunification was an extreme burden on our economy .
unity must be completed , and the number of holidays must be reduced . "
he finished by saying he was open to meeting with köhler to discuss better options .
despite the raging opposition , clement said that the plan " is not -lrb- just -rrb- an idea ; it will be carried out . "
and spd chief franz müntefering backed him up , telling the press that even if the opposition refuses to go along with the plan , " then we will go it alone . "
indeed , germany 's bundestag , the lower house of parliament , could make the change unilaterally .
the holiday was created by the german unity pact of 1990 , a federal law , and amending it would not require ratification by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament which represents the states .
opposition - from both sides but just because the government can pull it off , does n't mean people have to like it - not even members of the ruling party .
bundestag president wolfgang thierse , schleswig-holstein premier heide simonis , bremen mayor henning scherf , green party parliamentary group leader krista sager - all have openly criticized the plan .
and the opposition , of course , has been anything but quiet .
cdu secretary general laurenz meyer called the suggestion " unpatriotic . "
the idea shows that " this government does not have a positive attitude toward german unity and to the emotions that are tied to the event , " meyer told the kieler nachrichten newspaper .
the leaders of key opposition parties cdu and csu , angela merkel and edmund stoiber , accused the government of " forgetting history . "
in turn , spd secretary general klaus uwe benneter retorted , " it was the policies made under the leadership of spd leader willy brandt that made reunification possible . "

the move was heavily criticized by the media , and the country 's head of state horst köhler even wrote to chancellor gerhard schröder asking him to reconsider the move .
speaking in brussels friday , the chancellor regretfully withdrew the plan , citing lack of political support .
loud opposition the plan by german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel to rid the country of one of its work holidays was met with loud opposition - from within the government as well as political opponents .
the trouble started when the two social democrats proposed a plan to move the october 3 german unity day holiday - one of up to 16 national holidays - to a sunday , thereby gaining an extra day of work .
eichel introduced the plan as part of his new austerity measures , arguing it would potentially provide a 0.1 percent increase in gdp , and attendant tax revenue increases .
economics minister wolfgang clement said the move would bring in additional income of € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
a question of soul ?

" i wonder about the soul of a nation whose government plans such a thing , " lothar de maizere , east germany 's last prime minister , told german tv broadcaster ard .
the situation heated up further german president horst köhler wrote a letter to schröder in which he opposed the plan .
" taking october 3 as a symbol for the reunification of germany in peace and freedom is important for the future of our country , and should be retained , " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper quoted köhler as writing .
there could be better ways " to find an additional work day in order to take part in the consolidation of the country 's finances . "

but schröder parried back with a letter to köhler , according to mass-circulation daily bild .
he wrote that unity day is indeed very important , but added , " reunification was an extreme burden on our economy .
unity must be completed , and the number of holidays must be reduced . "
he finished by saying he was open to meeting with köhler to discuss better options .
despite the raging opposition , clement said that the plan " is not -lrb- just -rrb- an idea ; it will be carried out . "

revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years . german finance minister hans eichel presented his plan to make up for an unexpected € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12.9 billion -rrb- budget shortfall and bring the german economy in line with eu stability criteria thursday .
to this end , the minister said , he plans a pay freeze for civil servants , an additional workday for all germans , and securitization of deutsche post and deutsche telekom pensions , along with several other measures .
the package met with criticism from many quarters , and the plan to get rid of a key german holiday unleashed a political firestorm .
mineral oil , tobacco to blame tax revenues for 2004-2005 fell some € 4.8 billion short of previous forecasts .
in addition , the budget needed to be adjusted for an additional € 3 billion in spending on the job market .
the federal government will be hit especially hard by the measures ; the individual states got off relatively lightly , and local governments even got additional funds .
eichel blamed the lower-than-expected tax revenues on reduced mineral-oil and tobacco taxes , whereby local governments booked " superb increases in commercial taxes , " the finance ministry told news agencies .
despite the decline , the ministry said the government " is still holding on to its 2005 goal of having a budget deficit that will again return to below " the 3 percent euro-zone criteria .
controversial plan a big part of the government 's plan to plug the hole in its finances will be achieved by selling off pension liabilities at deutsche post and deutsche telekom , two semi-private companies .
many post and telekom workers are effectively civil servants , and their retirements must therefore be paid by the state .
in compensation , the two companies are supposed to pay into eichel 's coffers € 18 billion .
the state will then convert these expected revenues into securities and sell them to investors , generating a further € 5.5 billion .
the part of the plan that has generated the most controversy was the move by eichel and german chancellor gerhard schröder to shift the day of german unity holiday from oct .
3 to the first sunday in october .
the government calculated that the extra day of work each year is worth annual gdp growth of 0.1 percent , that is , increased tax revenue .
critics speak out criticism of the plan came from opposition politicians as well as affected organizations .
the german civil servants association , deutscher beamtenbund , objected vociferously to the plan .
the group 's head , peter heesen , said such a move would endanger the implementation of the reform package previously agreed to with interior minister otto schily .
heesen also noted that civil servants already accepted benefits cuts as well as longer work hours in 2004 .
also strongly opposed to the plan to meet the eu criteria was the bdb association of german banks .
" the consolidation of federal finances is an urgent task facing germany , " bdb head manfred weber told news agencies in berlin .
" but the proposal that the government submitted is just a quick fix . "
while group said moving a holiday could indeed help long term growth , it criticized the plan for pushing current debt off to future budgets .
this is not a good solution for the current structural problems , weber said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu lodges " tank tourism " complaint germany 's political opposition is calling for fast and effective measures to combat so-called " tank tourism , " which sees germans flooding across borders to fill up their cars with cheaper gasoline .

revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years . german finance minister hans eichel presented his plan to make up for an unexpected € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12.9 billion -rrb- budget shortfall and bring the german economy in line with eu stability criteria thursday .
to this end , the minister said , he plans a pay freeze for civil servants , an additional workday for all germans , and securitization of deutsche post and deutsche telekom pensions , along with several other measures .
the package met with criticism from many quarters , and the plan to get rid of a key german holiday unleashed a political firestorm .
mineral oil , tobacco to blame tax revenues for 2004-2005 fell some € 4.8 billion short of previous forecasts .
in addition , the budget needed to be adjusted for an additional € 3 billion in spending on the job market .
the federal government will be hit especially hard by the measures ; the individual states got off relatively lightly , and local governments even got additional funds .
eichel blamed the lower-than-expected tax revenues on reduced mineral-oil and tobacco taxes , whereby local governments booked " superb increases in commercial taxes , " the finance ministry told news agencies .
despite the decline , the ministry said the government " is still holding on to its 2005 goal of having a budget deficit that will again return to below " the 3 percent euro-zone criteria .
controversial plan a big part of the government 's plan to plug the hole in its finances will be achieved by selling off pension liabilities at deutsche post and deutsche telekom , two semi-private companies .
many post and telekom workers are effectively civil servants , and their retirements must therefore be paid by the state .
in compensation , the two companies are supposed to pay into eichel 's coffers € 18 billion .
the state will then convert these expected revenues into securities and sell them to investors , generating a further € 5.5 billion .
the part of the plan that has generated the most controversy was the move by eichel and german chancellor gerhard schröder to shift the day of german unity holiday from oct .
3 to the first sunday in october .
the government calculated that the extra day of work each year is worth annual gdp growth of 0.1 percent , that is , increased tax revenue .
critics speak out criticism of the plan came from opposition politicians as well as affected organizations .
the german civil servants association , deutscher beamtenbund , objected vociferously to the plan .
the group 's head , peter heesen , said such a move would endanger the implementation of the reform package previously agreed to with interior minister otto schily .
heesen also noted that civil servants already accepted benefits cuts as well as longer work hours in 2004 .
also strongly opposed to the plan to meet the eu criteria was the bdb association of german banks .
" the consolidation of federal finances is an urgent task facing germany , " bdb head manfred weber told news agencies in berlin .
" but the proposal that the government submitted is just a quick fix . "
while group said moving a holiday could indeed help long term growth , it criticized the plan for pushing current debt off to future budgets .

" we are now back on track .
we need to get back to work quickly , " barroso told a news conference after presenting his slightly modified line-up to eu leaders . the most high-profile change is that of the future justice and security chief .
barroso said italian foreign minister franco frattini would replace rocco buttiglione , whose conservative views on homosexuality and the role of women stirred anger among many eu parliamentarians and threatened to derail the entire commission . barroso also announced that laszlo kovacs of hungary would switch from energy to taxation and a new latvian nominee , andris piebalgs , would take the energy portfolio .
another controversial nominee , neelie kroes from the netherlands , would be retained as competition commissioner . us-eu future meeting at european union headquarters in brussels a day after president george bush was re-elected to the white house , leaders from the 25 member states were just as focused on the future path of us-eu relations as on the set economic agenda .
on the eve of the two-day summit which will include talks with iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi , the eu pledged to overhaul transatlantic links strained to the breaking point during the president 's first term .
both eu and us officials said they hoped bush 's second term would start out on a much better note and bring the two regions closer together again .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , who holds the eu 's rotating presidency , sent a personal letter of congratulation to bush .
" the united states and the european union are linked by strong cultural , economic and political ties , and by our shared values ...
the presidency is confident that this relationship will be further deepened and strengthened under the new administration , " it said .
iraq on the agenda eu nations have been deeply split over us policy in iraq , with britain spearheading support for the war while germany and france staunchly opposed military intervention .
only recently has the bloc begun overcoming those differences to work for the shattered country 's reconstruction .
on tuesday eu foreign ministers agreed to a package of financial and logistical support initiatives for iraq ahead of the country 's elections planned for january .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot said the deal showed that the eu was " united again " after its iraq rift .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi a meeting with iraqi interim leader allawi on friday will help further shore up common eu support for bolstering iraq 's struggling democracy .
economic focus in addition to foreign policy issues , the 25 eu leaders are expected to focus on a report by former dutch prime minister wim kok on the so-called lisbon agenda , the bloc 's grand plan launched in 2000 to make europe the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .
the report paints a gloomy future , warning that " too many targets promise to be seriously missed . "
nonetheless eu leaders are likely to express renewed commitment to the economic goals and examine ways to press ahead with market-oriented reforms in the face of new enlargement prospects and current difficulties in bringing the 10 newest accession states up to an economic par with the rest of the bloc .

" we are now back on track .
we need to get back to work quickly , " barroso told a news conference after presenting his slightly modified line-up to eu leaders . the most high-profile change is that of the future justice and security chief .
barroso said italian foreign minister franco frattini would replace rocco buttiglione , whose conservative views on homosexuality and the role of women stirred anger among many eu parliamentarians and threatened to derail the entire commission . barroso also announced that laszlo kovacs of hungary would switch from energy to taxation and a new latvian nominee , andris piebalgs , would take the energy portfolio .
another controversial nominee , neelie kroes from the netherlands , would be retained as competition commissioner . us-eu future meeting at european union headquarters in brussels a day after president george bush was re-elected to the white house , leaders from the 25 member states were just as focused on the future path of us-eu relations as on the set economic agenda .
on the eve of the two-day summit which will include talks with iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi , the eu pledged to overhaul transatlantic links strained to the breaking point during the president 's first term .
both eu and us officials said they hoped bush 's second term would start out on a much better note and bring the two regions closer together again .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , who holds the eu 's rotating presidency , sent a personal letter of congratulation to bush .
" the united states and the european union are linked by strong cultural , economic and political ties , and by our shared values ...
the presidency is confident that this relationship will be further deepened and strengthened under the new administration , " it said .
iraq on the agenda eu nations have been deeply split over us policy in iraq , with britain spearheading support for the war while germany and france staunchly opposed military intervention .
only recently has the bloc begun overcoming those differences to work for the shattered country 's reconstruction .
on tuesday eu foreign ministers agreed to a package of financial and logistical support initiatives for iraq ahead of the country 's elections planned for january .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot said the deal showed that the eu was " united again " after its iraq rift .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi a meeting with iraqi interim leader allawi on friday will help further shore up common eu support for bolstering iraq 's struggling democracy .
economic focus in addition to foreign policy issues , the 25 eu leaders are expected to focus on a report by former dutch prime minister wim kok on the so-called lisbon agenda , the bloc 's grand plan launched in 2000 to make europe the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .
the report paints a gloomy future , warning that " too many targets promise to be seriously missed . "
nonetheless eu leaders are likely to express renewed commitment to the economic goals and examine ways to press ahead with market-oriented reforms in the face of new enlargement prospects and current difficulties in bringing the 10 newest accession states up to an economic par with the rest of the bloc .
many leaders will also be looking towards the summit as a good opportunity to resolve the crisis that was sparked last week when incoming european commission chief jose manuel barroso was forced to withdraw his proposed executive team due to protests by eu lawmakers . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in emotional speech , kerry concedes defeat in a gracious speech before supporters a clearly emotional senator john kerry conceded defeat and urged the country to find " common cause .

" we are now back on track .
we need to get back to work quickly , " barroso told a news conference after presenting his slightly modified line-up to eu leaders . the most high-profile change is that of the future justice and security chief .
barroso said italian foreign minister franco frattini would replace rocco buttiglione , whose conservative views on homosexuality and the role of women stirred anger among many eu parliamentarians and threatened to derail the entire commission . barroso also announced that laszlo kovacs of hungary would switch from energy to taxation and a new latvian nominee , andris piebalgs , would take the energy portfolio .
another controversial nominee , neelie kroes from the netherlands , would be retained as competition commissioner . us-eu future meeting at european union headquarters in brussels a day after president george bush was re-elected to the white house , leaders from the 25 member states were just as focused on the future path of us-eu relations as on the set economic agenda .
on the eve of the two-day summit which will include talks with iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi , the eu pledged to overhaul transatlantic links strained to the breaking point during the president 's first term .
both eu and us officials said they hoped bush 's second term would start out on a much better note and bring the two regions closer together again .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , who holds the eu 's rotating presidency , sent a personal letter of congratulation to bush .
" the united states and the european union are linked by strong cultural , economic and political ties , and by our shared values ...
the presidency is confident that this relationship will be further deepened and strengthened under the new administration , " it said .
iraq on the agenda eu nations have been deeply split over us policy in iraq , with britain spearheading support for the war while germany and france staunchly opposed military intervention .
only recently has the bloc begun overcoming those differences to work for the shattered country 's reconstruction .
on tuesday eu foreign ministers agreed to a package of financial and logistical support initiatives for iraq ahead of the country 's elections planned for january .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot said the deal showed that the eu was " united again " after its iraq rift .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi a meeting with iraqi interim leader allawi on friday will help further shore up common eu support for bolstering iraq 's struggling democracy .
economic focus in addition to foreign policy issues , the 25 eu leaders are expected to focus on a report by former dutch prime minister wim kok on the so-called lisbon agenda , the bloc 's grand plan launched in 2000 to make europe the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .
the report paints a gloomy future , warning that " too many targets promise to be seriously missed . "
nonetheless eu leaders are likely to express renewed commitment to the economic goals and examine ways to press ahead with market-oriented reforms in the face of new enlargement prospects and current difficulties in bringing the 10 newest accession states up to an economic par with the rest of the bloc .
many leaders will also be looking towards the summit as a good opportunity to resolve the crisis that was sparked last week when incoming european commission chief jose manuel barroso was forced to withdraw his proposed executive team due to protests by eu lawmakers . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in emotional speech , kerry concedes defeat in a gracious speech before supporters a clearly emotional senator john kerry conceded defeat and urged the country to find " common cause .

barroso waits to replace prodi incoming eu executive head jose manuel barroso said friday he hopes for " clear " approval when eu lawmakers finally vote on his new team later this month , to end an unprecedented state of limbo in brussels . barroso was speaking after the european union parliament , which threatened the eu with crisis last month by blocking barroso 's first-choice line-up for the new european commission , set a new date of november 18 for a confidence vote . " i am very satisfied by the general reaction ...
i hope to have a strong vote , clear majority vote for the commission in the interests of the union , " barroso said after talks with party leaders in the eu legislative assembly . barroso was forced to withdraw his first-choice team on october 27 after eu lawmakers in strasbourg threatened to veto it notably over the inclusion of controversial italian nominee rocco buttiglione . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's rocco buttiglione .
buttiglione , who was nominated for the sensitive justice portfolio , had infuriated meps by describing homosexuality as a " sin " and saying that women should stay at home to have babies . barroso , portugal 's former prime minister , should have taken up his brussels job on november 1 .
outgoing commission chief romano prodi is staying on as a caretaker in the meantime . party leaders agree on date the new vote date was set by party group leaders after talks with barroso , who unveiled a reshuffled commission team at a two-day eu summit in brussels . confirmation hearings for three newly-designated nominees will be held on november 15 and 16 at the parliament , which will be holding its next monthly plenary session in strasbourg , sources said . the head of the socialist group in the eu assembly , which was the driving force behind last week 's veto threat , said friday he favored a swift resolution to the standoff .

" new commission nominees confirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's foreign minister franco frattini .
barroso had pledged to make a " limited " reshuffle to win parliament 's support , and his reformed line-up included two new members and one swap of portfolio .
he confirmed that italian foreign minister franco frattini was nominated to replace buttiglione .
frattini will also serve as one of five vice presidents of the commission . barroso said that latvia 's new nominee andris piebalgs will replace ingrida udre , who also failed to win eu lawmakers ' backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andris piebalgs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.11.2004 european press review : will palestine survive arafat ? palestinian president yasser arafat 's critical health condition was the focus of numerous european editorials on friday . britain ’ s the daily telegraph suggested that yasser arafat ’ s critical condition could open the door to the revival of peace talks between the israelis and palestinians .
yet , progress may not be as swift as british prime minister tony blair and his foreign secretary , jack straw , would wish .
they both reacted to george w. bush ’ s electoral triumph by declaring that the most pressing political challenge in the world today is to get the two sides back round the negotiating table .
the incapacitation of the palestinian leader will add credence to that view , the paper opined .
the guardian , from london , said arafat is " the father of the nation but not yet the father of the palestinian state . "
it wrote that 40 years on from the age of british de-colonization , he is the last man who can claim that status .
the paper recalled that arafat had to win recognition of the fact that there was such a thing as a palestinian nation at all .
" to move from defensive consolidation and start to build a nation was nigh impossible .
that arafat managed to do it and retain the affection of his people , not just as a symbol of independence but as a respected and approachable human being , is a tribute of his greatness . " the paris daily liberation wrote that yasser arafat ’ s death will usher in a dangerous phase for the palestinians .
his death might mean the birth of a new arab myth , but the immediate and burning question is whether palestine will survive arafat .
will his orphans manage to unite in a different way than through his symbol ? liberation ’ s compatriot le figaro , while praising arafat as one of the great figures of the 20th century , wonders whether he really wanted peace .
the former terrorist , who became the elected president of the palestinian authority , was during his entire life an expert at playing a double game .
he was so unpredictable that it was hard to know whether he was always acting in the interest of his people or in his own interest , the paper said . us president george w. bush 's election victory still gives commentators plenty of food for thought .
germany ’ s berliner zeitung wrote that there is little room for optimism in the analysis of washington ’ s future policies , but that for the political practice it is indispensable .
for without transatlantic cooperation there will never be a peace process in the middle east that deserves that name , and it will be even harder to slow down the spread of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
in addition , the berlin daily said , if america and europe feud , it reduces the western democracies effect on the rest of the world and weakens the fight against terrorism . incoming european commission president jose barroso tried to end the political crisis in the european union on thursday by unveiling his new team of commissioners after the european parliament had last month expressed concerns about a number of candidates , including italy ’ s rocco buttiglione .
commenting on his replacement with italian foreign minister franco frattini , the rome-based newspaper il messaggero write : " it took almost a month - dominated by negotiations , international squabbles and even crusades from other eras .
now it seems we have made it .
everywhere you look approval and widespread praise .
one begins to wonder why we couldn ’ t have got there much sooner . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

yet , progress may not be as swift as british prime minister tony blair and his foreign secretary , jack straw , would wish .
they both reacted to george w. bush ’ s electoral triumph by declaring that the most pressing political challenge in the world today is to get the two sides back round the negotiating table .
the incapacitation of the palestinian leader will add credence to that view , the paper opined .
the guardian , from london , said arafat is " the father of the nation but not yet the father of the palestinian state . "
it wrote that 40 years on from the age of british de-colonization , he is the last man who can claim that status .
the paper recalled that arafat had to win recognition of the fact that there was such a thing as a palestinian nation at all .
" to move from defensive consolidation and start to build a nation was nigh impossible .
that arafat managed to do it and retain the affection of his people , not just as a symbol of independence but as a respected and approachable human being , is a tribute of his greatness . " the paris daily liberation wrote that yasser arafat ’ s death will usher in a dangerous phase for the palestinians .
his death might mean the birth of a new arab myth , but the immediate and burning question is whether palestine will survive arafat .
will his orphans manage to unite in a different way than through his symbol ? liberation ’ s compatriot le figaro , while praising arafat as one of the great figures of the 20th century , wonders whether he really wanted peace .
the former terrorist , who became the elected president of the palestinian authority , was during his entire life an expert at playing a double game .
he was so unpredictable that it was hard to know whether he was always acting in the interest of his people or in his own interest , the paper said . us president george w. bush 's election victory still gives commentators plenty of food for thought .
germany ’ s berliner zeitung wrote that there is little room for optimism in the analysis of washington ’ s future policies , but that for the political practice it is indispensable .
for without transatlantic cooperation there will never be a peace process in the middle east that deserves that name , and it will be even harder to slow down the spread of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
in addition , the berlin daily said , if america and europe feud , it reduces the western democracies effect on the rest of the world and weakens the fight against terrorism . incoming european commission president jose barroso tried to end the political crisis in the european union on thursday by unveiling his new team of commissioners after the european parliament had last month expressed concerns about a number of candidates , including italy ’ s rocco buttiglione .
commenting on his replacement with italian foreign minister franco frattini , the rome-based newspaper il messaggero write : " it took almost a month - dominated by negotiations , international squabbles and even crusades from other eras .

but conflicts of interests and privacy issues , especially in germany , are undermining investigations . just days after european investigators called for " sharper tools " and better intelligence-sharing in the war on terror , germany 's attempts to adhere to these calls has come up against a brick wall of the government 's making . interior minister otto schily , who addressed a security conference in wiesbaden on tuesday , told those attending that he was confident of forcing through constitutional changes to give the federal crime office - the bundeskriminalamt or bka - more " preventive powers , " including those which would allow german security forces to tap suspects ' telephones . but by thursday , schily was left frustrated at the unwillingness of the german government to reform the security services .
powers which would give the bka the ability to mount the increasingly sensitive and intrusive investigations schily recommends in the fight against terrorism would have to be agreed upon by the government , a course of action it is not willing to take at the moment . schily 's plan to create a central terror suspect database is also causing controversy .

but the creation of a central database for muslim fundamentalists is controversial , both with germany 's more than three million muslims and with privacy watchdogs .
federal data protection commissioner peter schaar told the security conference this week that muslims considered to be " extremists " must not be listed in such a database unless there was concrete evidence of links to terrorism . however , tensions were increased when top intelligence officials countered that view , claiming suspects could always be removed later if terrorist involvement was ruled out .
" we should n't let -lrb- militants -rrb- exploit our freedom and data protection rules , " said rüdiger von fritsch , deputy head of the foreign intelligence agency . the privacy issue aside , the creation of a centralized intelligence agency has increased tensions between the government and the16 german states , all of which have their own police and security forces .

" if we receive highly sensitive threat information , we do n't want to get into long discussions with the states on whether they have the resources to launch surveillance if i have the resources to do that myself , " he told journalists . the german bickering highlighted the problems facing the eu countries in the fight against terrorism in regard to speed of investigation and action . french investigating magistrate jean-louis bruguiere told the conference that the bureaucracy was undoing a lot of the good work being undertaken by european investigations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.11.2004 german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily 's call for security reform in germany fell on deaf ears european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .
but conflicts of interests and privacy issues , especially in germany , are undermining investigations . just days after european investigators called for " sharper tools " and better intelligence-sharing in the war on terror , germany 's attempts to adhere to these calls has come up against a brick wall of the government 's making . interior minister otto schily , who addressed a security conference in wiesbaden on tuesday , told those attending that he was confident of forcing through constitutional changes to give the federal crime office - the bundeskriminalamt or bka - more " preventive powers , " including those which would allow german security forces to tap suspects ' telephones . but by thursday , schily was left frustrated at the unwillingness of the german government to reform the security services .
powers which would give the bka the ability to mount the increasingly sensitive and intrusive investigations schily recommends in the fight against terrorism would have to be agreed upon by the government , a course of action it is not willing to take at the moment . schily 's plan to create a central terror suspect database is also causing controversy .
the federal police and intelligence services have already had their headquarters moved to berlin as part of a drive to improve coordination , an initial part of the plan to centralize information on suspected muslim extremists . false accusation fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rights of germany 's three million muslims could be compromised .
but the creation of a central database for muslim fundamentalists is controversial , both with germany 's more than three million muslims and with privacy watchdogs .
federal data protection commissioner peter schaar told the security conference this week that muslims considered to be " extremists " must not be listed in such a database unless there was concrete evidence of links to terrorism . however , tensions were increased when top intelligence officials countered that view , claiming suspects could always be removed later if terrorist involvement was ruled out .
" we should n't let -lrb- militants -rrb- exploit our freedom and data protection rules , " said rüdiger von fritsch , deputy head of the foreign intelligence agency . the privacy issue aside , the creation of a centralized intelligence agency has increased tensions between the government and the16 german states , all of which have their own police and security forces .
at the moment , each of the german states is responsible for its own investigations into terrorist activities , something schily wants to reform in a bid to compile a nationwide network of efficient data collection and exchange under a bka banner . conflict with germany hindering process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking at the security conference , bka chief jörg ziercke -lrb- photo , with schily -rrb- said that the current situation often forced the agency to take a back seat to police forces in the federal states . " if we receive highly sensitive threat information , we do n't want to get into long discussions with the states on whether they have the resources to launch surveillance if i have the resources to do that myself , " he told journalists . the german bickering highlighted the problems facing the eu countries in the fight against terrorism in regard to speed of investigation and action . french investigating magistrate jean-louis bruguiere told the conference that the bureaucracy was undoing a lot of the good work being undertaken by european investigations .
" we must act in real time , " he told the conference .
" very often it takes much too long for appropriate action to be taken .
we must position ourselves so a house search can be carried out within the hour . " european initiatives suffering europe 's struggle to overhaul anti-terrorism cooperation since the attacks of sept .

the move was heavily criticized by the media , and the country 's head of state horst köhler even wrote to chancellor gerhard schröder asking him to reconsider the move .
speaking in brussels friday , the chancellor regretfully withdrew the plan , citing lack of political support .
loud opposition the plan by german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel to rid the country of one of its work holidays was met with loud opposition - from within the government as well as political opponents .
the trouble started when the two social democrats proposed a plan to move the october 3 german unity day holiday - one of up to 16 national holidays - to a sunday , thereby gaining an extra day of work .
eichel introduced the plan as part of his new austerity measures , arguing it would potentially provide a 0.1 percent increase in gdp , and attendant tax revenue increases .
economics minister wolfgang clement said the move would bring in additional income of € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
a question of soul ?
but opponents to the idea retorted that to strike the national holiday was " unpatriotic , " akin to attacking the soul of the nation , referring to the overriding historical importance of the division and reunification of east and west .

" taking october 3 as a symbol for the reunification of germany in peace and freedom is important for the future of our country , and should be retained , " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper quoted köhler as writing .
there could be better ways " to find an additional work day in order to take part in the consolidation of the country 's finances . "
done deal ?
but schröder parried back with a letter to köhler , according to mass-circulation daily bild .
he wrote that unity day is indeed very important , but added , " reunification was an extreme burden on our economy .
unity must be completed , and the number of holidays must be reduced . "
he finished by saying he was open to meeting with köhler to discuss better options .
despite the raging opposition , clement said that the plan " is not -lrb- just -rrb- an idea ; it will be carried out . "
and spd chief franz müntefering backed him up , telling the press that even if the opposition refuses to go along with the plan , " then we will go it alone . "
indeed , germany 's bundestag , the lower house of parliament , could make the change unilaterally .
the holiday was created by the german unity pact of 1990 , a federal law , and amending it would not require ratification by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament which represents the states .

" scrapping the oct .
3 holiday is no longer being pursued , " social democrat spokesman lars kühn said friday .
the move was heavily criticized by the media , and the country 's head of state horst köhler even wrote to chancellor gerhard schröder asking him to reconsider the move .
speaking in brussels friday , the chancellor regretfully withdrew the plan , citing lack of political support .
loud opposition the plan by german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel to rid the country of one of its work holidays was met with loud opposition - from within the government as well as political opponents .
the trouble started when the two social democrats proposed a plan to move the october 3 german unity day holiday - one of up to 16 national holidays - to a sunday , thereby gaining an extra day of work .
eichel introduced the plan as part of his new austerity measures , arguing it would potentially provide a 0.1 percent increase in gdp , and attendant tax revenue increases .
economics minister wolfgang clement said the move would bring in additional income of € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
a question of soul ?
but opponents to the idea retorted that to strike the national holiday was " unpatriotic , " akin to attacking the soul of the nation , referring to the overriding historical importance of the division and reunification of east and west .
" i wonder about the soul of a nation whose government plans such a thing , " lothar de maizere , east germany 's last prime minister , told german tv broadcaster ard .
the situation heated up further german president horst köhler wrote a letter to schröder in which he opposed the plan .
" taking october 3 as a symbol for the reunification of germany in peace and freedom is important for the future of our country , and should be retained , " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper quoted köhler as writing .
there could be better ways " to find an additional work day in order to take part in the consolidation of the country 's finances . "
done deal ?
but schröder parried back with a letter to köhler , according to mass-circulation daily bild .
he wrote that unity day is indeed very important , but added , " reunification was an extreme burden on our economy .
unity must be completed , and the number of holidays must be reduced . "
he finished by saying he was open to meeting with köhler to discuss better options .
despite the raging opposition , clement said that the plan " is not -lrb- just -rrb- an idea ; it will be carried out . "
and spd chief franz müntefering backed him up , telling the press that even if the opposition refuses to go along with the plan , " then we will go it alone . "
indeed , germany 's bundestag , the lower house of parliament , could make the change unilaterally .
the holiday was created by the german unity pact of 1990 , a federal law , and amending it would not require ratification by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament which represents the states .
opposition - from both sides but just because the government can pull it off , does n't mean people have to like it - not even members of the ruling party .
bundestag president wolfgang thierse , schleswig-holstein premier heide simonis , bremen mayor henning scherf , green party parliamentary group leader krista sager - all have openly criticized the plan .
and the opposition , of course , has been anything but quiet .
cdu secretary general laurenz meyer called the suggestion " unpatriotic . "
the idea shows that " this government does not have a positive attitude toward german unity and to the emotions that are tied to the event , " meyer told the kieler nachrichten newspaper .
the leaders of key opposition parties cdu and csu , angela merkel and edmund stoiber , accused the government of " forgetting history . "
in turn , spd secretary general klaus uwe benneter retorted , " it was the policies made under the leadership of spd leader willy brandt that made reunification possible . "

revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years . german finance minister hans eichel presented his plan to make up for an unexpected € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12.9 billion -rrb- budget shortfall and bring the german economy in line with eu stability criteria thursday .
to this end , the minister said , he plans a pay freeze for civil servants , an additional workday for all germans , and securitization of deutsche post and deutsche telekom pensions , along with several other measures .
the package met with criticism from many quarters , and the plan to get rid of a key german holiday unleashed a political firestorm .
mineral oil , tobacco to blame tax revenues for 2004-2005 fell some € 4.8 billion short of previous forecasts .
in addition , the budget needed to be adjusted for an additional € 3 billion in spending on the job market .
the federal government will be hit especially hard by the measures ; the individual states got off relatively lightly , and local governments even got additional funds .
eichel blamed the lower-than-expected tax revenues on reduced mineral-oil and tobacco taxes , whereby local governments booked " superb increases in commercial taxes , " the finance ministry told news agencies .
despite the decline , the ministry said the government " is still holding on to its 2005 goal of having a budget deficit that will again return to below " the 3 percent euro-zone criteria .
controversial plan a big part of the government 's plan to plug the hole in its finances will be achieved by selling off pension liabilities at deutsche post and deutsche telekom , two semi-private companies .
many post and telekom workers are effectively civil servants , and their retirements must therefore be paid by the state .
in compensation , the two companies are supposed to pay into eichel 's coffers € 18 billion .
the state will then convert these expected revenues into securities and sell them to investors , generating a further € 5.5 billion .
the part of the plan that has generated the most controversy was the move by eichel and german chancellor gerhard schröder to shift the day of german unity holiday from oct .
3 to the first sunday in october .
the government calculated that the extra day of work each year is worth annual gdp growth of 0.1 percent , that is , increased tax revenue .
critics speak out criticism of the plan came from opposition politicians as well as affected organizations .
the german civil servants association , deutscher beamtenbund , objected vociferously to the plan .
the group 's head , peter heesen , said such a move would endanger the implementation of the reform package previously agreed to with interior minister otto schily .
heesen also noted that civil servants already accepted benefits cuts as well as longer work hours in 2004 .
also strongly opposed to the plan to meet the eu criteria was the bdb association of german banks .
" the consolidation of federal finances is an urgent task facing germany , " bdb head manfred weber told news agencies in berlin .
" but the proposal that the government submitted is just a quick fix . "
while group said moving a holiday could indeed help long term growth , it criticized the plan for pushing current debt off to future budgets .

revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years . german finance minister hans eichel presented his plan to make up for an unexpected € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12.9 billion -rrb- budget shortfall and bring the german economy in line with eu stability criteria thursday .
to this end , the minister said , he plans a pay freeze for civil servants , an additional workday for all germans , and securitization of deutsche post and deutsche telekom pensions , along with several other measures .
the package met with criticism from many quarters , and the plan to get rid of a key german holiday unleashed a political firestorm .
mineral oil , tobacco to blame tax revenues for 2004-2005 fell some € 4.8 billion short of previous forecasts .
in addition , the budget needed to be adjusted for an additional € 3 billion in spending on the job market .
the federal government will be hit especially hard by the measures ; the individual states got off relatively lightly , and local governments even got additional funds .
eichel blamed the lower-than-expected tax revenues on reduced mineral-oil and tobacco taxes , whereby local governments booked " superb increases in commercial taxes , " the finance ministry told news agencies .
despite the decline , the ministry said the government " is still holding on to its 2005 goal of having a budget deficit that will again return to below " the 3 percent euro-zone criteria .
controversial plan a big part of the government 's plan to plug the hole in its finances will be achieved by selling off pension liabilities at deutsche post and deutsche telekom , two semi-private companies .
many post and telekom workers are effectively civil servants , and their retirements must therefore be paid by the state .
in compensation , the two companies are supposed to pay into eichel 's coffers € 18 billion .
the state will then convert these expected revenues into securities and sell them to investors , generating a further € 5.5 billion .
the part of the plan that has generated the most controversy was the move by eichel and german chancellor gerhard schröder to shift the day of german unity holiday from oct .
3 to the first sunday in october .
the government calculated that the extra day of work each year is worth annual gdp growth of 0.1 percent , that is , increased tax revenue .
critics speak out criticism of the plan came from opposition politicians as well as affected organizations .
the german civil servants association , deutscher beamtenbund , objected vociferously to the plan .
the group 's head , peter heesen , said such a move would endanger the implementation of the reform package previously agreed to with interior minister otto schily .
heesen also noted that civil servants already accepted benefits cuts as well as longer work hours in 2004 .
also strongly opposed to the plan to meet the eu criteria was the bdb association of german banks .
" the consolidation of federal finances is an urgent task facing germany , " bdb head manfred weber told news agencies in berlin .
" but the proposal that the government submitted is just a quick fix . "
while group said moving a holiday could indeed help long term growth , it criticized the plan for pushing current debt off to future budgets .
this is not a good solution for the current structural problems , weber said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu lodges " tank tourism " complaint germany 's political opposition is calling for fast and effective measures to combat so-called " tank tourism , " which sees germans flooding across borders to fill up their cars with cheaper gasoline .

" we are now back on track .
we need to get back to work quickly , " barroso told a news conference after presenting his slightly modified line-up to eu leaders . the most high-profile change is that of the future justice and security chief .
barroso said italian foreign minister franco frattini would replace rocco buttiglione , whose conservative views on homosexuality and the role of women stirred anger among many eu parliamentarians and threatened to derail the entire commission . barroso also announced that laszlo kovacs of hungary would switch from energy to taxation and a new latvian nominee , andris piebalgs , would take the energy portfolio .
another controversial nominee , neelie kroes from the netherlands , would be retained as competition commissioner . us-eu future meeting at european union headquarters in brussels a day after president george bush was re-elected to the white house , leaders from the 25 member states were just as focused on the future path of us-eu relations as on the set economic agenda .
on the eve of the two-day summit which will include talks with iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi , the eu pledged to overhaul transatlantic links strained to the breaking point during the president 's first term .
both eu and us officials said they hoped bush 's second term would start out on a much better note and bring the two regions closer together again .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , who holds the eu 's rotating presidency , sent a personal letter of congratulation to bush .
" the united states and the european union are linked by strong cultural , economic and political ties , and by our shared values ...
the presidency is confident that this relationship will be further deepened and strengthened under the new administration , " it said .
iraq on the agenda eu nations have been deeply split over us policy in iraq , with britain spearheading support for the war while germany and france staunchly opposed military intervention .
only recently has the bloc begun overcoming those differences to work for the shattered country 's reconstruction .
on tuesday eu foreign ministers agreed to a package of financial and logistical support initiatives for iraq ahead of the country 's elections planned for january .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot said the deal showed that the eu was " united again " after its iraq rift .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi a meeting with iraqi interim leader allawi on friday will help further shore up common eu support for bolstering iraq 's struggling democracy .
economic focus in addition to foreign policy issues , the 25 eu leaders are expected to focus on a report by former dutch prime minister wim kok on the so-called lisbon agenda , the bloc 's grand plan launched in 2000 to make europe the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .
the report paints a gloomy future , warning that " too many targets promise to be seriously missed . "
nonetheless eu leaders are likely to express renewed commitment to the economic goals and examine ways to press ahead with market-oriented reforms in the face of new enlargement prospects and current difficulties in bringing the 10 newest accession states up to an economic par with the rest of the bloc .
many leaders will also be looking towards the summit as a good opportunity to resolve the crisis that was sparked last week when incoming european commission chief jose manuel barroso was forced to withdraw his proposed executive team due to protests by eu lawmakers . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in emotional speech , kerry concedes defeat in a gracious speech before supporters a clearly emotional senator john kerry conceded defeat and urged the country to find " common cause .

" we are now back on track .
we need to get back to work quickly , " barroso told a news conference after presenting his slightly modified line-up to eu leaders . the most high-profile change is that of the future justice and security chief .
barroso said italian foreign minister franco frattini would replace rocco buttiglione , whose conservative views on homosexuality and the role of women stirred anger among many eu parliamentarians and threatened to derail the entire commission . barroso also announced that laszlo kovacs of hungary would switch from energy to taxation and a new latvian nominee , andris piebalgs , would take the energy portfolio .
another controversial nominee , neelie kroes from the netherlands , would be retained as competition commissioner . us-eu future meeting at european union headquarters in brussels a day after president george bush was re-elected to the white house , leaders from the 25 member states were just as focused on the future path of us-eu relations as on the set economic agenda .
on the eve of the two-day summit which will include talks with iraqi interim prime minister iyad allawi , the eu pledged to overhaul transatlantic links strained to the breaking point during the president 's first term .
both eu and us officials said they hoped bush 's second term would start out on a much better note and bring the two regions closer together again .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , who holds the eu 's rotating presidency , sent a personal letter of congratulation to bush .
" the united states and the european union are linked by strong cultural , economic and political ties , and by our shared values ...
the presidency is confident that this relationship will be further deepened and strengthened under the new administration , " it said .

only recently has the bloc begun overcoming those differences to work for the shattered country 's reconstruction .
on tuesday eu foreign ministers agreed to a package of financial and logistical support initiatives for iraq ahead of the country 's elections planned for january .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot said the deal showed that the eu was " united again " after its iraq rift .

the report paints a gloomy future , warning that " too many targets promise to be seriously missed . "
nonetheless eu leaders are likely to express renewed commitment to the economic goals and examine ways to press ahead with market-oriented reforms in the face of new enlargement prospects and current difficulties in bringing the 10 newest accession states up to an economic par with the rest of the bloc .

barroso waits to replace prodi incoming eu executive head jose manuel barroso said friday he hopes for " clear " approval when eu lawmakers finally vote on his new team later this month , to end an unprecedented state of limbo in brussels . barroso was speaking after the european union parliament , which threatened the eu with crisis last month by blocking barroso 's first-choice line-up for the new european commission , set a new date of november 18 for a confidence vote . " i am very satisfied by the general reaction ...
i hope to have a strong vote , clear majority vote for the commission in the interests of the union , " barroso said after talks with party leaders in the eu legislative assembly . barroso was forced to withdraw his first-choice team on october 27 after eu lawmakers in strasbourg threatened to veto it notably over the inclusion of controversial italian nominee rocco buttiglione . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's rocco buttiglione .

outgoing commission chief romano prodi is staying on as a caretaker in the meantime . party leaders agree on date the new vote date was set by party group leaders after talks with barroso , who unveiled a reshuffled commission team at a two-day eu summit in brussels . confirmation hearings for three newly-designated nominees will be held on november 15 and 16 at the parliament , which will be holding its next monthly plenary session in strasbourg , sources said . the head of the socialist group in the eu assembly , which was the driving force behind last week 's veto threat , said friday he favored a swift resolution to the standoff .

barroso had pledged to make a " limited " reshuffle to win parliament 's support , and his reformed line-up included two new members and one swap of portfolio .

the petition , signed by 51 opposition lawmakers , will create a committee to investigate charges that mr gutierrez misused public funds .
interior minister raul baca said it was an attempt to destabilise the country .
the committee will meet next week to begin to consider whether there are grounds for a trial .
it will report to congress within five days , which will vote on whether to proceed .
in ecuador 's one-chamber legislature , 67 votes out of 100 would be needed to remove the president , who was elected in 2002 .
the only things we have on our side are the truth and the evidence cinthya viteri , psc mp mr gutierrez is accused of using state funds for the last campaign of his patriotic society party .
the impeachment trial request has been made by the opposition social christian party -lrb- psc -rrb- , democratic left , democratic people 's movement and the indigenous pachakutik , as well as some independents .
" the only things we have on our side are the truth and the evidence , " said cinthya viteri , a member of the psc .
' revenge ' mr gutierrez says the impeachment attempt has been instigated by the family of former president leon febres cordero , in revenge for moves to recover an alleged $ 110m of their unpaid debts .
" they have money and they do not feel like paying ...
i am going to make them pay , so they are trying to get me impeached , " he said , according to afp news agency .
" this is the fight of honest working people against the corrupt oligarchy . "
mr baca said he was confident the opposition would not get the two-thirds majority in congress needed to remove mr gutierrez .
analysts say at present he probably has enough support in congress to survive any impeachment vote .
it is the first time in ecuador 's history that such proceedings have been sought against a president .
when mr gutierrez , an ex-army colonel and former coup leader , won the presidency two years ago he pledged to stamp out corruption .

the airline said it carried 2.4 million passengers in october , a 25 % increase on the same period last year .
easyjet 's load factor - the average proportion of occupied seats per flight - rose to 87 % from 85.5 % in october 2003 .
easyjet chief ray webster described the firm 's performance as " solid " .
" our low-cost business model remains robust and we continue to capitalise on it . "
the passenger figures for october were also lifted by the launch of 18 new routes .
the increase in easyjet 's passenger numbers will help dispel investor concerns over rising oil prices at a time of intense price competition within the no-frills airline sector .
last month , easyjet 's shares fell sharply after the airline warned that fares would remain under pressure into next year .
two weeks ago , there was speculation of a takeover bid for easyjet after icelandic flag carrier icelandair bought a 10 % stake in the firm .
easyjet shares were up more than 4 % at 179p in early trade on friday .

it is thought nicotinic acetylcholine receptors found on the surface of brain cells are key .
the team from the california institute of technology found that carrying a particular variant of the receptor increases vulnerability to nicotine .
the findings are published in the journal science .
it could eventually lead to new technologies that could help the 70 % of smokers in the uk who want to kick the habit .
professor andrew peacock the receptors can be composed of different combinations of subunits .
the california team discovered that mice with a mutation in the " alpha4 " subunit were unusually sensitive to the effects of nicotine .
compared to normal neurons , the mutant neurons responded to lower concentrations of nicotine and , after this exposure , they also responded more robustly to larger doses .
behavioral tests showed that mutant mice exhibited signs of addiction at lower doses than normal mice .
professor robert west , of the cancer research uk health behaviour unit at university college london , said : " this study is useful in helping with development of medications that target the receptors involved in nicotine dependence but not others and so minimising unwanted side effects . "
professor west said the pharmaceutical company pfizer have a drug , varenicline , which is undergoing clinical trials at the moment that they believe targets just this receptor .
he said the study also highlighted the fact that susceptibility to nicotine addiction may be passed down the generations .
" in fact the ' heritability ' of nicotine dependence is estimated at around 50 % which is similar to that for alcohol dependence . "
professor andrew peacock , of the british thoracic society , said : " this is an interesting piece of research as it could eventually lead to new technologies that could help the 70 % of smokers in the uk who want to kick the habit .
" the research also demonstrates that there is a lot more for us to learn about how the brain works in relation to nicotine addiction - we need to see much more research in this area . "

soares was convicted in 2002 of failing to prevent the bloodshed which wracked the territory before , during , and after its vote to become independent of indonesia .
many were killed by pro-jakarta militias .
soares only began serving his three-year sentence in july , but he could now be free within days .

the tribunal has been widely criticised by human rights groups and foreign governments but the government of east timor has downplayed the importance of the tribunals , arguing that good relations with jakarta should take priority over justice .
however , indonesia 's foreign minister , hassan wirayuda , acknowledged that the verdict would increase international criticism of jakarta .
" this decision against soares will add to the arguments for those who are questioning the credibility of the legal process in indonesia , " he said .

soares was convicted in 2002 of failing to prevent the bloodshed which wracked the territory before , during , and after its vote to become independent of indonesia .

the tribunal has been widely criticised by human rights groups and foreign governments but the government of east timor has downplayed the importance of the tribunals , arguing that good relations with jakarta should take priority over justice .
however , indonesia 's foreign minister , hassan wirayuda , acknowledged that the verdict would increase international criticism of jakarta .
" this decision against soares will add to the arguments for those who are questioning the credibility of the legal process in indonesia , " he said .
the only person whose conviction still stands is eurico guterres , a notorious militia leader .
he is still free pending appeal .
the bbc 's correspondent in jakarta , rachel harvey , says that the most senior military leaders implicated in the violence were never even indicted .
