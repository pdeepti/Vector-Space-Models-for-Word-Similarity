as part of the agreement , the italian government is planning to send 150 police officers to libya to help train their libyan counterparts .
the training exercises are expected to last one month and are likely to start in november . in addition , tripoli will be purchasing military equipment and vehicles from italy .
pisanu said this will be possible following the european union 's recent decision to lift its embargo on the sale of military equipment to libya . dropping embargo will aid libyan efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian soldiers help a weak and sick refugee from his boat in lampedusa harbor .
after eu foreign ministers officially do away with the embargo at a meeting scheduled for oct .
11 and oct .

the eu decision followed pressure by italy which wanted libya to make more efforts in controlling its coastline to stop human traffickers sending boatloads of illegal immigrants across the sea to italy .
in the past , libya was forced to borrow such vehicles from rome .
libya 's thousands of kilometers of desert and sea frontiers are difficult to police , but both countries have a strong interest in bringing the flood of illegal immigrants from other parts of africa to libya under control . sabina castelfranco -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy and libya tackle illegal immigration italian prime minister silvio berlusconi met libyan leader moammar gadhafi on wednesday for talks on stemming the tide of illegal immigrants using the north african country as a transit point .

while political critics in schily 's social democratic party are waiting to hear what he has to say when he presents the proposal to a parliamentary committee on wednesday , members of junior collation party , the greens , are n't wasting any time voicing their opposition to the plan .
" there has to be a different answer than schily 's , " green party leader katrin göring-eckardt told the newspaper .

" the idea of safe third states -lrb- in africa -rrb- would make it nearly impossible for refugees to receive asylum in europe , " wolfgang grenz of amnesty international said .
" it contradicts the fundament of international refugee laws . "
a unified european asylum system will be high on the agenda when the eu 's 25 interior ministers meet in the netherlands on thursday .
there is still debate about whether the eu should set up centers in africa to process immigrants and refugees .
in italy , one of the countries most heavily targeted by illegal immigrants , the government has already begun bilaterial negotiations with libya about such a center .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the capital of pop mp3 inventor wants a chat with his stereo german radio quota debate goes live netting the big fish business -pipe- 29.09.2004 can berlin save german pop ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking for the answers to the industry 's woes many in germany 's troubled music industry hope moving the trade fair popkomm from cologne to berlin this year will help the sector redefine itself in an age of plummeting cd sales and surging digital downloads . long suffering from sinking revenues and under threat from emerging technologies such as mp3 and internet file-swapping networks , there are several issues plaguing the music business during the 16th annual popkomm .
but the move to berlin has fused what is often billed as the world 's biggest music trade fair with new life .
" it 's not simply moving from one city to another , but rather a real fresh start , " said popkomm 's general manager ralf kleinhenz .
despite cologne 's role as an important media center in germany , the number of visitors to the fair had dropped dramatically in recent years .
opening with a big concert on tuesday night , organizers hope berlin - which has been anointed germany 's music capital - will increase popkomm 's international profile .
there will be 661 exhibitors at the three-day trade fair from 41 different countries .
along with an industry conference , there will be 400 hours of live music at concerts and club events open to the general public .
during the week , german acts like rappers die fantastischen vier and rockers sportfreunde stiller will perform alongside international artists including world-renowned techno djs and veteran gangsta rapper ice-t , who has a new group called the machine .
but as berliners enjoy a few days of top-shelf music , industry insiders will be discussing the still uncertain future of the music business .
the future is digital topping the agenda is how to deal with the rapidly evolving nature of music .
as fewer people buy cds and move their music collections to their home computers , the industry is still grappling with piracy and copyright issues for digital formats like mp3s .
some estimates have put the drop in sales for the german music sector at around 40 percent since 1997 .
most in the industry blame internet file-sharing networks that were modeled on napster .
" what 's changing at the moment is how we deal with music , " kleinhenz said .
" and that raises questions not only of an economic nature , but also cultural and societal questions . "
in germany , one of the top current questions is how best to support local artists .
some are calling for a radio quota for german musicians modeled on france 's system .
there , at least 40 percent of all radio airtime is reserved for french acts .
the initiative has gained the support of some german politicians , including green party parliamentarian antje vollmer .
" we owe it to our cultural identity , " vollmer said , according to dpa news agency .
" it has nothing to do with being overly german .
other countries naturally take care of their own artists . "
vollmer has called for an open parliamentary debate on the matter on wednesday .
not waiting for help many musicians agree more needs to be done to promote german acts , but they are n't waiting for the government or industry to help them out .
eike herwig , the drummer for the punk rock band the donots , said his group makes a special effort to promote up-and-coming bands .
besides setting up a special section highlighting new groups on their web site , the donots are also giving them opening spots on their latest tour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo and alex from the donots at the hurricane open air festival .
-lrb- eike is behind them . -rrb-
" i think it 's important to give german musicians more attention , " herwig told dw-world .
" a lot of the time on german radio the focus is on bands from america and england . "
tim renner from record label motor music backs the idea of supporting local acts , but is leery of a legally mandated quota .
during popkomm the label 's new radio station motorfm will broadcast only german bands and musicians like canadian electro-trash queen peaches , who have a connection to germany .
thinking globally and locally renner used to head up the german division of universal music , but he and the company parted ways amid disagreement over the direction the label was heading .
whereas renner always thought supporting local german musicians would be the best way to approach the domestic market , the head office of the company wanted to focus more on major international acts that could be sold globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim renner " i get mixed feelings when i hear the word quota , " renner told dw-world .
" they 'll tell you there 's not enough good stuff out there .
that 's not true .
they need to promote the cultural diversity , but any quota will mean they 've failed to find a radio concept . "
he said if motorfm gets a permanent frequency to broadcast in berlin the station will continue to support local artists , but it will concentrate on simply playing good music regardless of its origin .
renner is also hoping to pioneer new ways to make new digital technologies a boon instead of a bane for the industry .
he said the station would aim to make every song played available to download legally .
besides an internet portal along the lines of the apple itunes music store , he said he hoped to have a totally mobile business model , including being able to send a sms text message from your phone to purchase the song being played on your car stereo .
" the radio stations could be the retailers of tomorrow , " he said .

dw-world readers this week commented on the race for the white house and president bush 's negative foreign policy record abroad . your point of view is interesting , i lived in europe for eight years and appreciate your points of view ; it 's great to see that the billions of dollars we spent through the marshal plan has produced peaceful differences .
two things you overlook are : only us citizens vote , and the economy , not foreign policy will determine the outcome of the election .
we 've been through years and years of anti-americanism , so what else is new .
polls in other countries mean nothing .
the americans living overseas vote in their particular state so even though they may be 80 % democrats , scattered over 50 states i seriously doubt they will have the kind of impact you describe - frank shipp why does n't your rag of a newspaper conduct a poll of americans asking them what they think of germany and mr. schröder ?
you germans can take your smug , self-satisfied views and shove them .
how 's that for candor , heinz ?
if germans had any sense of decency at all , they would shut their mouths before dispensing any advice - let alone moral advice - to george bush or to america .
any " crimes " america has ever committed pale by comparison to what you animals did not once , but twice in the last century .
your leaders kaiser willie and hitler were personally responsible for at least thirty million deaths , and you have the balls to ask germans what they think about my president and my country ? - john huettner violence destroyed our world trade center but that can be rebuilt .
george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .
george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .
we ca n't take it anymore . - lucy cole , alamo , california most americans are oblivious to their reception abroad , and i blame the american media for much of this ignorance .

our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .

it appears to be true ! - trevor steven taylor you need to understand that most americans know that the us is just about the only country in the world that can " go it alone . "
for that reason , we americans do n't care what the world thinks about us or our international policies .
the independent streak of the americans is actually increased when we hear that a large percentage of the germans and french disagrees with something the us is doing , no matter what it is .
as soon as the us does not require energy from foreign sources , we may just resign from the united nations .

dw-world readers this week commented on the race for the white house and president bush 's negative foreign policy record abroad . your point of view is interesting , i lived in europe for eight years and appreciate your points of view ; it 's great to see that the billions of dollars we spent through the marshal plan has produced peaceful differences .
two things you overlook are : only us citizens vote , and the economy , not foreign policy will determine the outcome of the election .
we 've been through years and years of anti-americanism , so what else is new .
polls in other countries mean nothing .
the americans living overseas vote in their particular state so even though they may be 80 % democrats , scattered over 50 states i seriously doubt they will have the kind of impact you describe - frank shipp why does n't your rag of a newspaper conduct a poll of americans asking them what they think of germany and mr. schröder ?
you germans can take your smug , self-satisfied views and shove them .
how 's that for candor , heinz ?
if germans had any sense of decency at all , they would shut their mouths before dispensing any advice - let alone moral advice - to george bush or to america .
any " crimes " america has ever committed pale by comparison to what you animals did not once , but twice in the last century .
your leaders kaiser willie and hitler were personally responsible for at least thirty million deaths , and you have the balls to ask germans what they think about my president and my country ? - john huettner violence destroyed our world trade center but that can be rebuilt .
george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .
george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .
we ca n't take it anymore . - lucy cole , alamo , california most americans are oblivious to their reception abroad , and i blame the american media for much of this ignorance .
bush 's record at home is remarkably but undeservedly good . - jeffrey hamill i am an a citizen of the united states and love my country but detest its current " leadership . "
our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .
if iraq truly had nothing to hide , then why not comply ?
should we have waited another 10 years while saddam continued to torture his own people ?
how long is too long ?
george w. bush is the only leader in the world strong enough to draw the line in the sand and face these threats head-on .
it may be years before this is truly understood .
the un is a weak , spineless organization that failed miserably to stop saddam .
jacques chirac is also weak , and could never stand up to terrorists the way mr. bush has .
i 'd rather see us fight terrorists , alone if we have to , on the streets of baghdad instead of being attacked on the streets of boston or elsewhere .
i will proudly vote for president george w. bush on nov .
2nd .
and many here agree with me , and i would prepare for a second bush term now . - steve bush has been a complete disaster internationally and an embarrassment to those of us in the us who long for a return to diplomacy to solve problems .
this country is , i 'm afraid , moving into a very dangerous unilateralism on a wide range of subjects .
this includes our refusal to join the eu and others in the international criminal court and kyoto .
i hate to say it , but i fear we are resorting back to pre-wwii us autonomy , hegemony and unilateralism in our relations with the world .
i think this could be a semi-permanent condition and i do n't know that even electing kerry will solve it .
americans are , unfortunately turning increasingly inward and are not taking criticism and disagreement from other nations and organizations very well .
in fact , they increasingly appear to be fighting back and downright dismissive of allies and others who voice disagreement with our policies .
it appears that being the only military " super-power " in the world is going to our heads .
remember the adage , " absolute power corrupts , absolutely " ! !
it appears to be true ! - trevor steven taylor you need to understand that most americans know that the us is just about the only country in the world that can " go it alone . "
for that reason , we americans do n't care what the world thinks about us or our international policies .
the independent streak of the americans is actually increased when we hear that a large percentage of the germans and french disagrees with something the us is doing , no matter what it is .
as soon as the us does not require energy from foreign sources , we may just resign from the united nations .
according to the polls , that 's the goal of more than half the americans , and those are the ones who support george w. bush .
thank you . - james l. reid , usa i believe george w. bush has hindered the spread of peace throughout the world .
i believe he does not consider that others world-wide have a right to govern their own area and have a clearer view of the big picture .
i also believe he was not taught to " play nice with others " when he was a child .
he has the arrogant , smirk of a bully who was born into privilege and has never had to consider the other person 's rights or feelings . - karen seeger , usa the only opinion that counts will be the election results in november .
the eu public is generally misinformed by a biased media that spews constant anti-bush information .
the net result is an anti-bush eu public . - boyd lawrence , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .

dw-world readers this week commented on the race for the white house and president bush 's negative foreign policy record abroad . your point of view is interesting , i lived in europe for eight years and appreciate your points of view ; it 's great to see that the billions of dollars we spent through the marshal plan has produced peaceful differences .
two things you overlook are : only us citizens vote , and the economy , not foreign policy will determine the outcome of the election .
we 've been through years and years of anti-americanism , so what else is new .
polls in other countries mean nothing .
the americans living overseas vote in their particular state so even though they may be 80 % democrats , scattered over 50 states i seriously doubt they will have the kind of impact you describe - frank shipp why does n't your rag of a newspaper conduct a poll of americans asking them what they think of germany and mr. schröder ?
you germans can take your smug , self-satisfied views and shove them .
how 's that for candor , heinz ?
if germans had any sense of decency at all , they would shut their mouths before dispensing any advice - let alone moral advice - to george bush or to america .
any " crimes " america has ever committed pale by comparison to what you animals did not once , but twice in the last century .
your leaders kaiser willie and hitler were personally responsible for at least thirty million deaths , and you have the balls to ask germans what they think about my president and my country ? - john huettner violence destroyed our world trade center but that can be rebuilt .
george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .
george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .
we ca n't take it anymore . - lucy cole , alamo , california most americans are oblivious to their reception abroad , and i blame the american media for much of this ignorance .
bush 's record at home is remarkably but undeservedly good . - jeffrey hamill i am an a citizen of the united states and love my country but detest its current " leadership . "
our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .
if iraq truly had nothing to hide , then why not comply ?
should we have waited another 10 years while saddam continued to torture his own people ?
how long is too long ?
george w. bush is the only leader in the world strong enough to draw the line in the sand and face these threats head-on .
it may be years before this is truly understood .
the un is a weak , spineless organization that failed miserably to stop saddam .
jacques chirac is also weak , and could never stand up to terrorists the way mr. bush has .
i 'd rather see us fight terrorists , alone if we have to , on the streets of baghdad instead of being attacked on the streets of boston or elsewhere .
i will proudly vote for president george w. bush on nov .
2nd .
and many here agree with me , and i would prepare for a second bush term now . - steve bush has been a complete disaster internationally and an embarrassment to those of us in the us who long for a return to diplomacy to solve problems .
this country is , i 'm afraid , moving into a very dangerous unilateralism on a wide range of subjects .
this includes our refusal to join the eu and others in the international criminal court and kyoto .
i hate to say it , but i fear we are resorting back to pre-wwii us autonomy , hegemony and unilateralism in our relations with the world .
i think this could be a semi-permanent condition and i do n't know that even electing kerry will solve it .
americans are , unfortunately turning increasingly inward and are not taking criticism and disagreement from other nations and organizations very well .
in fact , they increasingly appear to be fighting back and downright dismissive of allies and others who voice disagreement with our policies .
it appears that being the only military " super-power " in the world is going to our heads .
remember the adage , " absolute power corrupts , absolutely " ! !
it appears to be true ! - trevor steven taylor you need to understand that most americans know that the us is just about the only country in the world that can " go it alone . "
for that reason , we americans do n't care what the world thinks about us or our international policies .
the independent streak of the americans is actually increased when we hear that a large percentage of the germans and french disagrees with something the us is doing , no matter what it is .
as soon as the us does not require energy from foreign sources , we may just resign from the united nations .
according to the polls , that 's the goal of more than half the americans , and those are the ones who support george w. bush .
thank you . - james l. reid , usa i believe george w. bush has hindered the spread of peace throughout the world .
i believe he does not consider that others world-wide have a right to govern their own area and have a clearer view of the big picture .
i also believe he was not taught to " play nice with others " when he was a child .
he has the arrogant , smirk of a bully who was born into privilege and has never had to consider the other person 's rights or feelings . - karen seeger , usa the only opinion that counts will be the election results in november .
the eu public is generally misinformed by a biased media that spews constant anti-bush information .
the net result is an anti-bush eu public . - boyd lawrence , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .
seeing the effects of bush 's foreign policy firsthand should boost kerry with expatriate voters , says dw-world 's marc young .

but the move to berlin has fused what is often billed as the world 's biggest music trade fair with new life .
" it 's not simply moving from one city to another , but rather a real fresh start , " said popkomm 's general manager ralf kleinhenz .
despite cologne 's role as an important media center in germany , the number of visitors to the fair had dropped dramatically in recent years .
opening with a big concert on tuesday night , organizers hope berlin - which has been anointed germany 's music capital - will increase popkomm 's international profile .
there will be 661 exhibitors at the three-day trade fair from 41 different countries .
along with an industry conference , there will be 400 hours of live music at concerts and club events open to the general public .
during the week , german acts like rappers die fantastischen vier and rockers sportfreunde stiller will perform alongside international artists including world-renowned techno djs and veteran gangsta rapper ice-t , who has a new group called the machine .
but as berliners enjoy a few days of top-shelf music , industry insiders will be discussing the still uncertain future of the music business .
the future is digital topping the agenda is how to deal with the rapidly evolving nature of music .
as fewer people buy cds and move their music collections to their home computers , the industry is still grappling with piracy and copyright issues for digital formats like mp3s .
some estimates have put the drop in sales for the german music sector at around 40 percent since 1997 .
most in the industry blame internet file-sharing networks that were modeled on napster .
" what 's changing at the moment is how we deal with music , " kleinhenz said .
" and that raises questions not only of an economic nature , but also cultural and societal questions . "
in germany , one of the top current questions is how best to support local artists .
some are calling for a radio quota for german musicians modeled on france 's system .
there , at least 40 percent of all radio airtime is reserved for french acts .
the initiative has gained the support of some german politicians , including green party parliamentarian antje vollmer .
" we owe it to our cultural identity , " vollmer said , according to dpa news agency .
" it has nothing to do with being overly german .
other countries naturally take care of their own artists . "
vollmer has called for an open parliamentary debate on the matter on wednesday .
not waiting for help many musicians agree more needs to be done to promote german acts , but they are n't waiting for the government or industry to help them out .
eike herwig , the drummer for the punk rock band the donots , said his group makes a special effort to promote up-and-coming bands .
besides setting up a special section highlighting new groups on their web site , the donots are also giving them opening spots on their latest tour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo and alex from the donots at the hurricane open air festival .
-lrb- eike is behind them . -rrb-
" i think it 's important to give german musicians more attention , " herwig told dw-world .
" a lot of the time on german radio the focus is on bands from america and england . "
tim renner from record label motor music backs the idea of supporting local acts , but is leery of a legally mandated quota .
during popkomm the label 's new radio station motorfm will broadcast only german bands and musicians like canadian electro-trash queen peaches , who have a connection to germany .
thinking globally and locally renner used to head up the german division of universal music , but he and the company parted ways amid disagreement over the direction the label was heading .
whereas renner always thought supporting local german musicians would be the best way to approach the domestic market , the head office of the company wanted to focus more on major international acts that could be sold globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim renner " i get mixed feelings when i hear the word quota , " renner told dw-world .
" they 'll tell you there 's not enough good stuff out there .
that 's not true .
they need to promote the cultural diversity , but any quota will mean they 've failed to find a radio concept . "
he said if motorfm gets a permanent frequency to broadcast in berlin the station will continue to support local artists , but it will concentrate on simply playing good music regardless of its origin .
renner is also hoping to pioneer new ways to make new digital technologies a boon instead of a bane for the industry .
he said the station would aim to make every song played available to download legally .
besides an internet portal along the lines of the apple itunes music store , he said he hoped to have a totally mobile business model , including being able to send a sms text message from your phone to purchase the song being played on your car stereo .
" the radio stations could be the retailers of tomorrow , " he said .

dw-world readers this week commented on the race for the white house and president bush 's negative foreign policy record abroad . your point of view is interesting , i lived in europe for eight years and appreciate your points of view ; it 's great to see that the billions of dollars we spent through the marshal plan has produced peaceful differences .
two things you overlook are : only us citizens vote , and the economy , not foreign policy will determine the outcome of the election .
we 've been through years and years of anti-americanism , so what else is new .
polls in other countries mean nothing .
the americans living overseas vote in their particular state so even though they may be 80 % democrats , scattered over 50 states i seriously doubt they will have the kind of impact you describe - frank shipp why does n't your rag of a newspaper conduct a poll of americans asking them what they think of germany and mr. schröder ?
you germans can take your smug , self-satisfied views and shove them .
how 's that for candor , heinz ?
if germans had any sense of decency at all , they would shut their mouths before dispensing any advice - let alone moral advice - to george bush or to america .
any " crimes " america has ever committed pale by comparison to what you animals did not once , but twice in the last century .
your leaders kaiser willie and hitler were personally responsible for at least thirty million deaths , and you have the balls to ask germans what they think about my president and my country ? - john huettner violence destroyed our world trade center but that can be rebuilt .
george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .
george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .
we ca n't take it anymore . - lucy cole , alamo , california most americans are oblivious to their reception abroad , and i blame the american media for much of this ignorance .
bush 's record at home is remarkably but undeservedly good . - jeffrey hamill i am an a citizen of the united states and love my country but detest its current " leadership . "
our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .
if iraq truly had nothing to hide , then why not comply ?
should we have waited another 10 years while saddam continued to torture his own people ?
how long is too long ?
george w. bush is the only leader in the world strong enough to draw the line in the sand and face these threats head-on .
it may be years before this is truly understood .
the un is a weak , spineless organization that failed miserably to stop saddam .
jacques chirac is also weak , and could never stand up to terrorists the way mr. bush has .
i 'd rather see us fight terrorists , alone if we have to , on the streets of baghdad instead of being attacked on the streets of boston or elsewhere .
i will proudly vote for president george w. bush on nov .
2nd .
and many here agree with me , and i would prepare for a second bush term now . - steve bush has been a complete disaster internationally and an embarrassment to those of us in the us who long for a return to diplomacy to solve problems .
this country is , i 'm afraid , moving into a very dangerous unilateralism on a wide range of subjects .
this includes our refusal to join the eu and others in the international criminal court and kyoto .
i hate to say it , but i fear we are resorting back to pre-wwii us autonomy , hegemony and unilateralism in our relations with the world .
i think this could be a semi-permanent condition and i do n't know that even electing kerry will solve it .
americans are , unfortunately turning increasingly inward and are not taking criticism and disagreement from other nations and organizations very well .
in fact , they increasingly appear to be fighting back and downright dismissive of allies and others who voice disagreement with our policies .
it appears that being the only military " super-power " in the world is going to our heads .
remember the adage , " absolute power corrupts , absolutely " ! !
it appears to be true ! - trevor steven taylor you need to understand that most americans know that the us is just about the only country in the world that can " go it alone . "
for that reason , we americans do n't care what the world thinks about us or our international policies .
the independent streak of the americans is actually increased when we hear that a large percentage of the germans and french disagrees with something the us is doing , no matter what it is .
as soon as the us does not require energy from foreign sources , we may just resign from the united nations .
according to the polls , that 's the goal of more than half the americans , and those are the ones who support george w. bush .
thank you . - james l. reid , usa i believe george w. bush has hindered the spread of peace throughout the world .
i believe he does not consider that others world-wide have a right to govern their own area and have a clearer view of the big picture .
i also believe he was not taught to " play nice with others " when he was a child .
he has the arrogant , smirk of a bully who was born into privilege and has never had to consider the other person 's rights or feelings . - karen seeger , usa the only opinion that counts will be the election results in november .
the eu public is generally misinformed by a biased media that spews constant anti-bush information .
the net result is an anti-bush eu public . - boyd lawrence , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .

but the move to berlin has fused what is often billed as the world 's biggest music trade fair with new life .
" it 's not simply moving from one city to another , but rather a real fresh start , " said popkomm 's general manager ralf kleinhenz .
despite cologne 's role as an important media center in germany , the number of visitors to the fair had dropped dramatically in recent years .
opening with a big concert on tuesday night , organizers hope berlin - which has been anointed germany 's music capital - will increase popkomm 's international profile .
there will be 661 exhibitors at the three-day trade fair from 41 different countries .
along with an industry conference , there will be 400 hours of live music at concerts and club events open to the general public .
during the week , german acts like rappers die fantastischen vier and rockers sportfreunde stiller will perform alongside international artists including world-renowned techno djs and veteran gangsta rapper ice-t , who has a new group called the machine .
but as berliners enjoy a few days of top-shelf music , industry insiders will be discussing the still uncertain future of the music business .
the future is digital topping the agenda is how to deal with the rapidly evolving nature of music .
as fewer people buy cds and move their music collections to their home computers , the industry is still grappling with piracy and copyright issues for digital formats like mp3s .
some estimates have put the drop in sales for the german music sector at around 40 percent since 1997 .
most in the industry blame internet file-sharing networks that were modeled on napster .
" what 's changing at the moment is how we deal with music , " kleinhenz said .
" and that raises questions not only of an economic nature , but also cultural and societal questions . "
in germany , one of the top current questions is how best to support local artists .
some are calling for a radio quota for german musicians modeled on france 's system .
there , at least 40 percent of all radio airtime is reserved for french acts .
the initiative has gained the support of some german politicians , including green party parliamentarian antje vollmer .
" we owe it to our cultural identity , " vollmer said , according to dpa news agency .
" it has nothing to do with being overly german .
other countries naturally take care of their own artists . "
vollmer has called for an open parliamentary debate on the matter on wednesday .
not waiting for help many musicians agree more needs to be done to promote german acts , but they are n't waiting for the government or industry to help them out .
eike herwig , the drummer for the punk rock band the donots , said his group makes a special effort to promote up-and-coming bands .
besides setting up a special section highlighting new groups on their web site , the donots are also giving them opening spots on their latest tour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo and alex from the donots at the hurricane open air festival .
-lrb- eike is behind them . -rrb-
" i think it 's important to give german musicians more attention , " herwig told dw-world .
" a lot of the time on german radio the focus is on bands from america and england . "
tim renner from record label motor music backs the idea of supporting local acts , but is leery of a legally mandated quota .
during popkomm the label 's new radio station motorfm will broadcast only german bands and musicians like canadian electro-trash queen peaches , who have a connection to germany .
thinking globally and locally renner used to head up the german division of universal music , but he and the company parted ways amid disagreement over the direction the label was heading .
whereas renner always thought supporting local german musicians would be the best way to approach the domestic market , the head office of the company wanted to focus more on major international acts that could be sold globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim renner " i get mixed feelings when i hear the word quota , " renner told dw-world .
" they 'll tell you there 's not enough good stuff out there .
that 's not true .
they need to promote the cultural diversity , but any quota will mean they 've failed to find a radio concept . "
he said if motorfm gets a permanent frequency to broadcast in berlin the station will continue to support local artists , but it will concentrate on simply playing good music regardless of its origin .
renner is also hoping to pioneer new ways to make new digital technologies a boon instead of a bane for the industry .
he said the station would aim to make every song played available to download legally .
besides an internet portal along the lines of the apple itunes music store , he said he hoped to have a totally mobile business model , including being able to send a sms text message from your phone to purchase the song being played on your car stereo .

it 's all possible at a new internet-based virtual stock market -lrb- vsm -rrb- aimed at predicting who will be among the next nobel prize winners .
the vsm is an economic experiment by the university of frankfurt , to see how well short- and medium-term market developments can be predicted .
the stocks in nobel candidates represent a bet on the outcome of future market situations - the higher the value of the stock , the more probable the market situation is .
the participants in the nobel vsm do n't have to concern themselves with economic models , however .
nor is any real money riding on this particular stock market .
but the most successful investors stand to win dividends in the form of 50 prizes , including an ibm laptop .
kohl stocks suffering internet users have to register to take part in the virtual market .
each participant then receives an initial cash deposit of $ 10,000 -lrb- € 12,300 -rrb- that can be used for buying and selling stocks .
just like a real market , the price of the stocks rises and falls according to supply and demand .

in contrast , demand for shares in top runner pope john paul ii has skyrocketed .
his stock is currently trading at over $ 70 .
trading at the nobel prize market wraps up at 6 p.m. the day before the winners are announced - that will happen on oct .
8 at the earliest .
once the nobel laureates are made known , the stocks are cashed out , with every share in a winner valued at $ 1,000 .
the participant with highest account balance wins the market .
reliable predictors frankfurt university 's project leader for the nobel prize market , bernd skiera , says vsm 's are increasingly establishing themselves as reliable predictors of future events .
their results are frequently just as good or better than comparable predictors such as polls , skiera said .
political stock markets , for example , are used to predict election results in countries such as the united states , germany , canada , the netherlands and austria .
slightly more macabre , perhaps , is the virtual terror stock market , terror xchange , where users buy or sell virtual shares of major international news events they think are likely to occur . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing tragedy in the soccer stadium how fast can a packed soccer stadium be evacuated ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the capital of pop mp3 inventor wants a chat with his stereo german radio quota debate goes live netting the big fish business -pipe- 29.09.2004 can berlin save german pop ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking for the answers to the industry 's woes many in germany 's troubled music industry hope moving the trade fair popkomm from cologne to berlin this year will help the sector redefine itself in an age of plummeting cd sales and surging digital downloads . long suffering from sinking revenues and under threat from emerging technologies such as mp3 and internet file-swapping networks , there are several issues plaguing the music business during the 16th annual popkomm .
but the move to berlin has fused what is often billed as the world 's biggest music trade fair with new life .
" it 's not simply moving from one city to another , but rather a real fresh start , " said popkomm 's general manager ralf kleinhenz .
despite cologne 's role as an important media center in germany , the number of visitors to the fair had dropped dramatically in recent years .
opening with a big concert on tuesday night , organizers hope berlin - which has been anointed germany 's music capital - will increase popkomm 's international profile .
there will be 661 exhibitors at the three-day trade fair from 41 different countries .
along with an industry conference , there will be 400 hours of live music at concerts and club events open to the general public .
during the week , german acts like rappers die fantastischen vier and rockers sportfreunde stiller will perform alongside international artists including world-renowned techno djs and veteran gangsta rapper ice-t , who has a new group called the machine .
but as berliners enjoy a few days of top-shelf music , industry insiders will be discussing the still uncertain future of the music business .
the future is digital topping the agenda is how to deal with the rapidly evolving nature of music .
as fewer people buy cds and move their music collections to their home computers , the industry is still grappling with piracy and copyright issues for digital formats like mp3s .
some estimates have put the drop in sales for the german music sector at around 40 percent since 1997 .
most in the industry blame internet file-sharing networks that were modeled on napster .
" what 's changing at the moment is how we deal with music , " kleinhenz said .
" and that raises questions not only of an economic nature , but also cultural and societal questions . "
in germany , one of the top current questions is how best to support local artists .
some are calling for a radio quota for german musicians modeled on france 's system .
there , at least 40 percent of all radio airtime is reserved for french acts .
the initiative has gained the support of some german politicians , including green party parliamentarian antje vollmer .
" we owe it to our cultural identity , " vollmer said , according to dpa news agency .
" it has nothing to do with being overly german .
other countries naturally take care of their own artists . "
vollmer has called for an open parliamentary debate on the matter on wednesday .
not waiting for help many musicians agree more needs to be done to promote german acts , but they are n't waiting for the government or industry to help them out .
eike herwig , the drummer for the punk rock band the donots , said his group makes a special effort to promote up-and-coming bands .
besides setting up a special section highlighting new groups on their web site , the donots are also giving them opening spots on their latest tour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo and alex from the donots at the hurricane open air festival .
-lrb- eike is behind them . -rrb-
" i think it 's important to give german musicians more attention , " herwig told dw-world .
" a lot of the time on german radio the focus is on bands from america and england . "
tim renner from record label motor music backs the idea of supporting local acts , but is leery of a legally mandated quota .
during popkomm the label 's new radio station motorfm will broadcast only german bands and musicians like canadian electro-trash queen peaches , who have a connection to germany .
thinking globally and locally renner used to head up the german division of universal music , but he and the company parted ways amid disagreement over the direction the label was heading .
whereas renner always thought supporting local german musicians would be the best way to approach the domestic market , the head office of the company wanted to focus more on major international acts that could be sold globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim renner " i get mixed feelings when i hear the word quota , " renner told dw-world .
" they 'll tell you there 's not enough good stuff out there .
that 's not true .
they need to promote the cultural diversity , but any quota will mean they 've failed to find a radio concept . "
he said if motorfm gets a permanent frequency to broadcast in berlin the station will continue to support local artists , but it will concentrate on simply playing good music regardless of its origin .
renner is also hoping to pioneer new ways to make new digital technologies a boon instead of a bane for the industry .
he said the station would aim to make every song played available to download legally .
besides an internet portal along the lines of the apple itunes music store , he said he hoped to have a totally mobile business model , including being able to send a sms text message from your phone to purchase the song being played on your car stereo .
" the radio stations could be the retailers of tomorrow , " he said .

the healing power of storytelling the unknown guest of honor frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.09.2004 book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tahar ben jelloun is one of the few well-known arab authors in europe many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all . of the around 120,000 foreign fiction titles translated into german , only about 500 come from the arab world .
it 's a telling statement on the lack of information in the west when it comes to the diversity of the literary landscape in the arab countries . it 's usually literary heavyweights such as egyptian author and nobel prize winner naguib mahfouz or france-based moroccan writer tahar ben jelloun who enjoy relative popularity in europe . but that might be about to change as the spotlight falls on the arab league at this year 's frankfurt book fair .
starting october 6 , visitors to the world 's largest book fair will get the chance to meet and get acquainted with the works of around 200 authors and artists from 17 countries of the 22-member arab league . arab league program under fire but , even as the arab league readies itself for the chance to showcase its literary talent on a western platform , it has been dogged by criticism of its program . a few days ago , moroccan culture minister and poet muhammad al-ashari said he found it hard to understand that arabs , in 22 very diverse nations , were invited to the fair as a whole entity .
morocco , along with kuwait , libya , algeria and iraq , is not participating in the official program of the arab league at the frankfurt book fair . further criticism centers on the disproportionately large share of egyptian authors among the invited guests as well as the lack of initiative to involve authors in exile . the arab league 's program , which it unveiled at a press conference in frankfurt in june , is comprehensive , to say the least : poetry and prose readings , music , film and folkloristic events , discussion forums on globalization , human rights and reform in the arab world . among the invited authors are prominent names in literary circles such as the poets adonis and mahmud darwish , the francophone authors asia djebar and amin maalouf , but also names largely unknown in germany , such as the saudi writers raja alim and abduh khal . censorship still taboo in addition to the exhaustive program , the arab organizers at the frankfurt book fair spoke glowingly of the arab world wanting to initiate an open dialogue with the west as well as discuss controversial questions .
at the same time , the organizers sought to play down or completely avoid grave problems such as the woes of the arab book market and publishing industry . the arab organizers ' unwillingness to discuss pressing issues was apparent when it came to the ubiquitous censorship in the arab world . the director of the muscat book fair in oman , muhammad ali hassan , explained why censorship was necessary .
" our societies have their specialties and traditions that need to be respected , " hassan said .
" everything that attacks arab society or creates turbulence should be forbidden .
our societies still need protection , " he told deutsche welle . that seems to be the dominating opinion among arab book fair circles .
but censorship , which is one of the largest problems within the arab world , is not even mentioned in the official part of the arab league 's frankfurt fair program .
ibrahim al-muallim , president of the arab publishing association , instead claimed that arab publishers have made great strides in the fight against censorship . khalid qubaia , a libyan publisher and official at the arab publishing association , made no bones about the fact that his organization had clear views on censorship . " different benchmarks on censorship prevail in every arab country , " qubaia said .
" the arab publishers ' association agrees with two reasons for censorship : when a book compromises the security of a nation or when it does n't reflect ideas of morality . " lively discussions guaranteed but that 's not a view jabir asfur , director of the egyptian high council for culture , agreed with .
in the arabic daily al-hayat , asfur recently praised german oriental studies and efforts to translate arab literature into german . at the same time asfur was also self-critical .
he wrote that neither individual arab states nor the arab league nor the arab publishers ' association had ever set up initiatives to support the translation of arabic literature into other languages . but , this self-criticism comes late .
on the one hand arab intellectuals have been demanding for years to set up a fund for exactly that purpose .
on the other , uncertainty still surrounds a list with arab books that are meant to be translated into german and english on the occasion of the arab league 's guest performance at the frankfurt book fair . one thing is clear though : suspense and heated discussion are guaranteed this year at the frankfurt book fair . mona naggar -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all . of the around 120,000 foreign fiction titles translated into german , only about 500 come from the arab world .
it 's a telling statement on the lack of information in the west when it comes to the diversity of the literary landscape in the arab countries . it 's usually literary heavyweights such as egyptian author and nobel prize winner naguib mahfouz or france-based moroccan writer tahar ben jelloun who enjoy relative popularity in europe . but that might be about to change as the spotlight falls on the arab league at this year 's frankfurt book fair .
starting october 6 , visitors to the world 's largest book fair will get the chance to meet and get acquainted with the works of around 200 authors and artists from 17 countries of the 22-member arab league . arab league program under fire but , even as the arab league readies itself for the chance to showcase its literary talent on a western platform , it has been dogged by criticism of its program . a few days ago , moroccan culture minister and poet muhammad al-ashari said he found it hard to understand that arabs , in 22 very diverse nations , were invited to the fair as a whole entity .
morocco , along with kuwait , libya , algeria and iraq , is not participating in the official program of the arab league at the frankfurt book fair . further criticism centers on the disproportionately large share of egyptian authors among the invited guests as well as the lack of initiative to involve authors in exile . the arab league 's program , which it unveiled at a press conference in frankfurt in june , is comprehensive , to say the least : poetry and prose readings , music , film and folkloristic events , discussion forums on globalization , human rights and reform in the arab world . among the invited authors are prominent names in literary circles such as the poets adonis and mahmud darwish , the francophone authors asia djebar and amin maalouf , but also names largely unknown in germany , such as the saudi writers raja alim and abduh khal . censorship still taboo in addition to the exhaustive program , the arab organizers at the frankfurt book fair spoke glowingly of the arab world wanting to initiate an open dialogue with the west as well as discuss controversial questions .
at the same time , the organizers sought to play down or completely avoid grave problems such as the woes of the arab book market and publishing industry . the arab organizers ' unwillingness to discuss pressing issues was apparent when it came to the ubiquitous censorship in the arab world . the director of the muscat book fair in oman , muhammad ali hassan , explained why censorship was necessary .
" our societies have their specialties and traditions that need to be respected , " hassan said .
" everything that attacks arab society or creates turbulence should be forbidden .
our societies still need protection , " he told deutsche welle . that seems to be the dominating opinion among arab book fair circles .
but censorship , which is one of the largest problems within the arab world , is not even mentioned in the official part of the arab league 's frankfurt fair program .
ibrahim al-muallim , president of the arab publishing association , instead claimed that arab publishers have made great strides in the fight against censorship . khalid qubaia , a libyan publisher and official at the arab publishing association , made no bones about the fact that his organization had clear views on censorship . " different benchmarks on censorship prevail in every arab country , " qubaia said .
" the arab publishers ' association agrees with two reasons for censorship : when a book compromises the security of a nation or when it does n't reflect ideas of morality . " lively discussions guaranteed but that 's not a view jabir asfur , director of the egyptian high council for culture , agreed with .
in the arabic daily al-hayat , asfur recently praised german oriental studies and efforts to translate arab literature into german . at the same time asfur was also self-critical .
he wrote that neither individual arab states nor the arab league nor the arab publishers ' association had ever set up initiatives to support the translation of arabic literature into other languages . but , this self-criticism comes late .
on the one hand arab intellectuals have been demanding for years to set up a fund for exactly that purpose .
on the other , uncertainty still surrounds a list with arab books that are meant to be translated into german and english on the occasion of the arab league 's guest performance at the frankfurt book fair . one thing is clear though : suspense and heated discussion are guaranteed this year at the frankfurt book fair . mona naggar -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

while pawprints are n't required for identification , photos are optional . previously , animal owners were expected to carry their pet 's immunization record when they travelled .
animals also were given a tattoo in their ear .
while the old id measures will be accepted during the transition phase , after 2011 , all animals will need to have a microchip the size of a grain of rice injected which contains a machine-readable number to identify the animal . " total nonsense , " scoffed professor hans-joachim hackbarth of the veterinary school in hanover upon hearing of the new regulations .
he said he ca n't remember the last time he was required to show his own passport when crossing an eu border .
the effort pet owners have to make for their animals to meet eu standards is in no relation to the usefulness of the information , hackbarth said . home is best germany 's national association of veterinarians showed understanding for the eu 's desire to unify pet identification procedures .
after all , countries such as ireland , britain and sweden are rabies-free , and would like to stay that way . but the german society for the protection of animals says the best advice for pet owners is to leave their furry friends at home when they travel . and so that owners do n't have to resort to kennels , they 've even set up a hotline for pet " foster families .

dw-world readers this week commented on the race for the white house and president bush 's negative foreign policy record abroad . your point of view is interesting , i lived in europe for eight years and appreciate your points of view ; it 's great to see that the billions of dollars we spent through the marshal plan has produced peaceful differences .
two things you overlook are : only us citizens vote , and the economy , not foreign policy will determine the outcome of the election .
we 've been through years and years of anti-americanism , so what else is new .
polls in other countries mean nothing .
the americans living overseas vote in their particular state so even though they may be 80 % democrats , scattered over 50 states i seriously doubt they will have the kind of impact you describe - frank shipp why does n't your rag of a newspaper conduct a poll of americans asking them what they think of germany and mr. schröder ?
you germans can take your smug , self-satisfied views and shove them .
how 's that for candor , heinz ?
if germans had any sense of decency at all , they would shut their mouths before dispensing any advice - let alone moral advice - to george bush or to america .
any " crimes " america has ever committed pale by comparison to what you animals did not once , but twice in the last century .
your leaders kaiser willie and hitler were personally responsible for at least thirty million deaths , and you have the balls to ask germans what they think about my president and my country ? - john huettner violence destroyed our world trade center but that can be rebuilt .
george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .
george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .
we ca n't take it anymore . - lucy cole , alamo , california most americans are oblivious to their reception abroad , and i blame the american media for much of this ignorance .
bush 's record at home is remarkably but undeservedly good . - jeffrey hamill i am an a citizen of the united states and love my country but detest its current " leadership . "
our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .
if iraq truly had nothing to hide , then why not comply ?
should we have waited another 10 years while saddam continued to torture his own people ?
how long is too long ?
george w. bush is the only leader in the world strong enough to draw the line in the sand and face these threats head-on .
it may be years before this is truly understood .
the un is a weak , spineless organization that failed miserably to stop saddam .
jacques chirac is also weak , and could never stand up to terrorists the way mr. bush has .
i 'd rather see us fight terrorists , alone if we have to , on the streets of baghdad instead of being attacked on the streets of boston or elsewhere .
i will proudly vote for president george w. bush on nov .
2nd .
and many here agree with me , and i would prepare for a second bush term now . - steve bush has been a complete disaster internationally and an embarrassment to those of us in the us who long for a return to diplomacy to solve problems .
this country is , i 'm afraid , moving into a very dangerous unilateralism on a wide range of subjects .
this includes our refusal to join the eu and others in the international criminal court and kyoto .
i hate to say it , but i fear we are resorting back to pre-wwii us autonomy , hegemony and unilateralism in our relations with the world .
i think this could be a semi-permanent condition and i do n't know that even electing kerry will solve it .
americans are , unfortunately turning increasingly inward and are not taking criticism and disagreement from other nations and organizations very well .
in fact , they increasingly appear to be fighting back and downright dismissive of allies and others who voice disagreement with our policies .
it appears that being the only military " super-power " in the world is going to our heads .
remember the adage , " absolute power corrupts , absolutely " ! !
it appears to be true ! - trevor steven taylor you need to understand that most americans know that the us is just about the only country in the world that can " go it alone . "
for that reason , we americans do n't care what the world thinks about us or our international policies .
the independent streak of the americans is actually increased when we hear that a large percentage of the germans and french disagrees with something the us is doing , no matter what it is .
as soon as the us does not require energy from foreign sources , we may just resign from the united nations .
according to the polls , that 's the goal of more than half the americans , and those are the ones who support george w. bush .
thank you . - james l. reid , usa i believe george w. bush has hindered the spread of peace throughout the world .
i believe he does not consider that others world-wide have a right to govern their own area and have a clearer view of the big picture .
i also believe he was not taught to " play nice with others " when he was a child .
he has the arrogant , smirk of a bully who was born into privilege and has never had to consider the other person 's rights or feelings . - karen seeger , usa the only opinion that counts will be the election results in november .
the eu public is generally misinformed by a biased media that spews constant anti-bush information .
the net result is an anti-bush eu public . - boyd lawrence , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .

" we will mobilize the workforce so that these stores stay a part of karstadt , " franziska wiethold , a member of verdi 's national executive board , told the berliner zeitung .
she also said the reorganization would end up putting karstadt 's future in danger rather than stabilizing it .
the sale of small and medium sized stores was one part of the € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.72 billion -rrb- restructuring plan the german retail giant announced tuesday .

while pawprints are n't required for identification , photos are optional . previously , animal owners were expected to carry their pet 's immunization record when they travelled .
animals also were given a tattoo in their ear .
while the old id measures will be accepted during the transition phase , after 2011 , all animals will need to have a microchip the size of a grain of rice injected which contains a machine-readable number to identify the animal . " total nonsense , " scoffed professor hans-joachim hackbarth of the veterinary school in hanover upon hearing of the new regulations .
he said he ca n't remember the last time he was required to show his own passport when crossing an eu border .
the effort pet owners have to make for their animals to meet eu standards is in no relation to the usefulness of the information , hackbarth said . home is best germany 's national association of veterinarians showed understanding for the eu 's desire to unify pet identification procedures .
after all , countries such as ireland , britain and sweden are rabies-free , and would like to stay that way . but the german society for the protection of animals says the best advice for pet owners is to leave their furry friends at home when they travel . and so that owners do n't have to resort to kennels , they 've even set up a hotline for pet " foster families .

italy is already cooperating with libya and says such a center should be set up there . italy 's interior minister giuseppe pisanu is convinced the deal his government struck with libya to curb illegal immigration is starting to bear fruit .
he recently traveled to tripoli to meet with his libyan counterpart and discuss the plan further .
following the meeting , he said the results so far are encouraging .
the italian government has been increasingly concerned with the continuous arrivals of illegal immigrants .
holding centers in sicily and on the island of lampedusa have suffered the brunt of the problem and reached bursting point this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat carrying some of the 79 would-be immigrants reaches lampedusa .

it also said asylum seekers must be given adequate protection .
as part of the agreement , the italian government is planning to send 150 police officers to libya to help train their libyan counterparts .
the training exercises are expected to last one month and are likely to start in november . in addition , tripoli will be purchasing military equipment and vehicles from italy .
pisanu said this will be possible following the european union 's recent decision to lift its embargo on the sale of military equipment to libya . dropping embargo will aid libyan efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian soldiers help a weak and sick refugee from his boat in lampedusa harbor .

karstadtquelle has been hemorrhaging money as german consumers continue to show reluctance in spending during the country 's gradual emergence from three years of economic stagnation .
while exports within a stronger world economy have begun to drive an upturn in fortunes of late , germany 's domestic demand and the consumer environment have remained stagnant , with unemployment above 10 percent and the government moving to trim social programs .
in addition to slow retail sales , essen-based karstadtquelle 's performance has been hit recently by losses at the thomas cook tourism company , which it co-owns with german airline lufthansa .
retail sales expected to drop the company also released figures that showed the state of the concern .
karstadtquelle is expected to post a pre-tax loss of € 1.3 billion this year and forecasts a drop in retail sales of between 4.5 and 5 percent .
the company also revealed that it would not be paying a dividend this year or the next .
in august , the company reported a second quarter net loss of € 188 million -lrb- $ 231 million -rrb- on slumping retail sales .
tuesday 's statement did not mention any imminent job cuts related to the restructuring , but karstadtquelle said in july that it planned to cut about 4,000 jobs from its work force of 47,000 full- and part-time employees by the end of 2006 karstadtquelle shares , which dropped by more than 6 percent monday at € 13.38 a share , were up 5.7 percent at € 14.14 by noon on the frankfurt stock exchange . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karstadtquelle to cut more jobs essen-based retailer karstadtquelle will cut an additional 4,000 jobs over the next two years , the company said in a statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the capital of pop mp3 inventor wants a chat with his stereo german radio quota debate goes live netting the big fish business -pipe- 29.09.2004 can berlin save german pop ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking for the answers to the industry 's woes many in germany 's troubled music industry hope moving the trade fair popkomm from cologne to berlin this year will help the sector redefine itself in an age of plummeting cd sales and surging digital downloads . long suffering from sinking revenues and under threat from emerging technologies such as mp3 and internet file-swapping networks , there are several issues plaguing the music business during the 16th annual popkomm .
but the move to berlin has fused what is often billed as the world 's biggest music trade fair with new life .
" it 's not simply moving from one city to another , but rather a real fresh start , " said popkomm 's general manager ralf kleinhenz .
despite cologne 's role as an important media center in germany , the number of visitors to the fair had dropped dramatically in recent years .
opening with a big concert on tuesday night , organizers hope berlin - which has been anointed germany 's music capital - will increase popkomm 's international profile .
there will be 661 exhibitors at the three-day trade fair from 41 different countries .
along with an industry conference , there will be 400 hours of live music at concerts and club events open to the general public .
during the week , german acts like rappers die fantastischen vier and rockers sportfreunde stiller will perform alongside international artists including world-renowned techno djs and veteran gangsta rapper ice-t , who has a new group called the machine .
but as berliners enjoy a few days of top-shelf music , industry insiders will be discussing the still uncertain future of the music business .
the future is digital topping the agenda is how to deal with the rapidly evolving nature of music .
as fewer people buy cds and move their music collections to their home computers , the industry is still grappling with piracy and copyright issues for digital formats like mp3s .
some estimates have put the drop in sales for the german music sector at around 40 percent since 1997 .
most in the industry blame internet file-sharing networks that were modeled on napster .
" what 's changing at the moment is how we deal with music , " kleinhenz said .
" and that raises questions not only of an economic nature , but also cultural and societal questions . "
in germany , one of the top current questions is how best to support local artists .
some are calling for a radio quota for german musicians modeled on france 's system .
there , at least 40 percent of all radio airtime is reserved for french acts .
the initiative has gained the support of some german politicians , including green party parliamentarian antje vollmer .
" we owe it to our cultural identity , " vollmer said , according to dpa news agency .
" it has nothing to do with being overly german .
other countries naturally take care of their own artists . "
vollmer has called for an open parliamentary debate on the matter on wednesday .
not waiting for help many musicians agree more needs to be done to promote german acts , but they are n't waiting for the government or industry to help them out .
eike herwig , the drummer for the punk rock band the donots , said his group makes a special effort to promote up-and-coming bands .
besides setting up a special section highlighting new groups on their web site , the donots are also giving them opening spots on their latest tour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo and alex from the donots at the hurricane open air festival .
-lrb- eike is behind them . -rrb-
" i think it 's important to give german musicians more attention , " herwig told dw-world .
" a lot of the time on german radio the focus is on bands from america and england . "
tim renner from record label motor music backs the idea of supporting local acts , but is leery of a legally mandated quota .
during popkomm the label 's new radio station motorfm will broadcast only german bands and musicians like canadian electro-trash queen peaches , who have a connection to germany .
thinking globally and locally renner used to head up the german division of universal music , but he and the company parted ways amid disagreement over the direction the label was heading .
whereas renner always thought supporting local german musicians would be the best way to approach the domestic market , the head office of the company wanted to focus more on major international acts that could be sold globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim renner " i get mixed feelings when i hear the word quota , " renner told dw-world .
" they 'll tell you there 's not enough good stuff out there .
that 's not true .
they need to promote the cultural diversity , but any quota will mean they 've failed to find a radio concept . "
he said if motorfm gets a permanent frequency to broadcast in berlin the station will continue to support local artists , but it will concentrate on simply playing good music regardless of its origin .
renner is also hoping to pioneer new ways to make new digital technologies a boon instead of a bane for the industry .
he said the station would aim to make every song played available to download legally .
besides an internet portal along the lines of the apple itunes music store , he said he hoped to have a totally mobile business model , including being able to send a sms text message from your phone to purchase the song being played on your car stereo .
" the radio stations could be the retailers of tomorrow , " he said .

while political critics in schily 's social democratic party are waiting to hear what he has to say when he presents the proposal to a parliamentary committee on wednesday , members of junior collation party , the greens , are n't wasting any time voicing their opposition to the plan .
" there has to be a different answer than schily 's , " green party leader katrin göring-eckardt told the newspaper .
her party wants an enforceable , individual asylum law and said in a report that schily 's plan is impractical and not in accordance with german law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german minister 's plan calls for dealing with refugees before they reach europe 's shores human rights organizations are also against the minister 's plan which calls for the establishment of centers to evaluate petitions for would-be africa refugees before they set off for europe .
" the idea of safe third states -lrb- in africa -rrb- would make it nearly impossible for refugees to receive asylum in europe , " wolfgang grenz of amnesty international said .
" it contradicts the fundament of international refugee laws . "
a unified european asylum system will be high on the agenda when the eu 's 25 interior ministers meet in the netherlands on thursday .
there is still debate about whether the eu should set up centers in africa to process immigrants and refugees .
in italy , one of the countries most heavily targeted by illegal immigrants , the government has already begun bilaterial negotiations with libya about such a center .
the eu 's interior ministers will also discuss how europe can improve cooperation with the outside countries that could be involved in a shared eu asylum and immigration policy as well as the fight on terror . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu looks to africa for refugee solution eu justice and interior ministers are expected to discuss plans for an eu asylum center in africa at a meeting this week .

the paper said that although the machine guns usually on the vehicles would be taken off , they surely would n't be used to transport the baghdad football team .
instead they would carry heavily armed people through territory endangered by explosive traps and snipers .
the " fuchs , " as the vehicles are called , is war material , delivered by germany to a war area and german politicians will have to ask themselves in future what use of german weapons is desired in which contexts , the paper wrote .
recalling that he won the 2002 election with his anti-war stance , the offenburger tageblatt newspaper said chancellor schröder has thrown his iraq policy overboard .
the supply of the vehicles is direct support of the allied troops , the paper wrote , and hence a direct intervention in the iraq war ; schröder broke his word .
the badische zeitung of freiburg wrote that regardless of all criticism of the war , schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer agree that the west must not fail in iraq , because it would be a catastrophe if the country were to descend into despotism , anarchy or religious fanaticism .
the armored vehicles are to ease , at least temporarily , the pressure on germany to get more involved , the paper opined .
the main-echo newspaper saw the british prime minister marshalling his rank and file behind him because a third election win is more important to them than moral debates .
the discipline in the campaigning ahead would ensure an end to all speculation about treasurer gordon brown replacing prime minister tony blair .
it ’ s an altogether different matter , though whether the british public will continue to accept a prime minister who can ’ t bring himself to say sorry for his iraq policy , the paper said .
the badisches tagblatt of baden-baden noted that blair played on his strength and his personality , which brought him to power triumphantly in 1997 .
hollow-cheeked , passionately and very openly , he admitted personal mistakes , including that he believed claims about iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
blair appeared to be resigned to his political fate being linked to developments in iraq , the paper wrote .
all bad news from there falls back on him and the ratings of his party , it concluded .
the financial times deutschland found blair focusing on the need for education , health care and pension reforms to distract attention from iraq .
despite anger over iraq , the paper still saw a small majority for blair 's labor party in most polls and predicted it would win . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

they say putin is using the fight against terror to clamp down on democracy . the protest letter , delivered to us president george w. bush , as well as other government leaders in nato and the european union , accuses putin of turning back to authoritarian rule .
its 115 signatories include prominent politicians such as former czech president vaclav havel , former swedish prime minister carl bildt , and us senators john mccain and joseph r. biden . the most prominent german politicians to sign the letter are green party chief reinhard bütikofer , and the foreign policy expert of the christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , friedbert pflüger .
no politicians from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- signed it . democracy in name only ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian solders with rifles outside the school in beslan where over 300 students and adults were held hostage by chechen attackers the letter expresses concern that putin is using terrorist attacks by chechen separatists , including the recent school hostage drama in beslan , as a pretext for extending his control over political life in russia . " we are deeply concerned that these tragic events are being used to further undermine democracy in russia , " said the letter , which was published in full in the financial times deutschland .
" russia 's democratic institutions have always been weak and fragile .
since becoming president in january 2000 , vladimir putin has made them even weaker . " the letter calls on western countries to place themselves " unambiguously on the side of democratic forces in russia . " this week , putin sent a draft law to parliament that will give him the right to nominate regional governors .
he also introduced a draft resolution that would create a new blacklist of terrorist suspects subject to extradition .
both plans have raised concern in the west . putin faces little opposition in the russian parliament , as his united russia party holds more than two-thirds of the seats .
criticism of putin in the russian media is rare , as most independent media organizations have been shut down under his rule . breaking the silence until now , western leaders have been reserved in their criticism , with barely a word being uttered by the eu or the us government to protest human rights violations in chechnya . germany has taken pains to cultivate close ties with russia .
on his last visit there , schröder emphasized the friendly nature of his relationship with putin .
the two leaders presented a united front on the most important questions , including putin 's controversial handling of the chechnya conflict . russia 's un ambassador , andrey denisov , said he took the criticism in the letter seriously , but added that it was important that there be enough " flexibility " in russia 's democracy to allow it to fight terrorism . " yes , we have to take seriously such opinions because they are being expressed by such distinguished persons , " denisov said .

but the move to berlin has fused what is often billed as the world 's biggest music trade fair with new life .
" it 's not simply moving from one city to another , but rather a real fresh start , " said popkomm 's general manager ralf kleinhenz .
despite cologne 's role as an important media center in germany , the number of visitors to the fair had dropped dramatically in recent years .
opening with a big concert on tuesday night , organizers hope berlin - which has been anointed germany 's music capital - will increase popkomm 's international profile .
there will be 661 exhibitors at the three-day trade fair from 41 different countries .
along with an industry conference , there will be 400 hours of live music at concerts and club events open to the general public .
during the week , german acts like rappers die fantastischen vier and rockers sportfreunde stiller will perform alongside international artists including world-renowned techno djs and veteran gangsta rapper ice-t , who has a new group called the machine .

the future is digital topping the agenda is how to deal with the rapidly evolving nature of music .
as fewer people buy cds and move their music collections to their home computers , the industry is still grappling with piracy and copyright issues for digital formats like mp3s .
some estimates have put the drop in sales for the german music sector at around 40 percent since 1997 .
most in the industry blame internet file-sharing networks that were modeled on napster .
" what 's changing at the moment is how we deal with music , " kleinhenz said .
" and that raises questions not only of an economic nature , but also cultural and societal questions . "
in germany , one of the top current questions is how best to support local artists .
some are calling for a radio quota for german musicians modeled on france 's system .
there , at least 40 percent of all radio airtime is reserved for french acts .
the initiative has gained the support of some german politicians , including green party parliamentarian antje vollmer .
" we owe it to our cultural identity , " vollmer said , according to dpa news agency .
" it has nothing to do with being overly german .
other countries naturally take care of their own artists . "
vollmer has called for an open parliamentary debate on the matter on wednesday .
not waiting for help many musicians agree more needs to be done to promote german acts , but they are n't waiting for the government or industry to help them out .
eike herwig , the drummer for the punk rock band the donots , said his group makes a special effort to promote up-and-coming bands .

their results are frequently just as good or better than comparable predictors such as polls , skiera said .
political stock markets , for example , are used to predict election results in countries such as the united states , germany , canada , the netherlands and austria .
slightly more macabre , perhaps , is the virtual terror stock market , terror xchange , where users buy or sell virtual shares of major international news events they think are likely to occur . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing tragedy in the soccer stadium how fast can a packed soccer stadium be evacuated ?

but the move to berlin has fused what is often billed as the world 's biggest music trade fair with new life .
" it 's not simply moving from one city to another , but rather a real fresh start , " said popkomm 's general manager ralf kleinhenz .
despite cologne 's role as an important media center in germany , the number of visitors to the fair had dropped dramatically in recent years .
opening with a big concert on tuesday night , organizers hope berlin - which has been anointed germany 's music capital - will increase popkomm 's international profile .
there will be 661 exhibitors at the three-day trade fair from 41 different countries .
along with an industry conference , there will be 400 hours of live music at concerts and club events open to the general public .
during the week , german acts like rappers die fantastischen vier and rockers sportfreunde stiller will perform alongside international artists including world-renowned techno djs and veteran gangsta rapper ice-t , who has a new group called the machine .
but as berliners enjoy a few days of top-shelf music , industry insiders will be discussing the still uncertain future of the music business .
the future is digital topping the agenda is how to deal with the rapidly evolving nature of music .
as fewer people buy cds and move their music collections to their home computers , the industry is still grappling with piracy and copyright issues for digital formats like mp3s .
some estimates have put the drop in sales for the german music sector at around 40 percent since 1997 .
most in the industry blame internet file-sharing networks that were modeled on napster .
" what 's changing at the moment is how we deal with music , " kleinhenz said .
" and that raises questions not only of an economic nature , but also cultural and societal questions . "
in germany , one of the top current questions is how best to support local artists .
some are calling for a radio quota for german musicians modeled on france 's system .
there , at least 40 percent of all radio airtime is reserved for french acts .
the initiative has gained the support of some german politicians , including green party parliamentarian antje vollmer .
" we owe it to our cultural identity , " vollmer said , according to dpa news agency .
" it has nothing to do with being overly german .
other countries naturally take care of their own artists . "
vollmer has called for an open parliamentary debate on the matter on wednesday .
not waiting for help many musicians agree more needs to be done to promote german acts , but they are n't waiting for the government or industry to help them out .
eike herwig , the drummer for the punk rock band the donots , said his group makes a special effort to promote up-and-coming bands .
besides setting up a special section highlighting new groups on their web site , the donots are also giving them opening spots on their latest tour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo and alex from the donots at the hurricane open air festival .
-lrb- eike is behind them . -rrb-
" i think it 's important to give german musicians more attention , " herwig told dw-world .
" a lot of the time on german radio the focus is on bands from america and england . "
tim renner from record label motor music backs the idea of supporting local acts , but is leery of a legally mandated quota .
during popkomm the label 's new radio station motorfm will broadcast only german bands and musicians like canadian electro-trash queen peaches , who have a connection to germany .
thinking globally and locally renner used to head up the german division of universal music , but he and the company parted ways amid disagreement over the direction the label was heading .
whereas renner always thought supporting local german musicians would be the best way to approach the domestic market , the head office of the company wanted to focus more on major international acts that could be sold globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim renner " i get mixed feelings when i hear the word quota , " renner told dw-world .
" they 'll tell you there 's not enough good stuff out there .
that 's not true .
they need to promote the cultural diversity , but any quota will mean they 've failed to find a radio concept . "
he said if motorfm gets a permanent frequency to broadcast in berlin the station will continue to support local artists , but it will concentrate on simply playing good music regardless of its origin .
renner is also hoping to pioneer new ways to make new digital technologies a boon instead of a bane for the industry .
he said the station would aim to make every song played available to download legally .
besides an internet portal along the lines of the apple itunes music store , he said he hoped to have a totally mobile business model , including being able to send a sms text message from your phone to purchase the song being played on your car stereo .
" the radio stations could be the retailers of tomorrow , " he said .

italy is already cooperating with libya and says such a center should be set up there . italy 's interior minister giuseppe pisanu is convinced the deal his government struck with libya to curb illegal immigration is starting to bear fruit .
he recently traveled to tripoli to meet with his libyan counterpart and discuss the plan further .
following the meeting , he said the results so far are encouraging .
the italian government has been increasingly concerned with the continuous arrivals of illegal immigrants .
holding centers in sicily and on the island of lampedusa have suffered the brunt of the problem and reached bursting point this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat carrying some of the 79 would-be immigrants reaches lampedusa .
pisanu said a proposal to create asylum camps in libya to prevent illegal immigrants from reaching italian shores is moving forward after the italy-libya immigration deal was agreed in august between italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and libyan leader moammar ghadafi . concerns about libya 's human rights record the idea , originally proposed by britain , was revived by italy and germany this summer and is expected to be discussed by eu justice and interior ministers this week . amnesty international has already voiced its concern citing libya 's human rights record .
it also said asylum seekers must be given adequate protection .
as part of the agreement , the italian government is planning to send 150 police officers to libya to help train their libyan counterparts .
the training exercises are expected to last one month and are likely to start in november . in addition , tripoli will be purchasing military equipment and vehicles from italy .
pisanu said this will be possible following the european union 's recent decision to lift its embargo on the sale of military equipment to libya . dropping embargo will aid libyan efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian soldiers help a weak and sick refugee from his boat in lampedusa harbor .

" we will mobilize the workforce so that these stores stay a part of karstadt , " franziska wiethold , a member of verdi 's national executive board , told the berliner zeitung .
she also said the reorganization would end up putting karstadt 's future in danger rather than stabilizing it .
the sale of small and medium sized stores was one part of the € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.72 billion -rrb- restructuring plan the german retail giant announced tuesday .
additionally , the company proposed a € 500 million capital increase and cuts in social programs and vacation for employees .
" the core of the program is the refocusing of the group on its strengths and core competencies , " the company said in a statement .
" the management plans , on the basis of the reorientation , to achieve markedly positive earnings as early as the 2005 fiscal year . "
the company will also sell its 82 percent stake in a joint venture with coffeehouse chain starbucks , in addition to parting with its specialist runners point , golf house , sinnleffers and wehmeyer outlets in an effort to concentrate on its core retail activities .
the company 's core retail business portfolio is worth around € 4.5 billion in turnover while those non-core activities set to be abandoned are worth € 700 million in turnover .
" these steps are inevitable and also overdue , " chief executive christoph achenbach told a news conference in the western city of essen .
trade unions criticize plans the company 's plan has been criticized by the verdi service workers union , who called the closing of department stores avoidable .
the restructuring " endangers the jobs of thousands of people , and above all does not point to a solid future in the department store area , " a union statement said .
karstadtquelle has been hemorrhaging money as german consumers continue to show reluctance in spending during the country 's gradual emergence from three years of economic stagnation .
while exports within a stronger world economy have begun to drive an upturn in fortunes of late , germany 's domestic demand and the consumer environment have remained stagnant , with unemployment above 10 percent and the government moving to trim social programs .
in addition to slow retail sales , essen-based karstadtquelle 's performance has been hit recently by losses at the thomas cook tourism company , which it co-owns with german airline lufthansa .
retail sales expected to drop the company also released figures that showed the state of the concern .
karstadtquelle is expected to post a pre-tax loss of € 1.3 billion this year and forecasts a drop in retail sales of between 4.5 and 5 percent .
the company also revealed that it would not be paying a dividend this year or the next .
in august , the company reported a second quarter net loss of € 188 million -lrb- $ 231 million -rrb- on slumping retail sales .
tuesday 's statement did not mention any imminent job cuts related to the restructuring , but karstadtquelle said in july that it planned to cut about 4,000 jobs from its work force of 47,000 full- and part-time employees by the end of 2006 karstadtquelle shares , which dropped by more than 6 percent monday at € 13.38 a share , were up 5.7 percent at € 14.14 by noon on the frankfurt stock exchange . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karstadtquelle to cut more jobs essen-based retailer karstadtquelle will cut an additional 4,000 jobs over the next two years , the company said in a statement .

while pawprints are n't required for identification , photos are optional . previously , animal owners were expected to carry their pet 's immunization record when they travelled .
animals also were given a tattoo in their ear .
while the old id measures will be accepted during the transition phase , after 2011 , all animals will need to have a microchip the size of a grain of rice injected which contains a machine-readable number to identify the animal . " total nonsense , " scoffed professor hans-joachim hackbarth of the veterinary school in hanover upon hearing of the new regulations .
he said he ca n't remember the last time he was required to show his own passport when crossing an eu border .
the effort pet owners have to make for their animals to meet eu standards is in no relation to the usefulness of the information , hackbarth said . home is best germany 's national association of veterinarians showed understanding for the eu 's desire to unify pet identification procedures .

but the move to berlin has fused what is often billed as the world 's biggest music trade fair with new life .
" it 's not simply moving from one city to another , but rather a real fresh start , " said popkomm 's general manager ralf kleinhenz .
despite cologne 's role as an important media center in germany , the number of visitors to the fair had dropped dramatically in recent years .
opening with a big concert on tuesday night , organizers hope berlin - which has been anointed germany 's music capital - will increase popkomm 's international profile .
there will be 661 exhibitors at the three-day trade fair from 41 different countries .
along with an industry conference , there will be 400 hours of live music at concerts and club events open to the general public .
during the week , german acts like rappers die fantastischen vier and rockers sportfreunde stiller will perform alongside international artists including world-renowned techno djs and veteran gangsta rapper ice-t , who has a new group called the machine .
but as berliners enjoy a few days of top-shelf music , industry insiders will be discussing the still uncertain future of the music business .
the future is digital topping the agenda is how to deal with the rapidly evolving nature of music .
as fewer people buy cds and move their music collections to their home computers , the industry is still grappling with piracy and copyright issues for digital formats like mp3s .
some estimates have put the drop in sales for the german music sector at around 40 percent since 1997 .
most in the industry blame internet file-sharing networks that were modeled on napster .
" what 's changing at the moment is how we deal with music , " kleinhenz said .
" and that raises questions not only of an economic nature , but also cultural and societal questions . "
in germany , one of the top current questions is how best to support local artists .
some are calling for a radio quota for german musicians modeled on france 's system .
there , at least 40 percent of all radio airtime is reserved for french acts .
the initiative has gained the support of some german politicians , including green party parliamentarian antje vollmer .
" we owe it to our cultural identity , " vollmer said , according to dpa news agency .
" it has nothing to do with being overly german .
other countries naturally take care of their own artists . "
vollmer has called for an open parliamentary debate on the matter on wednesday .
not waiting for help many musicians agree more needs to be done to promote german acts , but they are n't waiting for the government or industry to help them out .
eike herwig , the drummer for the punk rock band the donots , said his group makes a special effort to promote up-and-coming bands .
besides setting up a special section highlighting new groups on their web site , the donots are also giving them opening spots on their latest tour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo and alex from the donots at the hurricane open air festival .
-lrb- eike is behind them . -rrb-
" i think it 's important to give german musicians more attention , " herwig told dw-world .
" a lot of the time on german radio the focus is on bands from america and england . "
tim renner from record label motor music backs the idea of supporting local acts , but is leery of a legally mandated quota .
during popkomm the label 's new radio station motorfm will broadcast only german bands and musicians like canadian electro-trash queen peaches , who have a connection to germany .
thinking globally and locally renner used to head up the german division of universal music , but he and the company parted ways amid disagreement over the direction the label was heading .
whereas renner always thought supporting local german musicians would be the best way to approach the domestic market , the head office of the company wanted to focus more on major international acts that could be sold globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim renner " i get mixed feelings when i hear the word quota , " renner told dw-world .
" they 'll tell you there 's not enough good stuff out there .
that 's not true .
they need to promote the cultural diversity , but any quota will mean they 've failed to find a radio concept . "
he said if motorfm gets a permanent frequency to broadcast in berlin the station will continue to support local artists , but it will concentrate on simply playing good music regardless of its origin .
renner is also hoping to pioneer new ways to make new digital technologies a boon instead of a bane for the industry .
he said the station would aim to make every song played available to download legally .
besides an internet portal along the lines of the apple itunes music store , he said he hoped to have a totally mobile business model , including being able to send a sms text message from your phone to purchase the song being played on your car stereo .
" the radio stations could be the retailers of tomorrow , " he said .

dw-world readers this week commented on the race for the white house and president bush 's negative foreign policy record abroad . your point of view is interesting , i lived in europe for eight years and appreciate your points of view ; it 's great to see that the billions of dollars we spent through the marshal plan has produced peaceful differences .
two things you overlook are : only us citizens vote , and the economy , not foreign policy will determine the outcome of the election .
we 've been through years and years of anti-americanism , so what else is new .
polls in other countries mean nothing .
the americans living overseas vote in their particular state so even though they may be 80 % democrats , scattered over 50 states i seriously doubt they will have the kind of impact you describe - frank shipp why does n't your rag of a newspaper conduct a poll of americans asking them what they think of germany and mr. schröder ?
you germans can take your smug , self-satisfied views and shove them .
how 's that for candor , heinz ?
if germans had any sense of decency at all , they would shut their mouths before dispensing any advice - let alone moral advice - to george bush or to america .
any " crimes " america has ever committed pale by comparison to what you animals did not once , but twice in the last century .
your leaders kaiser willie and hitler were personally responsible for at least thirty million deaths , and you have the balls to ask germans what they think about my president and my country ? - john huettner violence destroyed our world trade center but that can be rebuilt .
george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .
george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .
we ca n't take it anymore . - lucy cole , alamo , california most americans are oblivious to their reception abroad , and i blame the american media for much of this ignorance .
bush 's record at home is remarkably but undeservedly good . - jeffrey hamill i am an a citizen of the united states and love my country but detest its current " leadership . "
our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .
if iraq truly had nothing to hide , then why not comply ?
should we have waited another 10 years while saddam continued to torture his own people ?
how long is too long ?
george w. bush is the only leader in the world strong enough to draw the line in the sand and face these threats head-on .
it may be years before this is truly understood .
the un is a weak , spineless organization that failed miserably to stop saddam .
jacques chirac is also weak , and could never stand up to terrorists the way mr. bush has .
i 'd rather see us fight terrorists , alone if we have to , on the streets of baghdad instead of being attacked on the streets of boston or elsewhere .
i will proudly vote for president george w. bush on nov .
2nd .
and many here agree with me , and i would prepare for a second bush term now . - steve bush has been a complete disaster internationally and an embarrassment to those of us in the us who long for a return to diplomacy to solve problems .
this country is , i 'm afraid , moving into a very dangerous unilateralism on a wide range of subjects .
this includes our refusal to join the eu and others in the international criminal court and kyoto .
i hate to say it , but i fear we are resorting back to pre-wwii us autonomy , hegemony and unilateralism in our relations with the world .
i think this could be a semi-permanent condition and i do n't know that even electing kerry will solve it .
americans are , unfortunately turning increasingly inward and are not taking criticism and disagreement from other nations and organizations very well .
in fact , they increasingly appear to be fighting back and downright dismissive of allies and others who voice disagreement with our policies .
it appears that being the only military " super-power " in the world is going to our heads .
remember the adage , " absolute power corrupts , absolutely " ! !
it appears to be true ! - trevor steven taylor you need to understand that most americans know that the us is just about the only country in the world that can " go it alone . "
for that reason , we americans do n't care what the world thinks about us or our international policies .
the independent streak of the americans is actually increased when we hear that a large percentage of the germans and french disagrees with something the us is doing , no matter what it is .
as soon as the us does not require energy from foreign sources , we may just resign from the united nations .
according to the polls , that 's the goal of more than half the americans , and those are the ones who support george w. bush .
thank you . - james l. reid , usa i believe george w. bush has hindered the spread of peace throughout the world .
i believe he does not consider that others world-wide have a right to govern their own area and have a clearer view of the big picture .
i also believe he was not taught to " play nice with others " when he was a child .
he has the arrogant , smirk of a bully who was born into privilege and has never had to consider the other person 's rights or feelings . - karen seeger , usa the only opinion that counts will be the election results in november .
the eu public is generally misinformed by a biased media that spews constant anti-bush information .
the net result is an anti-bush eu public . - boyd lawrence , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .

the americans living overseas vote in their particular state so even though they may be 80 % democrats , scattered over 50 states i seriously doubt they will have the kind of impact you describe - frank shipp why does n't your rag of a newspaper conduct a poll of americans asking them what they think of germany and mr. schröder ?
you germans can take your smug , self-satisfied views and shove them .
how 's that for candor , heinz ?
if germans had any sense of decency at all , they would shut their mouths before dispensing any advice - let alone moral advice - to george bush or to america .
any " crimes " america has ever committed pale by comparison to what you animals did not once , but twice in the last century .
your leaders kaiser willie and hitler were personally responsible for at least thirty million deaths , and you have the balls to ask germans what they think about my president and my country ? - john huettner violence destroyed our world trade center but that can be rebuilt .
george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .
george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .

bush 's record at home is remarkably but undeservedly good . - jeffrey hamill i am an a citizen of the united states and love my country but detest its current " leadership . "
our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .
if iraq truly had nothing to hide , then why not comply ?
should we have waited another 10 years while saddam continued to torture his own people ?
how long is too long ?
george w. bush is the only leader in the world strong enough to draw the line in the sand and face these threats head-on .
it may be years before this is truly understood .
the un is a weak , spineless organization that failed miserably to stop saddam .
jacques chirac is also weak , and could never stand up to terrorists the way mr. bush has .
i 'd rather see us fight terrorists , alone if we have to , on the streets of baghdad instead of being attacked on the streets of boston or elsewhere .
i will proudly vote for president george w. bush on nov .
2nd .
and many here agree with me , and i would prepare for a second bush term now . - steve bush has been a complete disaster internationally and an embarrassment to those of us in the us who long for a return to diplomacy to solve problems .
this country is , i 'm afraid , moving into a very dangerous unilateralism on a wide range of subjects .
this includes our refusal to join the eu and others in the international criminal court and kyoto .
i hate to say it , but i fear we are resorting back to pre-wwii us autonomy , hegemony and unilateralism in our relations with the world .
i think this could be a semi-permanent condition and i do n't know that even electing kerry will solve it .
americans are , unfortunately turning increasingly inward and are not taking criticism and disagreement from other nations and organizations very well .
in fact , they increasingly appear to be fighting back and downright dismissive of allies and others who voice disagreement with our policies .
it appears that being the only military " super-power " in the world is going to our heads .
remember the adage , " absolute power corrupts , absolutely " ! !
it appears to be true ! - trevor steven taylor you need to understand that most americans know that the us is just about the only country in the world that can " go it alone . "
for that reason , we americans do n't care what the world thinks about us or our international policies .
the independent streak of the americans is actually increased when we hear that a large percentage of the germans and french disagrees with something the us is doing , no matter what it is .
as soon as the us does not require energy from foreign sources , we may just resign from the united nations .
according to the polls , that 's the goal of more than half the americans , and those are the ones who support george w. bush .
thank you . - james l. reid , usa i believe george w. bush has hindered the spread of peace throughout the world .
i believe he does not consider that others world-wide have a right to govern their own area and have a clearer view of the big picture .
i also believe he was not taught to " play nice with others " when he was a child .
he has the arrogant , smirk of a bully who was born into privilege and has never had to consider the other person 's rights or feelings . - karen seeger , usa the only opinion that counts will be the election results in november .

but the move to berlin has fused what is often billed as the world 's biggest music trade fair with new life .
" it 's not simply moving from one city to another , but rather a real fresh start , " said popkomm 's general manager ralf kleinhenz .
despite cologne 's role as an important media center in germany , the number of visitors to the fair had dropped dramatically in recent years .
opening with a big concert on tuesday night , organizers hope berlin - which has been anointed germany 's music capital - will increase popkomm 's international profile .
there will be 661 exhibitors at the three-day trade fair from 41 different countries .
along with an industry conference , there will be 400 hours of live music at concerts and club events open to the general public .
during the week , german acts like rappers die fantastischen vier and rockers sportfreunde stiller will perform alongside international artists including world-renowned techno djs and veteran gangsta rapper ice-t , who has a new group called the machine .
but as berliners enjoy a few days of top-shelf music , industry insiders will be discussing the still uncertain future of the music business .
the future is digital topping the agenda is how to deal with the rapidly evolving nature of music .
as fewer people buy cds and move their music collections to their home computers , the industry is still grappling with piracy and copyright issues for digital formats like mp3s .
some estimates have put the drop in sales for the german music sector at around 40 percent since 1997 .
most in the industry blame internet file-sharing networks that were modeled on napster .
" what 's changing at the moment is how we deal with music , " kleinhenz said .
" and that raises questions not only of an economic nature , but also cultural and societal questions . "
in germany , one of the top current questions is how best to support local artists .
some are calling for a radio quota for german musicians modeled on france 's system .
there , at least 40 percent of all radio airtime is reserved for french acts .
the initiative has gained the support of some german politicians , including green party parliamentarian antje vollmer .
" we owe it to our cultural identity , " vollmer said , according to dpa news agency .
" it has nothing to do with being overly german .
other countries naturally take care of their own artists . "
vollmer has called for an open parliamentary debate on the matter on wednesday .
not waiting for help many musicians agree more needs to be done to promote german acts , but they are n't waiting for the government or industry to help them out .
eike herwig , the drummer for the punk rock band the donots , said his group makes a special effort to promote up-and-coming bands .
besides setting up a special section highlighting new groups on their web site , the donots are also giving them opening spots on their latest tour .

-lrb- eike is behind them . -rrb-
" i think it 's important to give german musicians more attention , " herwig told dw-world .
" a lot of the time on german radio the focus is on bands from america and england . "
tim renner from record label motor music backs the idea of supporting local acts , but is leery of a legally mandated quota .
during popkomm the label 's new radio station motorfm will broadcast only german bands and musicians like canadian electro-trash queen peaches , who have a connection to germany .
thinking globally and locally renner used to head up the german division of universal music , but he and the company parted ways amid disagreement over the direction the label was heading .
whereas renner always thought supporting local german musicians would be the best way to approach the domestic market , the head office of the company wanted to focus more on major international acts that could be sold globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim renner " i get mixed feelings when i hear the word quota , " renner told dw-world .
" they 'll tell you there 's not enough good stuff out there .
that 's not true .
they need to promote the cultural diversity , but any quota will mean they 've failed to find a radio concept . "
he said if motorfm gets a permanent frequency to broadcast in berlin the station will continue to support local artists , but it will concentrate on simply playing good music regardless of its origin .
renner is also hoping to pioneer new ways to make new digital technologies a boon instead of a bane for the industry .
he said the station would aim to make every song played available to download legally .
besides an internet portal along the lines of the apple itunes music store , he said he hoped to have a totally mobile business model , including being able to send a sms text message from your phone to purchase the song being played on your car stereo .
" the radio stations could be the retailers of tomorrow , " he said .

while pawprints are n't required for identification , photos are optional . previously , animal owners were expected to carry their pet 's immunization record when they travelled .

while the old id measures will be accepted during the transition phase , after 2011 , all animals will need to have a microchip the size of a grain of rice injected which contains a machine-readable number to identify the animal . " total nonsense , " scoffed professor hans-joachim hackbarth of the veterinary school in hanover upon hearing of the new regulations .
he said he ca n't remember the last time he was required to show his own passport when crossing an eu border .
the effort pet owners have to make for their animals to meet eu standards is in no relation to the usefulness of the information , hackbarth said . home is best germany 's national association of veterinarians showed understanding for the eu 's desire to unify pet identification procedures .
after all , countries such as ireland , britain and sweden are rabies-free , and would like to stay that way . but the german society for the protection of animals says the best advice for pet owners is to leave their furry friends at home when they travel . and so that owners do n't have to resort to kennels , they 've even set up a hotline for pet " foster families .

on the whole , they are still in the cold war period , " nick witney , head of the european defense agency , which was created in june to strengthen the eu 's military capabilities , told the french daily le figaro .
rather than focusing on tanks , european armies need more high-tech equipment , such as effective communication tools and analytical equipment , witney added .
closing the gap with the us in terms of arms technology is not about spending more , but spending more efficiently , he said .
witney said defense markets opearate mainly at the national level and that eu member states do not have the means to keep their industries alive .
" european companies are up against big american groups with colossal budgets .
compared to the americans , the europeans are underweight .
they need a market on a continental scale to be profitable , " he concluded .

the paper said that although the machine guns usually on the vehicles would be taken off , they surely would n't be used to transport the baghdad football team .
instead they would carry heavily armed people through territory endangered by explosive traps and snipers .
the " fuchs , " as the vehicles are called , is war material , delivered by germany to a war area and german politicians will have to ask themselves in future what use of german weapons is desired in which contexts , the paper wrote .
recalling that he won the 2002 election with his anti-war stance , the offenburger tageblatt newspaper said chancellor schröder has thrown his iraq policy overboard .
the supply of the vehicles is direct support of the allied troops , the paper wrote , and hence a direct intervention in the iraq war ; schröder broke his word .
the badische zeitung of freiburg wrote that regardless of all criticism of the war , schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer agree that the west must not fail in iraq , because it would be a catastrophe if the country were to descend into despotism , anarchy or religious fanaticism .
the armored vehicles are to ease , at least temporarily , the pressure on germany to get more involved , the paper opined .
the main-echo newspaper saw the british prime minister marshalling his rank and file behind him because a third election win is more important to them than moral debates .
the discipline in the campaigning ahead would ensure an end to all speculation about treasurer gordon brown replacing prime minister tony blair .
it ’ s an altogether different matter , though whether the british public will continue to accept a prime minister who can ’ t bring himself to say sorry for his iraq policy , the paper said .
the badisches tagblatt of baden-baden noted that blair played on his strength and his personality , which brought him to power triumphantly in 1997 .
hollow-cheeked , passionately and very openly , he admitted personal mistakes , including that he believed claims about iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
blair appeared to be resigned to his political fate being linked to developments in iraq , the paper wrote .
all bad news from there falls back on him and the ratings of his party , it concluded .
the financial times deutschland found blair focusing on the need for education , health care and pension reforms to distract attention from iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.09.2004 western leaders criticize putin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under fire more than 100 american and european foreign policy experts signed a letter protesting against russian president vladimir putin 's leadership .
they say putin is using the fight against terror to clamp down on democracy . the protest letter , delivered to us president george w. bush , as well as other government leaders in nato and the european union , accuses putin of turning back to authoritarian rule .
its 115 signatories include prominent politicians such as former czech president vaclav havel , former swedish prime minister carl bildt , and us senators john mccain and joseph r. biden . the most prominent german politicians to sign the letter are green party chief reinhard bütikofer , and the foreign policy expert of the christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , friedbert pflüger .
no politicians from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- signed it . democracy in name only ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian solders with rifles outside the school in beslan where over 300 students and adults were held hostage by chechen attackers the letter expresses concern that putin is using terrorist attacks by chechen separatists , including the recent school hostage drama in beslan , as a pretext for extending his control over political life in russia . " we are deeply concerned that these tragic events are being used to further undermine democracy in russia , " said the letter , which was published in full in the financial times deutschland .
" russia 's democratic institutions have always been weak and fragile .
since becoming president in january 2000 , vladimir putin has made them even weaker . " the letter calls on western countries to place themselves " unambiguously on the side of democratic forces in russia . " this week , putin sent a draft law to parliament that will give him the right to nominate regional governors .
he also introduced a draft resolution that would create a new blacklist of terrorist suspects subject to extradition .
both plans have raised concern in the west . putin faces little opposition in the russian parliament , as his united russia party holds more than two-thirds of the seats .
criticism of putin in the russian media is rare , as most independent media organizations have been shut down under his rule . breaking the silence until now , western leaders have been reserved in their criticism , with barely a word being uttered by the eu or the us government to protest human rights violations in chechnya . germany has taken pains to cultivate close ties with russia .
on his last visit there , schröder emphasized the friendly nature of his relationship with putin .
the two leaders presented a united front on the most important questions , including putin 's controversial handling of the chechnya conflict . russia 's un ambassador , andrey denisov , said he took the criticism in the letter seriously , but added that it was important that there be enough " flexibility " in russia 's democracy to allow it to fight terrorism . " yes , we have to take seriously such opinions because they are being expressed by such distinguished persons , " denisov said .
" we have to prove to our partners that they are mistaken or they are exaggerating the present state of affairs .

they say putin is using the fight against terror to clamp down on democracy . the protest letter , delivered to us president george w. bush , as well as other government leaders in nato and the european union , accuses putin of turning back to authoritarian rule .
its 115 signatories include prominent politicians such as former czech president vaclav havel , former swedish prime minister carl bildt , and us senators john mccain and joseph r. biden . the most prominent german politicians to sign the letter are green party chief reinhard bütikofer , and the foreign policy expert of the christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , friedbert pflüger .
no politicians from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- signed it . democracy in name only ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian solders with rifles outside the school in beslan where over 300 students and adults were held hostage by chechen attackers the letter expresses concern that putin is using terrorist attacks by chechen separatists , including the recent school hostage drama in beslan , as a pretext for extending his control over political life in russia . " we are deeply concerned that these tragic events are being used to further undermine democracy in russia , " said the letter , which was published in full in the financial times deutschland .
" russia 's democratic institutions have always been weak and fragile .
since becoming president in january 2000 , vladimir putin has made them even weaker . " the letter calls on western countries to place themselves " unambiguously on the side of democratic forces in russia . " this week , putin sent a draft law to parliament that will give him the right to nominate regional governors .
he also introduced a draft resolution that would create a new blacklist of terrorist suspects subject to extradition .
both plans have raised concern in the west . putin faces little opposition in the russian parliament , as his united russia party holds more than two-thirds of the seats .
criticism of putin in the russian media is rare , as most independent media organizations have been shut down under his rule . breaking the silence until now , western leaders have been reserved in their criticism , with barely a word being uttered by the eu or the us government to protest human rights violations in chechnya . germany has taken pains to cultivate close ties with russia .
on his last visit there , schröder emphasized the friendly nature of his relationship with putin .
the two leaders presented a united front on the most important questions , including putin 's controversial handling of the chechnya conflict . russia 's un ambassador , andrey denisov , said he took the criticism in the letter seriously , but added that it was important that there be enough " flexibility " in russia 's democracy to allow it to fight terrorism . " yes , we have to take seriously such opinions because they are being expressed by such distinguished persons , " denisov said .

they say putin is using the fight against terror to clamp down on democracy . the protest letter , delivered to us president george w. bush , as well as other government leaders in nato and the european union , accuses putin of turning back to authoritarian rule .
its 115 signatories include prominent politicians such as former czech president vaclav havel , former swedish prime minister carl bildt , and us senators john mccain and joseph r. biden . the most prominent german politicians to sign the letter are green party chief reinhard bütikofer , and the foreign policy expert of the christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , friedbert pflüger .
no politicians from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- signed it . democracy in name only ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian solders with rifles outside the school in beslan where over 300 students and adults were held hostage by chechen attackers the letter expresses concern that putin is using terrorist attacks by chechen separatists , including the recent school hostage drama in beslan , as a pretext for extending his control over political life in russia . " we are deeply concerned that these tragic events are being used to further undermine democracy in russia , " said the letter , which was published in full in the financial times deutschland .
" russia 's democratic institutions have always been weak and fragile .
since becoming president in january 2000 , vladimir putin has made them even weaker . " the letter calls on western countries to place themselves " unambiguously on the side of democratic forces in russia . " this week , putin sent a draft law to parliament that will give him the right to nominate regional governors .
he also introduced a draft resolution that would create a new blacklist of terrorist suspects subject to extradition .
both plans have raised concern in the west . putin faces little opposition in the russian parliament , as his united russia party holds more than two-thirds of the seats .
criticism of putin in the russian media is rare , as most independent media organizations have been shut down under his rule . breaking the silence until now , western leaders have been reserved in their criticism , with barely a word being uttered by the eu or the us government to protest human rights violations in chechnya . germany has taken pains to cultivate close ties with russia .
on his last visit there , schröder emphasized the friendly nature of his relationship with putin .
the two leaders presented a united front on the most important questions , including putin 's controversial handling of the chechnya conflict . russia 's un ambassador , andrey denisov , said he took the criticism in the letter seriously , but added that it was important that there be enough " flexibility " in russia 's democracy to allow it to fight terrorism . " yes , we have to take seriously such opinions because they are being expressed by such distinguished persons , " denisov said .
" we have to prove to our partners that they are mistaken or they are exaggerating the present state of affairs . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases .

the healing power of storytelling the unknown guest of honor frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.09.2004 book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tahar ben jelloun is one of the few well-known arab authors in europe many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all . of the around 120,000 foreign fiction titles translated into german , only about 500 come from the arab world .
it 's a telling statement on the lack of information in the west when it comes to the diversity of the literary landscape in the arab countries . it 's usually literary heavyweights such as egyptian author and nobel prize winner naguib mahfouz or france-based moroccan writer tahar ben jelloun who enjoy relative popularity in europe . but that might be about to change as the spotlight falls on the arab league at this year 's frankfurt book fair .
starting october 6 , visitors to the world 's largest book fair will get the chance to meet and get acquainted with the works of around 200 authors and artists from 17 countries of the 22-member arab league . arab league program under fire but , even as the arab league readies itself for the chance to showcase its literary talent on a western platform , it has been dogged by criticism of its program . a few days ago , moroccan culture minister and poet muhammad al-ashari said he found it hard to understand that arabs , in 22 very diverse nations , were invited to the fair as a whole entity .
morocco , along with kuwait , libya , algeria and iraq , is not participating in the official program of the arab league at the frankfurt book fair . further criticism centers on the disproportionately large share of egyptian authors among the invited guests as well as the lack of initiative to involve authors in exile . the arab league 's program , which it unveiled at a press conference in frankfurt in june , is comprehensive , to say the least : poetry and prose readings , music , film and folkloristic events , discussion forums on globalization , human rights and reform in the arab world . among the invited authors are prominent names in literary circles such as the poets adonis and mahmud darwish , the francophone authors asia djebar and amin maalouf , but also names largely unknown in germany , such as the saudi writers raja alim and abduh khal . censorship still taboo in addition to the exhaustive program , the arab organizers at the frankfurt book fair spoke glowingly of the arab world wanting to initiate an open dialogue with the west as well as discuss controversial questions .
at the same time , the organizers sought to play down or completely avoid grave problems such as the woes of the arab book market and publishing industry . the arab organizers ' unwillingness to discuss pressing issues was apparent when it came to the ubiquitous censorship in the arab world . the director of the muscat book fair in oman , muhammad ali hassan , explained why censorship was necessary .
" our societies have their specialties and traditions that need to be respected , " hassan said .
" everything that attacks arab society or creates turbulence should be forbidden .
our societies still need protection , " he told deutsche welle . that seems to be the dominating opinion among arab book fair circles .
but censorship , which is one of the largest problems within the arab world , is not even mentioned in the official part of the arab league 's frankfurt fair program .
ibrahim al-muallim , president of the arab publishing association , instead claimed that arab publishers have made great strides in the fight against censorship . khalid qubaia , a libyan publisher and official at the arab publishing association , made no bones about the fact that his organization had clear views on censorship . " different benchmarks on censorship prevail in every arab country , " qubaia said .
" the arab publishers ' association agrees with two reasons for censorship : when a book compromises the security of a nation or when it does n't reflect ideas of morality . " lively discussions guaranteed but that 's not a view jabir asfur , director of the egyptian high council for culture , agreed with .
in the arabic daily al-hayat , asfur recently praised german oriental studies and efforts to translate arab literature into german . at the same time asfur was also self-critical .
he wrote that neither individual arab states nor the arab league nor the arab publishers ' association had ever set up initiatives to support the translation of arabic literature into other languages . but , this self-criticism comes late .
on the one hand arab intellectuals have been demanding for years to set up a fund for exactly that purpose .
on the other , uncertainty still surrounds a list with arab books that are meant to be translated into german and english on the occasion of the arab league 's guest performance at the frankfurt book fair . one thing is clear though : suspense and heated discussion are guaranteed this year at the frankfurt book fair . mona naggar -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

the healing power of storytelling the unknown guest of honor frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.09.2004 book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tahar ben jelloun is one of the few well-known arab authors in europe many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all . of the around 120,000 foreign fiction titles translated into german , only about 500 come from the arab world .
it 's a telling statement on the lack of information in the west when it comes to the diversity of the literary landscape in the arab countries . it 's usually literary heavyweights such as egyptian author and nobel prize winner naguib mahfouz or france-based moroccan writer tahar ben jelloun who enjoy relative popularity in europe . but that might be about to change as the spotlight falls on the arab league at this year 's frankfurt book fair .
starting october 6 , visitors to the world 's largest book fair will get the chance to meet and get acquainted with the works of around 200 authors and artists from 17 countries of the 22-member arab league . arab league program under fire but , even as the arab league readies itself for the chance to showcase its literary talent on a western platform , it has been dogged by criticism of its program . a few days ago , moroccan culture minister and poet muhammad al-ashari said he found it hard to understand that arabs , in 22 very diverse nations , were invited to the fair as a whole entity .
morocco , along with kuwait , libya , algeria and iraq , is not participating in the official program of the arab league at the frankfurt book fair . further criticism centers on the disproportionately large share of egyptian authors among the invited guests as well as the lack of initiative to involve authors in exile . the arab league 's program , which it unveiled at a press conference in frankfurt in june , is comprehensive , to say the least : poetry and prose readings , music , film and folkloristic events , discussion forums on globalization , human rights and reform in the arab world . among the invited authors are prominent names in literary circles such as the poets adonis and mahmud darwish , the francophone authors asia djebar and amin maalouf , but also names largely unknown in germany , such as the saudi writers raja alim and abduh khal . censorship still taboo in addition to the exhaustive program , the arab organizers at the frankfurt book fair spoke glowingly of the arab world wanting to initiate an open dialogue with the west as well as discuss controversial questions .
at the same time , the organizers sought to play down or completely avoid grave problems such as the woes of the arab book market and publishing industry . the arab organizers ' unwillingness to discuss pressing issues was apparent when it came to the ubiquitous censorship in the arab world . the director of the muscat book fair in oman , muhammad ali hassan , explained why censorship was necessary .
" our societies have their specialties and traditions that need to be respected , " hassan said .
" everything that attacks arab society or creates turbulence should be forbidden .
our societies still need protection , " he told deutsche welle . that seems to be the dominating opinion among arab book fair circles .
but censorship , which is one of the largest problems within the arab world , is not even mentioned in the official part of the arab league 's frankfurt fair program .
ibrahim al-muallim , president of the arab publishing association , instead claimed that arab publishers have made great strides in the fight against censorship . khalid qubaia , a libyan publisher and official at the arab publishing association , made no bones about the fact that his organization had clear views on censorship . " different benchmarks on censorship prevail in every arab country , " qubaia said .
" the arab publishers ' association agrees with two reasons for censorship : when a book compromises the security of a nation or when it does n't reflect ideas of morality . " lively discussions guaranteed but that 's not a view jabir asfur , director of the egyptian high council for culture , agreed with .
in the arabic daily al-hayat , asfur recently praised german oriental studies and efforts to translate arab literature into german . at the same time asfur was also self-critical .
he wrote that neither individual arab states nor the arab league nor the arab publishers ' association had ever set up initiatives to support the translation of arabic literature into other languages . but , this self-criticism comes late .
on the one hand arab intellectuals have been demanding for years to set up a fund for exactly that purpose .
on the other , uncertainty still surrounds a list with arab books that are meant to be translated into german and english on the occasion of the arab league 's guest performance at the frankfurt book fair . one thing is clear though : suspense and heated discussion are guaranteed this year at the frankfurt book fair . mona naggar -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

the healing power of storytelling the unknown guest of honor frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.09.2004 book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tahar ben jelloun is one of the few well-known arab authors in europe many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all . of the around 120,000 foreign fiction titles translated into german , only about 500 come from the arab world .
it 's a telling statement on the lack of information in the west when it comes to the diversity of the literary landscape in the arab countries . it 's usually literary heavyweights such as egyptian author and nobel prize winner naguib mahfouz or france-based moroccan writer tahar ben jelloun who enjoy relative popularity in europe . but that might be about to change as the spotlight falls on the arab league at this year 's frankfurt book fair .
starting october 6 , visitors to the world 's largest book fair will get the chance to meet and get acquainted with the works of around 200 authors and artists from 17 countries of the 22-member arab league . arab league program under fire but , even as the arab league readies itself for the chance to showcase its literary talent on a western platform , it has been dogged by criticism of its program . a few days ago , moroccan culture minister and poet muhammad al-ashari said he found it hard to understand that arabs , in 22 very diverse nations , were invited to the fair as a whole entity .
morocco , along with kuwait , libya , algeria and iraq , is not participating in the official program of the arab league at the frankfurt book fair . further criticism centers on the disproportionately large share of egyptian authors among the invited guests as well as the lack of initiative to involve authors in exile . the arab league 's program , which it unveiled at a press conference in frankfurt in june , is comprehensive , to say the least : poetry and prose readings , music , film and folkloristic events , discussion forums on globalization , human rights and reform in the arab world . among the invited authors are prominent names in literary circles such as the poets adonis and mahmud darwish , the francophone authors asia djebar and amin maalouf , but also names largely unknown in germany , such as the saudi writers raja alim and abduh khal . censorship still taboo in addition to the exhaustive program , the arab organizers at the frankfurt book fair spoke glowingly of the arab world wanting to initiate an open dialogue with the west as well as discuss controversial questions .
at the same time , the organizers sought to play down or completely avoid grave problems such as the woes of the arab book market and publishing industry . the arab organizers ' unwillingness to discuss pressing issues was apparent when it came to the ubiquitous censorship in the arab world . the director of the muscat book fair in oman , muhammad ali hassan , explained why censorship was necessary .
" our societies have their specialties and traditions that need to be respected , " hassan said .
" everything that attacks arab society or creates turbulence should be forbidden .
our societies still need protection , " he told deutsche welle . that seems to be the dominating opinion among arab book fair circles .
but censorship , which is one of the largest problems within the arab world , is not even mentioned in the official part of the arab league 's frankfurt fair program .
ibrahim al-muallim , president of the arab publishing association , instead claimed that arab publishers have made great strides in the fight against censorship . khalid qubaia , a libyan publisher and official at the arab publishing association , made no bones about the fact that his organization had clear views on censorship . " different benchmarks on censorship prevail in every arab country , " qubaia said .
" the arab publishers ' association agrees with two reasons for censorship : when a book compromises the security of a nation or when it does n't reflect ideas of morality . " lively discussions guaranteed but that 's not a view jabir asfur , director of the egyptian high council for culture , agreed with .
in the arabic daily al-hayat , asfur recently praised german oriental studies and efforts to translate arab literature into german . at the same time asfur was also self-critical .
he wrote that neither individual arab states nor the arab league nor the arab publishers ' association had ever set up initiatives to support the translation of arabic literature into other languages . but , this self-criticism comes late .
on the one hand arab intellectuals have been demanding for years to set up a fund for exactly that purpose .
on the other , uncertainty still surrounds a list with arab books that are meant to be translated into german and english on the occasion of the arab league 's guest performance at the frankfurt book fair . one thing is clear though : suspense and heated discussion are guaranteed this year at the frankfurt book fair . mona naggar -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

on the whole , they are still in the cold war period , " nick witney , head of the european defense agency , which was created in june to strengthen the eu 's military capabilities , told the french daily le figaro .
rather than focusing on tanks , european armies need more high-tech equipment , such as effective communication tools and analytical equipment , witney added .
closing the gap with the us in terms of arms technology is not about spending more , but spending more efficiently , he said .
witney said defense markets opearate mainly at the national level and that eu member states do not have the means to keep their industries alive .
" european companies are up against big american groups with colossal budgets .
compared to the americans , the europeans are underweight .
they need a market on a continental scale to be profitable , " he concluded .

" we will mobilize the workforce so that these stores stay a part of karstadt , " franziska wiethold , a member of verdi 's national executive board , told the berliner zeitung .
she also said the reorganization would end up putting karstadt 's future in danger rather than stabilizing it .
the sale of small and medium sized stores was one part of the € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.72 billion -rrb- restructuring plan the german retail giant announced tuesday .
additionally , the company proposed a € 500 million capital increase and cuts in social programs and vacation for employees .
" the core of the program is the refocusing of the group on its strengths and core competencies , " the company said in a statement .
" the management plans , on the basis of the reorientation , to achieve markedly positive earnings as early as the 2005 fiscal year . "
the company will also sell its 82 percent stake in a joint venture with coffeehouse chain starbucks , in addition to parting with its specialist runners point , golf house , sinnleffers and wehmeyer outlets in an effort to concentrate on its core retail activities .
the company 's core retail business portfolio is worth around € 4.5 billion in turnover while those non-core activities set to be abandoned are worth € 700 million in turnover .
" these steps are inevitable and also overdue , " chief executive christoph achenbach told a news conference in the western city of essen .
trade unions criticize plans the company 's plan has been criticized by the verdi service workers union , who called the closing of department stores avoidable .
the restructuring " endangers the jobs of thousands of people , and above all does not point to a solid future in the department store area , " a union statement said .
karstadtquelle has been hemorrhaging money as german consumers continue to show reluctance in spending during the country 's gradual emergence from three years of economic stagnation .
while exports within a stronger world economy have begun to drive an upturn in fortunes of late , germany 's domestic demand and the consumer environment have remained stagnant , with unemployment above 10 percent and the government moving to trim social programs .
in addition to slow retail sales , essen-based karstadtquelle 's performance has been hit recently by losses at the thomas cook tourism company , which it co-owns with german airline lufthansa .
retail sales expected to drop the company also released figures that showed the state of the concern .
karstadtquelle is expected to post a pre-tax loss of € 1.3 billion this year and forecasts a drop in retail sales of between 4.5 and 5 percent .
the company also revealed that it would not be paying a dividend this year or the next .
in august , the company reported a second quarter net loss of € 188 million -lrb- $ 231 million -rrb- on slumping retail sales .
tuesday 's statement did not mention any imminent job cuts related to the restructuring , but karstadtquelle said in july that it planned to cut about 4,000 jobs from its work force of 47,000 full- and part-time employees by the end of 2006 karstadtquelle shares , which dropped by more than 6 percent monday at € 13.38 a share , were up 5.7 percent at € 14.14 by noon on the frankfurt stock exchange . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karstadtquelle to cut more jobs essen-based retailer karstadtquelle will cut an additional 4,000 jobs over the next two years , the company said in a statement .

while political critics in schily 's social democratic party are waiting to hear what he has to say when he presents the proposal to a parliamentary committee on wednesday , members of junior collation party , the greens , are n't wasting any time voicing their opposition to the plan .
" there has to be a different answer than schily 's , " green party leader katrin göring-eckardt told the newspaper .
her party wants an enforceable , individual asylum law and said in a report that schily 's plan is impractical and not in accordance with german law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german minister 's plan calls for dealing with refugees before they reach europe 's shores human rights organizations are also against the minister 's plan which calls for the establishment of centers to evaluate petitions for would-be africa refugees before they set off for europe .
" the idea of safe third states -lrb- in africa -rrb- would make it nearly impossible for refugees to receive asylum in europe , " wolfgang grenz of amnesty international said .
" it contradicts the fundament of international refugee laws . "
a unified european asylum system will be high on the agenda when the eu 's 25 interior ministers meet in the netherlands on thursday .
there is still debate about whether the eu should set up centers in africa to process immigrants and refugees .
in italy , one of the countries most heavily targeted by illegal immigrants , the government has already begun bilaterial negotiations with libya about such a center .
the eu 's interior ministers will also discuss how europe can improve cooperation with the outside countries that could be involved in a shared eu asylum and immigration policy as well as the fight on terror . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu looks to africa for refugee solution eu justice and interior ministers are expected to discuss plans for an eu asylum center in africa at a meeting this week .

while pawprints are n't required for identification , photos are optional . previously , animal owners were expected to carry their pet 's immunization record when they travelled .
animals also were given a tattoo in their ear .
while the old id measures will be accepted during the transition phase , after 2011 , all animals will need to have a microchip the size of a grain of rice injected which contains a machine-readable number to identify the animal . " total nonsense , " scoffed professor hans-joachim hackbarth of the veterinary school in hanover upon hearing of the new regulations .
he said he ca n't remember the last time he was required to show his own passport when crossing an eu border .
the effort pet owners have to make for their animals to meet eu standards is in no relation to the usefulness of the information , hackbarth said . home is best germany 's national association of veterinarians showed understanding for the eu 's desire to unify pet identification procedures .
after all , countries such as ireland , britain and sweden are rabies-free , and would like to stay that way . but the german society for the protection of animals says the best advice for pet owners is to leave their furry friends at home when they travel . and so that owners do n't have to resort to kennels , they 've even set up a hotline for pet " foster families .

they say putin is using the fight against terror to clamp down on democracy . the protest letter , delivered to us president george w. bush , as well as other government leaders in nato and the european union , accuses putin of turning back to authoritarian rule .
its 115 signatories include prominent politicians such as former czech president vaclav havel , former swedish prime minister carl bildt , and us senators john mccain and joseph r. biden . the most prominent german politicians to sign the letter are green party chief reinhard bütikofer , and the foreign policy expert of the christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , friedbert pflüger .

" we are deeply concerned that these tragic events are being used to further undermine democracy in russia , " said the letter , which was published in full in the financial times deutschland .
" russia 's democratic institutions have always been weak and fragile .
since becoming president in january 2000 , vladimir putin has made them even weaker .

" this week , putin sent a draft law to parliament that will give him the right to nominate regional governors .
he also introduced a draft resolution that would create a new blacklist of terrorist suspects subject to extradition .
both plans have raised concern in the west . putin faces little opposition in the russian parliament , as his united russia party holds more than two-thirds of the seats .
criticism of putin in the russian media is rare , as most independent media organizations have been shut down under his rule . breaking the silence until now , western leaders have been reserved in their criticism , with barely a word being uttered by the eu or the us government to protest human rights violations in chechnya . germany has taken pains to cultivate close ties with russia .
on his last visit there , schröder emphasized the friendly nature of his relationship with putin .
the two leaders presented a united front on the most important questions , including putin 's controversial handling of the chechnya conflict . russia 's un ambassador , andrey denisov , said he took the criticism in the letter seriously , but added that it was important that there be enough " flexibility " in russia 's democracy to allow it to fight terrorism .

the healing power of storytelling the unknown guest of honor frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.09.2004 book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tahar ben jelloun is one of the few well-known arab authors in europe many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all . of the around 120,000 foreign fiction titles translated into german , only about 500 come from the arab world .
it 's a telling statement on the lack of information in the west when it comes to the diversity of the literary landscape in the arab countries . it 's usually literary heavyweights such as egyptian author and nobel prize winner naguib mahfouz or france-based moroccan writer tahar ben jelloun who enjoy relative popularity in europe . but that might be about to change as the spotlight falls on the arab league at this year 's frankfurt book fair .
starting october 6 , visitors to the world 's largest book fair will get the chance to meet and get acquainted with the works of around 200 authors and artists from 17 countries of the 22-member arab league . arab league program under fire but , even as the arab league readies itself for the chance to showcase its literary talent on a western platform , it has been dogged by criticism of its program . a few days ago , moroccan culture minister and poet muhammad al-ashari said he found it hard to understand that arabs , in 22 very diverse nations , were invited to the fair as a whole entity .
morocco , along with kuwait , libya , algeria and iraq , is not participating in the official program of the arab league at the frankfurt book fair . further criticism centers on the disproportionately large share of egyptian authors among the invited guests as well as the lack of initiative to involve authors in exile . the arab league 's program , which it unveiled at a press conference in frankfurt in june , is comprehensive , to say the least : poetry and prose readings , music , film and folkloristic events , discussion forums on globalization , human rights and reform in the arab world . among the invited authors are prominent names in literary circles such as the poets adonis and mahmud darwish , the francophone authors asia djebar and amin maalouf , but also names largely unknown in germany , such as the saudi writers raja alim and abduh khal . censorship still taboo in addition to the exhaustive program , the arab organizers at the frankfurt book fair spoke glowingly of the arab world wanting to initiate an open dialogue with the west as well as discuss controversial questions .
at the same time , the organizers sought to play down or completely avoid grave problems such as the woes of the arab book market and publishing industry . the arab organizers ' unwillingness to discuss pressing issues was apparent when it came to the ubiquitous censorship in the arab world . the director of the muscat book fair in oman , muhammad ali hassan , explained why censorship was necessary .
" our societies have their specialties and traditions that need to be respected , " hassan said .
" everything that attacks arab society or creates turbulence should be forbidden .
our societies still need protection , " he told deutsche welle . that seems to be the dominating opinion among arab book fair circles .
but censorship , which is one of the largest problems within the arab world , is not even mentioned in the official part of the arab league 's frankfurt fair program .
ibrahim al-muallim , president of the arab publishing association , instead claimed that arab publishers have made great strides in the fight against censorship . khalid qubaia , a libyan publisher and official at the arab publishing association , made no bones about the fact that his organization had clear views on censorship . " different benchmarks on censorship prevail in every arab country , " qubaia said .
" the arab publishers ' association agrees with two reasons for censorship : when a book compromises the security of a nation or when it does n't reflect ideas of morality . " lively discussions guaranteed but that 's not a view jabir asfur , director of the egyptian high council for culture , agreed with .
in the arabic daily al-hayat , asfur recently praised german oriental studies and efforts to translate arab literature into german . at the same time asfur was also self-critical .
he wrote that neither individual arab states nor the arab league nor the arab publishers ' association had ever set up initiatives to support the translation of arabic literature into other languages . but , this self-criticism comes late .
on the one hand arab intellectuals have been demanding for years to set up a fund for exactly that purpose .
on the other , uncertainty still surrounds a list with arab books that are meant to be translated into german and english on the occasion of the arab league 's guest performance at the frankfurt book fair . one thing is clear though : suspense and heated discussion are guaranteed this year at the frankfurt book fair . mona naggar -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

morocco , along with kuwait , libya , algeria and iraq , is not participating in the official program of the arab league at the frankfurt book fair . further criticism centers on the disproportionately large share of egyptian authors among the invited guests as well as the lack of initiative to involve authors in exile . the arab league 's program , which it unveiled at a press conference in frankfurt in june , is comprehensive , to say the least : poetry and prose readings , music , film and folkloristic events , discussion forums on globalization , human rights and reform in the arab world . among the invited authors are prominent names in literary circles such as the poets adonis and mahmud darwish , the francophone authors asia djebar and amin maalouf , but also names largely unknown in germany , such as the saudi writers raja alim and abduh khal . censorship still taboo in addition to the exhaustive program , the arab organizers at the frankfurt book fair spoke glowingly of the arab world wanting to initiate an open dialogue with the west as well as discuss controversial questions .
at the same time , the organizers sought to play down or completely avoid grave problems such as the woes of the arab book market and publishing industry . the arab organizers ' unwillingness to discuss pressing issues was apparent when it came to the ubiquitous censorship in the arab world . the director of the muscat book fair in oman , muhammad ali hassan , explained why censorship was necessary .
" our societies have their specialties and traditions that need to be respected , " hassan said .
" everything that attacks arab society or creates turbulence should be forbidden .
our societies still need protection , " he told deutsche welle . that seems to be the dominating opinion among arab book fair circles .
but censorship , which is one of the largest problems within the arab world , is not even mentioned in the official part of the arab league 's frankfurt fair program .
ibrahim al-muallim , president of the arab publishing association , instead claimed that arab publishers have made great strides in the fight against censorship . khalid qubaia , a libyan publisher and official at the arab publishing association , made no bones about the fact that his organization had clear views on censorship . " different benchmarks on censorship prevail in every arab country , " qubaia said .
" the arab publishers ' association agrees with two reasons for censorship : when a book compromises the security of a nation or when it does n't reflect ideas of morality . " lively discussions guaranteed but that 's not a view jabir asfur , director of the egyptian high council for culture , agreed with .
in the arabic daily al-hayat , asfur recently praised german oriental studies and efforts to translate arab literature into german . at the same time asfur was also self-critical .
he wrote that neither individual arab states nor the arab league nor the arab publishers ' association had ever set up initiatives to support the translation of arabic literature into other languages . but , this self-criticism comes late .
on the one hand arab intellectuals have been demanding for years to set up a fund for exactly that purpose .
on the other , uncertainty still surrounds a list with arab books that are meant to be translated into german and english on the occasion of the arab league 's guest performance at the frankfurt book fair . one thing is clear though : suspense and heated discussion are guaranteed this year at the frankfurt book fair . mona naggar -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

the paper said that although the machine guns usually on the vehicles would be taken off , they surely would n't be used to transport the baghdad football team .
instead they would carry heavily armed people through territory endangered by explosive traps and snipers .
the " fuchs , " as the vehicles are called , is war material , delivered by germany to a war area and german politicians will have to ask themselves in future what use of german weapons is desired in which contexts , the paper wrote .
recalling that he won the 2002 election with his anti-war stance , the offenburger tageblatt newspaper said chancellor schröder has thrown his iraq policy overboard .
the supply of the vehicles is direct support of the allied troops , the paper wrote , and hence a direct intervention in the iraq war ; schröder broke his word .
the badische zeitung of freiburg wrote that regardless of all criticism of the war , schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer agree that the west must not fail in iraq , because it would be a catastrophe if the country were to descend into despotism , anarchy or religious fanaticism .
the armored vehicles are to ease , at least temporarily , the pressure on germany to get more involved , the paper opined .
the main-echo newspaper saw the british prime minister marshalling his rank and file behind him because a third election win is more important to them than moral debates .
the discipline in the campaigning ahead would ensure an end to all speculation about treasurer gordon brown replacing prime minister tony blair .
it ’ s an altogether different matter , though whether the british public will continue to accept a prime minister who can ’ t bring himself to say sorry for his iraq policy , the paper said .
the badisches tagblatt of baden-baden noted that blair played on his strength and his personality , which brought him to power triumphantly in 1997 .
hollow-cheeked , passionately and very openly , he admitted personal mistakes , including that he believed claims about iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
blair appeared to be resigned to his political fate being linked to developments in iraq , the paper wrote .
all bad news from there falls back on him and the ratings of his party , it concluded .
the financial times deutschland found blair focusing on the need for education , health care and pension reforms to distract attention from iraq .
despite anger over iraq , the paper still saw a small majority for blair 's labor party in most polls and predicted it would win . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

italy is already cooperating with libya and says such a center should be set up there . italy 's interior minister giuseppe pisanu is convinced the deal his government struck with libya to curb illegal immigration is starting to bear fruit .
he recently traveled to tripoli to meet with his libyan counterpart and discuss the plan further .
following the meeting , he said the results so far are encouraging .
the italian government has been increasingly concerned with the continuous arrivals of illegal immigrants .
holding centers in sicily and on the island of lampedusa have suffered the brunt of the problem and reached bursting point this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat carrying some of the 79 would-be immigrants reaches lampedusa .
pisanu said a proposal to create asylum camps in libya to prevent illegal immigrants from reaching italian shores is moving forward after the italy-libya immigration deal was agreed in august between italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and libyan leader moammar ghadafi . concerns about libya 's human rights record the idea , originally proposed by britain , was revived by italy and germany this summer and is expected to be discussed by eu justice and interior ministers this week . amnesty international has already voiced its concern citing libya 's human rights record .
it also said asylum seekers must be given adequate protection .
as part of the agreement , the italian government is planning to send 150 police officers to libya to help train their libyan counterparts .
the training exercises are expected to last one month and are likely to start in november . in addition , tripoli will be purchasing military equipment and vehicles from italy .
pisanu said this will be possible following the european union 's recent decision to lift its embargo on the sale of military equipment to libya . dropping embargo will aid libyan efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian soldiers help a weak and sick refugee from his boat in lampedusa harbor .
after eu foreign ministers officially do away with the embargo at a meeting scheduled for oct .
11 and oct .
12 in luxembourg , italy will be able to sell to libya airplanes , boats , helicopters and jeeps needed to block the trafficking of illegal immigrants .
the eu decision followed pressure by italy which wanted libya to make more efforts in controlling its coastline to stop human traffickers sending boatloads of illegal immigrants across the sea to italy .
in the past , libya was forced to borrow such vehicles from rome .
libya 's thousands of kilometers of desert and sea frontiers are difficult to police , but both countries have a strong interest in bringing the flood of illegal immigrants from other parts of africa to libya under control . sabina castelfranco -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy and libya tackle illegal immigration italian prime minister silvio berlusconi met libyan leader moammar gadhafi on wednesday for talks on stemming the tide of illegal immigrants using the north african country as a transit point .

but the move to berlin has fused what is often billed as the world 's biggest music trade fair with new life .

but the move to berlin has fused what is often billed as the world 's biggest music trade fair with new life .
" it 's not simply moving from one city to another , but rather a real fresh start , " said popkomm 's general manager ralf kleinhenz .
despite cologne 's role as an important media center in germany , the number of visitors to the fair had dropped dramatically in recent years .
opening with a big concert on tuesday night , organizers hope berlin - which has been anointed germany 's music capital - will increase popkomm 's international profile .
there will be 661 exhibitors at the three-day trade fair from 41 different countries .
along with an industry conference , there will be 400 hours of live music at concerts and club events open to the general public .
during the week , german acts like rappers die fantastischen vier and rockers sportfreunde stiller will perform alongside international artists including world-renowned techno djs and veteran gangsta rapper ice-t , who has a new group called the machine .
but as berliners enjoy a few days of top-shelf music , industry insiders will be discussing the still uncertain future of the music business .
the future is digital topping the agenda is how to deal with the rapidly evolving nature of music .
as fewer people buy cds and move their music collections to their home computers , the industry is still grappling with piracy and copyright issues for digital formats like mp3s .
some estimates have put the drop in sales for the german music sector at around 40 percent since 1997 .
most in the industry blame internet file-sharing networks that were modeled on napster .
" what 's changing at the moment is how we deal with music , " kleinhenz said .
" and that raises questions not only of an economic nature , but also cultural and societal questions . "
in germany , one of the top current questions is how best to support local artists .
some are calling for a radio quota for german musicians modeled on france 's system .
there , at least 40 percent of all radio airtime is reserved for french acts .
the initiative has gained the support of some german politicians , including green party parliamentarian antje vollmer .
" we owe it to our cultural identity , " vollmer said , according to dpa news agency .
" it has nothing to do with being overly german .
other countries naturally take care of their own artists . "
vollmer has called for an open parliamentary debate on the matter on wednesday .
not waiting for help many musicians agree more needs to be done to promote german acts , but they are n't waiting for the government or industry to help them out .
eike herwig , the drummer for the punk rock band the donots , said his group makes a special effort to promote up-and-coming bands .
besides setting up a special section highlighting new groups on their web site , the donots are also giving them opening spots on their latest tour .

-lrb- eike is behind them . -rrb-
" i think it 's important to give german musicians more attention , " herwig told dw-world .
" a lot of the time on german radio the focus is on bands from america and england . "
tim renner from record label motor music backs the idea of supporting local acts , but is leery of a legally mandated quota .
during popkomm the label 's new radio station motorfm will broadcast only german bands and musicians like canadian electro-trash queen peaches , who have a connection to germany .
thinking globally and locally renner used to head up the german division of universal music , but he and the company parted ways amid disagreement over the direction the label was heading .
whereas renner always thought supporting local german musicians would be the best way to approach the domestic market , the head office of the company wanted to focus more on major international acts that could be sold globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim renner " i get mixed feelings when i hear the word quota , " renner told dw-world .
" they 'll tell you there 's not enough good stuff out there .
that 's not true .
they need to promote the cultural diversity , but any quota will mean they 've failed to find a radio concept . "
he said if motorfm gets a permanent frequency to broadcast in berlin the station will continue to support local artists , but it will concentrate on simply playing good music regardless of its origin .
renner is also hoping to pioneer new ways to make new digital technologies a boon instead of a bane for the industry .
he said the station would aim to make every song played available to download legally .
besides an internet portal along the lines of the apple itunes music store , he said he hoped to have a totally mobile business model , including being able to send a sms text message from your phone to purchase the song being played on your car stereo .

" we will mobilize the workforce so that these stores stay a part of karstadt , " franziska wiethold , a member of verdi 's national executive board , told the berliner zeitung .
she also said the reorganization would end up putting karstadt 's future in danger rather than stabilizing it .
the sale of small and medium sized stores was one part of the € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.72 billion -rrb- restructuring plan the german retail giant announced tuesday .
additionally , the company proposed a € 500 million capital increase and cuts in social programs and vacation for employees .
" the core of the program is the refocusing of the group on its strengths and core competencies , " the company said in a statement .
" the management plans , on the basis of the reorientation , to achieve markedly positive earnings as early as the 2005 fiscal year . "
the company will also sell its 82 percent stake in a joint venture with coffeehouse chain starbucks , in addition to parting with its specialist runners point , golf house , sinnleffers and wehmeyer outlets in an effort to concentrate on its core retail activities .
the company 's core retail business portfolio is worth around € 4.5 billion in turnover while those non-core activities set to be abandoned are worth € 700 million in turnover .
" these steps are inevitable and also overdue , " chief executive christoph achenbach told a news conference in the western city of essen .
trade unions criticize plans the company 's plan has been criticized by the verdi service workers union , who called the closing of department stores avoidable .
the restructuring " endangers the jobs of thousands of people , and above all does not point to a solid future in the department store area , " a union statement said .
karstadtquelle has been hemorrhaging money as german consumers continue to show reluctance in spending during the country 's gradual emergence from three years of economic stagnation .
while exports within a stronger world economy have begun to drive an upturn in fortunes of late , germany 's domestic demand and the consumer environment have remained stagnant , with unemployment above 10 percent and the government moving to trim social programs .
in addition to slow retail sales , essen-based karstadtquelle 's performance has been hit recently by losses at the thomas cook tourism company , which it co-owns with german airline lufthansa .
retail sales expected to drop the company also released figures that showed the state of the concern .
karstadtquelle is expected to post a pre-tax loss of € 1.3 billion this year and forecasts a drop in retail sales of between 4.5 and 5 percent .
the company also revealed that it would not be paying a dividend this year or the next .
in august , the company reported a second quarter net loss of € 188 million -lrb- $ 231 million -rrb- on slumping retail sales .
tuesday 's statement did not mention any imminent job cuts related to the restructuring , but karstadtquelle said in july that it planned to cut about 4,000 jobs from its work force of 47,000 full- and part-time employees by the end of 2006 karstadtquelle shares , which dropped by more than 6 percent monday at € 13.38 a share , were up 5.7 percent at € 14.14 by noon on the frankfurt stock exchange . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karstadtquelle to cut more jobs essen-based retailer karstadtquelle will cut an additional 4,000 jobs over the next two years , the company said in a statement .

the sale of small and medium sized stores was one part of the € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.72 billion -rrb- restructuring plan the german retail giant announced tuesday .
additionally , the company proposed a € 500 million capital increase and cuts in social programs and vacation for employees .
" the core of the program is the refocusing of the group on its strengths and core competencies , " the company said in a statement .
" the management plans , on the basis of the reorientation , to achieve markedly positive earnings as early as the 2005 fiscal year . "
the company will also sell its 82 percent stake in a joint venture with coffeehouse chain starbucks , in addition to parting with its specialist runners point , golf house , sinnleffers and wehmeyer outlets in an effort to concentrate on its core retail activities .
the company 's core retail business portfolio is worth around € 4.5 billion in turnover while those non-core activities set to be abandoned are worth € 700 million in turnover .
" these steps are inevitable and also overdue , " chief executive christoph achenbach told a news conference in the western city of essen .
trade unions criticize plans the company 's plan has been criticized by the verdi service workers union , who called the closing of department stores avoidable .
the restructuring " endangers the jobs of thousands of people , and above all does not point to a solid future in the department store area , " a union statement said .
karstadtquelle has been hemorrhaging money as german consumers continue to show reluctance in spending during the country 's gradual emergence from three years of economic stagnation .
while exports within a stronger world economy have begun to drive an upturn in fortunes of late , germany 's domestic demand and the consumer environment have remained stagnant , with unemployment above 10 percent and the government moving to trim social programs .
in addition to slow retail sales , essen-based karstadtquelle 's performance has been hit recently by losses at the thomas cook tourism company , which it co-owns with german airline lufthansa .
retail sales expected to drop the company also released figures that showed the state of the concern .
karstadtquelle is expected to post a pre-tax loss of € 1.3 billion this year and forecasts a drop in retail sales of between 4.5 and 5 percent .
the company also revealed that it would not be paying a dividend this year or the next .

dw-world readers this week commented on the race for the white house and president bush 's negative foreign policy record abroad . your point of view is interesting , i lived in europe for eight years and appreciate your points of view ; it 's great to see that the billions of dollars we spent through the marshal plan has produced peaceful differences .
two things you overlook are : only us citizens vote , and the economy , not foreign policy will determine the outcome of the election .
we 've been through years and years of anti-americanism , so what else is new .
polls in other countries mean nothing .
the americans living overseas vote in their particular state so even though they may be 80 % democrats , scattered over 50 states i seriously doubt they will have the kind of impact you describe - frank shipp why does n't your rag of a newspaper conduct a poll of americans asking them what they think of germany and mr. schröder ?
you germans can take your smug , self-satisfied views and shove them .
how 's that for candor , heinz ?
if germans had any sense of decency at all , they would shut their mouths before dispensing any advice - let alone moral advice - to george bush or to america .
any " crimes " america has ever committed pale by comparison to what you animals did not once , but twice in the last century .
your leaders kaiser willie and hitler were personally responsible for at least thirty million deaths , and you have the balls to ask germans what they think about my president and my country ? - john huettner violence destroyed our world trade center but that can be rebuilt .
george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .
george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .
we ca n't take it anymore . - lucy cole , alamo , california most americans are oblivious to their reception abroad , and i blame the american media for much of this ignorance .
bush 's record at home is remarkably but undeservedly good . - jeffrey hamill i am an a citizen of the united states and love my country but detest its current " leadership . "
our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .
if iraq truly had nothing to hide , then why not comply ?
should we have waited another 10 years while saddam continued to torture his own people ?
how long is too long ?
george w. bush is the only leader in the world strong enough to draw the line in the sand and face these threats head-on .
it may be years before this is truly understood .
the un is a weak , spineless organization that failed miserably to stop saddam .
jacques chirac is also weak , and could never stand up to terrorists the way mr. bush has .
i 'd rather see us fight terrorists , alone if we have to , on the streets of baghdad instead of being attacked on the streets of boston or elsewhere .
i will proudly vote for president george w. bush on nov .
2nd .
and many here agree with me , and i would prepare for a second bush term now . - steve bush has been a complete disaster internationally and an embarrassment to those of us in the us who long for a return to diplomacy to solve problems .
this country is , i 'm afraid , moving into a very dangerous unilateralism on a wide range of subjects .
this includes our refusal to join the eu and others in the international criminal court and kyoto .
i hate to say it , but i fear we are resorting back to pre-wwii us autonomy , hegemony and unilateralism in our relations with the world .
i think this could be a semi-permanent condition and i do n't know that even electing kerry will solve it .
americans are , unfortunately turning increasingly inward and are not taking criticism and disagreement from other nations and organizations very well .
in fact , they increasingly appear to be fighting back and downright dismissive of allies and others who voice disagreement with our policies .
it appears that being the only military " super-power " in the world is going to our heads .
remember the adage , " absolute power corrupts , absolutely " ! !
it appears to be true ! - trevor steven taylor you need to understand that most americans know that the us is just about the only country in the world that can " go it alone . "
for that reason , we americans do n't care what the world thinks about us or our international policies .
the independent streak of the americans is actually increased when we hear that a large percentage of the germans and french disagrees with something the us is doing , no matter what it is .
as soon as the us does not require energy from foreign sources , we may just resign from the united nations .
according to the polls , that 's the goal of more than half the americans , and those are the ones who support george w. bush .
thank you . - james l. reid , usa i believe george w. bush has hindered the spread of peace throughout the world .
i believe he does not consider that others world-wide have a right to govern their own area and have a clearer view of the big picture .
i also believe he was not taught to " play nice with others " when he was a child .
he has the arrogant , smirk of a bully who was born into privilege and has never had to consider the other person 's rights or feelings . - karen seeger , usa the only opinion that counts will be the election results in november .
the eu public is generally misinformed by a biased media that spews constant anti-bush information .
the net result is an anti-bush eu public . - boyd lawrence , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .
seeing the effects of bush 's foreign policy firsthand should boost kerry with expatriate voters , says dw-world 's marc young .

27 , 2004 -rrb- a kerry conundrum for schröder the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .

dw-world readers this week commented on the race for the white house and president bush 's negative foreign policy record abroad . your point of view is interesting , i lived in europe for eight years and appreciate your points of view ; it 's great to see that the billions of dollars we spent through the marshal plan has produced peaceful differences .
two things you overlook are : only us citizens vote , and the economy , not foreign policy will determine the outcome of the election .
we 've been through years and years of anti-americanism , so what else is new .
polls in other countries mean nothing .
the americans living overseas vote in their particular state so even though they may be 80 % democrats , scattered over 50 states i seriously doubt they will have the kind of impact you describe - frank shipp why does n't your rag of a newspaper conduct a poll of americans asking them what they think of germany and mr. schröder ?
you germans can take your smug , self-satisfied views and shove them .
how 's that for candor , heinz ?
if germans had any sense of decency at all , they would shut their mouths before dispensing any advice - let alone moral advice - to george bush or to america .
any " crimes " america has ever committed pale by comparison to what you animals did not once , but twice in the last century .
your leaders kaiser willie and hitler were personally responsible for at least thirty million deaths , and you have the balls to ask germans what they think about my president and my country ? - john huettner violence destroyed our world trade center but that can be rebuilt .
george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .
george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .
we ca n't take it anymore . - lucy cole , alamo , california most americans are oblivious to their reception abroad , and i blame the american media for much of this ignorance .
bush 's record at home is remarkably but undeservedly good . - jeffrey hamill i am an a citizen of the united states and love my country but detest its current " leadership . "
our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .
if iraq truly had nothing to hide , then why not comply ?
should we have waited another 10 years while saddam continued to torture his own people ?
how long is too long ?
george w. bush is the only leader in the world strong enough to draw the line in the sand and face these threats head-on .
it may be years before this is truly understood .
the un is a weak , spineless organization that failed miserably to stop saddam .
jacques chirac is also weak , and could never stand up to terrorists the way mr. bush has .
i 'd rather see us fight terrorists , alone if we have to , on the streets of baghdad instead of being attacked on the streets of boston or elsewhere .
i will proudly vote for president george w. bush on nov .
2nd .
and many here agree with me , and i would prepare for a second bush term now . - steve bush has been a complete disaster internationally and an embarrassment to those of us in the us who long for a return to diplomacy to solve problems .
this country is , i 'm afraid , moving into a very dangerous unilateralism on a wide range of subjects .
this includes our refusal to join the eu and others in the international criminal court and kyoto .
i hate to say it , but i fear we are resorting back to pre-wwii us autonomy , hegemony and unilateralism in our relations with the world .
i think this could be a semi-permanent condition and i do n't know that even electing kerry will solve it .
americans are , unfortunately turning increasingly inward and are not taking criticism and disagreement from other nations and organizations very well .
in fact , they increasingly appear to be fighting back and downright dismissive of allies and others who voice disagreement with our policies .
it appears that being the only military " super-power " in the world is going to our heads .
remember the adage , " absolute power corrupts , absolutely " ! !
it appears to be true ! - trevor steven taylor you need to understand that most americans know that the us is just about the only country in the world that can " go it alone . "
for that reason , we americans do n't care what the world thinks about us or our international policies .
the independent streak of the americans is actually increased when we hear that a large percentage of the germans and french disagrees with something the us is doing , no matter what it is .
as soon as the us does not require energy from foreign sources , we may just resign from the united nations .
according to the polls , that 's the goal of more than half the americans , and those are the ones who support george w. bush .
thank you . - james l. reid , usa i believe george w. bush has hindered the spread of peace throughout the world .
i believe he does not consider that others world-wide have a right to govern their own area and have a clearer view of the big picture .
i also believe he was not taught to " play nice with others " when he was a child .
he has the arrogant , smirk of a bully who was born into privilege and has never had to consider the other person 's rights or feelings . - karen seeger , usa the only opinion that counts will be the election results in november .
the eu public is generally misinformed by a biased media that spews constant anti-bush information .
the net result is an anti-bush eu public . - boyd lawrence , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .
seeing the effects of bush 's foreign policy firsthand should boost kerry with expatriate voters , says dw-world 's marc young .

george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .
george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .
we ca n't take it anymore . - lucy cole , alamo , california most americans are oblivious to their reception abroad , and i blame the american media for much of this ignorance .
bush 's record at home is remarkably but undeservedly good . - jeffrey hamill i am an a citizen of the united states and love my country but detest its current " leadership . "
our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .
if iraq truly had nothing to hide , then why not comply ?
should we have waited another 10 years while saddam continued to torture his own people ?
how long is too long ?
george w. bush is the only leader in the world strong enough to draw the line in the sand and face these threats head-on .
it may be years before this is truly understood .
the un is a weak , spineless organization that failed miserably to stop saddam .
jacques chirac is also weak , and could never stand up to terrorists the way mr. bush has .
i 'd rather see us fight terrorists , alone if we have to , on the streets of baghdad instead of being attacked on the streets of boston or elsewhere .
i will proudly vote for president george w. bush on nov .
2nd .
and many here agree with me , and i would prepare for a second bush term now . - steve bush has been a complete disaster internationally and an embarrassment to those of us in the us who long for a return to diplomacy to solve problems .
this country is , i 'm afraid , moving into a very dangerous unilateralism on a wide range of subjects .
this includes our refusal to join the eu and others in the international criminal court and kyoto .
i hate to say it , but i fear we are resorting back to pre-wwii us autonomy , hegemony and unilateralism in our relations with the world .
i think this could be a semi-permanent condition and i do n't know that even electing kerry will solve it .
americans are , unfortunately turning increasingly inward and are not taking criticism and disagreement from other nations and organizations very well .
in fact , they increasingly appear to be fighting back and downright dismissive of allies and others who voice disagreement with our policies .
it appears that being the only military " super-power " in the world is going to our heads .
remember the adage , " absolute power corrupts , absolutely " ! !
it appears to be true ! - trevor steven taylor you need to understand that most americans know that the us is just about the only country in the world that can " go it alone . "
for that reason , we americans do n't care what the world thinks about us or our international policies .
the independent streak of the americans is actually increased when we hear that a large percentage of the germans and french disagrees with something the us is doing , no matter what it is .
as soon as the us does not require energy from foreign sources , we may just resign from the united nations .
according to the polls , that 's the goal of more than half the americans , and those are the ones who support george w. bush .
thank you . - james l. reid , usa i believe george w. bush has hindered the spread of peace throughout the world .
i believe he does not consider that others world-wide have a right to govern their own area and have a clearer view of the big picture .
i also believe he was not taught to " play nice with others " when he was a child .
he has the arrogant , smirk of a bully who was born into privilege and has never had to consider the other person 's rights or feelings . - karen seeger , usa the only opinion that counts will be the election results in november .
the eu public is generally misinformed by a biased media that spews constant anti-bush information .
the net result is an anti-bush eu public . - boyd lawrence , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .
seeing the effects of bush 's foreign policy firsthand should boost kerry with expatriate voters , says dw-world 's marc young .
-lrb- sept .
27 , 2004 -rrb- a kerry conundrum for schröder the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .
however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier .

it 's all possible at a new internet-based virtual stock market -lrb- vsm -rrb- aimed at predicting who will be among the next nobel prize winners .
the vsm is an economic experiment by the university of frankfurt , to see how well short- and medium-term market developments can be predicted .
the stocks in nobel candidates represent a bet on the outcome of future market situations - the higher the value of the stock , the more probable the market situation is .
the participants in the nobel vsm do n't have to concern themselves with economic models , however .
nor is any real money riding on this particular stock market .
but the most successful investors stand to win dividends in the form of 50 prizes , including an ibm laptop .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 2004 frankfurt book fair opinion : open , sesame !
the healing power of storytelling the unknown guest of honor frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.09.2004 book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tahar ben jelloun is one of the few well-known arab authors in europe many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all . of the around 120,000 foreign fiction titles translated into german , only about 500 come from the arab world .
it 's a telling statement on the lack of information in the west when it comes to the diversity of the literary landscape in the arab countries . it 's usually literary heavyweights such as egyptian author and nobel prize winner naguib mahfouz or france-based moroccan writer tahar ben jelloun who enjoy relative popularity in europe . but that might be about to change as the spotlight falls on the arab league at this year 's frankfurt book fair .
starting october 6 , visitors to the world 's largest book fair will get the chance to meet and get acquainted with the works of around 200 authors and artists from 17 countries of the 22-member arab league . arab league program under fire but , even as the arab league readies itself for the chance to showcase its literary talent on a western platform , it has been dogged by criticism of its program . a few days ago , moroccan culture minister and poet muhammad al-ashari said he found it hard to understand that arabs , in 22 very diverse nations , were invited to the fair as a whole entity .
morocco , along with kuwait , libya , algeria and iraq , is not participating in the official program of the arab league at the frankfurt book fair . further criticism centers on the disproportionately large share of egyptian authors among the invited guests as well as the lack of initiative to involve authors in exile . the arab league 's program , which it unveiled at a press conference in frankfurt in june , is comprehensive , to say the least : poetry and prose readings , music , film and folkloristic events , discussion forums on globalization , human rights and reform in the arab world . among the invited authors are prominent names in literary circles such as the poets adonis and mahmud darwish , the francophone authors asia djebar and amin maalouf , but also names largely unknown in germany , such as the saudi writers raja alim and abduh khal . censorship still taboo in addition to the exhaustive program , the arab organizers at the frankfurt book fair spoke glowingly of the arab world wanting to initiate an open dialogue with the west as well as discuss controversial questions .
at the same time , the organizers sought to play down or completely avoid grave problems such as the woes of the arab book market and publishing industry . the arab organizers ' unwillingness to discuss pressing issues was apparent when it came to the ubiquitous censorship in the arab world . the director of the muscat book fair in oman , muhammad ali hassan , explained why censorship was necessary .
" our societies have their specialties and traditions that need to be respected , " hassan said .
" everything that attacks arab society or creates turbulence should be forbidden .
our societies still need protection , " he told deutsche welle . that seems to be the dominating opinion among arab book fair circles .
but censorship , which is one of the largest problems within the arab world , is not even mentioned in the official part of the arab league 's frankfurt fair program .
ibrahim al-muallim , president of the arab publishing association , instead claimed that arab publishers have made great strides in the fight against censorship . khalid qubaia , a libyan publisher and official at the arab publishing association , made no bones about the fact that his organization had clear views on censorship . " different benchmarks on censorship prevail in every arab country , " qubaia said .
" the arab publishers ' association agrees with two reasons for censorship : when a book compromises the security of a nation or when it does n't reflect ideas of morality . " lively discussions guaranteed but that 's not a view jabir asfur , director of the egyptian high council for culture , agreed with .
in the arabic daily al-hayat , asfur recently praised german oriental studies and efforts to translate arab literature into german . at the same time asfur was also self-critical .
he wrote that neither individual arab states nor the arab league nor the arab publishers ' association had ever set up initiatives to support the translation of arabic literature into other languages . but , this self-criticism comes late .
on the one hand arab intellectuals have been demanding for years to set up a fund for exactly that purpose .
on the other , uncertainty still surrounds a list with arab books that are meant to be translated into german and english on the occasion of the arab league 's guest performance at the frankfurt book fair . one thing is clear though : suspense and heated discussion are guaranteed this year at the frankfurt book fair . mona naggar -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

26 , 2004 -rrb- building bridges with books building a bridge between the middle east and the west is no small task , but its something the organizers of this year 's book fair in frankfurt hope to accomplish .

its 115 signatories include prominent politicians such as former czech president vaclav havel , former swedish prime minister carl bildt , and us senators john mccain and joseph r. biden . the most prominent german politicians to sign the letter are green party chief reinhard bütikofer , and the foreign policy expert of the christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , friedbert pflüger .

" we are deeply concerned that these tragic events are being used to further undermine democracy in russia , " said the letter , which was published in full in the financial times deutschland .
" russia 's democratic institutions have always been weak and fragile .
since becoming president in january 2000 , vladimir putin has made them even weaker .

" this week , putin sent a draft law to parliament that will give him the right to nominate regional governors .
he also introduced a draft resolution that would create a new blacklist of terrorist suspects subject to extradition .
both plans have raised concern in the west . putin faces little opposition in the russian parliament , as his united russia party holds more than two-thirds of the seats .
criticism of putin in the russian media is rare , as most independent media organizations have been shut down under his rule . breaking the silence until now , western leaders have been reserved in their criticism , with barely a word being uttered by the eu or the us government to protest human rights violations in chechnya . germany has taken pains to cultivate close ties with russia .
on his last visit there , schröder emphasized the friendly nature of his relationship with putin .
the two leaders presented a united front on the most important questions , including putin 's controversial handling of the chechnya conflict . russia 's un ambassador , andrey denisov , said he took the criticism in the letter seriously , but added that it was important that there be enough " flexibility " in russia 's democracy to allow it to fight terrorism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.09.2004 german press review : armored foxes to iraq the proposed sale to iraq 's new armed forces of 20 fuchs armored personnel carriers and 100 light military trucks and blair 's speech at his party 's conference dominated german editorials on wednesday . is the social democratic-green party government coalition losing its arms exports innocence ? asked national daily die welt .
the paper said that although the machine guns usually on the vehicles would be taken off , they surely would n't be used to transport the baghdad football team .
instead they would carry heavily armed people through territory endangered by explosive traps and snipers .
the " fuchs , " as the vehicles are called , is war material , delivered by germany to a war area and german politicians will have to ask themselves in future what use of german weapons is desired in which contexts , the paper wrote .
recalling that he won the 2002 election with his anti-war stance , the offenburger tageblatt newspaper said chancellor schröder has thrown his iraq policy overboard .
the supply of the vehicles is direct support of the allied troops , the paper wrote , and hence a direct intervention in the iraq war ; schröder broke his word .
the badische zeitung of freiburg wrote that regardless of all criticism of the war , schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer agree that the west must not fail in iraq , because it would be a catastrophe if the country were to descend into despotism , anarchy or religious fanaticism .
the armored vehicles are to ease , at least temporarily , the pressure on germany to get more involved , the paper opined .
the main-echo newspaper saw the british prime minister marshalling his rank and file behind him because a third election win is more important to them than moral debates .
the discipline in the campaigning ahead would ensure an end to all speculation about treasurer gordon brown replacing prime minister tony blair .
it ’ s an altogether different matter , though whether the british public will continue to accept a prime minister who can ’ t bring himself to say sorry for his iraq policy , the paper said .
the badisches tagblatt of baden-baden noted that blair played on his strength and his personality , which brought him to power triumphantly in 1997 .
hollow-cheeked , passionately and very openly , he admitted personal mistakes , including that he believed claims about iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
blair appeared to be resigned to his political fate being linked to developments in iraq , the paper wrote .
all bad news from there falls back on him and the ratings of his party , it concluded .
the financial times deutschland found blair focusing on the need for education , health care and pension reforms to distract attention from iraq .
despite anger over iraq , the paper still saw a small majority for blair 's labor party in most polls and predicted it would win . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the healing power of storytelling the unknown guest of honor frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.09.2004 book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tahar ben jelloun is one of the few well-known arab authors in europe many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all . of the around 120,000 foreign fiction titles translated into german , only about 500 come from the arab world .
it 's a telling statement on the lack of information in the west when it comes to the diversity of the literary landscape in the arab countries . it 's usually literary heavyweights such as egyptian author and nobel prize winner naguib mahfouz or france-based moroccan writer tahar ben jelloun who enjoy relative popularity in europe . but that might be about to change as the spotlight falls on the arab league at this year 's frankfurt book fair .
starting october 6 , visitors to the world 's largest book fair will get the chance to meet and get acquainted with the works of around 200 authors and artists from 17 countries of the 22-member arab league . arab league program under fire but , even as the arab league readies itself for the chance to showcase its literary talent on a western platform , it has been dogged by criticism of its program . a few days ago , moroccan culture minister and poet muhammad al-ashari said he found it hard to understand that arabs , in 22 very diverse nations , were invited to the fair as a whole entity .
morocco , along with kuwait , libya , algeria and iraq , is not participating in the official program of the arab league at the frankfurt book fair . further criticism centers on the disproportionately large share of egyptian authors among the invited guests as well as the lack of initiative to involve authors in exile . the arab league 's program , which it unveiled at a press conference in frankfurt in june , is comprehensive , to say the least : poetry and prose readings , music , film and folkloristic events , discussion forums on globalization , human rights and reform in the arab world . among the invited authors are prominent names in literary circles such as the poets adonis and mahmud darwish , the francophone authors asia djebar and amin maalouf , but also names largely unknown in germany , such as the saudi writers raja alim and abduh khal . censorship still taboo in addition to the exhaustive program , the arab organizers at the frankfurt book fair spoke glowingly of the arab world wanting to initiate an open dialogue with the west as well as discuss controversial questions .
at the same time , the organizers sought to play down or completely avoid grave problems such as the woes of the arab book market and publishing industry . the arab organizers ' unwillingness to discuss pressing issues was apparent when it came to the ubiquitous censorship in the arab world . the director of the muscat book fair in oman , muhammad ali hassan , explained why censorship was necessary .
" our societies have their specialties and traditions that need to be respected , " hassan said .
" everything that attacks arab society or creates turbulence should be forbidden .
our societies still need protection , " he told deutsche welle . that seems to be the dominating opinion among arab book fair circles .
but censorship , which is one of the largest problems within the arab world , is not even mentioned in the official part of the arab league 's frankfurt fair program .
ibrahim al-muallim , president of the arab publishing association , instead claimed that arab publishers have made great strides in the fight against censorship . khalid qubaia , a libyan publisher and official at the arab publishing association , made no bones about the fact that his organization had clear views on censorship . " different benchmarks on censorship prevail in every arab country , " qubaia said .
" the arab publishers ' association agrees with two reasons for censorship : when a book compromises the security of a nation or when it does n't reflect ideas of morality . " lively discussions guaranteed but that 's not a view jabir asfur , director of the egyptian high council for culture , agreed with .
in the arabic daily al-hayat , asfur recently praised german oriental studies and efforts to translate arab literature into german . at the same time asfur was also self-critical .
he wrote that neither individual arab states nor the arab league nor the arab publishers ' association had ever set up initiatives to support the translation of arabic literature into other languages . but , this self-criticism comes late .
on the one hand arab intellectuals have been demanding for years to set up a fund for exactly that purpose .
on the other , uncertainty still surrounds a list with arab books that are meant to be translated into german and english on the occasion of the arab league 's guest performance at the frankfurt book fair . one thing is clear though : suspense and heated discussion are guaranteed this year at the frankfurt book fair . mona naggar -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

starting october 6 , visitors to the world 's largest book fair will get the chance to meet and get acquainted with the works of around 200 authors and artists from 17 countries of the 22-member arab league . arab league program under fire but , even as the arab league readies itself for the chance to showcase its literary talent on a western platform , it has been dogged by criticism of its program . a few days ago , moroccan culture minister and poet muhammad al-ashari said he found it hard to understand that arabs , in 22 very diverse nations , were invited to the fair as a whole entity .
morocco , along with kuwait , libya , algeria and iraq , is not participating in the official program of the arab league at the frankfurt book fair . further criticism centers on the disproportionately large share of egyptian authors among the invited guests as well as the lack of initiative to involve authors in exile . the arab league 's program , which it unveiled at a press conference in frankfurt in june , is comprehensive , to say the least : poetry and prose readings , music , film and folkloristic events , discussion forums on globalization , human rights and reform in the arab world . among the invited authors are prominent names in literary circles such as the poets adonis and mahmud darwish , the francophone authors asia djebar and amin maalouf , but also names largely unknown in germany , such as the saudi writers raja alim and abduh khal . censorship still taboo in addition to the exhaustive program , the arab organizers at the frankfurt book fair spoke glowingly of the arab world wanting to initiate an open dialogue with the west as well as discuss controversial questions .
at the same time , the organizers sought to play down or completely avoid grave problems such as the woes of the arab book market and publishing industry . the arab organizers ' unwillingness to discuss pressing issues was apparent when it came to the ubiquitous censorship in the arab world . the director of the muscat book fair in oman , muhammad ali hassan , explained why censorship was necessary .
" our societies have their specialties and traditions that need to be respected , " hassan said .
" everything that attacks arab society or creates turbulence should be forbidden .
our societies still need protection , " he told deutsche welle . that seems to be the dominating opinion among arab book fair circles .
but censorship , which is one of the largest problems within the arab world , is not even mentioned in the official part of the arab league 's frankfurt fair program .
ibrahim al-muallim , president of the arab publishing association , instead claimed that arab publishers have made great strides in the fight against censorship . khalid qubaia , a libyan publisher and official at the arab publishing association , made no bones about the fact that his organization had clear views on censorship . " different benchmarks on censorship prevail in every arab country , " qubaia said .
" the arab publishers ' association agrees with two reasons for censorship : when a book compromises the security of a nation or when it does n't reflect ideas of morality . " lively discussions guaranteed but that 's not a view jabir asfur , director of the egyptian high council for culture , agreed with .
in the arabic daily al-hayat , asfur recently praised german oriental studies and efforts to translate arab literature into german . at the same time asfur was also self-critical .
he wrote that neither individual arab states nor the arab league nor the arab publishers ' association had ever set up initiatives to support the translation of arabic literature into other languages . but , this self-criticism comes late .
on the one hand arab intellectuals have been demanding for years to set up a fund for exactly that purpose .
on the other , uncertainty still surrounds a list with arab books that are meant to be translated into german and english on the occasion of the arab league 's guest performance at the frankfurt book fair . one thing is clear though : suspense and heated discussion are guaranteed this year at the frankfurt book fair . mona naggar -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.09.2004 western leaders criticize putin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under fire more than 100 american and european foreign policy experts signed a letter protesting against russian president vladimir putin 's leadership .
they say putin is using the fight against terror to clamp down on democracy . the protest letter , delivered to us president george w. bush , as well as other government leaders in nato and the european union , accuses putin of turning back to authoritarian rule .
its 115 signatories include prominent politicians such as former czech president vaclav havel , former swedish prime minister carl bildt , and us senators john mccain and joseph r. biden . the most prominent german politicians to sign the letter are green party chief reinhard bütikofer , and the foreign policy expert of the christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , friedbert pflüger .
no politicians from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- signed it . democracy in name only ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian solders with rifles outside the school in beslan where over 300 students and adults were held hostage by chechen attackers the letter expresses concern that putin is using terrorist attacks by chechen separatists , including the recent school hostage drama in beslan , as a pretext for extending his control over political life in russia . " we are deeply concerned that these tragic events are being used to further undermine democracy in russia , " said the letter , which was published in full in the financial times deutschland .
" russia 's democratic institutions have always been weak and fragile .
since becoming president in january 2000 , vladimir putin has made them even weaker . " the letter calls on western countries to place themselves " unambiguously on the side of democratic forces in russia . " this week , putin sent a draft law to parliament that will give him the right to nominate regional governors .
he also introduced a draft resolution that would create a new blacklist of terrorist suspects subject to extradition .
both plans have raised concern in the west . putin faces little opposition in the russian parliament , as his united russia party holds more than two-thirds of the seats .
criticism of putin in the russian media is rare , as most independent media organizations have been shut down under his rule . breaking the silence until now , western leaders have been reserved in their criticism , with barely a word being uttered by the eu or the us government to protest human rights violations in chechnya . germany has taken pains to cultivate close ties with russia .
on his last visit there , schröder emphasized the friendly nature of his relationship with putin .
the two leaders presented a united front on the most important questions , including putin 's controversial handling of the chechnya conflict . russia 's un ambassador , andrey denisov , said he took the criticism in the letter seriously , but added that it was important that there be enough " flexibility " in russia 's democracy to allow it to fight terrorism . " yes , we have to take seriously such opinions because they are being expressed by such distinguished persons , " denisov said .
" we have to prove to our partners that they are mistaken or they are exaggerating the present state of affairs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.09.2004 western leaders criticize putin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under fire more than 100 american and european foreign policy experts signed a letter protesting against russian president vladimir putin 's leadership .
they say putin is using the fight against terror to clamp down on democracy . the protest letter , delivered to us president george w. bush , as well as other government leaders in nato and the european union , accuses putin of turning back to authoritarian rule .
its 115 signatories include prominent politicians such as former czech president vaclav havel , former swedish prime minister carl bildt , and us senators john mccain and joseph r. biden . the most prominent german politicians to sign the letter are green party chief reinhard bütikofer , and the foreign policy expert of the christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , friedbert pflüger .
no politicians from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- signed it . democracy in name only ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian solders with rifles outside the school in beslan where over 300 students and adults were held hostage by chechen attackers the letter expresses concern that putin is using terrorist attacks by chechen separatists , including the recent school hostage drama in beslan , as a pretext for extending his control over political life in russia . " we are deeply concerned that these tragic events are being used to further undermine democracy in russia , " said the letter , which was published in full in the financial times deutschland .
" russia 's democratic institutions have always been weak and fragile .
since becoming president in january 2000 , vladimir putin has made them even weaker . " the letter calls on western countries to place themselves " unambiguously on the side of democratic forces in russia . " this week , putin sent a draft law to parliament that will give him the right to nominate regional governors .
he also introduced a draft resolution that would create a new blacklist of terrorist suspects subject to extradition .
both plans have raised concern in the west . putin faces little opposition in the russian parliament , as his united russia party holds more than two-thirds of the seats .
criticism of putin in the russian media is rare , as most independent media organizations have been shut down under his rule . breaking the silence until now , western leaders have been reserved in their criticism , with barely a word being uttered by the eu or the us government to protest human rights violations in chechnya . germany has taken pains to cultivate close ties with russia .
on his last visit there , schröder emphasized the friendly nature of his relationship with putin .
the two leaders presented a united front on the most important questions , including putin 's controversial handling of the chechnya conflict . russia 's un ambassador , andrey denisov , said he took the criticism in the letter seriously , but added that it was important that there be enough " flexibility " in russia 's democracy to allow it to fight terrorism . " yes , we have to take seriously such opinions because they are being expressed by such distinguished persons , " denisov said .
" we have to prove to our partners that they are mistaken or they are exaggerating the present state of affairs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 29.09.2004 how much damage has bush done ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 's going to make it ?
dw-world readers this week commented on the race for the white house and president bush 's negative foreign policy record abroad . your point of view is interesting , i lived in europe for eight years and appreciate your points of view ; it 's great to see that the billions of dollars we spent through the marshal plan has produced peaceful differences .
two things you overlook are : only us citizens vote , and the economy , not foreign policy will determine the outcome of the election .
we 've been through years and years of anti-americanism , so what else is new .
polls in other countries mean nothing .
the americans living overseas vote in their particular state so even though they may be 80 % democrats , scattered over 50 states i seriously doubt they will have the kind of impact you describe - frank shipp why does n't your rag of a newspaper conduct a poll of americans asking them what they think of germany and mr. schröder ?
you germans can take your smug , self-satisfied views and shove them .
how 's that for candor , heinz ?
if germans had any sense of decency at all , they would shut their mouths before dispensing any advice - let alone moral advice - to george bush or to america .
any " crimes " america has ever committed pale by comparison to what you animals did not once , but twice in the last century .
your leaders kaiser willie and hitler were personally responsible for at least thirty million deaths , and you have the balls to ask germans what they think about my president and my country ? - john huettner violence destroyed our world trade center but that can be rebuilt .
george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .
george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .
we ca n't take it anymore . - lucy cole , alamo , california most americans are oblivious to their reception abroad , and i blame the american media for much of this ignorance .
bush 's record at home is remarkably but undeservedly good . - jeffrey hamill i am an a citizen of the united states and love my country but detest its current " leadership . "
our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .
if iraq truly had nothing to hide , then why not comply ?
should we have waited another 10 years while saddam continued to torture his own people ?
how long is too long ?
george w. bush is the only leader in the world strong enough to draw the line in the sand and face these threats head-on .
it may be years before this is truly understood .
the un is a weak , spineless organization that failed miserably to stop saddam .
jacques chirac is also weak , and could never stand up to terrorists the way mr. bush has .
i 'd rather see us fight terrorists , alone if we have to , on the streets of baghdad instead of being attacked on the streets of boston or elsewhere .
i will proudly vote for president george w. bush on nov .
2nd .
and many here agree with me , and i would prepare for a second bush term now . - steve bush has been a complete disaster internationally and an embarrassment to those of us in the us who long for a return to diplomacy to solve problems .
this country is , i 'm afraid , moving into a very dangerous unilateralism on a wide range of subjects .
this includes our refusal to join the eu and others in the international criminal court and kyoto .
i hate to say it , but i fear we are resorting back to pre-wwii us autonomy , hegemony and unilateralism in our relations with the world .
i think this could be a semi-permanent condition and i do n't know that even electing kerry will solve it .
americans are , unfortunately turning increasingly inward and are not taking criticism and disagreement from other nations and organizations very well .
in fact , they increasingly appear to be fighting back and downright dismissive of allies and others who voice disagreement with our policies .
it appears that being the only military " super-power " in the world is going to our heads .
remember the adage , " absolute power corrupts , absolutely " ! !
it appears to be true ! - trevor steven taylor you need to understand that most americans know that the us is just about the only country in the world that can " go it alone . "
for that reason , we americans do n't care what the world thinks about us or our international policies .
the independent streak of the americans is actually increased when we hear that a large percentage of the germans and french disagrees with something the us is doing , no matter what it is .
as soon as the us does not require energy from foreign sources , we may just resign from the united nations .
according to the polls , that 's the goal of more than half the americans , and those are the ones who support george w. bush .
thank you . - james l. reid , usa i believe george w. bush has hindered the spread of peace throughout the world .
i believe he does not consider that others world-wide have a right to govern their own area and have a clearer view of the big picture .
i also believe he was not taught to " play nice with others " when he was a child .
he has the arrogant , smirk of a bully who was born into privilege and has never had to consider the other person 's rights or feelings . - karen seeger , usa the only opinion that counts will be the election results in november .
the eu public is generally misinformed by a biased media that spews constant anti-bush information .
the net result is an anti-bush eu public . - boyd lawrence , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .
seeing the effects of bush 's foreign policy firsthand should boost kerry with expatriate voters , says dw-world 's marc young .

27 , 2004 -rrb- a kerry conundrum for schröder the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .

dw-world readers this week commented on the race for the white house and president bush 's negative foreign policy record abroad . your point of view is interesting , i lived in europe for eight years and appreciate your points of view ; it 's great to see that the billions of dollars we spent through the marshal plan has produced peaceful differences .
two things you overlook are : only us citizens vote , and the economy , not foreign policy will determine the outcome of the election .
we 've been through years and years of anti-americanism , so what else is new .
polls in other countries mean nothing .
the americans living overseas vote in their particular state so even though they may be 80 % democrats , scattered over 50 states i seriously doubt they will have the kind of impact you describe - frank shipp why does n't your rag of a newspaper conduct a poll of americans asking them what they think of germany and mr. schröder ?
you germans can take your smug , self-satisfied views and shove them .
how 's that for candor , heinz ?
if germans had any sense of decency at all , they would shut their mouths before dispensing any advice - let alone moral advice - to george bush or to america .
any " crimes " america has ever committed pale by comparison to what you animals did not once , but twice in the last century .
your leaders kaiser willie and hitler were personally responsible for at least thirty million deaths , and you have the balls to ask germans what they think about my president and my country ? - john huettner violence destroyed our world trade center but that can be rebuilt .
george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .
george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .
we ca n't take it anymore . - lucy cole , alamo , california most americans are oblivious to their reception abroad , and i blame the american media for much of this ignorance .
bush 's record at home is remarkably but undeservedly good . - jeffrey hamill i am an a citizen of the united states and love my country but detest its current " leadership . "
our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .
if iraq truly had nothing to hide , then why not comply ?
should we have waited another 10 years while saddam continued to torture his own people ?
how long is too long ?
george w. bush is the only leader in the world strong enough to draw the line in the sand and face these threats head-on .
it may be years before this is truly understood .

" we will mobilize the workforce so that these stores stay a part of karstadt , " franziska wiethold , a member of verdi 's national executive board , told the berliner zeitung .
she also said the reorganization would end up putting karstadt 's future in danger rather than stabilizing it .
the sale of small and medium sized stores was one part of the € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.72 billion -rrb- restructuring plan the german retail giant announced tuesday .
additionally , the company proposed a € 500 million capital increase and cuts in social programs and vacation for employees .

" the management plans , on the basis of the reorientation , to achieve markedly positive earnings as early as the 2005 fiscal year . "
the company will also sell its 82 percent stake in a joint venture with coffeehouse chain starbucks , in addition to parting with its specialist runners point , golf house , sinnleffers and wehmeyer outlets in an effort to concentrate on its core retail activities .
the company 's core retail business portfolio is worth around € 4.5 billion in turnover while those non-core activities set to be abandoned are worth € 700 million in turnover .
" these steps are inevitable and also overdue , " chief executive christoph achenbach told a news conference in the western city of essen .

karstadtquelle has been hemorrhaging money as german consumers continue to show reluctance in spending during the country 's gradual emergence from three years of economic stagnation .
while exports within a stronger world economy have begun to drive an upturn in fortunes of late , germany 's domestic demand and the consumer environment have remained stagnant , with unemployment above 10 percent and the government moving to trim social programs .
in addition to slow retail sales , essen-based karstadtquelle 's performance has been hit recently by losses at the thomas cook tourism company , which it co-owns with german airline lufthansa .
retail sales expected to drop the company also released figures that showed the state of the concern .
karstadtquelle is expected to post a pre-tax loss of € 1.3 billion this year and forecasts a drop in retail sales of between 4.5 and 5 percent .
the company also revealed that it would not be paying a dividend this year or the next .

it 's all possible at a new internet-based virtual stock market -lrb- vsm -rrb- aimed at predicting who will be among the next nobel prize winners .
the vsm is an economic experiment by the university of frankfurt , to see how well short- and medium-term market developments can be predicted .
the stocks in nobel candidates represent a bet on the outcome of future market situations - the higher the value of the stock , the more probable the market situation is .
the participants in the nobel vsm do n't have to concern themselves with economic models , however .
nor is any real money riding on this particular stock market .
but the most successful investors stand to win dividends in the form of 50 prizes , including an ibm laptop .
kohl stocks suffering internet users have to register to take part in the virtual market .
each participant then receives an initial cash deposit of $ 10,000 -lrb- € 12,300 -rrb- that can be used for buying and selling stocks .
just like a real market , the price of the stocks rises and falls according to supply and demand .

in contrast , demand for shares in top runner pope john paul ii has skyrocketed .
his stock is currently trading at over $ 70 .
trading at the nobel prize market wraps up at 6 p.m. the day before the winners are announced - that will happen on oct .
8 at the earliest .
once the nobel laureates are made known , the stocks are cashed out , with every share in a winner valued at $ 1,000 .
the participant with highest account balance wins the market .
reliable predictors frankfurt university 's project leader for the nobel prize market , bernd skiera , says vsm 's are increasingly establishing themselves as reliable predictors of future events .
their results are frequently just as good or better than comparable predictors such as polls , skiera said .
political stock markets , for example , are used to predict election results in countries such as the united states , germany , canada , the netherlands and austria .
slightly more macabre , perhaps , is the virtual terror stock market , terror xchange , where users buy or sell virtual shares of major international news events they think are likely to occur . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing tragedy in the soccer stadium how fast can a packed soccer stadium be evacuated ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 2004 frankfurt book fair opinion : open , sesame !
the healing power of storytelling the unknown guest of honor frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.09.2004 book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tahar ben jelloun is one of the few well-known arab authors in europe many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all . of the around 120,000 foreign fiction titles translated into german , only about 500 come from the arab world .
it 's a telling statement on the lack of information in the west when it comes to the diversity of the literary landscape in the arab countries . it 's usually literary heavyweights such as egyptian author and nobel prize winner naguib mahfouz or france-based moroccan writer tahar ben jelloun who enjoy relative popularity in europe . but that might be about to change as the spotlight falls on the arab league at this year 's frankfurt book fair .
starting october 6 , visitors to the world 's largest book fair will get the chance to meet and get acquainted with the works of around 200 authors and artists from 17 countries of the 22-member arab league . arab league program under fire but , even as the arab league readies itself for the chance to showcase its literary talent on a western platform , it has been dogged by criticism of its program . a few days ago , moroccan culture minister and poet muhammad al-ashari said he found it hard to understand that arabs , in 22 very diverse nations , were invited to the fair as a whole entity .
morocco , along with kuwait , libya , algeria and iraq , is not participating in the official program of the arab league at the frankfurt book fair . further criticism centers on the disproportionately large share of egyptian authors among the invited guests as well as the lack of initiative to involve authors in exile . the arab league 's program , which it unveiled at a press conference in frankfurt in june , is comprehensive , to say the least : poetry and prose readings , music , film and folkloristic events , discussion forums on globalization , human rights and reform in the arab world . among the invited authors are prominent names in literary circles such as the poets adonis and mahmud darwish , the francophone authors asia djebar and amin maalouf , but also names largely unknown in germany , such as the saudi writers raja alim and abduh khal . censorship still taboo in addition to the exhaustive program , the arab organizers at the frankfurt book fair spoke glowingly of the arab world wanting to initiate an open dialogue with the west as well as discuss controversial questions .
at the same time , the organizers sought to play down or completely avoid grave problems such as the woes of the arab book market and publishing industry . the arab organizers ' unwillingness to discuss pressing issues was apparent when it came to the ubiquitous censorship in the arab world . the director of the muscat book fair in oman , muhammad ali hassan , explained why censorship was necessary .
" our societies have their specialties and traditions that need to be respected , " hassan said .
" everything that attacks arab society or creates turbulence should be forbidden .
our societies still need protection , " he told deutsche welle . that seems to be the dominating opinion among arab book fair circles .
but censorship , which is one of the largest problems within the arab world , is not even mentioned in the official part of the arab league 's frankfurt fair program .
ibrahim al-muallim , president of the arab publishing association , instead claimed that arab publishers have made great strides in the fight against censorship . khalid qubaia , a libyan publisher and official at the arab publishing association , made no bones about the fact that his organization had clear views on censorship . " different benchmarks on censorship prevail in every arab country , " qubaia said .
" the arab publishers ' association agrees with two reasons for censorship : when a book compromises the security of a nation or when it does n't reflect ideas of morality . " lively discussions guaranteed but that 's not a view jabir asfur , director of the egyptian high council for culture , agreed with .
in the arabic daily al-hayat , asfur recently praised german oriental studies and efforts to translate arab literature into german . at the same time asfur was also self-critical .
he wrote that neither individual arab states nor the arab league nor the arab publishers ' association had ever set up initiatives to support the translation of arabic literature into other languages . but , this self-criticism comes late .
on the one hand arab intellectuals have been demanding for years to set up a fund for exactly that purpose .
on the other , uncertainty still surrounds a list with arab books that are meant to be translated into german and english on the occasion of the arab league 's guest performance at the frankfurt book fair . one thing is clear though : suspense and heated discussion are guaranteed this year at the frankfurt book fair . mona naggar -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

" we will mobilize the workforce so that these stores stay a part of karstadt , " franziska wiethold , a member of verdi 's national executive board , told the berliner zeitung .
she also said the reorganization would end up putting karstadt 's future in danger rather than stabilizing it .
the sale of small and medium sized stores was one part of the € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.72 billion -rrb- restructuring plan the german retail giant announced tuesday .
additionally , the company proposed a € 500 million capital increase and cuts in social programs and vacation for employees .
" the core of the program is the refocusing of the group on its strengths and core competencies , " the company said in a statement .

the company will also sell its 82 percent stake in a joint venture with coffeehouse chain starbucks , in addition to parting with its specialist runners point , golf house , sinnleffers and wehmeyer outlets in an effort to concentrate on its core retail activities .
the company 's core retail business portfolio is worth around € 4.5 billion in turnover while those non-core activities set to be abandoned are worth € 700 million in turnover .

karstadtquelle has been hemorrhaging money as german consumers continue to show reluctance in spending during the country 's gradual emergence from three years of economic stagnation .
while exports within a stronger world economy have begun to drive an upturn in fortunes of late , germany 's domestic demand and the consumer environment have remained stagnant , with unemployment above 10 percent and the government moving to trim social programs .
in addition to slow retail sales , essen-based karstadtquelle 's performance has been hit recently by losses at the thomas cook tourism company , which it co-owns with german airline lufthansa .
retail sales expected to drop the company also released figures that showed the state of the concern .
karstadtquelle is expected to post a pre-tax loss of € 1.3 billion this year and forecasts a drop in retail sales of between 4.5 and 5 percent .
the company also revealed that it would not be paying a dividend this year or the next .
in august , the company reported a second quarter net loss of € 188 million -lrb- $ 231 million -rrb- on slumping retail sales .
tuesday 's statement did not mention any imminent job cuts related to the restructuring , but karstadtquelle said in july that it planned to cut about 4,000 jobs from its work force of 47,000 full- and part-time employees by the end of 2006 karstadtquelle shares , which dropped by more than 6 percent monday at € 13.38 a share , were up 5.7 percent at € 14.14 by noon on the frankfurt stock exchange . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karstadtquelle to cut more jobs essen-based retailer karstadtquelle will cut an additional 4,000 jobs over the next two years , the company said in a statement .

italy is already cooperating with libya and says such a center should be set up there . italy 's interior minister giuseppe pisanu is convinced the deal his government struck with libya to curb illegal immigration is starting to bear fruit .
he recently traveled to tripoli to meet with his libyan counterpart and discuss the plan further .
following the meeting , he said the results so far are encouraging .
the italian government has been increasingly concerned with the continuous arrivals of illegal immigrants .
holding centers in sicily and on the island of lampedusa have suffered the brunt of the problem and reached bursting point this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat carrying some of the 79 would-be immigrants reaches lampedusa .
pisanu said a proposal to create asylum camps in libya to prevent illegal immigrants from reaching italian shores is moving forward after the italy-libya immigration deal was agreed in august between italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and libyan leader moammar ghadafi . concerns about libya 's human rights record the idea , originally proposed by britain , was revived by italy and germany this summer and is expected to be discussed by eu justice and interior ministers this week . amnesty international has already voiced its concern citing libya 's human rights record .
it also said asylum seekers must be given adequate protection .
as part of the agreement , the italian government is planning to send 150 police officers to libya to help train their libyan counterparts .
the training exercises are expected to last one month and are likely to start in november . in addition , tripoli will be purchasing military equipment and vehicles from italy .
pisanu said this will be possible following the european union 's recent decision to lift its embargo on the sale of military equipment to libya . dropping embargo will aid libyan efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian soldiers help a weak and sick refugee from his boat in lampedusa harbor .

11 and oct .

the eu decision followed pressure by italy which wanted libya to make more efforts in controlling its coastline to stop human traffickers sending boatloads of illegal immigrants across the sea to italy .
in the past , libya was forced to borrow such vehicles from rome .
libya 's thousands of kilometers of desert and sea frontiers are difficult to police , but both countries have a strong interest in bringing the flood of illegal immigrants from other parts of africa to libya under control . sabina castelfranco -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy and libya tackle illegal immigration italian prime minister silvio berlusconi met libyan leader moammar gadhafi on wednesday for talks on stemming the tide of illegal immigrants using the north african country as a transit point .

dw-world readers this week commented on the race for the white house and president bush 's negative foreign policy record abroad . your point of view is interesting , i lived in europe for eight years and appreciate your points of view ; it 's great to see that the billions of dollars we spent through the marshal plan has produced peaceful differences .
two things you overlook are : only us citizens vote , and the economy , not foreign policy will determine the outcome of the election .
we 've been through years and years of anti-americanism , so what else is new .
polls in other countries mean nothing .
the americans living overseas vote in their particular state so even though they may be 80 % democrats , scattered over 50 states i seriously doubt they will have the kind of impact you describe - frank shipp why does n't your rag of a newspaper conduct a poll of americans asking them what they think of germany and mr. schröder ?
you germans can take your smug , self-satisfied views and shove them .
how 's that for candor , heinz ?
if germans had any sense of decency at all , they would shut their mouths before dispensing any advice - let alone moral advice - to george bush or to america .
any " crimes " america has ever committed pale by comparison to what you animals did not once , but twice in the last century .
your leaders kaiser willie and hitler were personally responsible for at least thirty million deaths , and you have the balls to ask germans what they think about my president and my country ? - john huettner violence destroyed our world trade center but that can be rebuilt .
george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .
george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .
we ca n't take it anymore . - lucy cole , alamo , california most americans are oblivious to their reception abroad , and i blame the american media for much of this ignorance .
bush 's record at home is remarkably but undeservedly good . - jeffrey hamill i am an a citizen of the united states and love my country but detest its current " leadership . "
our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .
if iraq truly had nothing to hide , then why not comply ?
should we have waited another 10 years while saddam continued to torture his own people ?
how long is too long ?
george w. bush is the only leader in the world strong enough to draw the line in the sand and face these threats head-on .
it may be years before this is truly understood .
the un is a weak , spineless organization that failed miserably to stop saddam .
jacques chirac is also weak , and could never stand up to terrorists the way mr. bush has .
i 'd rather see us fight terrorists , alone if we have to , on the streets of baghdad instead of being attacked on the streets of boston or elsewhere .
i will proudly vote for president george w. bush on nov .
2nd .
and many here agree with me , and i would prepare for a second bush term now . - steve bush has been a complete disaster internationally and an embarrassment to those of us in the us who long for a return to diplomacy to solve problems .
this country is , i 'm afraid , moving into a very dangerous unilateralism on a wide range of subjects .
this includes our refusal to join the eu and others in the international criminal court and kyoto .
i hate to say it , but i fear we are resorting back to pre-wwii us autonomy , hegemony and unilateralism in our relations with the world .
i think this could be a semi-permanent condition and i do n't know that even electing kerry will solve it .
americans are , unfortunately turning increasingly inward and are not taking criticism and disagreement from other nations and organizations very well .
in fact , they increasingly appear to be fighting back and downright dismissive of allies and others who voice disagreement with our policies .
it appears that being the only military " super-power " in the world is going to our heads .
remember the adage , " absolute power corrupts , absolutely " ! !
it appears to be true ! - trevor steven taylor you need to understand that most americans know that the us is just about the only country in the world that can " go it alone . "
for that reason , we americans do n't care what the world thinks about us or our international policies .
the independent streak of the americans is actually increased when we hear that a large percentage of the germans and french disagrees with something the us is doing , no matter what it is .
as soon as the us does not require energy from foreign sources , we may just resign from the united nations .
according to the polls , that 's the goal of more than half the americans , and those are the ones who support george w. bush .
thank you . - james l. reid , usa i believe george w. bush has hindered the spread of peace throughout the world .
i believe he does not consider that others world-wide have a right to govern their own area and have a clearer view of the big picture .
i also believe he was not taught to " play nice with others " when he was a child .
he has the arrogant , smirk of a bully who was born into privilege and has never had to consider the other person 's rights or feelings . - karen seeger , usa the only opinion that counts will be the election results in november .
the eu public is generally misinformed by a biased media that spews constant anti-bush information .
the net result is an anti-bush eu public . - boyd lawrence , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .
seeing the effects of bush 's foreign policy firsthand should boost kerry with expatriate voters , says dw-world 's marc young .
-lrb- sept .
27 , 2004 -rrb- a kerry conundrum for schröder the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .
however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier .

the healing power of storytelling the unknown guest of honor frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.09.2004 book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tahar ben jelloun is one of the few well-known arab authors in europe many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all . of the around 120,000 foreign fiction titles translated into german , only about 500 come from the arab world .
it 's a telling statement on the lack of information in the west when it comes to the diversity of the literary landscape in the arab countries . it 's usually literary heavyweights such as egyptian author and nobel prize winner naguib mahfouz or france-based moroccan writer tahar ben jelloun who enjoy relative popularity in europe . but that might be about to change as the spotlight falls on the arab league at this year 's frankfurt book fair .
starting october 6 , visitors to the world 's largest book fair will get the chance to meet and get acquainted with the works of around 200 authors and artists from 17 countries of the 22-member arab league . arab league program under fire but , even as the arab league readies itself for the chance to showcase its literary talent on a western platform , it has been dogged by criticism of its program . a few days ago , moroccan culture minister and poet muhammad al-ashari said he found it hard to understand that arabs , in 22 very diverse nations , were invited to the fair as a whole entity .
morocco , along with kuwait , libya , algeria and iraq , is not participating in the official program of the arab league at the frankfurt book fair . further criticism centers on the disproportionately large share of egyptian authors among the invited guests as well as the lack of initiative to involve authors in exile . the arab league 's program , which it unveiled at a press conference in frankfurt in june , is comprehensive , to say the least : poetry and prose readings , music , film and folkloristic events , discussion forums on globalization , human rights and reform in the arab world . among the invited authors are prominent names in literary circles such as the poets adonis and mahmud darwish , the francophone authors asia djebar and amin maalouf , but also names largely unknown in germany , such as the saudi writers raja alim and abduh khal . censorship still taboo in addition to the exhaustive program , the arab organizers at the frankfurt book fair spoke glowingly of the arab world wanting to initiate an open dialogue with the west as well as discuss controversial questions .
at the same time , the organizers sought to play down or completely avoid grave problems such as the woes of the arab book market and publishing industry . the arab organizers ' unwillingness to discuss pressing issues was apparent when it came to the ubiquitous censorship in the arab world . the director of the muscat book fair in oman , muhammad ali hassan , explained why censorship was necessary .

" everything that attacks arab society or creates turbulence should be forbidden .
our societies still need protection , " he told deutsche welle . that seems to be the dominating opinion among arab book fair circles .
but censorship , which is one of the largest problems within the arab world , is not even mentioned in the official part of the arab league 's frankfurt fair program .
ibrahim al-muallim , president of the arab publishing association , instead claimed that arab publishers have made great strides in the fight against censorship . khalid qubaia , a libyan publisher and official at the arab publishing association , made no bones about the fact that his organization had clear views on censorship . " different benchmarks on censorship prevail in every arab country , " qubaia said .
" the arab publishers ' association agrees with two reasons for censorship : when a book compromises the security of a nation or when it does n't reflect ideas of morality . " lively discussions guaranteed but that 's not a view jabir asfur , director of the egyptian high council for culture , agreed with .

starting october 6 , visitors to the world 's largest book fair will get the chance to meet and get acquainted with the works of around 200 authors and artists from 17 countries of the 22-member arab league . arab league program under fire but , even as the arab league readies itself for the chance to showcase its literary talent on a western platform , it has been dogged by criticism of its program . a few days ago , moroccan culture minister and poet muhammad al-ashari said he found it hard to understand that arabs , in 22 very diverse nations , were invited to the fair as a whole entity .
morocco , along with kuwait , libya , algeria and iraq , is not participating in the official program of the arab league at the frankfurt book fair . further criticism centers on the disproportionately large share of egyptian authors among the invited guests as well as the lack of initiative to involve authors in exile . the arab league 's program , which it unveiled at a press conference in frankfurt in june , is comprehensive , to say the least : poetry and prose readings , music , film and folkloristic events , discussion forums on globalization , human rights and reform in the arab world . among the invited authors are prominent names in literary circles such as the poets adonis and mahmud darwish , the francophone authors asia djebar and amin maalouf , but also names largely unknown in germany , such as the saudi writers raja alim and abduh khal . censorship still taboo in addition to the exhaustive program , the arab organizers at the frankfurt book fair spoke glowingly of the arab world wanting to initiate an open dialogue with the west as well as discuss controversial questions .
at the same time , the organizers sought to play down or completely avoid grave problems such as the woes of the arab book market and publishing industry . the arab organizers ' unwillingness to discuss pressing issues was apparent when it came to the ubiquitous censorship in the arab world . the director of the muscat book fair in oman , muhammad ali hassan , explained why censorship was necessary .
" our societies have their specialties and traditions that need to be respected , " hassan said .
" everything that attacks arab society or creates turbulence should be forbidden .
our societies still need protection , " he told deutsche welle . that seems to be the dominating opinion among arab book fair circles .
but censorship , which is one of the largest problems within the arab world , is not even mentioned in the official part of the arab league 's frankfurt fair program .
ibrahim al-muallim , president of the arab publishing association , instead claimed that arab publishers have made great strides in the fight against censorship . khalid qubaia , a libyan publisher and official at the arab publishing association , made no bones about the fact that his organization had clear views on censorship . " different benchmarks on censorship prevail in every arab country , " qubaia said .
" the arab publishers ' association agrees with two reasons for censorship : when a book compromises the security of a nation or when it does n't reflect ideas of morality . " lively discussions guaranteed but that 's not a view jabir asfur , director of the egyptian high council for culture , agreed with .
in the arabic daily al-hayat , asfur recently praised german oriental studies and efforts to translate arab literature into german . at the same time asfur was also self-critical .
he wrote that neither individual arab states nor the arab league nor the arab publishers ' association had ever set up initiatives to support the translation of arabic literature into other languages . but , this self-criticism comes late .
on the one hand arab intellectuals have been demanding for years to set up a fund for exactly that purpose .
on the other , uncertainty still surrounds a list with arab books that are meant to be translated into german and english on the occasion of the arab league 's guest performance at the frankfurt book fair . one thing is clear though : suspense and heated discussion are guaranteed this year at the frankfurt book fair . mona naggar -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

the paper said that although the machine guns usually on the vehicles would be taken off , they surely would n't be used to transport the baghdad football team .

recalling that he won the 2002 election with his anti-war stance , the offenburger tageblatt newspaper said chancellor schröder has thrown his iraq policy overboard .
the supply of the vehicles is direct support of the allied troops , the paper wrote , and hence a direct intervention in the iraq war ; schröder broke his word .
the badische zeitung of freiburg wrote that regardless of all criticism of the war , schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer agree that the west must not fail in iraq , because it would be a catastrophe if the country were to descend into despotism , anarchy or religious fanaticism .

the main-echo newspaper saw the british prime minister marshalling his rank and file behind him because a third election win is more important to them than moral debates .

they say putin is using the fight against terror to clamp down on democracy . the protest letter , delivered to us president george w. bush , as well as other government leaders in nato and the european union , accuses putin of turning back to authoritarian rule .
its 115 signatories include prominent politicians such as former czech president vaclav havel , former swedish prime minister carl bildt , and us senators john mccain and joseph r. biden . the most prominent german politicians to sign the letter are green party chief reinhard bütikofer , and the foreign policy expert of the christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , friedbert pflüger .

" we are deeply concerned that these tragic events are being used to further undermine democracy in russia , " said the letter , which was published in full in the financial times deutschland .
" russia 's democratic institutions have always been weak and fragile .
since becoming president in january 2000 , vladimir putin has made them even weaker . " the letter calls on western countries to place themselves " unambiguously on the side of democratic forces in russia . " this week , putin sent a draft law to parliament that will give him the right to nominate regional governors .
he also introduced a draft resolution that would create a new blacklist of terrorist suspects subject to extradition .
both plans have raised concern in the west . putin faces little opposition in the russian parliament , as his united russia party holds more than two-thirds of the seats .
criticism of putin in the russian media is rare , as most independent media organizations have been shut down under his rule . breaking the silence until now , western leaders have been reserved in their criticism , with barely a word being uttered by the eu or the us government to protest human rights violations in chechnya . germany has taken pains to cultivate close ties with russia .
on his last visit there , schröder emphasized the friendly nature of his relationship with putin .
the two leaders presented a united front on the most important questions , including putin 's controversial handling of the chechnya conflict . russia 's un ambassador , andrey denisov , said he took the criticism in the letter seriously , but added that it was important that there be enough " flexibility " in russia 's democracy to allow it to fight terrorism .

they say putin is using the fight against terror to clamp down on democracy . the protest letter , delivered to us president george w. bush , as well as other government leaders in nato and the european union , accuses putin of turning back to authoritarian rule .
its 115 signatories include prominent politicians such as former czech president vaclav havel , former swedish prime minister carl bildt , and us senators john mccain and joseph r. biden . the most prominent german politicians to sign the letter are green party chief reinhard bütikofer , and the foreign policy expert of the christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , friedbert pflüger .
no politicians from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- signed it . democracy in name only ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian solders with rifles outside the school in beslan where over 300 students and adults were held hostage by chechen attackers the letter expresses concern that putin is using terrorist attacks by chechen separatists , including the recent school hostage drama in beslan , as a pretext for extending his control over political life in russia . " we are deeply concerned that these tragic events are being used to further undermine democracy in russia , " said the letter , which was published in full in the financial times deutschland .
" russia 's democratic institutions have always been weak and fragile .
since becoming president in january 2000 , vladimir putin has made them even weaker . " the letter calls on western countries to place themselves " unambiguously on the side of democratic forces in russia . " this week , putin sent a draft law to parliament that will give him the right to nominate regional governors .
he also introduced a draft resolution that would create a new blacklist of terrorist suspects subject to extradition .
both plans have raised concern in the west . putin faces little opposition in the russian parliament , as his united russia party holds more than two-thirds of the seats .
criticism of putin in the russian media is rare , as most independent media organizations have been shut down under his rule . breaking the silence until now , western leaders have been reserved in their criticism , with barely a word being uttered by the eu or the us government to protest human rights violations in chechnya . germany has taken pains to cultivate close ties with russia .
on his last visit there , schröder emphasized the friendly nature of his relationship with putin .
the two leaders presented a united front on the most important questions , including putin 's controversial handling of the chechnya conflict . russia 's un ambassador , andrey denisov , said he took the criticism in the letter seriously , but added that it was important that there be enough " flexibility " in russia 's democracy to allow it to fight terrorism .

karstadtquelle has been hemorrhaging money as german consumers continue to show reluctance in spending during the country 's gradual emergence from three years of economic stagnation .
while exports within a stronger world economy have begun to drive an upturn in fortunes of late , germany 's domestic demand and the consumer environment have remained stagnant , with unemployment above 10 percent and the government moving to trim social programs .

dw-world readers this week commented on the race for the white house and president bush 's negative foreign policy record abroad . your point of view is interesting , i lived in europe for eight years and appreciate your points of view ; it 's great to see that the billions of dollars we spent through the marshal plan has produced peaceful differences .
two things you overlook are : only us citizens vote , and the economy , not foreign policy will determine the outcome of the election .
we 've been through years and years of anti-americanism , so what else is new .
polls in other countries mean nothing .
the americans living overseas vote in their particular state so even though they may be 80 % democrats , scattered over 50 states i seriously doubt they will have the kind of impact you describe - frank shipp why does n't your rag of a newspaper conduct a poll of americans asking them what they think of germany and mr. schröder ?
you germans can take your smug , self-satisfied views and shove them .
how 's that for candor , heinz ?
if germans had any sense of decency at all , they would shut their mouths before dispensing any advice - let alone moral advice - to george bush or to america .
any " crimes " america has ever committed pale by comparison to what you animals did not once , but twice in the last century .
your leaders kaiser willie and hitler were personally responsible for at least thirty million deaths , and you have the balls to ask germans what they think about my president and my country ? - john huettner violence destroyed our world trade center but that can be rebuilt .
george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .
george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .
we ca n't take it anymore . - lucy cole , alamo , california most americans are oblivious to their reception abroad , and i blame the american media for much of this ignorance .
bush 's record at home is remarkably but undeservedly good . - jeffrey hamill i am an a citizen of the united states and love my country but detest its current " leadership . "
our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .
if iraq truly had nothing to hide , then why not comply ?
should we have waited another 10 years while saddam continued to torture his own people ?
how long is too long ?
george w. bush is the only leader in the world strong enough to draw the line in the sand and face these threats head-on .
it may be years before this is truly understood .
the un is a weak , spineless organization that failed miserably to stop saddam .
jacques chirac is also weak , and could never stand up to terrorists the way mr. bush has .
i 'd rather see us fight terrorists , alone if we have to , on the streets of baghdad instead of being attacked on the streets of boston or elsewhere .
i will proudly vote for president george w. bush on nov .
2nd .
and many here agree with me , and i would prepare for a second bush term now . - steve bush has been a complete disaster internationally and an embarrassment to those of us in the us who long for a return to diplomacy to solve problems .
this country is , i 'm afraid , moving into a very dangerous unilateralism on a wide range of subjects .
this includes our refusal to join the eu and others in the international criminal court and kyoto .
i hate to say it , but i fear we are resorting back to pre-wwii us autonomy , hegemony and unilateralism in our relations with the world .
i think this could be a semi-permanent condition and i do n't know that even electing kerry will solve it .
americans are , unfortunately turning increasingly inward and are not taking criticism and disagreement from other nations and organizations very well .
in fact , they increasingly appear to be fighting back and downright dismissive of allies and others who voice disagreement with our policies .
it appears that being the only military " super-power " in the world is going to our heads .
remember the adage , " absolute power corrupts , absolutely " ! !
it appears to be true ! - trevor steven taylor you need to understand that most americans know that the us is just about the only country in the world that can " go it alone . "
for that reason , we americans do n't care what the world thinks about us or our international policies .
the independent streak of the americans is actually increased when we hear that a large percentage of the germans and french disagrees with something the us is doing , no matter what it is .
as soon as the us does not require energy from foreign sources , we may just resign from the united nations .
according to the polls , that 's the goal of more than half the americans , and those are the ones who support george w. bush .
thank you . - james l. reid , usa i believe george w. bush has hindered the spread of peace throughout the world .
i believe he does not consider that others world-wide have a right to govern their own area and have a clearer view of the big picture .
i also believe he was not taught to " play nice with others " when he was a child .
he has the arrogant , smirk of a bully who was born into privilege and has never had to consider the other person 's rights or feelings . - karen seeger , usa the only opinion that counts will be the election results in november .
the eu public is generally misinformed by a biased media that spews constant anti-bush information .
the net result is an anti-bush eu public . - boyd lawrence , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .

they say putin is using the fight against terror to clamp down on democracy . the protest letter , delivered to us president george w. bush , as well as other government leaders in nato and the european union , accuses putin of turning back to authoritarian rule .
its 115 signatories include prominent politicians such as former czech president vaclav havel , former swedish prime minister carl bildt , and us senators john mccain and joseph r. biden . the most prominent german politicians to sign the letter are green party chief reinhard bütikofer , and the foreign policy expert of the christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , friedbert pflüger .
no politicians from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- signed it . democracy in name only ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian solders with rifles outside the school in beslan where over 300 students and adults were held hostage by chechen attackers the letter expresses concern that putin is using terrorist attacks by chechen separatists , including the recent school hostage drama in beslan , as a pretext for extending his control over political life in russia . " we are deeply concerned that these tragic events are being used to further undermine democracy in russia , " said the letter , which was published in full in the financial times deutschland .
" russia 's democratic institutions have always been weak and fragile .
since becoming president in january 2000 , vladimir putin has made them even weaker . " the letter calls on western countries to place themselves " unambiguously on the side of democratic forces in russia . " this week , putin sent a draft law to parliament that will give him the right to nominate regional governors .
he also introduced a draft resolution that would create a new blacklist of terrorist suspects subject to extradition .
both plans have raised concern in the west . putin faces little opposition in the russian parliament , as his united russia party holds more than two-thirds of the seats .
criticism of putin in the russian media is rare , as most independent media organizations have been shut down under his rule . breaking the silence until now , western leaders have been reserved in their criticism , with barely a word being uttered by the eu or the us government to protest human rights violations in chechnya . germany has taken pains to cultivate close ties with russia .
on his last visit there , schröder emphasized the friendly nature of his relationship with putin .
the two leaders presented a united front on the most important questions , including putin 's controversial handling of the chechnya conflict . russia 's un ambassador , andrey denisov , said he took the criticism in the letter seriously , but added that it was important that there be enough " flexibility " in russia 's democracy to allow it to fight terrorism . " yes , we have to take seriously such opinions because they are being expressed by such distinguished persons , " denisov said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.09.2004 western leaders criticize putin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under fire more than 100 american and european foreign policy experts signed a letter protesting against russian president vladimir putin 's leadership .
they say putin is using the fight against terror to clamp down on democracy . the protest letter , delivered to us president george w. bush , as well as other government leaders in nato and the european union , accuses putin of turning back to authoritarian rule .
its 115 signatories include prominent politicians such as former czech president vaclav havel , former swedish prime minister carl bildt , and us senators john mccain and joseph r. biden . the most prominent german politicians to sign the letter are green party chief reinhard bütikofer , and the foreign policy expert of the christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , friedbert pflüger .
no politicians from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- signed it . democracy in name only ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian solders with rifles outside the school in beslan where over 300 students and adults were held hostage by chechen attackers the letter expresses concern that putin is using terrorist attacks by chechen separatists , including the recent school hostage drama in beslan , as a pretext for extending his control over political life in russia . " we are deeply concerned that these tragic events are being used to further undermine democracy in russia , " said the letter , which was published in full in the financial times deutschland .
" russia 's democratic institutions have always been weak and fragile .
since becoming president in january 2000 , vladimir putin has made them even weaker . " the letter calls on western countries to place themselves " unambiguously on the side of democratic forces in russia . " this week , putin sent a draft law to parliament that will give him the right to nominate regional governors .
he also introduced a draft resolution that would create a new blacklist of terrorist suspects subject to extradition .
both plans have raised concern in the west . putin faces little opposition in the russian parliament , as his united russia party holds more than two-thirds of the seats .
criticism of putin in the russian media is rare , as most independent media organizations have been shut down under his rule . breaking the silence until now , western leaders have been reserved in their criticism , with barely a word being uttered by the eu or the us government to protest human rights violations in chechnya . germany has taken pains to cultivate close ties with russia .
on his last visit there , schröder emphasized the friendly nature of his relationship with putin .
the two leaders presented a united front on the most important questions , including putin 's controversial handling of the chechnya conflict . russia 's un ambassador , andrey denisov , said he took the criticism in the letter seriously , but added that it was important that there be enough " flexibility " in russia 's democracy to allow it to fight terrorism . " yes , we have to take seriously such opinions because they are being expressed by such distinguished persons , " denisov said .
" we have to prove to our partners that they are mistaken or they are exaggerating the present state of affairs .

the healing power of storytelling the unknown guest of honor frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.09.2004 book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tahar ben jelloun is one of the few well-known arab authors in europe many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all . of the around 120,000 foreign fiction titles translated into german , only about 500 come from the arab world .
it 's a telling statement on the lack of information in the west when it comes to the diversity of the literary landscape in the arab countries . it 's usually literary heavyweights such as egyptian author and nobel prize winner naguib mahfouz or france-based moroccan writer tahar ben jelloun who enjoy relative popularity in europe . but that might be about to change as the spotlight falls on the arab league at this year 's frankfurt book fair .
starting october 6 , visitors to the world 's largest book fair will get the chance to meet and get acquainted with the works of around 200 authors and artists from 17 countries of the 22-member arab league . arab league program under fire but , even as the arab league readies itself for the chance to showcase its literary talent on a western platform , it has been dogged by criticism of its program . a few days ago , moroccan culture minister and poet muhammad al-ashari said he found it hard to understand that arabs , in 22 very diverse nations , were invited to the fair as a whole entity .
morocco , along with kuwait , libya , algeria and iraq , is not participating in the official program of the arab league at the frankfurt book fair . further criticism centers on the disproportionately large share of egyptian authors among the invited guests as well as the lack of initiative to involve authors in exile . the arab league 's program , which it unveiled at a press conference in frankfurt in june , is comprehensive , to say the least : poetry and prose readings , music , film and folkloristic events , discussion forums on globalization , human rights and reform in the arab world . among the invited authors are prominent names in literary circles such as the poets adonis and mahmud darwish , the francophone authors asia djebar and amin maalouf , but also names largely unknown in germany , such as the saudi writers raja alim and abduh khal . censorship still taboo in addition to the exhaustive program , the arab organizers at the frankfurt book fair spoke glowingly of the arab world wanting to initiate an open dialogue with the west as well as discuss controversial questions .
at the same time , the organizers sought to play down or completely avoid grave problems such as the woes of the arab book market and publishing industry . the arab organizers ' unwillingness to discuss pressing issues was apparent when it came to the ubiquitous censorship in the arab world . the director of the muscat book fair in oman , muhammad ali hassan , explained why censorship was necessary .
" our societies have their specialties and traditions that need to be respected , " hassan said .
" everything that attacks arab society or creates turbulence should be forbidden .
our societies still need protection , " he told deutsche welle . that seems to be the dominating opinion among arab book fair circles .
but censorship , which is one of the largest problems within the arab world , is not even mentioned in the official part of the arab league 's frankfurt fair program .
ibrahim al-muallim , president of the arab publishing association , instead claimed that arab publishers have made great strides in the fight against censorship . khalid qubaia , a libyan publisher and official at the arab publishing association , made no bones about the fact that his organization had clear views on censorship . " different benchmarks on censorship prevail in every arab country , " qubaia said .
" the arab publishers ' association agrees with two reasons for censorship : when a book compromises the security of a nation or when it does n't reflect ideas of morality . " lively discussions guaranteed but that 's not a view jabir asfur , director of the egyptian high council for culture , agreed with .
in the arabic daily al-hayat , asfur recently praised german oriental studies and efforts to translate arab literature into german . at the same time asfur was also self-critical .
he wrote that neither individual arab states nor the arab league nor the arab publishers ' association had ever set up initiatives to support the translation of arabic literature into other languages . but , this self-criticism comes late .
on the one hand arab intellectuals have been demanding for years to set up a fund for exactly that purpose .
on the other , uncertainty still surrounds a list with arab books that are meant to be translated into german and english on the occasion of the arab league 's guest performance at the frankfurt book fair . one thing is clear though : suspense and heated discussion are guaranteed this year at the frankfurt book fair . mona naggar -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

the healing power of storytelling the unknown guest of honor frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.09.2004 book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tahar ben jelloun is one of the few well-known arab authors in europe many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all . of the around 120,000 foreign fiction titles translated into german , only about 500 come from the arab world .
it 's a telling statement on the lack of information in the west when it comes to the diversity of the literary landscape in the arab countries . it 's usually literary heavyweights such as egyptian author and nobel prize winner naguib mahfouz or france-based moroccan writer tahar ben jelloun who enjoy relative popularity in europe . but that might be about to change as the spotlight falls on the arab league at this year 's frankfurt book fair .
starting october 6 , visitors to the world 's largest book fair will get the chance to meet and get acquainted with the works of around 200 authors and artists from 17 countries of the 22-member arab league . arab league program under fire but , even as the arab league readies itself for the chance to showcase its literary talent on a western platform , it has been dogged by criticism of its program . a few days ago , moroccan culture minister and poet muhammad al-ashari said he found it hard to understand that arabs , in 22 very diverse nations , were invited to the fair as a whole entity .
morocco , along with kuwait , libya , algeria and iraq , is not participating in the official program of the arab league at the frankfurt book fair . further criticism centers on the disproportionately large share of egyptian authors among the invited guests as well as the lack of initiative to involve authors in exile . the arab league 's program , which it unveiled at a press conference in frankfurt in june , is comprehensive , to say the least : poetry and prose readings , music , film and folkloristic events , discussion forums on globalization , human rights and reform in the arab world . among the invited authors are prominent names in literary circles such as the poets adonis and mahmud darwish , the francophone authors asia djebar and amin maalouf , but also names largely unknown in germany , such as the saudi writers raja alim and abduh khal . censorship still taboo in addition to the exhaustive program , the arab organizers at the frankfurt book fair spoke glowingly of the arab world wanting to initiate an open dialogue with the west as well as discuss controversial questions .
at the same time , the organizers sought to play down or completely avoid grave problems such as the woes of the arab book market and publishing industry . the arab organizers ' unwillingness to discuss pressing issues was apparent when it came to the ubiquitous censorship in the arab world . the director of the muscat book fair in oman , muhammad ali hassan , explained why censorship was necessary .
" our societies have their specialties and traditions that need to be respected , " hassan said .
" everything that attacks arab society or creates turbulence should be forbidden .
our societies still need protection , " he told deutsche welle . that seems to be the dominating opinion among arab book fair circles .
but censorship , which is one of the largest problems within the arab world , is not even mentioned in the official part of the arab league 's frankfurt fair program .
ibrahim al-muallim , president of the arab publishing association , instead claimed that arab publishers have made great strides in the fight against censorship . khalid qubaia , a libyan publisher and official at the arab publishing association , made no bones about the fact that his organization had clear views on censorship . " different benchmarks on censorship prevail in every arab country , " qubaia said .
" the arab publishers ' association agrees with two reasons for censorship : when a book compromises the security of a nation or when it does n't reflect ideas of morality . " lively discussions guaranteed but that 's not a view jabir asfur , director of the egyptian high council for culture , agreed with .
in the arabic daily al-hayat , asfur recently praised german oriental studies and efforts to translate arab literature into german . at the same time asfur was also self-critical .
he wrote that neither individual arab states nor the arab league nor the arab publishers ' association had ever set up initiatives to support the translation of arabic literature into other languages . but , this self-criticism comes late .
on the one hand arab intellectuals have been demanding for years to set up a fund for exactly that purpose .
on the other , uncertainty still surrounds a list with arab books that are meant to be translated into german and english on the occasion of the arab league 's guest performance at the frankfurt book fair . one thing is clear though : suspense and heated discussion are guaranteed this year at the frankfurt book fair . mona naggar -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

" we will mobilize the workforce so that these stores stay a part of karstadt , " franziska wiethold , a member of verdi 's national executive board , told the berliner zeitung .
she also said the reorganization would end up putting karstadt 's future in danger rather than stabilizing it .
the sale of small and medium sized stores was one part of the € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.72 billion -rrb- restructuring plan the german retail giant announced tuesday .

karstadtquelle has been hemorrhaging money as german consumers continue to show reluctance in spending during the country 's gradual emergence from three years of economic stagnation .
while exports within a stronger world economy have begun to drive an upturn in fortunes of late , germany 's domestic demand and the consumer environment have remained stagnant , with unemployment above 10 percent and the government moving to trim social programs .
in addition to slow retail sales , essen-based karstadtquelle 's performance has been hit recently by losses at the thomas cook tourism company , which it co-owns with german airline lufthansa .

dw-world readers this week commented on the race for the white house and president bush 's negative foreign policy record abroad . your point of view is interesting , i lived in europe for eight years and appreciate your points of view ; it 's great to see that the billions of dollars we spent through the marshal plan has produced peaceful differences .
two things you overlook are : only us citizens vote , and the economy , not foreign policy will determine the outcome of the election .
we 've been through years and years of anti-americanism , so what else is new .
polls in other countries mean nothing .
the americans living overseas vote in their particular state so even though they may be 80 % democrats , scattered over 50 states i seriously doubt they will have the kind of impact you describe - frank shipp why does n't your rag of a newspaper conduct a poll of americans asking them what they think of germany and mr. schröder ?
you germans can take your smug , self-satisfied views and shove them .
how 's that for candor , heinz ?
if germans had any sense of decency at all , they would shut their mouths before dispensing any advice - let alone moral advice - to george bush or to america .
any " crimes " america has ever committed pale by comparison to what you animals did not once , but twice in the last century .
your leaders kaiser willie and hitler were personally responsible for at least thirty million deaths , and you have the balls to ask germans what they think about my president and my country ? - john huettner violence destroyed our world trade center but that can be rebuilt .
george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .
george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .
we ca n't take it anymore . - lucy cole , alamo , california most americans are oblivious to their reception abroad , and i blame the american media for much of this ignorance .
bush 's record at home is remarkably but undeservedly good . - jeffrey hamill i am an a citizen of the united states and love my country but detest its current " leadership . "
our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .
if iraq truly had nothing to hide , then why not comply ?
should we have waited another 10 years while saddam continued to torture his own people ?
how long is too long ?
george w. bush is the only leader in the world strong enough to draw the line in the sand and face these threats head-on .
it may be years before this is truly understood .
the un is a weak , spineless organization that failed miserably to stop saddam .
jacques chirac is also weak , and could never stand up to terrorists the way mr. bush has .
i 'd rather see us fight terrorists , alone if we have to , on the streets of baghdad instead of being attacked on the streets of boston or elsewhere .
i will proudly vote for president george w. bush on nov .
2nd .
and many here agree with me , and i would prepare for a second bush term now . - steve bush has been a complete disaster internationally and an embarrassment to those of us in the us who long for a return to diplomacy to solve problems .
this country is , i 'm afraid , moving into a very dangerous unilateralism on a wide range of subjects .
this includes our refusal to join the eu and others in the international criminal court and kyoto .
i hate to say it , but i fear we are resorting back to pre-wwii us autonomy , hegemony and unilateralism in our relations with the world .
i think this could be a semi-permanent condition and i do n't know that even electing kerry will solve it .
americans are , unfortunately turning increasingly inward and are not taking criticism and disagreement from other nations and organizations very well .
in fact , they increasingly appear to be fighting back and downright dismissive of allies and others who voice disagreement with our policies .
it appears that being the only military " super-power " in the world is going to our heads .
remember the adage , " absolute power corrupts , absolutely " ! !
it appears to be true ! - trevor steven taylor you need to understand that most americans know that the us is just about the only country in the world that can " go it alone . "
for that reason , we americans do n't care what the world thinks about us or our international policies .
the independent streak of the americans is actually increased when we hear that a large percentage of the germans and french disagrees with something the us is doing , no matter what it is .
as soon as the us does not require energy from foreign sources , we may just resign from the united nations .
according to the polls , that 's the goal of more than half the americans , and those are the ones who support george w. bush .
thank you . - james l. reid , usa i believe george w. bush has hindered the spread of peace throughout the world .
i believe he does not consider that others world-wide have a right to govern their own area and have a clearer view of the big picture .
i also believe he was not taught to " play nice with others " when he was a child .
he has the arrogant , smirk of a bully who was born into privilege and has never had to consider the other person 's rights or feelings . - karen seeger , usa the only opinion that counts will be the election results in november .
the eu public is generally misinformed by a biased media that spews constant anti-bush information .
the net result is an anti-bush eu public . - boyd lawrence , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .
seeing the effects of bush 's foreign policy firsthand should boost kerry with expatriate voters , says dw-world 's marc young .
-lrb- sept .
27 , 2004 -rrb- a kerry conundrum for schröder the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .
however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier .

dw-world readers this week commented on the race for the white house and president bush 's negative foreign policy record abroad . your point of view is interesting , i lived in europe for eight years and appreciate your points of view ; it 's great to see that the billions of dollars we spent through the marshal plan has produced peaceful differences .
two things you overlook are : only us citizens vote , and the economy , not foreign policy will determine the outcome of the election .
we 've been through years and years of anti-americanism , so what else is new .
polls in other countries mean nothing .
the americans living overseas vote in their particular state so even though they may be 80 % democrats , scattered over 50 states i seriously doubt they will have the kind of impact you describe - frank shipp why does n't your rag of a newspaper conduct a poll of americans asking them what they think of germany and mr. schröder ?
you germans can take your smug , self-satisfied views and shove them .
how 's that for candor , heinz ?
if germans had any sense of decency at all , they would shut their mouths before dispensing any advice - let alone moral advice - to george bush or to america .
any " crimes " america has ever committed pale by comparison to what you animals did not once , but twice in the last century .
your leaders kaiser willie and hitler were personally responsible for at least thirty million deaths , and you have the balls to ask germans what they think about my president and my country ? - john huettner violence destroyed our world trade center but that can be rebuilt .
george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .
george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .
we ca n't take it anymore . - lucy cole , alamo , california most americans are oblivious to their reception abroad , and i blame the american media for much of this ignorance .
bush 's record at home is remarkably but undeservedly good . - jeffrey hamill i am an a citizen of the united states and love my country but detest its current " leadership . "
our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .
if iraq truly had nothing to hide , then why not comply ?
should we have waited another 10 years while saddam continued to torture his own people ?
how long is too long ?
george w. bush is the only leader in the world strong enough to draw the line in the sand and face these threats head-on .
it may be years before this is truly understood .
the un is a weak , spineless organization that failed miserably to stop saddam .
jacques chirac is also weak , and could never stand up to terrorists the way mr. bush has .
i 'd rather see us fight terrorists , alone if we have to , on the streets of baghdad instead of being attacked on the streets of boston or elsewhere .
i will proudly vote for president george w. bush on nov .
2nd .
and many here agree with me , and i would prepare for a second bush term now . - steve bush has been a complete disaster internationally and an embarrassment to those of us in the us who long for a return to diplomacy to solve problems .
this country is , i 'm afraid , moving into a very dangerous unilateralism on a wide range of subjects .
this includes our refusal to join the eu and others in the international criminal court and kyoto .
i hate to say it , but i fear we are resorting back to pre-wwii us autonomy , hegemony and unilateralism in our relations with the world .
i think this could be a semi-permanent condition and i do n't know that even electing kerry will solve it .
americans are , unfortunately turning increasingly inward and are not taking criticism and disagreement from other nations and organizations very well .
in fact , they increasingly appear to be fighting back and downright dismissive of allies and others who voice disagreement with our policies .
it appears that being the only military " super-power " in the world is going to our heads .
remember the adage , " absolute power corrupts , absolutely " ! !
it appears to be true ! - trevor steven taylor you need to understand that most americans know that the us is just about the only country in the world that can " go it alone . "
for that reason , we americans do n't care what the world thinks about us or our international policies .
the independent streak of the americans is actually increased when we hear that a large percentage of the germans and french disagrees with something the us is doing , no matter what it is .
as soon as the us does not require energy from foreign sources , we may just resign from the united nations .
according to the polls , that 's the goal of more than half the americans , and those are the ones who support george w. bush .
thank you . - james l. reid , usa i believe george w. bush has hindered the spread of peace throughout the world .
i believe he does not consider that others world-wide have a right to govern their own area and have a clearer view of the big picture .
i also believe he was not taught to " play nice with others " when he was a child .
he has the arrogant , smirk of a bully who was born into privilege and has never had to consider the other person 's rights or feelings . - karen seeger , usa the only opinion that counts will be the election results in november .
the eu public is generally misinformed by a biased media that spews constant anti-bush information .
the net result is an anti-bush eu public . - boyd lawrence , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .
seeing the effects of bush 's foreign policy firsthand should boost kerry with expatriate voters , says dw-world 's marc young .

george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .
we ca n't take it anymore . - lucy cole , alamo , california most americans are oblivious to their reception abroad , and i blame the american media for much of this ignorance .
bush 's record at home is remarkably but undeservedly good . - jeffrey hamill i am an a citizen of the united states and love my country but detest its current " leadership . "
our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .
if iraq truly had nothing to hide , then why not comply ?
should we have waited another 10 years while saddam continued to torture his own people ?
how long is too long ?
george w. bush is the only leader in the world strong enough to draw the line in the sand and face these threats head-on .
it may be years before this is truly understood .
the un is a weak , spineless organization that failed miserably to stop saddam .
jacques chirac is also weak , and could never stand up to terrorists the way mr. bush has .
i 'd rather see us fight terrorists , alone if we have to , on the streets of baghdad instead of being attacked on the streets of boston or elsewhere .
i will proudly vote for president george w. bush on nov .
2nd .
and many here agree with me , and i would prepare for a second bush term now . - steve bush has been a complete disaster internationally and an embarrassment to those of us in the us who long for a return to diplomacy to solve problems .
this country is , i 'm afraid , moving into a very dangerous unilateralism on a wide range of subjects .
this includes our refusal to join the eu and others in the international criminal court and kyoto .
i hate to say it , but i fear we are resorting back to pre-wwii us autonomy , hegemony and unilateralism in our relations with the world .
i think this could be a semi-permanent condition and i do n't know that even electing kerry will solve it .
americans are , unfortunately turning increasingly inward and are not taking criticism and disagreement from other nations and organizations very well .
in fact , they increasingly appear to be fighting back and downright dismissive of allies and others who voice disagreement with our policies .
it appears that being the only military " super-power " in the world is going to our heads .
remember the adage , " absolute power corrupts , absolutely " ! !
it appears to be true ! - trevor steven taylor you need to understand that most americans know that the us is just about the only country in the world that can " go it alone . "
for that reason , we americans do n't care what the world thinks about us or our international policies .
the independent streak of the americans is actually increased when we hear that a large percentage of the germans and french disagrees with something the us is doing , no matter what it is .
as soon as the us does not require energy from foreign sources , we may just resign from the united nations .
according to the polls , that 's the goal of more than half the americans , and those are the ones who support george w. bush .
thank you . - james l. reid , usa i believe george w. bush has hindered the spread of peace throughout the world .
i believe he does not consider that others world-wide have a right to govern their own area and have a clearer view of the big picture .
i also believe he was not taught to " play nice with others " when he was a child .
he has the arrogant , smirk of a bully who was born into privilege and has never had to consider the other person 's rights or feelings . - karen seeger , usa the only opinion that counts will be the election results in november .
the eu public is generally misinformed by a biased media that spews constant anti-bush information .

dw-world readers this week commented on the race for the white house and president bush 's negative foreign policy record abroad . your point of view is interesting , i lived in europe for eight years and appreciate your points of view ; it 's great to see that the billions of dollars we spent through the marshal plan has produced peaceful differences .
two things you overlook are : only us citizens vote , and the economy , not foreign policy will determine the outcome of the election .
we 've been through years and years of anti-americanism , so what else is new .
polls in other countries mean nothing .
the americans living overseas vote in their particular state so even though they may be 80 % democrats , scattered over 50 states i seriously doubt they will have the kind of impact you describe - frank shipp why does n't your rag of a newspaper conduct a poll of americans asking them what they think of germany and mr. schröder ?
you germans can take your smug , self-satisfied views and shove them .
how 's that for candor , heinz ?
if germans had any sense of decency at all , they would shut their mouths before dispensing any advice - let alone moral advice - to george bush or to america .
any " crimes " america has ever committed pale by comparison to what you animals did not once , but twice in the last century .
your leaders kaiser willie and hitler were personally responsible for at least thirty million deaths , and you have the balls to ask germans what they think about my president and my country ? - john huettner violence destroyed our world trade center but that can be rebuilt .
george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the capital of pop mp3 inventor wants a chat with his stereo german radio quota debate goes live netting the big fish business -pipe- 29.09.2004 can berlin save german pop ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking for the answers to the industry 's woes many in germany 's troubled music industry hope moving the trade fair popkomm from cologne to berlin this year will help the sector redefine itself in an age of plummeting cd sales and surging digital downloads . long suffering from sinking revenues and under threat from emerging technologies such as mp3 and internet file-swapping networks , there are several issues plaguing the music business during the 16th annual popkomm .
but the move to berlin has fused what is often billed as the world 's biggest music trade fair with new life .
" it 's not simply moving from one city to another , but rather a real fresh start , " said popkomm 's general manager ralf kleinhenz .
despite cologne 's role as an important media center in germany , the number of visitors to the fair had dropped dramatically in recent years .
opening with a big concert on tuesday night , organizers hope berlin - which has been anointed germany 's music capital - will increase popkomm 's international profile .
there will be 661 exhibitors at the three-day trade fair from 41 different countries .
along with an industry conference , there will be 400 hours of live music at concerts and club events open to the general public .
during the week , german acts like rappers die fantastischen vier and rockers sportfreunde stiller will perform alongside international artists including world-renowned techno djs and veteran gangsta rapper ice-t , who has a new group called the machine .
but as berliners enjoy a few days of top-shelf music , industry insiders will be discussing the still uncertain future of the music business .
the future is digital topping the agenda is how to deal with the rapidly evolving nature of music .
as fewer people buy cds and move their music collections to their home computers , the industry is still grappling with piracy and copyright issues for digital formats like mp3s .
some estimates have put the drop in sales for the german music sector at around 40 percent since 1997 .
most in the industry blame internet file-sharing networks that were modeled on napster .
" what 's changing at the moment is how we deal with music , " kleinhenz said .
" and that raises questions not only of an economic nature , but also cultural and societal questions . "
in germany , one of the top current questions is how best to support local artists .
some are calling for a radio quota for german musicians modeled on france 's system .
there , at least 40 percent of all radio airtime is reserved for french acts .
the initiative has gained the support of some german politicians , including green party parliamentarian antje vollmer .
" we owe it to our cultural identity , " vollmer said , according to dpa news agency .
" it has nothing to do with being overly german .
other countries naturally take care of their own artists . "
vollmer has called for an open parliamentary debate on the matter on wednesday .
not waiting for help many musicians agree more needs to be done to promote german acts , but they are n't waiting for the government or industry to help them out .
eike herwig , the drummer for the punk rock band the donots , said his group makes a special effort to promote up-and-coming bands .
besides setting up a special section highlighting new groups on their web site , the donots are also giving them opening spots on their latest tour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo and alex from the donots at the hurricane open air festival .
-lrb- eike is behind them . -rrb-
" i think it 's important to give german musicians more attention , " herwig told dw-world .
" a lot of the time on german radio the focus is on bands from america and england . "
tim renner from record label motor music backs the idea of supporting local acts , but is leery of a legally mandated quota .
during popkomm the label 's new radio station motorfm will broadcast only german bands and musicians like canadian electro-trash queen peaches , who have a connection to germany .
thinking globally and locally renner used to head up the german division of universal music , but he and the company parted ways amid disagreement over the direction the label was heading .
whereas renner always thought supporting local german musicians would be the best way to approach the domestic market , the head office of the company wanted to focus more on major international acts that could be sold globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim renner " i get mixed feelings when i hear the word quota , " renner told dw-world .
" they 'll tell you there 's not enough good stuff out there .
that 's not true .
they need to promote the cultural diversity , but any quota will mean they 've failed to find a radio concept . "
he said if motorfm gets a permanent frequency to broadcast in berlin the station will continue to support local artists , but it will concentrate on simply playing good music regardless of its origin .
renner is also hoping to pioneer new ways to make new digital technologies a boon instead of a bane for the industry .
he said the station would aim to make every song played available to download legally .
besides an internet portal along the lines of the apple itunes music store , he said he hoped to have a totally mobile business model , including being able to send a sms text message from your phone to purchase the song being played on your car stereo .
" the radio stations could be the retailers of tomorrow , " he said .

but the move to berlin has fused what is often billed as the world 's biggest music trade fair with new life .
" it 's not simply moving from one city to another , but rather a real fresh start , " said popkomm 's general manager ralf kleinhenz .
despite cologne 's role as an important media center in germany , the number of visitors to the fair had dropped dramatically in recent years .
opening with a big concert on tuesday night , organizers hope berlin - which has been anointed germany 's music capital - will increase popkomm 's international profile .
there will be 661 exhibitors at the three-day trade fair from 41 different countries .
along with an industry conference , there will be 400 hours of live music at concerts and club events open to the general public .
during the week , german acts like rappers die fantastischen vier and rockers sportfreunde stiller will perform alongside international artists including world-renowned techno djs and veteran gangsta rapper ice-t , who has a new group called the machine .
but as berliners enjoy a few days of top-shelf music , industry insiders will be discussing the still uncertain future of the music business .
the future is digital topping the agenda is how to deal with the rapidly evolving nature of music .
as fewer people buy cds and move their music collections to their home computers , the industry is still grappling with piracy and copyright issues for digital formats like mp3s .
some estimates have put the drop in sales for the german music sector at around 40 percent since 1997 .
most in the industry blame internet file-sharing networks that were modeled on napster .
" what 's changing at the moment is how we deal with music , " kleinhenz said .
" and that raises questions not only of an economic nature , but also cultural and societal questions . "
in germany , one of the top current questions is how best to support local artists .
some are calling for a radio quota for german musicians modeled on france 's system .
there , at least 40 percent of all radio airtime is reserved for french acts .
the initiative has gained the support of some german politicians , including green party parliamentarian antje vollmer .
" we owe it to our cultural identity , " vollmer said , according to dpa news agency .
" it has nothing to do with being overly german .
other countries naturally take care of their own artists . "
vollmer has called for an open parliamentary debate on the matter on wednesday .
not waiting for help many musicians agree more needs to be done to promote german acts , but they are n't waiting for the government or industry to help them out .
eike herwig , the drummer for the punk rock band the donots , said his group makes a special effort to promote up-and-coming bands .
besides setting up a special section highlighting new groups on their web site , the donots are also giving them opening spots on their latest tour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo and alex from the donots at the hurricane open air festival .
-lrb- eike is behind them . -rrb-
" i think it 's important to give german musicians more attention , " herwig told dw-world .
" a lot of the time on german radio the focus is on bands from america and england . "
tim renner from record label motor music backs the idea of supporting local acts , but is leery of a legally mandated quota .
during popkomm the label 's new radio station motorfm will broadcast only german bands and musicians like canadian electro-trash queen peaches , who have a connection to germany .
thinking globally and locally renner used to head up the german division of universal music , but he and the company parted ways amid disagreement over the direction the label was heading .
whereas renner always thought supporting local german musicians would be the best way to approach the domestic market , the head office of the company wanted to focus more on major international acts that could be sold globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim renner " i get mixed feelings when i hear the word quota , " renner told dw-world .
" they 'll tell you there 's not enough good stuff out there .

they need to promote the cultural diversity , but any quota will mean they 've failed to find a radio concept . "
he said if motorfm gets a permanent frequency to broadcast in berlin the station will continue to support local artists , but it will concentrate on simply playing good music regardless of its origin .

the paper said that although the machine guns usually on the vehicles would be taken off , they surely would n't be used to transport the baghdad football team .
instead they would carry heavily armed people through territory endangered by explosive traps and snipers .
the " fuchs , " as the vehicles are called , is war material , delivered by germany to a war area and german politicians will have to ask themselves in future what use of german weapons is desired in which contexts , the paper wrote .
recalling that he won the 2002 election with his anti-war stance , the offenburger tageblatt newspaper said chancellor schröder has thrown his iraq policy overboard .
the supply of the vehicles is direct support of the allied troops , the paper wrote , and hence a direct intervention in the iraq war ; schröder broke his word .
the badische zeitung of freiburg wrote that regardless of all criticism of the war , schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer agree that the west must not fail in iraq , because it would be a catastrophe if the country were to descend into despotism , anarchy or religious fanaticism .
the armored vehicles are to ease , at least temporarily , the pressure on germany to get more involved , the paper opined .
the main-echo newspaper saw the british prime minister marshalling his rank and file behind him because a third election win is more important to them than moral debates .
the discipline in the campaigning ahead would ensure an end to all speculation about treasurer gordon brown replacing prime minister tony blair .
it ’ s an altogether different matter , though whether the british public will continue to accept a prime minister who can ’ t bring himself to say sorry for his iraq policy , the paper said .
the badisches tagblatt of baden-baden noted that blair played on his strength and his personality , which brought him to power triumphantly in 1997 .
hollow-cheeked , passionately and very openly , he admitted personal mistakes , including that he believed claims about iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
blair appeared to be resigned to his political fate being linked to developments in iraq , the paper wrote .
all bad news from there falls back on him and the ratings of his party , it concluded .

the paper said that although the machine guns usually on the vehicles would be taken off , they surely would n't be used to transport the baghdad football team .
instead they would carry heavily armed people through territory endangered by explosive traps and snipers .
the " fuchs , " as the vehicles are called , is war material , delivered by germany to a war area and german politicians will have to ask themselves in future what use of german weapons is desired in which contexts , the paper wrote .
recalling that he won the 2002 election with his anti-war stance , the offenburger tageblatt newspaper said chancellor schröder has thrown his iraq policy overboard .
the supply of the vehicles is direct support of the allied troops , the paper wrote , and hence a direct intervention in the iraq war ; schröder broke his word .
the badische zeitung of freiburg wrote that regardless of all criticism of the war , schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer agree that the west must not fail in iraq , because it would be a catastrophe if the country were to descend into despotism , anarchy or religious fanaticism .
the armored vehicles are to ease , at least temporarily , the pressure on germany to get more involved , the paper opined .
the main-echo newspaper saw the british prime minister marshalling his rank and file behind him because a third election win is more important to them than moral debates .
the discipline in the campaigning ahead would ensure an end to all speculation about treasurer gordon brown replacing prime minister tony blair .
it ’ s an altogether different matter , though whether the british public will continue to accept a prime minister who can ’ t bring himself to say sorry for his iraq policy , the paper said .
the badisches tagblatt of baden-baden noted that blair played on his strength and his personality , which brought him to power triumphantly in 1997 .
hollow-cheeked , passionately and very openly , he admitted personal mistakes , including that he believed claims about iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
blair appeared to be resigned to his political fate being linked to developments in iraq , the paper wrote .
all bad news from there falls back on him and the ratings of his party , it concluded .
the financial times deutschland found blair focusing on the need for education , health care and pension reforms to distract attention from iraq .
despite anger over iraq , the paper still saw a small majority for blair 's labor party in most polls and predicted it would win . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the paper said that although the machine guns usually on the vehicles would be taken off , they surely would n't be used to transport the baghdad football team .
instead they would carry heavily armed people through territory endangered by explosive traps and snipers .
the " fuchs , " as the vehicles are called , is war material , delivered by germany to a war area and german politicians will have to ask themselves in future what use of german weapons is desired in which contexts , the paper wrote .
recalling that he won the 2002 election with his anti-war stance , the offenburger tageblatt newspaper said chancellor schröder has thrown his iraq policy overboard .
the supply of the vehicles is direct support of the allied troops , the paper wrote , and hence a direct intervention in the iraq war ; schröder broke his word .
the badische zeitung of freiburg wrote that regardless of all criticism of the war , schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer agree that the west must not fail in iraq , because it would be a catastrophe if the country were to descend into despotism , anarchy or religious fanaticism .
the armored vehicles are to ease , at least temporarily , the pressure on germany to get more involved , the paper opined .
the main-echo newspaper saw the british prime minister marshalling his rank and file behind him because a third election win is more important to them than moral debates .
the discipline in the campaigning ahead would ensure an end to all speculation about treasurer gordon brown replacing prime minister tony blair .
it ’ s an altogether different matter , though whether the british public will continue to accept a prime minister who can ’ t bring himself to say sorry for his iraq policy , the paper said .
the badisches tagblatt of baden-baden noted that blair played on his strength and his personality , which brought him to power triumphantly in 1997 .
hollow-cheeked , passionately and very openly , he admitted personal mistakes , including that he believed claims about iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
blair appeared to be resigned to his political fate being linked to developments in iraq , the paper wrote .
all bad news from there falls back on him and the ratings of his party , it concluded .
the financial times deutschland found blair focusing on the need for education , health care and pension reforms to distract attention from iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the capital of pop mp3 inventor wants a chat with his stereo german radio quota debate goes live netting the big fish business -pipe- 29.09.2004 can berlin save german pop ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking for the answers to the industry 's woes many in germany 's troubled music industry hope moving the trade fair popkomm from cologne to berlin this year will help the sector redefine itself in an age of plummeting cd sales and surging digital downloads . long suffering from sinking revenues and under threat from emerging technologies such as mp3 and internet file-swapping networks , there are several issues plaguing the music business during the 16th annual popkomm .
but the move to berlin has fused what is often billed as the world 's biggest music trade fair with new life .
" it 's not simply moving from one city to another , but rather a real fresh start , " said popkomm 's general manager ralf kleinhenz .
despite cologne 's role as an important media center in germany , the number of visitors to the fair had dropped dramatically in recent years .
opening with a big concert on tuesday night , organizers hope berlin - which has been anointed germany 's music capital - will increase popkomm 's international profile .
there will be 661 exhibitors at the three-day trade fair from 41 different countries .
along with an industry conference , there will be 400 hours of live music at concerts and club events open to the general public .
during the week , german acts like rappers die fantastischen vier and rockers sportfreunde stiller will perform alongside international artists including world-renowned techno djs and veteran gangsta rapper ice-t , who has a new group called the machine .
but as berliners enjoy a few days of top-shelf music , industry insiders will be discussing the still uncertain future of the music business .
the future is digital topping the agenda is how to deal with the rapidly evolving nature of music .
as fewer people buy cds and move their music collections to their home computers , the industry is still grappling with piracy and copyright issues for digital formats like mp3s .
some estimates have put the drop in sales for the german music sector at around 40 percent since 1997 .
most in the industry blame internet file-sharing networks that were modeled on napster .
" what 's changing at the moment is how we deal with music , " kleinhenz said .
" and that raises questions not only of an economic nature , but also cultural and societal questions . "
in germany , one of the top current questions is how best to support local artists .
some are calling for a radio quota for german musicians modeled on france 's system .
there , at least 40 percent of all radio airtime is reserved for french acts .
the initiative has gained the support of some german politicians , including green party parliamentarian antje vollmer .
" we owe it to our cultural identity , " vollmer said , according to dpa news agency .
" it has nothing to do with being overly german .
other countries naturally take care of their own artists . "
vollmer has called for an open parliamentary debate on the matter on wednesday .
not waiting for help many musicians agree more needs to be done to promote german acts , but they are n't waiting for the government or industry to help them out .
eike herwig , the drummer for the punk rock band the donots , said his group makes a special effort to promote up-and-coming bands .
besides setting up a special section highlighting new groups on their web site , the donots are also giving them opening spots on their latest tour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo and alex from the donots at the hurricane open air festival .
-lrb- eike is behind them . -rrb-

" we owe it to our cultural identity , " vollmer said , according to dpa news agency .

vollmer has called for an open parliamentary debate on the matter on wednesday .

dw-world readers this week commented on the race for the white house and president bush 's negative foreign policy record abroad . your point of view is interesting , i lived in europe for eight years and appreciate your points of view ; it 's great to see that the billions of dollars we spent through the marshal plan has produced peaceful differences .
two things you overlook are : only us citizens vote , and the economy , not foreign policy will determine the outcome of the election .
we 've been through years and years of anti-americanism , so what else is new .
polls in other countries mean nothing .
the americans living overseas vote in their particular state so even though they may be 80 % democrats , scattered over 50 states i seriously doubt they will have the kind of impact you describe - frank shipp why does n't your rag of a newspaper conduct a poll of americans asking them what they think of germany and mr. schröder ?
you germans can take your smug , self-satisfied views and shove them .
how 's that for candor , heinz ?
if germans had any sense of decency at all , they would shut their mouths before dispensing any advice - let alone moral advice - to george bush or to america .
any " crimes " america has ever committed pale by comparison to what you animals did not once , but twice in the last century .
your leaders kaiser willie and hitler were personally responsible for at least thirty million deaths , and you have the balls to ask germans what they think about my president and my country ? - john huettner violence destroyed our world trade center but that can be rebuilt .
george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .
george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .
we ca n't take it anymore . - lucy cole , alamo , california most americans are oblivious to their reception abroad , and i blame the american media for much of this ignorance .
bush 's record at home is remarkably but undeservedly good . - jeffrey hamill i am an a citizen of the united states and love my country but detest its current " leadership . "
our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .
if iraq truly had nothing to hide , then why not comply ?
should we have waited another 10 years while saddam continued to torture his own people ?
how long is too long ?
george w. bush is the only leader in the world strong enough to draw the line in the sand and face these threats head-on .
it may be years before this is truly understood .
the un is a weak , spineless organization that failed miserably to stop saddam .
jacques chirac is also weak , and could never stand up to terrorists the way mr. bush has .
i 'd rather see us fight terrorists , alone if we have to , on the streets of baghdad instead of being attacked on the streets of boston or elsewhere .
i will proudly vote for president george w. bush on nov .
2nd .
and many here agree with me , and i would prepare for a second bush term now . - steve bush has been a complete disaster internationally and an embarrassment to those of us in the us who long for a return to diplomacy to solve problems .
this country is , i 'm afraid , moving into a very dangerous unilateralism on a wide range of subjects .
this includes our refusal to join the eu and others in the international criminal court and kyoto .
i hate to say it , but i fear we are resorting back to pre-wwii us autonomy , hegemony and unilateralism in our relations with the world .
i think this could be a semi-permanent condition and i do n't know that even electing kerry will solve it .
americans are , unfortunately turning increasingly inward and are not taking criticism and disagreement from other nations and organizations very well .
in fact , they increasingly appear to be fighting back and downright dismissive of allies and others who voice disagreement with our policies .
it appears that being the only military " super-power " in the world is going to our heads .
remember the adage , " absolute power corrupts , absolutely " ! !
it appears to be true ! - trevor steven taylor you need to understand that most americans know that the us is just about the only country in the world that can " go it alone . "
for that reason , we americans do n't care what the world thinks about us or our international policies .
the independent streak of the americans is actually increased when we hear that a large percentage of the germans and french disagrees with something the us is doing , no matter what it is .
as soon as the us does not require energy from foreign sources , we may just resign from the united nations .
according to the polls , that 's the goal of more than half the americans , and those are the ones who support george w. bush .
thank you . - james l. reid , usa i believe george w. bush has hindered the spread of peace throughout the world .
i believe he does not consider that others world-wide have a right to govern their own area and have a clearer view of the big picture .
i also believe he was not taught to " play nice with others " when he was a child .
he has the arrogant , smirk of a bully who was born into privilege and has never had to consider the other person 's rights or feelings . - karen seeger , usa the only opinion that counts will be the election results in november .
the eu public is generally misinformed by a biased media that spews constant anti-bush information .
the net result is an anti-bush eu public . - boyd lawrence , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .
seeing the effects of bush 's foreign policy firsthand should boost kerry with expatriate voters , says dw-world 's marc young .
-lrb- sept .
27 , 2004 -rrb- a kerry conundrum for schröder the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .
however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier .

dw-world readers this week commented on the race for the white house and president bush 's negative foreign policy record abroad . your point of view is interesting , i lived in europe for eight years and appreciate your points of view ; it 's great to see that the billions of dollars we spent through the marshal plan has produced peaceful differences .
two things you overlook are : only us citizens vote , and the economy , not foreign policy will determine the outcome of the election .
we 've been through years and years of anti-americanism , so what else is new .
polls in other countries mean nothing .
the americans living overseas vote in their particular state so even though they may be 80 % democrats , scattered over 50 states i seriously doubt they will have the kind of impact you describe - frank shipp why does n't your rag of a newspaper conduct a poll of americans asking them what they think of germany and mr. schröder ?
you germans can take your smug , self-satisfied views and shove them .
how 's that for candor , heinz ?
if germans had any sense of decency at all , they would shut their mouths before dispensing any advice - let alone moral advice - to george bush or to america .
any " crimes " america has ever committed pale by comparison to what you animals did not once , but twice in the last century .
your leaders kaiser willie and hitler were personally responsible for at least thirty million deaths , and you have the balls to ask germans what they think about my president and my country ? - john huettner violence destroyed our world trade center but that can be rebuilt .
george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .
george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .
we ca n't take it anymore . - lucy cole , alamo , california most americans are oblivious to their reception abroad , and i blame the american media for much of this ignorance .
bush 's record at home is remarkably but undeservedly good . - jeffrey hamill i am an a citizen of the united states and love my country but detest its current " leadership . "
our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .
if iraq truly had nothing to hide , then why not comply ?
should we have waited another 10 years while saddam continued to torture his own people ?
how long is too long ?
george w. bush is the only leader in the world strong enough to draw the line in the sand and face these threats head-on .
it may be years before this is truly understood .
the un is a weak , spineless organization that failed miserably to stop saddam .
jacques chirac is also weak , and could never stand up to terrorists the way mr. bush has .
i 'd rather see us fight terrorists , alone if we have to , on the streets of baghdad instead of being attacked on the streets of boston or elsewhere .
i will proudly vote for president george w. bush on nov .
2nd .
and many here agree with me , and i would prepare for a second bush term now . - steve bush has been a complete disaster internationally and an embarrassment to those of us in the us who long for a return to diplomacy to solve problems .
this country is , i 'm afraid , moving into a very dangerous unilateralism on a wide range of subjects .
this includes our refusal to join the eu and others in the international criminal court and kyoto .
i hate to say it , but i fear we are resorting back to pre-wwii us autonomy , hegemony and unilateralism in our relations with the world .
i think this could be a semi-permanent condition and i do n't know that even electing kerry will solve it .
americans are , unfortunately turning increasingly inward and are not taking criticism and disagreement from other nations and organizations very well .
in fact , they increasingly appear to be fighting back and downright dismissive of allies and others who voice disagreement with our policies .
it appears that being the only military " super-power " in the world is going to our heads .
remember the adage , " absolute power corrupts , absolutely " ! !
it appears to be true ! - trevor steven taylor you need to understand that most americans know that the us is just about the only country in the world that can " go it alone . "
for that reason , we americans do n't care what the world thinks about us or our international policies .
the independent streak of the americans is actually increased when we hear that a large percentage of the germans and french disagrees with something the us is doing , no matter what it is .
as soon as the us does not require energy from foreign sources , we may just resign from the united nations .
according to the polls , that 's the goal of more than half the americans , and those are the ones who support george w. bush .
thank you . - james l. reid , usa i believe george w. bush has hindered the spread of peace throughout the world .
i believe he does not consider that others world-wide have a right to govern their own area and have a clearer view of the big picture .
i also believe he was not taught to " play nice with others " when he was a child .
he has the arrogant , smirk of a bully who was born into privilege and has never had to consider the other person 's rights or feelings . - karen seeger , usa the only opinion that counts will be the election results in november .
the eu public is generally misinformed by a biased media that spews constant anti-bush information .
the net result is an anti-bush eu public . - boyd lawrence , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .
seeing the effects of bush 's foreign policy firsthand should boost kerry with expatriate voters , says dw-world 's marc young .

27 , 2004 -rrb- a kerry conundrum for schröder the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .
however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier .

two things you overlook are : only us citizens vote , and the economy , not foreign policy will determine the outcome of the election .
we 've been through years and years of anti-americanism , so what else is new .
polls in other countries mean nothing .
the americans living overseas vote in their particular state so even though they may be 80 % democrats , scattered over 50 states i seriously doubt they will have the kind of impact you describe - frank shipp why does n't your rag of a newspaper conduct a poll of americans asking them what they think of germany and mr. schröder ?
you germans can take your smug , self-satisfied views and shove them .
how 's that for candor , heinz ?
if germans had any sense of decency at all , they would shut their mouths before dispensing any advice - let alone moral advice - to george bush or to america .
any " crimes " america has ever committed pale by comparison to what you animals did not once , but twice in the last century .
your leaders kaiser willie and hitler were personally responsible for at least thirty million deaths , and you have the balls to ask germans what they think about my president and my country ? - john huettner violence destroyed our world trade center but that can be rebuilt .
george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .
george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .
we ca n't take it anymore . - lucy cole , alamo , california most americans are oblivious to their reception abroad , and i blame the american media for much of this ignorance .
bush 's record at home is remarkably but undeservedly good . - jeffrey hamill i am an a citizen of the united states and love my country but detest its current " leadership . "
our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .
if iraq truly had nothing to hide , then why not comply ?
should we have waited another 10 years while saddam continued to torture his own people ?
how long is too long ?
george w. bush is the only leader in the world strong enough to draw the line in the sand and face these threats head-on .
it may be years before this is truly understood .
the un is a weak , spineless organization that failed miserably to stop saddam .
jacques chirac is also weak , and could never stand up to terrorists the way mr. bush has .
i 'd rather see us fight terrorists , alone if we have to , on the streets of baghdad instead of being attacked on the streets of boston or elsewhere .
i will proudly vote for president george w. bush on nov .
2nd .
and many here agree with me , and i would prepare for a second bush term now . - steve bush has been a complete disaster internationally and an embarrassment to those of us in the us who long for a return to diplomacy to solve problems .
this country is , i 'm afraid , moving into a very dangerous unilateralism on a wide range of subjects .
this includes our refusal to join the eu and others in the international criminal court and kyoto .
i hate to say it , but i fear we are resorting back to pre-wwii us autonomy , hegemony and unilateralism in our relations with the world .
i think this could be a semi-permanent condition and i do n't know that even electing kerry will solve it .
americans are , unfortunately turning increasingly inward and are not taking criticism and disagreement from other nations and organizations very well .
in fact , they increasingly appear to be fighting back and downright dismissive of allies and others who voice disagreement with our policies .
it appears that being the only military " super-power " in the world is going to our heads .
remember the adage , " absolute power corrupts , absolutely " ! !
it appears to be true ! - trevor steven taylor you need to understand that most americans know that the us is just about the only country in the world that can " go it alone . "
for that reason , we americans do n't care what the world thinks about us or our international policies .
the independent streak of the americans is actually increased when we hear that a large percentage of the germans and french disagrees with something the us is doing , no matter what it is .
as soon as the us does not require energy from foreign sources , we may just resign from the united nations .
according to the polls , that 's the goal of more than half the americans , and those are the ones who support george w. bush .
thank you . - james l. reid , usa i believe george w. bush has hindered the spread of peace throughout the world .
i believe he does not consider that others world-wide have a right to govern their own area and have a clearer view of the big picture .
i also believe he was not taught to " play nice with others " when he was a child .
he has the arrogant , smirk of a bully who was born into privilege and has never had to consider the other person 's rights or feelings . - karen seeger , usa the only opinion that counts will be the election results in november .
the eu public is generally misinformed by a biased media that spews constant anti-bush information .
the net result is an anti-bush eu public . - boyd lawrence , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .
seeing the effects of bush 's foreign policy firsthand should boost kerry with expatriate voters , says dw-world 's marc young .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 2004 frankfurt book fair opinion : open , sesame !
the healing power of storytelling the unknown guest of honor frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.09.2004 book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tahar ben jelloun is one of the few well-known arab authors in europe many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all . of the around 120,000 foreign fiction titles translated into german , only about 500 come from the arab world .
it 's a telling statement on the lack of information in the west when it comes to the diversity of the literary landscape in the arab countries . it 's usually literary heavyweights such as egyptian author and nobel prize winner naguib mahfouz or france-based moroccan writer tahar ben jelloun who enjoy relative popularity in europe . but that might be about to change as the spotlight falls on the arab league at this year 's frankfurt book fair .
starting october 6 , visitors to the world 's largest book fair will get the chance to meet and get acquainted with the works of around 200 authors and artists from 17 countries of the 22-member arab league . arab league program under fire but , even as the arab league readies itself for the chance to showcase its literary talent on a western platform , it has been dogged by criticism of its program . a few days ago , moroccan culture minister and poet muhammad al-ashari said he found it hard to understand that arabs , in 22 very diverse nations , were invited to the fair as a whole entity .
morocco , along with kuwait , libya , algeria and iraq , is not participating in the official program of the arab league at the frankfurt book fair . further criticism centers on the disproportionately large share of egyptian authors among the invited guests as well as the lack of initiative to involve authors in exile . the arab league 's program , which it unveiled at a press conference in frankfurt in june , is comprehensive , to say the least : poetry and prose readings , music , film and folkloristic events , discussion forums on globalization , human rights and reform in the arab world . among the invited authors are prominent names in literary circles such as the poets adonis and mahmud darwish , the francophone authors asia djebar and amin maalouf , but also names largely unknown in germany , such as the saudi writers raja alim and abduh khal . censorship still taboo in addition to the exhaustive program , the arab organizers at the frankfurt book fair spoke glowingly of the arab world wanting to initiate an open dialogue with the west as well as discuss controversial questions .
at the same time , the organizers sought to play down or completely avoid grave problems such as the woes of the arab book market and publishing industry . the arab organizers ' unwillingness to discuss pressing issues was apparent when it came to the ubiquitous censorship in the arab world . the director of the muscat book fair in oman , muhammad ali hassan , explained why censorship was necessary .
" our societies have their specialties and traditions that need to be respected , " hassan said .
" everything that attacks arab society or creates turbulence should be forbidden .
our societies still need protection , " he told deutsche welle . that seems to be the dominating opinion among arab book fair circles .
but censorship , which is one of the largest problems within the arab world , is not even mentioned in the official part of the arab league 's frankfurt fair program .
ibrahim al-muallim , president of the arab publishing association , instead claimed that arab publishers have made great strides in the fight against censorship . khalid qubaia , a libyan publisher and official at the arab publishing association , made no bones about the fact that his organization had clear views on censorship . " different benchmarks on censorship prevail in every arab country , " qubaia said .
" the arab publishers ' association agrees with two reasons for censorship : when a book compromises the security of a nation or when it does n't reflect ideas of morality . " lively discussions guaranteed but that 's not a view jabir asfur , director of the egyptian high council for culture , agreed with .
in the arabic daily al-hayat , asfur recently praised german oriental studies and efforts to translate arab literature into german . at the same time asfur was also self-critical .
he wrote that neither individual arab states nor the arab league nor the arab publishers ' association had ever set up initiatives to support the translation of arabic literature into other languages . but , this self-criticism comes late .
on the one hand arab intellectuals have been demanding for years to set up a fund for exactly that purpose .
on the other , uncertainty still surrounds a list with arab books that are meant to be translated into german and english on the occasion of the arab league 's guest performance at the frankfurt book fair . one thing is clear though : suspense and heated discussion are guaranteed this year at the frankfurt book fair . mona naggar -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

while the old id measures will be accepted during the transition phase , after 2011 , all animals will need to have a microchip the size of a grain of rice injected which contains a machine-readable number to identify the animal . " total nonsense , " scoffed professor hans-joachim hackbarth of the veterinary school in hanover upon hearing of the new regulations .
he said he ca n't remember the last time he was required to show his own passport when crossing an eu border .
the effort pet owners have to make for their animals to meet eu standards is in no relation to the usefulness of the information , hackbarth said . home is best germany 's national association of veterinarians showed understanding for the eu 's desire to unify pet identification procedures .
after all , countries such as ireland , britain and sweden are rabies-free , and would like to stay that way . but the german society for the protection of animals says the best advice for pet owners is to leave their furry friends at home when they travel . and so that owners do n't have to resort to kennels , they 've even set up a hotline for pet " foster families .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.09.2004 trading shares in geniuses and heroes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii is the market leader for the nobel peace prize the work of the committee that selects nobel prize winners might be strictly confidential , but the university of frankfurt is betting that it can predict who the next winners will be using a virtual stock market . buy shares in bob dylan and kofi annan , or sell shares in helmut kohl .
it 's all possible at a new internet-based virtual stock market -lrb- vsm -rrb- aimed at predicting who will be among the next nobel prize winners .
the vsm is an economic experiment by the university of frankfurt , to see how well short- and medium-term market developments can be predicted .
the stocks in nobel candidates represent a bet on the outcome of future market situations - the higher the value of the stock , the more probable the market situation is .
the participants in the nobel vsm do n't have to concern themselves with economic models , however .
nor is any real money riding on this particular stock market .
but the most successful investors stand to win dividends in the form of 50 prizes , including an ibm laptop .
kohl stocks suffering internet users have to register to take part in the virtual market .
each participant then receives an initial cash deposit of $ 10,000 -lrb- € 12,300 -rrb- that can be used for buying and selling stocks .
just like a real market , the price of the stocks rises and falls according to supply and demand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl stock in former german chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- photo -rrb- as a candidate for the peace prize , for example , is going cheap , having dropped 16 percent from its initial offering price of $ 10 .
in contrast , demand for shares in top runner pope john paul ii has skyrocketed .
his stock is currently trading at over $ 70 .
trading at the nobel prize market wraps up at 6 p.m. the day before the winners are announced - that will happen on oct .
8 at the earliest .
once the nobel laureates are made known , the stocks are cashed out , with every share in a winner valued at $ 1,000 .
the participant with highest account balance wins the market .
reliable predictors frankfurt university 's project leader for the nobel prize market , bernd skiera , says vsm 's are increasingly establishing themselves as reliable predictors of future events .
their results are frequently just as good or better than comparable predictors such as polls , skiera said .
political stock markets , for example , are used to predict election results in countries such as the united states , germany , canada , the netherlands and austria .
slightly more macabre , perhaps , is the virtual terror stock market , terror xchange , where users buy or sell virtual shares of major international news events they think are likely to occur . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing tragedy in the soccer stadium how fast can a packed soccer stadium be evacuated ?

despite cologne 's role as an important media center in germany , the number of visitors to the fair had dropped dramatically in recent years .
opening with a big concert on tuesday night , organizers hope berlin - which has been anointed germany 's music capital - will increase popkomm 's international profile .
there will be 661 exhibitors at the three-day trade fair from 41 different countries .

other countries naturally take care of their own artists . "
vollmer has called for an open parliamentary debate on the matter on wednesday .

it 's all possible at a new internet-based virtual stock market -lrb- vsm -rrb- aimed at predicting who will be among the next nobel prize winners .
the vsm is an economic experiment by the university of frankfurt , to see how well short- and medium-term market developments can be predicted .
the stocks in nobel candidates represent a bet on the outcome of future market situations - the higher the value of the stock , the more probable the market situation is .
the participants in the nobel vsm do n't have to concern themselves with economic models , however .
nor is any real money riding on this particular stock market .
but the most successful investors stand to win dividends in the form of 50 prizes , including an ibm laptop .
kohl stocks suffering internet users have to register to take part in the virtual market .
each participant then receives an initial cash deposit of $ 10,000 -lrb- € 12,300 -rrb- that can be used for buying and selling stocks .
just like a real market , the price of the stocks rises and falls according to supply and demand .

trading at the nobel prize market wraps up at 6 p.m. the day before the winners are announced - that will happen on oct .

once the nobel laureates are made known , the stocks are cashed out , with every share in a winner valued at $ 1,000 .
the participant with highest account balance wins the market .
reliable predictors frankfurt university 's project leader for the nobel prize market , bernd skiera , says vsm 's are increasingly establishing themselves as reliable predictors of future events .
their results are frequently just as good or better than comparable predictors such as polls , skiera said .
political stock markets , for example , are used to predict election results in countries such as the united states , germany , canada , the netherlands and austria .
slightly more macabre , perhaps , is the virtual terror stock market , terror xchange , where users buy or sell virtual shares of major international news events they think are likely to occur . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing tragedy in the soccer stadium how fast can a packed soccer stadium be evacuated ?

the healing power of storytelling the unknown guest of honor frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.09.2004 book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tahar ben jelloun is one of the few well-known arab authors in europe many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all . of the around 120,000 foreign fiction titles translated into german , only about 500 come from the arab world .
it 's a telling statement on the lack of information in the west when it comes to the diversity of the literary landscape in the arab countries . it 's usually literary heavyweights such as egyptian author and nobel prize winner naguib mahfouz or france-based moroccan writer tahar ben jelloun who enjoy relative popularity in europe . but that might be about to change as the spotlight falls on the arab league at this year 's frankfurt book fair .
starting october 6 , visitors to the world 's largest book fair will get the chance to meet and get acquainted with the works of around 200 authors and artists from 17 countries of the 22-member arab league . arab league program under fire but , even as the arab league readies itself for the chance to showcase its literary talent on a western platform , it has been dogged by criticism of its program . a few days ago , moroccan culture minister and poet muhammad al-ashari said he found it hard to understand that arabs , in 22 very diverse nations , were invited to the fair as a whole entity .
morocco , along with kuwait , libya , algeria and iraq , is not participating in the official program of the arab league at the frankfurt book fair . further criticism centers on the disproportionately large share of egyptian authors among the invited guests as well as the lack of initiative to involve authors in exile . the arab league 's program , which it unveiled at a press conference in frankfurt in june , is comprehensive , to say the least : poetry and prose readings , music , film and folkloristic events , discussion forums on globalization , human rights and reform in the arab world . among the invited authors are prominent names in literary circles such as the poets adonis and mahmud darwish , the francophone authors asia djebar and amin maalouf , but also names largely unknown in germany , such as the saudi writers raja alim and abduh khal . censorship still taboo in addition to the exhaustive program , the arab organizers at the frankfurt book fair spoke glowingly of the arab world wanting to initiate an open dialogue with the west as well as discuss controversial questions .
at the same time , the organizers sought to play down or completely avoid grave problems such as the woes of the arab book market and publishing industry . the arab organizers ' unwillingness to discuss pressing issues was apparent when it came to the ubiquitous censorship in the arab world . the director of the muscat book fair in oman , muhammad ali hassan , explained why censorship was necessary .
" our societies have their specialties and traditions that need to be respected , " hassan said .
" everything that attacks arab society or creates turbulence should be forbidden .
our societies still need protection , " he told deutsche welle . that seems to be the dominating opinion among arab book fair circles .
but censorship , which is one of the largest problems within the arab world , is not even mentioned in the official part of the arab league 's frankfurt fair program .
ibrahim al-muallim , president of the arab publishing association , instead claimed that arab publishers have made great strides in the fight against censorship . khalid qubaia , a libyan publisher and official at the arab publishing association , made no bones about the fact that his organization had clear views on censorship . " different benchmarks on censorship prevail in every arab country , " qubaia said .
" the arab publishers ' association agrees with two reasons for censorship : when a book compromises the security of a nation or when it does n't reflect ideas of morality . " lively discussions guaranteed but that 's not a view jabir asfur , director of the egyptian high council for culture , agreed with .
in the arabic daily al-hayat , asfur recently praised german oriental studies and efforts to translate arab literature into german . at the same time asfur was also self-critical .
he wrote that neither individual arab states nor the arab league nor the arab publishers ' association had ever set up initiatives to support the translation of arabic literature into other languages . but , this self-criticism comes late .
on the one hand arab intellectuals have been demanding for years to set up a fund for exactly that purpose .
on the other , uncertainty still surrounds a list with arab books that are meant to be translated into german and english on the occasion of the arab league 's guest performance at the frankfurt book fair . one thing is clear though : suspense and heated discussion are guaranteed this year at the frankfurt book fair . mona naggar -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

the healing power of storytelling the unknown guest of honor frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.09.2004 book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tahar ben jelloun is one of the few well-known arab authors in europe many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all . of the around 120,000 foreign fiction titles translated into german , only about 500 come from the arab world .
it 's a telling statement on the lack of information in the west when it comes to the diversity of the literary landscape in the arab countries . it 's usually literary heavyweights such as egyptian author and nobel prize winner naguib mahfouz or france-based moroccan writer tahar ben jelloun who enjoy relative popularity in europe . but that might be about to change as the spotlight falls on the arab league at this year 's frankfurt book fair .
starting october 6 , visitors to the world 's largest book fair will get the chance to meet and get acquainted with the works of around 200 authors and artists from 17 countries of the 22-member arab league . arab league program under fire but , even as the arab league readies itself for the chance to showcase its literary talent on a western platform , it has been dogged by criticism of its program . a few days ago , moroccan culture minister and poet muhammad al-ashari said he found it hard to understand that arabs , in 22 very diverse nations , were invited to the fair as a whole entity .
morocco , along with kuwait , libya , algeria and iraq , is not participating in the official program of the arab league at the frankfurt book fair . further criticism centers on the disproportionately large share of egyptian authors among the invited guests as well as the lack of initiative to involve authors in exile . the arab league 's program , which it unveiled at a press conference in frankfurt in june , is comprehensive , to say the least : poetry and prose readings , music , film and folkloristic events , discussion forums on globalization , human rights and reform in the arab world . among the invited authors are prominent names in literary circles such as the poets adonis and mahmud darwish , the francophone authors asia djebar and amin maalouf , but also names largely unknown in germany , such as the saudi writers raja alim and abduh khal . censorship still taboo in addition to the exhaustive program , the arab organizers at the frankfurt book fair spoke glowingly of the arab world wanting to initiate an open dialogue with the west as well as discuss controversial questions .
at the same time , the organizers sought to play down or completely avoid grave problems such as the woes of the arab book market and publishing industry . the arab organizers ' unwillingness to discuss pressing issues was apparent when it came to the ubiquitous censorship in the arab world . the director of the muscat book fair in oman , muhammad ali hassan , explained why censorship was necessary .
" our societies have their specialties and traditions that need to be respected , " hassan said .
" everything that attacks arab society or creates turbulence should be forbidden .
our societies still need protection , " he told deutsche welle . that seems to be the dominating opinion among arab book fair circles .
but censorship , which is one of the largest problems within the arab world , is not even mentioned in the official part of the arab league 's frankfurt fair program .
ibrahim al-muallim , president of the arab publishing association , instead claimed that arab publishers have made great strides in the fight against censorship . khalid qubaia , a libyan publisher and official at the arab publishing association , made no bones about the fact that his organization had clear views on censorship . " different benchmarks on censorship prevail in every arab country , " qubaia said .
" the arab publishers ' association agrees with two reasons for censorship : when a book compromises the security of a nation or when it does n't reflect ideas of morality . " lively discussions guaranteed but that 's not a view jabir asfur , director of the egyptian high council for culture , agreed with .
in the arabic daily al-hayat , asfur recently praised german oriental studies and efforts to translate arab literature into german . at the same time asfur was also self-critical .
he wrote that neither individual arab states nor the arab league nor the arab publishers ' association had ever set up initiatives to support the translation of arabic literature into other languages . but , this self-criticism comes late .
on the one hand arab intellectuals have been demanding for years to set up a fund for exactly that purpose .
on the other , uncertainty still surrounds a list with arab books that are meant to be translated into german and english on the occasion of the arab league 's guest performance at the frankfurt book fair . one thing is clear though : suspense and heated discussion are guaranteed this year at the frankfurt book fair . mona naggar -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.09.2004 trading shares in geniuses and heroes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii is the market leader for the nobel peace prize the work of the committee that selects nobel prize winners might be strictly confidential , but the university of frankfurt is betting that it can predict who the next winners will be using a virtual stock market . buy shares in bob dylan and kofi annan , or sell shares in helmut kohl .
it 's all possible at a new internet-based virtual stock market -lrb- vsm -rrb- aimed at predicting who will be among the next nobel prize winners .
the vsm is an economic experiment by the university of frankfurt , to see how well short- and medium-term market developments can be predicted .
the stocks in nobel candidates represent a bet on the outcome of future market situations - the higher the value of the stock , the more probable the market situation is .
the participants in the nobel vsm do n't have to concern themselves with economic models , however .
nor is any real money riding on this particular stock market .
but the most successful investors stand to win dividends in the form of 50 prizes , including an ibm laptop .
kohl stocks suffering internet users have to register to take part in the virtual market .
each participant then receives an initial cash deposit of $ 10,000 -lrb- € 12,300 -rrb- that can be used for buying and selling stocks .
just like a real market , the price of the stocks rises and falls according to supply and demand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl stock in former german chancellor helmut kohl -lrb- photo -rrb- as a candidate for the peace prize , for example , is going cheap , having dropped 16 percent from its initial offering price of $ 10 .
in contrast , demand for shares in top runner pope john paul ii has skyrocketed .
his stock is currently trading at over $ 70 .
trading at the nobel prize market wraps up at 6 p.m. the day before the winners are announced - that will happen on oct .
8 at the earliest .
once the nobel laureates are made known , the stocks are cashed out , with every share in a winner valued at $ 1,000 .
the participant with highest account balance wins the market .
reliable predictors frankfurt university 's project leader for the nobel prize market , bernd skiera , says vsm 's are increasingly establishing themselves as reliable predictors of future events .
their results are frequently just as good or better than comparable predictors such as polls , skiera said .
political stock markets , for example , are used to predict election results in countries such as the united states , germany , canada , the netherlands and austria .
slightly more macabre , perhaps , is the virtual terror stock market , terror xchange , where users buy or sell virtual shares of major international news events they think are likely to occur . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing tragedy in the soccer stadium how fast can a packed soccer stadium be evacuated ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 29.09.2004 how much damage has bush done ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 's going to make it ?
dw-world readers this week commented on the race for the white house and president bush 's negative foreign policy record abroad . your point of view is interesting , i lived in europe for eight years and appreciate your points of view ; it 's great to see that the billions of dollars we spent through the marshal plan has produced peaceful differences .
two things you overlook are : only us citizens vote , and the economy , not foreign policy will determine the outcome of the election .
we 've been through years and years of anti-americanism , so what else is new .
polls in other countries mean nothing .
the americans living overseas vote in their particular state so even though they may be 80 % democrats , scattered over 50 states i seriously doubt they will have the kind of impact you describe - frank shipp why does n't your rag of a newspaper conduct a poll of americans asking them what they think of germany and mr. schröder ?
you germans can take your smug , self-satisfied views and shove them .
how 's that for candor , heinz ?
if germans had any sense of decency at all , they would shut their mouths before dispensing any advice - let alone moral advice - to george bush or to america .
any " crimes " america has ever committed pale by comparison to what you animals did not once , but twice in the last century .
your leaders kaiser willie and hitler were personally responsible for at least thirty million deaths , and you have the balls to ask germans what they think about my president and my country ? - john huettner violence destroyed our world trade center but that can be rebuilt .
george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .
george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .
we ca n't take it anymore . - lucy cole , alamo , california most americans are oblivious to their reception abroad , and i blame the american media for much of this ignorance .
bush 's record at home is remarkably but undeservedly good . - jeffrey hamill i am an a citizen of the united states and love my country but detest its current " leadership . "
our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .
if iraq truly had nothing to hide , then why not comply ?
should we have waited another 10 years while saddam continued to torture his own people ?
how long is too long ?
george w. bush is the only leader in the world strong enough to draw the line in the sand and face these threats head-on .
it may be years before this is truly understood .
the un is a weak , spineless organization that failed miserably to stop saddam .
jacques chirac is also weak , and could never stand up to terrorists the way mr. bush has .
i 'd rather see us fight terrorists , alone if we have to , on the streets of baghdad instead of being attacked on the streets of boston or elsewhere .
i will proudly vote for president george w. bush on nov .
2nd .
and many here agree with me , and i would prepare for a second bush term now . - steve bush has been a complete disaster internationally and an embarrassment to those of us in the us who long for a return to diplomacy to solve problems .
this country is , i 'm afraid , moving into a very dangerous unilateralism on a wide range of subjects .
this includes our refusal to join the eu and others in the international criminal court and kyoto .
i hate to say it , but i fear we are resorting back to pre-wwii us autonomy , hegemony and unilateralism in our relations with the world .
i think this could be a semi-permanent condition and i do n't know that even electing kerry will solve it .
americans are , unfortunately turning increasingly inward and are not taking criticism and disagreement from other nations and organizations very well .
in fact , they increasingly appear to be fighting back and downright dismissive of allies and others who voice disagreement with our policies .
it appears that being the only military " super-power " in the world is going to our heads .
remember the adage , " absolute power corrupts , absolutely " ! !
it appears to be true ! - trevor steven taylor you need to understand that most americans know that the us is just about the only country in the world that can " go it alone . "
for that reason , we americans do n't care what the world thinks about us or our international policies .
the independent streak of the americans is actually increased when we hear that a large percentage of the germans and french disagrees with something the us is doing , no matter what it is .
as soon as the us does not require energy from foreign sources , we may just resign from the united nations .
according to the polls , that 's the goal of more than half the americans , and those are the ones who support george w. bush .
thank you . - james l. reid , usa i believe george w. bush has hindered the spread of peace throughout the world .
i believe he does not consider that others world-wide have a right to govern their own area and have a clearer view of the big picture .
i also believe he was not taught to " play nice with others " when he was a child .
he has the arrogant , smirk of a bully who was born into privilege and has never had to consider the other person 's rights or feelings . - karen seeger , usa the only opinion that counts will be the election results in november .
the eu public is generally misinformed by a biased media that spews constant anti-bush information .
the net result is an anti-bush eu public . - boyd lawrence , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .
seeing the effects of bush 's foreign policy firsthand should boost kerry with expatriate voters , says dw-world 's marc young .
-lrb- sept .
27 , 2004 -rrb- a kerry conundrum for schröder the overwhelming majority of germans say they 'd prefer john kerry as us president instead of george bush .
however , having kerry in the white house would n't necessarily make chancellor gerhard schröder 's life any easier .

the americans living overseas vote in their particular state so even though they may be 80 % democrats , scattered over 50 states i seriously doubt they will have the kind of impact you describe - frank shipp why does n't your rag of a newspaper conduct a poll of americans asking them what they think of germany and mr. schröder ?
you germans can take your smug , self-satisfied views and shove them .
how 's that for candor , heinz ?
if germans had any sense of decency at all , they would shut their mouths before dispensing any advice - let alone moral advice - to george bush or to america .
any " crimes " america has ever committed pale by comparison to what you animals did not once , but twice in the last century .
your leaders kaiser willie and hitler were personally responsible for at least thirty million deaths , and you have the balls to ask germans what they think about my president and my country ? - john huettner violence destroyed our world trade center but that can be rebuilt .
george bush destroyed our reputation , which takes years to rebuild .
george bush is a disgrace , and a blight on our country . - phil greene the bush record of not respecting supposed allies that act like ungrateful snivelers when america stands up for itself , is pretty much in accord with the attitude of the majority of americans .
it is in the interest of france and germany to limit as much as possible the power of the united states .
that is why the us rejection of kyoto , icc , abm and the un itself is met with such outrage in some eu capitols .
since europeans have accepted some loss of sovereignty that goes with eu , they expect americans to do likewise in joining globalist institutions which place limitations on theirs .
that is not a popular way of thinking here .
americans who live abroad may have been influenced by opinions obtaining there but back here voters could not care less what foreigners think . - jerald ronish i thank marc young and your newspaper for the opinion piece on bush and the damage done .
it is exactly accurate , and i plead with every expatriate voter to help us vote bush out .
his administration is a disaster for the united states and the world on every front - the war in iraq , the environment , the economy , human rights , and much more .
to top it off he blatantly misleads the public about his actions .
we ca n't take it anymore . - lucy cole , alamo , california most americans are oblivious to their reception abroad , and i blame the american media for much of this ignorance .
bush 's record at home is remarkably but undeservedly good . - jeffrey hamill i am an a citizen of the united states and love my country but detest its current " leadership . "
our president 's foreign policy has been a disaster .
i am ashamed of the arrogance and soullessness that brought the us to this point . - manya menapace i understand mr. bush is not popular overseas .
however , many people overseas were not in the us when it was brutally attacked on september 11th .
no one here wants to see that again .
fortunately , the smarter voters in this country understand that drastic steps are needed to defeat an enemy before they attack again on our soil .
i 'd much rather see a preemptive attack on terrorist-regimes like iran and north korea , than to sit around and wait for them to launch a surprise attack on us .
iraq was not a unilteral war .
in fact , 60 out of nearly 300 nations joined us in order to remove a dictator that was just as evil as hitler was .
saddam needed to be removed .
the united states , and the un for that matter , gave saddam nearly 10 years to comply with demands to give up its wmd program .
if iraq truly had nothing to hide , then why not comply ?
should we have waited another 10 years while saddam continued to torture his own people ?
how long is too long ?
george w. bush is the only leader in the world strong enough to draw the line in the sand and face these threats head-on .
it may be years before this is truly understood .
the un is a weak , spineless organization that failed miserably to stop saddam .
jacques chirac is also weak , and could never stand up to terrorists the way mr. bush has .
i 'd rather see us fight terrorists , alone if we have to , on the streets of baghdad instead of being attacked on the streets of boston or elsewhere .
i will proudly vote for president george w. bush on nov .
2nd .
and many here agree with me , and i would prepare for a second bush term now . - steve bush has been a complete disaster internationally and an embarrassment to those of us in the us who long for a return to diplomacy to solve problems .
this country is , i 'm afraid , moving into a very dangerous unilateralism on a wide range of subjects .
this includes our refusal to join the eu and others in the international criminal court and kyoto .
i hate to say it , but i fear we are resorting back to pre-wwii us autonomy , hegemony and unilateralism in our relations with the world .
i think this could be a semi-permanent condition and i do n't know that even electing kerry will solve it .
americans are , unfortunately turning increasingly inward and are not taking criticism and disagreement from other nations and organizations very well .
in fact , they increasingly appear to be fighting back and downright dismissive of allies and others who voice disagreement with our policies .
it appears that being the only military " super-power " in the world is going to our heads .
remember the adage , " absolute power corrupts , absolutely " ! !
it appears to be true ! - trevor steven taylor you need to understand that most americans know that the us is just about the only country in the world that can " go it alone . "
for that reason , we americans do n't care what the world thinks about us or our international policies .
the independent streak of the americans is actually increased when we hear that a large percentage of the germans and french disagrees with something the us is doing , no matter what it is .
as soon as the us does not require energy from foreign sources , we may just resign from the united nations .
according to the polls , that 's the goal of more than half the americans , and those are the ones who support george w. bush .
thank you . - james l. reid , usa i believe george w. bush has hindered the spread of peace throughout the world .
i believe he does not consider that others world-wide have a right to govern their own area and have a clearer view of the big picture .
i also believe he was not taught to " play nice with others " when he was a child .
he has the arrogant , smirk of a bully who was born into privilege and has never had to consider the other person 's rights or feelings . - karen seeger , usa the only opinion that counts will be the election results in november .
the eu public is generally misinformed by a biased media that spews constant anti-bush information .
the net result is an anti-bush eu public . - boyd lawrence , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : bush and the damage done the millions of americans living abroad may decide this year 's tight us presidential election .
seeing the effects of bush 's foreign policy firsthand should boost kerry with expatriate voters , says dw-world 's marc young .

while pawprints are n't required for identification , photos are optional . previously , animal owners were expected to carry their pet 's immunization record when they travelled .

while the old id measures will be accepted during the transition phase , after 2011 , all animals will need to have a microchip the size of a grain of rice injected which contains a machine-readable number to identify the animal . " total nonsense , " scoffed professor hans-joachim hackbarth of the veterinary school in hanover upon hearing of the new regulations .
he said he ca n't remember the last time he was required to show his own passport when crossing an eu border .
the effort pet owners have to make for their animals to meet eu standards is in no relation to the usefulness of the information , hackbarth said . home is best germany 's national association of veterinarians showed understanding for the eu 's desire to unify pet identification procedures .
after all , countries such as ireland , britain and sweden are rabies-free , and would like to stay that way . but the german society for the protection of animals says the best advice for pet owners is to leave their furry friends at home when they travel . and so that owners do n't have to resort to kennels , they 've even set up a hotline for pet " foster families .

they say putin is using the fight against terror to clamp down on democracy . the protest letter , delivered to us president george w. bush , as well as other government leaders in nato and the european union , accuses putin of turning back to authoritarian rule .
its 115 signatories include prominent politicians such as former czech president vaclav havel , former swedish prime minister carl bildt , and us senators john mccain and joseph r. biden . the most prominent german politicians to sign the letter are green party chief reinhard bütikofer , and the foreign policy expert of the christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , friedbert pflüger .

he also introduced a draft resolution that would create a new blacklist of terrorist suspects subject to extradition .
both plans have raised concern in the west . putin faces little opposition in the russian parliament , as his united russia party holds more than two-thirds of the seats .
criticism of putin in the russian media is rare , as most independent media organizations have been shut down under his rule . breaking the silence until now , western leaders have been reserved in their criticism , with barely a word being uttered by the eu or the us government to protest human rights violations in chechnya . germany has taken pains to cultivate close ties with russia .
on his last visit there , schröder emphasized the friendly nature of his relationship with putin .
the two leaders presented a united front on the most important questions , including putin 's controversial handling of the chechnya conflict . russia 's un ambassador , andrey denisov , said he took the criticism in the letter seriously , but added that it was important that there be enough " flexibility " in russia 's democracy to allow it to fight terrorism .

labor leader mark latham said the plan , which would cost a $ 2.9bn -lrb- $ 2.1bn -rrb- , would help build a " stronger , safer and fairer " australia .
mr latham , 43 , kept family issues at the centre of labor 's campaign .

mr latham launched labor 's campaign at a rally in brisbane , where he was warmly applauded by party activists .

he also promised extra money for pensioners and a a $ 20-a-week allowance for elderly australians who look after their grandchildren .

" i say to the australian people , ' i 'm ready to lead , he 's ready to leave ' , " mr latham said .
mr latham said australia needed an urgent change of government .
" unless we change now , it will be too late for the basic decency and honesty of government in this country , " he said .
" too late to restore truth in government and end the deceit and buck-passing of the howard years , " he said .
mr latham has said previously that if elected he would withdraw most of the 850 australian troops serving in and around iraq .

" this is where labor will dedicate our resources in the war against terror - to our region , to our part of the world , to the real security of the australian people , " he said .

the move came after the body , which investigates money made from criminal activities , was granted in a series of orders by the high court .
a range of properties and other assets believed to belong to a gang were impounded while an investigation is undertaken to establish if they can be seized .
the court heard the assets were the proceeds of criminal activity , " including the robbery and distraction burglary of elderly people living in isolated homes in country areas across northern ireland " .
we put all that material to the court and say to the court we think we have a good , arguable case here - will you appoint a receiver to investigate ?
alan mcquillan assets recovery agency an interim receiving order was granted at the high court on tuesday after the agency searched premises in lisburn , dromore and carryduff .
a quantity of documents and other evidence was seized at the premises .
the asa said the interim receiver took possession of : one house in lisburn ; two houses in carryduff ; a house in the ormeau road area of belfast ; an apartment in newcastle , county down ; a house in dromore , county down .
the figure of £ 300,000 is based on the estimated equity in the properties .
if the houses were to be sold , any mortgages would have to be paid off before the profits could be seized .
other property believed to be in the possession of certain named individuals - including a 1984 bentley model 8 , a 1996 mercedes and a range rover - is retained in the interim receiving order .
the interim receiver has begun an investigation into all of the assets .
the ara will decide whether to make an application for the assets to be forfeited , after he makes a report to the high court .
' suspicious circumstances ' ara assistant director alan mcquillan said buying property was one of the ways in which criminals " washed money " .
" they invest in property , but they mortgage it , " he said .
" we also try to be as conservative as we can in valuations , so £ 300,000 net is the amount we believe they have - the properties themselves are probably worth certainly well over £ 500,000 collectively . "
he said the case to the high court was made on the basis of previous convictions , arrests in suspicious circumstances and evidence of assets .
people were able to amass personal fortunes while living on benefits , he said .
" we put all that material to the court and say to the court ' we think we have a good , arguable case here - will you appoint a receiver to investigate ? " '
security minister ian pearson said the move proved the assets recovery agency was an effective weapon in the ongoing fight against organised criminals in northern ireland .
" i am particularly delighted that the assets frozen were from those who allegedly attempt to prosper by preying on some of the most vulnerable people in our community , " he said .

the court heard the assets were the proceeds of criminal activity , " including the robbery and distraction burglary of elderly people living in isolated homes in country areas across northern ireland " .
we put all that material to the court and say to the court we think we have a good , arguable case here - will you appoint a receiver to investigate ?
alan mcquillan assets recovery agency an interim receiving order was granted at the high court on tuesday after the agency searched premises in lisburn , dromore and carryduff .
a quantity of documents and other evidence was seized at the premises .
the asa said the interim receiver took possession of : one house in lisburn ; two houses in carryduff ; a house in the ormeau road area of belfast ; an apartment in newcastle , county down ; a house in dromore , county down .
the figure of £ 300,000 is based on the estimated equity in the properties .
if the houses were to be sold , any mortgages would have to be paid off before the profits could be seized .
other property believed to be in the possession of certain named individuals - including a 1984 bentley model 8 , a 1996 mercedes and a range rover - is retained in the interim receiving order .
the interim receiver has begun an investigation into all of the assets .
the ara will decide whether to make an application for the assets to be forfeited , after he makes a report to the high court .
' suspicious circumstances ' ara assistant director alan mcquillan said buying property was one of the ways in which criminals " washed money " .
" they invest in property , but they mortgage it , " he said .
" we also try to be as conservative as we can in valuations , so £ 300,000 net is the amount we believe they have - the properties themselves are probably worth certainly well over £ 500,000 collectively . "
he said the case to the high court was made on the basis of previous convictions , arrests in suspicious circumstances and evidence of assets .
people were able to amass personal fortunes while living on benefits , he said .
" we put all that material to the court and say to the court ' we think we have a good , arguable case here - will you appoint a receiver to investigate ? " '
security minister ian pearson said the move proved the assets recovery agency was an effective weapon in the ongoing fight against organised criminals in northern ireland .
" i am particularly delighted that the assets frozen were from those who allegedly attempt to prosper by preying on some of the most vulnerable people in our community , " he said .

we put all that material to the court and say to the court we think we have a good , arguable case here - will you appoint a receiver to investigate ?
alan mcquillan assets recovery agency an interim receiving order was granted at the high court on tuesday after the agency searched premises in lisburn , dromore and carryduff .
a quantity of documents and other evidence was seized at the premises .
the asa said the interim receiver took possession of : one house in lisburn ; two houses in carryduff ; a house in the ormeau road area of belfast ; an apartment in newcastle , county down ; a house in dromore , county down .
the figure of £ 300,000 is based on the estimated equity in the properties .
if the houses were to be sold , any mortgages would have to be paid off before the profits could be seized .
other property believed to be in the possession of certain named individuals - including a 1984 bentley model 8 , a 1996 mercedes and a range rover - is retained in the interim receiving order .
the interim receiver has begun an investigation into all of the assets .
the ara will decide whether to make an application for the assets to be forfeited , after he makes a report to the high court .
' suspicious circumstances ' ara assistant director alan mcquillan said buying property was one of the ways in which criminals " washed money " .
" they invest in property , but they mortgage it , " he said .
" we also try to be as conservative as we can in valuations , so £ 300,000 net is the amount we believe they have - the properties themselves are probably worth certainly well over £ 500,000 collectively . "
he said the case to the high court was made on the basis of previous convictions , arrests in suspicious circumstances and evidence of assets .
people were able to amass personal fortunes while living on benefits , he said .
" we put all that material to the court and say to the court ' we think we have a good , arguable case here - will you appoint a receiver to investigate ? " '
security minister ian pearson said the move proved the assets recovery agency was an effective weapon in the ongoing fight against organised criminals in northern ireland .
" i am particularly delighted that the assets frozen were from those who allegedly attempt to prosper by preying on some of the most vulnerable people in our community , " he said .

insured losses could reach $ 21.7bn -lrb- £ 12bn -rrb- , according to the insurance information institute , breaking the record set by hurricane andrew in 1992 .
the insurance industry had to pay out $ 15.5bn , or $ 20bn in current values , to repair the damage caused by andrew .
the caribbean and southern us have been hit by four storms since mid-august .
the most recent , hurricane jeanne , killed six people and left up to two million without electricity when it swept through florida at the weekend .
quadruple whammy between them , the four hurricanes have killed dozens and forced millions more to evacuate their homes across the caribbean and three southern us states over the last six weeks .
while none of them has been as severe as hurricane andrew , their arrival in quick succession has inflicted heavy cumulative damage across the region .
meteorologists say the 2004 hurricane season has been among the most destructive of the past 100 years .
the cost of repairing the damage caused by andrew triggered the bankruptcy of 12 home insurance companies in the us .
it also pushed many of the syndicates that make up the lloyd 's of london insurance market close to financial collapse .
the insurance industry has since reduced its exposure to hurricane damage , with government-backed bodies increasingly underwriting losses in the most vulnerable regions .
analysts say that a repeat of the financial crisis that hit the industry in the wake of hurricane andrew is unlikely .

but that 's hardly surprising because , whatever your political persuasion , the whole leader 's speech experience is scientifically choreographed to generate a sense of anticipation .
the hall is packed .
there is an expectant hum in the air .
uplifting music is pumping out .
pink 's coming up , the levellers ' beautiful day - -lrb- containing the immortal line " wealth redistribution becomes the new solution " - are they trying to tell us something ? -rrb- .
the atmosphere is somewhere between a wedding , with people making polite small talk and standing up to let other people shuffle to their seats , and a heavyweight boxing promotion .
14.22 the undercard -lrb- to use a boxing term -rrb- starts to file in , one by one .
cherie blair walks through the crowd from a side entrance , to warm applause , and takes up her seat at the front , where she gossips with pauline prescott .
a group of party worthies have been parked in chairs on the main platform , behind mr blair 's lectern , leaving the leader 's podium in a forward position -lrb- it 's all about symbolism -rrb- surrounded by the faithful .
14.24 neil kinnock enters to a round of applause , followed a moment or two later by wife glenys .
there is a moment of confusion as the kinnocks take up seats reserved for the cabinet and are led to seats in the body of the hall .
another round of applause .
they are followed a few minutes later by john prescott .
14.29 finally , the chairwoman introduces " our leader , and the prime minister tony blair " .
the crowd go wild .
14.34 tony blair enters the hall .
for the past few minutes the crowd has been treated to a dazzling electronic roll call of labour 's supposed achievements in office -lrb- " better gp surgeries ! " , " broadband for all rural communities ! " -rrb- to the sound of fatboy slim 's right here , right now .
14.35 having made it to the stage , after a very boxing-promotion-style walk through the crowd , sugar ray blair takes a moment to soak up the acclaim .
14.36 he begins his speech .
14.37 first joke -lrb- a one he has used before about this being his hardest week , until his next one -rrb- .
14.37.5 first ripple of applause -lrb- at the mention of veteran trade unionist rodney bickerstaffe -rrb- .
14.38 first protester is ejected from the hall .
what turns out later to be an anti-war demonstrator is bundled out of the hall by fluorescent-bibbed security guards and burly special branch types .
the shaven-headed protester is shouting something about mr blair and " blood on your hands " .
you are lucky to be living in a democracy , a grinning mr blair tells him .
14.38 first mention of labour 's " historic third term " .
14.42 first , somewhat muffled , whoop from the audience , as mr blair mentions london mayor ken livingstone -lrb- " red ken frightened people , even those as brave as your own leader " -rrb- 14.46 gushing tributes to john and gordon -lrb- " a personal friend for 20 years " and " the best chancellor this country has ever had " -rrb- 14.53 protest number two .
a sudden burst of shouting and a group of about half a dozen people get up to leave -lrb- a very british protest -rrb- .
one very angry man in a suit - who must have been queuing very early this morning to get that seat - is pointing at mr blair and shouting something .
mr blair is initially knocked off his stride , but quickly adopts his best " is everything alright here , officer ? " smirk , as the protesters are manhandled out of the hall .
" if there are any more of you , do you mind standing up now , " he says , attempting to regain his composure .
14.55 mr blair 's attempts to carry on are undermined by what sounds like a distant car alarm .
for a moment we could be on one of those problem estates mr blair is always visiting to talk about " anti-social behaviour " .
but rather than doing the rhetorical equivalent of sticking his head out of the bedroom window in his string vest to yell at it to shut up , mr blair manfully ploughs on with the speech .
for a few seconds anyway .
" i want the sort of britain . in which that does n't go off all the time , " he says attempting a smile .
it later turns out that the protesters have cunningly left an alarm in the hall , to carry on their work after they have been ejected into the car park .
as security guards flap about at the back of the hall frantically trying to find - and then silence - the device , mr blair is forced to ad lib .
" if i was n't so technologically challenged , i could tell you what it is that 's doing it " .
but his patience has been sorely tried .
you can tell .
15.01 a sun newspaper moment .
mr blair has " ten things " that labour would do in a third term -lrb- as opposed to 10 things you did n't know about jordan 's boobs , or whatever -rrb- .
15.13 a strange hush descends , as mr blair mentions iraq for the first time .
will he apologise ? 15.18 a visibly relieved mr blair takes a sip of water , as he reaches the end of his mea nearly culpa on the war .
15.23 the bridge between europe and the us .
now he is starting to hit his stride .
we start to see some of the old blair passion .
15.25 he has changed - not as a man , a family man , but as a leader , he says .
he has learned to stand by his decisions .
conference not sure about this .
limp applause .
15.30 at last .
mr blair jettisons his verbs !
his sentences shrink !
but just as he is about to go into a stratosphere of " young britain. new britain " , the speech ends , with an exhortation to get on with the job of winning a third term .
15.33 after soaking up the party faithful acclaim for a few minutes , and beckoning cherie - and john and pauline prescott -lrb- wot no gordon ? -rrb- - on to the platform to join him , he starts to leave the hall .
15.34 blair moves slowly out of the hall to the strains of steve winwood 's valerie .
ca n't help thinking winwood had a bigger hit with " higher love " , but as the ovation subsides to a something only slightly quicker than a slow handclap , before dying away altogether , not sure this would be appropriate .

but that 's hardly surprising because , whatever your political persuasion , the whole leader 's speech experience is scientifically choreographed to generate a sense of anticipation .
the hall is packed .
there is an expectant hum in the air .
uplifting music is pumping out .
pink 's coming up , the levellers ' beautiful day - -lrb- containing the immortal line " wealth redistribution becomes the new solution " - are they trying to tell us something ? -rrb- .
the atmosphere is somewhere between a wedding , with people making polite small talk and standing up to let other people shuffle to their seats , and a heavyweight boxing promotion .
14.22 the undercard -lrb- to use a boxing term -rrb- starts to file in , one by one .
cherie blair walks through the crowd from a side entrance , to warm applause , and takes up her seat at the front , where she gossips with pauline prescott .
a group of party worthies have been parked in chairs on the main platform , behind mr blair 's lectern , leaving the leader 's podium in a forward position -lrb- it 's all about symbolism -rrb- surrounded by the faithful .
14.24 neil kinnock enters to a round of applause , followed a moment or two later by wife glenys .
there is a moment of confusion as the kinnocks take up seats reserved for the cabinet and are led to seats in the body of the hall .
another round of applause .
they are followed a few minutes later by john prescott .
14.29 finally , the chairwoman introduces " our leader , and the prime minister tony blair " .
the crowd go wild .
14.34 tony blair enters the hall .
for the past few minutes the crowd has been treated to a dazzling electronic roll call of labour 's supposed achievements in office -lrb- " better gp surgeries ! " , " broadband for all rural communities ! " -rrb- to the sound of fatboy slim 's right here , right now .
14.35 having made it to the stage , after a very boxing-promotion-style walk through the crowd , sugar ray blair takes a moment to soak up the acclaim .
14.36 he begins his speech .
14.37 first joke -lrb- a one he has used before about this being his hardest week , until his next one -rrb- .
14.37.5 first ripple of applause -lrb- at the mention of veteran trade unionist rodney bickerstaffe -rrb- .
14.38 first protester is ejected from the hall .
what turns out later to be an anti-war demonstrator is bundled out of the hall by fluorescent-bibbed security guards and burly special branch types .
the shaven-headed protester is shouting something about mr blair and " blood on your hands " .
you are lucky to be living in a democracy , a grinning mr blair tells him .
14.38 first mention of labour 's " historic third term " .
14.42 first , somewhat muffled , whoop from the audience , as mr blair mentions london mayor ken livingstone -lrb- " red ken frightened people , even those as brave as your own leader " -rrb- 14.46 gushing tributes to john and gordon -lrb- " a personal friend for 20 years " and " the best chancellor this country has ever had " -rrb- 14.53 protest number two .
a sudden burst of shouting and a group of about half a dozen people get up to leave -lrb- a very british protest -rrb- .
one very angry man in a suit - who must have been queuing very early this morning to get that seat - is pointing at mr blair and shouting something .
mr blair is initially knocked off his stride , but quickly adopts his best " is everything alright here , officer ? " smirk , as the protesters are manhandled out of the hall .
" if there are any more of you , do you mind standing up now , " he says , attempting to regain his composure .
14.55 mr blair 's attempts to carry on are undermined by what sounds like a distant car alarm .
for a moment we could be on one of those problem estates mr blair is always visiting to talk about " anti-social behaviour " .
but rather than doing the rhetorical equivalent of sticking his head out of the bedroom window in his string vest to yell at it to shut up , mr blair manfully ploughs on with the speech .
for a few seconds anyway .
" i want the sort of britain . in which that does n't go off all the time , " he says attempting a smile .
it later turns out that the protesters have cunningly left an alarm in the hall , to carry on their work after they have been ejected into the car park .
as security guards flap about at the back of the hall frantically trying to find - and then silence - the device , mr blair is forced to ad lib .
" if i was n't so technologically challenged , i could tell you what it is that 's doing it " .
but his patience has been sorely tried .
you can tell .
15.01 a sun newspaper moment .
mr blair has " ten things " that labour would do in a third term -lrb- as opposed to 10 things you did n't know about jordan 's boobs , or whatever -rrb- .
15.13 a strange hush descends , as mr blair mentions iraq for the first time .
will he apologise ? 15.18 a visibly relieved mr blair takes a sip of water , as he reaches the end of his mea nearly culpa on the war .
15.23 the bridge between europe and the us .
now he is starting to hit his stride .
we start to see some of the old blair passion .
15.25 he has changed - not as a man , a family man , but as a leader , he says .
he has learned to stand by his decisions .
conference not sure about this .
limp applause .
15.30 at last .
mr blair jettisons his verbs !
his sentences shrink !
but just as he is about to go into a stratosphere of " young britain. new britain " , the speech ends , with an exhortation to get on with the job of winning a third term .
15.33 after soaking up the party faithful acclaim for a few minutes , and beckoning cherie - and john and pauline prescott -lrb- wot no gordon ? -rrb- - on to the platform to join him , he starts to leave the hall .
15.34 blair moves slowly out of the hall to the strains of steve winwood 's valerie .
ca n't help thinking winwood had a bigger hit with " higher love " , but as the ovation subsides to a something only slightly quicker than a slow handclap , before dying away altogether , not sure this would be appropriate .

the inquest into the deaths of andrew hutin , stephen galsworthy and len radford has been postponed until the new year .
the inquest had been due to be held earlier this month .
the coroner 's office said it has had difficulty finding a suitable building to accommodate all the people expected .
in november , it will be exactly three years since the plant 's blast furnace number five exploded , killing three men and injuring twelve others .
andrew hutin , 20 , was the youngest person killed in the blast , which is now thought likely to have been caused by water coming into contact with hot material in the furnace .
corus has admitted civil liability , but a joint health and safety executive and police investigation will decide if the company or any individuals are to face criminal charges .
they must wait for the inquest to be held before deciding how to proceed .
mr hutin 's father , mike , told bbc wales that the wait for answers is increasing the family 's pain .
he said : " when we were told that the inquest was going to be held on september 17 , it was a date to aim for .
" now we 're in limbo again and we 're just looking now at possibly mid january , and hoping that that 's going to be a date when the inquest starts .
" and that we 're not going to be knocked back again . "
the furnace is being completely rebuilt at a cost of £ 75m .
the work is due to be finished by march 2005 .
