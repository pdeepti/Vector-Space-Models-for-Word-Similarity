calls by politicians and aid organizations for germans to donate the money they 'd otherwise spend on fireworks to the tsunami victims has worried the companies that rely on new year 's revenue for their survival . new year 's eve in germany is traditionally a noisy affair .
not content to leave the fireworks displays to the organizers of large parties , ordinary germans spend a lot of money - € 97 million -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- last year alone - on rockets , firecrackers , and sparklers . but this year , german politicians have been urging people to have a quieter celebration without the assorted noisemakers , and to spend the money instead on donations for the tsunami victims instead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims at a relief camp in port blair in india 's southeastern andaman and nicobar islands .
that 's upset the 3,000 people employed in germany 's fireworks industry , which rakes in the bulk of its annual turnover in the last three days of each year . " it 's going to be very difficult for us now to match the € 97 million in sales we had last year , " said klaus gotzen who heads the business association for the german pyrotechnics industry . while gotzen said there was no question that donations to help victims in the tsunami-stricken region were necessary , he objected to the name the german aid organization agro action gave its fundraising campaign : " rice , not fireworks . " " i think it 's unfair that the call for donations has focused exclusively on our industry , " gotzen said .
" it would have made more sense to leave it up to people to decide for themselves what they 'd rather go without . " call already having effect germans have already started to take agro action 's message to heart .
on thursday , retailers reported less demand for fireworks than in previous years .
a department store employee in frankfurt estimated a 20 percent drop in sales .
and a newspaper in kiel reported how one shop was even prepared to give customers refunds for fireworks they 'd already paid for . but some of the germany 's hobby pyrotechnicians are n't prepared to give up their fun on the loudest night of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators watch fireworks in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin , germany , during the new year celebrations on thursday , jan .
1 , 2004 .
" there 's no way i 'm going to give up my fireworks , " said one young man stocking up on rocket-like devices near leipzig .
" a proper fireworks display is part of new year 's eve , " another shopper said .
" i wo n't go without . " for other germans , it 's not a question of one or the other .
a father in kiel , out shopping with his children , said he 'd still spend around € 10 on fireworks , but that the family would also make a charitable donation , as it does every year . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami death toll could reach 150,000 the indonesian health ministry says at least 79,940 have died as a result of the tsunami tidal waves that struck the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.12.2004 calls grow to tax airlines for pollution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : planes pollute more than trains , but pay less environmental tax in germany , airlines enjoy generous government tax breaks while rail companies pay environmental and fuel taxes , even though they pollute less .
the paradox has environmentalists and rail officials upset . germany 's large environmental organizations as well as deutsche bahn , the country 's national rail operator , are demanding the rail network get the same treatment airlines do . the country 's airlines are currently not subject to any environmental and fuel tax and in the case of flights abroad , no value-added tax either .
deutsche bahn , on the other hand , is required by law to pay all three .
it then passes the costs on to passengers . deutsche bahn complains that the tax imbalance distorts competition , and environmentalists say the tax breaks for airlines amount to subsidizing a mode of transport that releases large amounts of pollutants . airlines - worst climate polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning of jet-engine fuel results in environmentally damaging emissions that predominantly consist of vapor , carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides . the effects of these substances are three times more pronounced at a higher altitude than they are on the ground , a fact that environmentalists say further exacerbates the " greenhouse effect , " wherein the trapped gases prevent heat being released from earth 's atmosphere and heat up the planet . gerhard timm , head of the german environmental organization bund -lrb- the association for environment and nature protection -rrb- , said that the international panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- had already concluded that co2 emissions released high up in the air were up to eight times more harmful than when released near the ground . culprit : discount airlines " the other problem is that air traffic in europe is one of the fastest growing in the world and increasing in the double digits every year , " timm said . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that aviation already causes four percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 .
according to the oecd , the impact of air traffic on global climate warming in 2030 will be more than three times higher than in 1990 .
the german environment ministry expects a threefold jump in co2 emissions by german airplanes by 2030 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers step off of a ryanair flight at brussels the environment lobby has already identified the main culprit responsible for the alarming rise in greenhouse gases : discount airlines . air travel has increased five fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the exploding popularity of budget airlines .

calls by politicians and aid organizations for germans to donate the money they 'd otherwise spend on fireworks to the tsunami victims has worried the companies that rely on new year 's revenue for their survival . new year 's eve in germany is traditionally a noisy affair .
not content to leave the fireworks displays to the organizers of large parties , ordinary germans spend a lot of money - € 97 million -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- last year alone - on rockets , firecrackers , and sparklers . but this year , german politicians have been urging people to have a quieter celebration without the assorted noisemakers , and to spend the money instead on donations for the tsunami victims instead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims at a relief camp in port blair in india 's southeastern andaman and nicobar islands .
that 's upset the 3,000 people employed in germany 's fireworks industry , which rakes in the bulk of its annual turnover in the last three days of each year . " it 's going to be very difficult for us now to match the € 97 million in sales we had last year , " said klaus gotzen who heads the business association for the german pyrotechnics industry . while gotzen said there was no question that donations to help victims in the tsunami-stricken region were necessary , he objected to the name the german aid organization agro action gave its fundraising campaign : " rice , not fireworks . " " i think it 's unfair that the call for donations has focused exclusively on our industry , " gotzen said .
" it would have made more sense to leave it up to people to decide for themselves what they 'd rather go without . " call already having effect germans have already started to take agro action 's message to heart .

a department store employee in frankfurt estimated a 20 percent drop in sales .

in an interview with the neue osnabrücker zeitung , thierse said that while there was no question managers should be properly compensated , " there are limits where i would say , this is morally unacceptable , verging on the obscene . "
he added that it was necessary to create more transparency when it comes to salaries in germany , and that if it did n't happen voluntarily , the government would think about introducing new regulations .
management salaries were a big topic over the past year , with top earners in several sectors succumbing to the pressure to take pay cuts in solidarity with staff facing wage reductions and other drastic savings measures .
thierse pointed out that , 30 years ago , the ratio of manager salaries to the average income was 30:1 , while now , the ratio is 240:1 . dw-world.de salary secrecy haunts german business leaders most companies listed on the german stock index violate germany 's corporate governance codex because they have a mutual agreement not to reveal salaries for top executives , according to the man who wrote the codex .

" germany , through the european union , will push the united nations and the world bank to help these countries in an efficient and unbureaucratic way .
for me , that includes reducing the debts of these countries , " he said .
" i want there to be lasting aid for the region .
i want us to feel a responsibility over a long period . " schröder has already proposed a moratorium on debt owed by indonesia and somalia , but his new appeal now includes other affected countries . french president jacques chirac on thursday told his government to push the paris club of creditor nations to put a moratorium on debt payments owed by some of the 11 asian countries which were hit by the disaster . canada has already done so , with canadian foreign minister pierre pettigrew saying the moratorium would help the battered asian nations dealwith both the immediate crisis and their long-term rebuilding efforts . a spokesman for the us agency for international development had said wednesday that washington was " open to all kinds of ideas " on debt reduction . bilateral partnerships in his speech dedicated almost entirely to the flood catastrophe , schröder also called for stronger bilateral partnerships between industrial nations and the nations hit by the tsunamis . bildunterschrift : in these photos released thursday , the shoreline of banda aceh in indonesia , is shown on june 23 , 2004 , above , and dec .
28 , 2004 , below , after the tsunami attack . " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation .
also germany .
our states for corresponding areas there .
our cities for their cities and our villages for their villages , " schröder said in the speech . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there .
this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long-term . " schröder , calling the tsunami disaster the " worst natural catastrophe in human memory " , said he would present the plan to other members of the european union . reforms to continue the chancellor touched only briefly on matters of domestic policy , painting an optimistic picture for 2005 . " our reform course will continue decisively in the year ahead , " schröder said , adding that the reforms already passed in 2004 will " keep germany on the road to success .

calls by politicians and aid organizations for germans to donate the money they 'd otherwise spend on fireworks to the tsunami victims has worried the companies that rely on new year 's revenue for their survival . new year 's eve in germany is traditionally a noisy affair .
not content to leave the fireworks displays to the organizers of large parties , ordinary germans spend a lot of money - € 97 million -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- last year alone - on rockets , firecrackers , and sparklers . but this year , german politicians have been urging people to have a quieter celebration without the assorted noisemakers , and to spend the money instead on donations for the tsunami victims instead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims at a relief camp in port blair in india 's southeastern andaman and nicobar islands .
that 's upset the 3,000 people employed in germany 's fireworks industry , which rakes in the bulk of its annual turnover in the last three days of each year . " it 's going to be very difficult for us now to match the € 97 million in sales we had last year , " said klaus gotzen who heads the business association for the german pyrotechnics industry . while gotzen said there was no question that donations to help victims in the tsunami-stricken region were necessary , he objected to the name the german aid organization agro action gave its fundraising campaign : " rice , not fireworks . " " i think it 's unfair that the call for donations has focused exclusively on our industry , " gotzen said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.12.2004 calls grow to tax airlines for pollution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : planes pollute more than trains , but pay less environmental tax in germany , airlines enjoy generous government tax breaks while rail companies pay environmental and fuel taxes , even though they pollute less .
the paradox has environmentalists and rail officials upset . germany 's large environmental organizations as well as deutsche bahn , the country 's national rail operator , are demanding the rail network get the same treatment airlines do . the country 's airlines are currently not subject to any environmental and fuel tax and in the case of flights abroad , no value-added tax either .
deutsche bahn , on the other hand , is required by law to pay all three .
it then passes the costs on to passengers . deutsche bahn complains that the tax imbalance distorts competition , and environmentalists say the tax breaks for airlines amount to subsidizing a mode of transport that releases large amounts of pollutants . airlines - worst climate polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning of jet-engine fuel results in environmentally damaging emissions that predominantly consist of vapor , carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides . the effects of these substances are three times more pronounced at a higher altitude than they are on the ground , a fact that environmentalists say further exacerbates the " greenhouse effect , " wherein the trapped gases prevent heat being released from earth 's atmosphere and heat up the planet . gerhard timm , head of the german environmental organization bund -lrb- the association for environment and nature protection -rrb- , said that the international panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- had already concluded that co2 emissions released high up in the air were up to eight times more harmful than when released near the ground . culprit : discount airlines " the other problem is that air traffic in europe is one of the fastest growing in the world and increasing in the double digits every year , " timm said . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that aviation already causes four percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 .
according to the oecd , the impact of air traffic on global climate warming in 2030 will be more than three times higher than in 1990 .
the german environment ministry expects a threefold jump in co2 emissions by german airplanes by 2030 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers step off of a ryanair flight at brussels the environment lobby has already identified the main culprit responsible for the alarming rise in greenhouse gases : discount airlines . air travel has increased five fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the exploding popularity of budget airlines .
germany 's green lobby has little doubt that the no-frills travel boom is the country 's number one climate killer . eu moves to check imbalance in the face of such violations , environmentalists and deutsche bahn representatives are pushing for environmental taxes to be imposed on airlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they point out that that a rail journey is about a tenth as damaging to the environment as a airplane flight .
bund has calculated that the three tax breaks enjoyed by airlines costs the german finance ministry more than € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.8 billion -rrb- a year . the european union has attempted to correct the imbalance .
since the beginning of 2004 , a new eu energy tax directive explicitly mentions imposing a fuel tax on domestic flights as well as on planes operating within eu air space provided the participating eu member states reach agreement on it . but , unanimous agreement on the directive is still forthcoming .
" the eu regulation actually makes it possible for us in germany to make a unilateral move towards such a fuel tax on airlines , " timm said .
" the greens , the junior coalition partner in the governing coalition are in favor of it , but the bigger partner still has doubts , " he added , referring to the social democrats . pay back taxes or punish airlines bund has now kicked off a nationwide campaign together with deutsche bahn to demand a fuel tax on domestic air traffic . the initiative asks rail passengers in germany to lodge protests against airlines at large railway stations in the country as well as on the internet .
passengers can also calculate for themselves the tax breaks enjoyed by the airlines on a special form which can be downloaded from the internet and demand that the finance minister pay back the environmental tax charged on their tickets .
" that 's totally acceptable : passengers just have to say that they traveled by rail for so many kilometers and would like to have the taxes paid back , " said timm .
" or the other alternative in this campaign is that a similar tax should also be imposed on jet fuel . " marina joarder -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jetting around more responsibly budget airlines have made it easier for people to take to the skies , but on the downside frequent air travel pollutes the environment .

the paradox has environmentalists and rail officials upset . germany 's large environmental organizations as well as deutsche bahn , the country 's national rail operator , are demanding the rail network get the same treatment airlines do . the country 's airlines are currently not subject to any environmental and fuel tax and in the case of flights abroad , no value-added tax either .
deutsche bahn , on the other hand , is required by law to pay all three .

since the beginning of 2004 , a new eu energy tax directive explicitly mentions imposing a fuel tax on domestic flights as well as on planes operating within eu air space provided the participating eu member states reach agreement on it . but , unanimous agreement on the directive is still forthcoming .

calls by politicians and aid organizations for germans to donate the money they 'd otherwise spend on fireworks to the tsunami victims has worried the companies that rely on new year 's revenue for their survival . new year 's eve in germany is traditionally a noisy affair .
not content to leave the fireworks displays to the organizers of large parties , ordinary germans spend a lot of money - € 97 million -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- last year alone - on rockets , firecrackers , and sparklers . but this year , german politicians have been urging people to have a quieter celebration without the assorted noisemakers , and to spend the money instead on donations for the tsunami victims instead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims at a relief camp in port blair in india 's southeastern andaman and nicobar islands .
that 's upset the 3,000 people employed in germany 's fireworks industry , which rakes in the bulk of its annual turnover in the last three days of each year . " it 's going to be very difficult for us now to match the € 97 million in sales we had last year , " said klaus gotzen who heads the business association for the german pyrotechnics industry . while gotzen said there was no question that donations to help victims in the tsunami-stricken region were necessary , he objected to the name the german aid organization agro action gave its fundraising campaign : " rice , not fireworks . " " i think it 's unfair that the call for donations has focused exclusively on our industry , " gotzen said .
" it would have made more sense to leave it up to people to decide for themselves what they 'd rather go without . " call already having effect germans have already started to take agro action 's message to heart .
on thursday , retailers reported less demand for fireworks than in previous years .
a department store employee in frankfurt estimated a 20 percent drop in sales .
and a newspaper in kiel reported how one shop was even prepared to give customers refunds for fireworks they 'd already paid for . but some of the germany 's hobby pyrotechnicians are n't prepared to give up their fun on the loudest night of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators watch fireworks in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin , germany , during the new year celebrations on thursday , jan .

" there 's no way i 'm going to give up my fireworks , " said one young man stocking up on rocket-like devices near leipzig .
" a proper fireworks display is part of new year 's eve , " another shopper said .
" i wo n't go without . " for other germans , it 's not a question of one or the other .
a father in kiel , out shopping with his children , said he 'd still spend around € 10 on fireworks , but that the family would also make a charitable donation , as it does every year . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami death toll could reach 150,000 the indonesian health ministry says at least 79,940 have died as a result of the tsunami tidal waves that struck the region .

calls by politicians and aid organizations for germans to donate the money they 'd otherwise spend on fireworks to the tsunami victims has worried the companies that rely on new year 's revenue for their survival . new year 's eve in germany is traditionally a noisy affair .
not content to leave the fireworks displays to the organizers of large parties , ordinary germans spend a lot of money - € 97 million -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- last year alone - on rockets , firecrackers , and sparklers . but this year , german politicians have been urging people to have a quieter celebration without the assorted noisemakers , and to spend the money instead on donations for the tsunami victims instead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims at a relief camp in port blair in india 's southeastern andaman and nicobar islands .

" it 's going to be very difficult for us now to match the € 97 million in sales we had last year , " said klaus gotzen who heads the business association for the german pyrotechnics industry . while gotzen said there was no question that donations to help victims in the tsunami-stricken region were necessary , he objected to the name the german aid organization agro action gave its fundraising campaign : " rice , not fireworks . " " i think it 's unfair that the call for donations has focused exclusively on our industry , " gotzen said .
" it would have made more sense to leave it up to people to decide for themselves what they 'd rather go without . " call already having effect germans have already started to take agro action 's message to heart .

not content to leave the fireworks displays to the organizers of large parties , ordinary germans spend a lot of money - € 97 million -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- last year alone - on rockets , firecrackers , and sparklers . but this year , german politicians have been urging people to have a quieter celebration without the assorted noisemakers , and to spend the money instead on donations for the tsunami victims instead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims at a relief camp in port blair in india 's southeastern andaman and nicobar islands .

" " i think it 's unfair that the call for donations has focused exclusively on our industry , " gotzen said .
" it would have made more sense to leave it up to people to decide for themselves what they 'd rather go without . " call already having effect germans have already started to take agro action 's message to heart .

calls by politicians and aid organizations for germans to donate the money they 'd otherwise spend on fireworks to the tsunami victims has worried the companies that rely on new year 's revenue for their survival . new year 's eve in germany is traditionally a noisy affair .
not content to leave the fireworks displays to the organizers of large parties , ordinary germans spend a lot of money - € 97 million -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- last year alone - on rockets , firecrackers , and sparklers . but this year , german politicians have been urging people to have a quieter celebration without the assorted noisemakers , and to spend the money instead on donations for the tsunami victims instead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims at a relief camp in port blair in india 's southeastern andaman and nicobar islands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.12.2004 calls grow to tax airlines for pollution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : planes pollute more than trains , but pay less environmental tax in germany , airlines enjoy generous government tax breaks while rail companies pay environmental and fuel taxes , even though they pollute less .
the paradox has environmentalists and rail officials upset . germany 's large environmental organizations as well as deutsche bahn , the country 's national rail operator , are demanding the rail network get the same treatment airlines do . the country 's airlines are currently not subject to any environmental and fuel tax and in the case of flights abroad , no value-added tax either .
deutsche bahn , on the other hand , is required by law to pay all three .
it then passes the costs on to passengers . deutsche bahn complains that the tax imbalance distorts competition , and environmentalists say the tax breaks for airlines amount to subsidizing a mode of transport that releases large amounts of pollutants . airlines - worst climate polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning of jet-engine fuel results in environmentally damaging emissions that predominantly consist of vapor , carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides . the effects of these substances are three times more pronounced at a higher altitude than they are on the ground , a fact that environmentalists say further exacerbates the " greenhouse effect , " wherein the trapped gases prevent heat being released from earth 's atmosphere and heat up the planet . gerhard timm , head of the german environmental organization bund -lrb- the association for environment and nature protection -rrb- , said that the international panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- had already concluded that co2 emissions released high up in the air were up to eight times more harmful than when released near the ground . culprit : discount airlines " the other problem is that air traffic in europe is one of the fastest growing in the world and increasing in the double digits every year , " timm said . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that aviation already causes four percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 .
according to the oecd , the impact of air traffic on global climate warming in 2030 will be more than three times higher than in 1990 .
the german environment ministry expects a threefold jump in co2 emissions by german airplanes by 2030 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers step off of a ryanair flight at brussels the environment lobby has already identified the main culprit responsible for the alarming rise in greenhouse gases : discount airlines . air travel has increased five fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the exploding popularity of budget airlines .
germany 's green lobby has little doubt that the no-frills travel boom is the country 's number one climate killer . eu moves to check imbalance in the face of such violations , environmentalists and deutsche bahn representatives are pushing for environmental taxes to be imposed on airlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they point out that that a rail journey is about a tenth as damaging to the environment as a airplane flight .
bund has calculated that the three tax breaks enjoyed by airlines costs the german finance ministry more than € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.8 billion -rrb- a year . the european union has attempted to correct the imbalance .
since the beginning of 2004 , a new eu energy tax directive explicitly mentions imposing a fuel tax on domestic flights as well as on planes operating within eu air space provided the participating eu member states reach agreement on it . but , unanimous agreement on the directive is still forthcoming .
" the eu regulation actually makes it possible for us in germany to make a unilateral move towards such a fuel tax on airlines , " timm said .
" the greens , the junior coalition partner in the governing coalition are in favor of it , but the bigger partner still has doubts , " he added , referring to the social democrats . pay back taxes or punish airlines bund has now kicked off a nationwide campaign together with deutsche bahn to demand a fuel tax on domestic air traffic . the initiative asks rail passengers in germany to lodge protests against airlines at large railway stations in the country as well as on the internet .
passengers can also calculate for themselves the tax breaks enjoyed by the airlines on a special form which can be downloaded from the internet and demand that the finance minister pay back the environmental tax charged on their tickets .
" that 's totally acceptable : passengers just have to say that they traveled by rail for so many kilometers and would like to have the taxes paid back , " said timm .
" or the other alternative in this campaign is that a similar tax should also be imposed on jet fuel .

calls by politicians and aid organizations for germans to donate the money they 'd otherwise spend on fireworks to the tsunami victims has worried the companies that rely on new year 's revenue for their survival . new year 's eve in germany is traditionally a noisy affair .
not content to leave the fireworks displays to the organizers of large parties , ordinary germans spend a lot of money - € 97 million -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- last year alone - on rockets , firecrackers , and sparklers . but this year , german politicians have been urging people to have a quieter celebration without the assorted noisemakers , and to spend the money instead on donations for the tsunami victims instead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims at a relief camp in port blair in india 's southeastern andaman and nicobar islands .
that 's upset the 3,000 people employed in germany 's fireworks industry , which rakes in the bulk of its annual turnover in the last three days of each year . " it 's going to be very difficult for us now to match the € 97 million in sales we had last year , " said klaus gotzen who heads the business association for the german pyrotechnics industry . while gotzen said there was no question that donations to help victims in the tsunami-stricken region were necessary , he objected to the name the german aid organization agro action gave its fundraising campaign : " rice , not fireworks . " " i think it 's unfair that the call for donations has focused exclusively on our industry , " gotzen said .
" it would have made more sense to leave it up to people to decide for themselves what they 'd rather go without . " call already having effect germans have already started to take agro action 's message to heart .
on thursday , retailers reported less demand for fireworks than in previous years .
a department store employee in frankfurt estimated a 20 percent drop in sales .
and a newspaper in kiel reported how one shop was even prepared to give customers refunds for fireworks they 'd already paid for . but some of the germany 's hobby pyrotechnicians are n't prepared to give up their fun on the loudest night of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators watch fireworks in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin , germany , during the new year celebrations on thursday , jan .

" i wo n't go without . " for other germans , it 's not a question of one or the other .

" germany , through the european union , will push the united nations and the world bank to help these countries in an efficient and unbureaucratic way .
for me , that includes reducing the debts of these countries , " he said .
" i want there to be lasting aid for the region .
i want us to feel a responsibility over a long period . " schröder has already proposed a moratorium on debt owed by indonesia and somalia , but his new appeal now includes other affected countries . french president jacques chirac on thursday told his government to push the paris club of creditor nations to put a moratorium on debt payments owed by some of the 11 asian countries which were hit by the disaster . canada has already done so , with canadian foreign minister pierre pettigrew saying the moratorium would help the battered asian nations dealwith both the immediate crisis and their long-term rebuilding efforts . a spokesman for the us agency for international development had said wednesday that washington was " open to all kinds of ideas " on debt reduction . bilateral partnerships in his speech dedicated almost entirely to the flood catastrophe , schröder also called for stronger bilateral partnerships between industrial nations and the nations hit by the tsunamis . bildunterschrift : in these photos released thursday , the shoreline of banda aceh in indonesia , is shown on june 23 , 2004 , above , and dec .
28 , 2004 , below , after the tsunami attack . " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation .
also germany .
our states for corresponding areas there .
our cities for their cities and our villages for their villages , " schröder said in the speech . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there .
this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long-term . " schröder , calling the tsunami disaster the " worst natural catastrophe in human memory " , said he would present the plan to other members of the european union . reforms to continue the chancellor touched only briefly on matters of domestic policy , painting an optimistic picture for 2005 . " our reform course will continue decisively in the year ahead , " schröder said , adding that the reforms already passed in 2004 will " keep germany on the road to success .

calls by politicians and aid organizations for germans to donate the money they 'd otherwise spend on fireworks to the tsunami victims has worried the companies that rely on new year 's revenue for their survival . new year 's eve in germany is traditionally a noisy affair .
not content to leave the fireworks displays to the organizers of large parties , ordinary germans spend a lot of money - € 97 million -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- last year alone - on rockets , firecrackers , and sparklers . but this year , german politicians have been urging people to have a quieter celebration without the assorted noisemakers , and to spend the money instead on donations for the tsunami victims instead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims at a relief camp in port blair in india 's southeastern andaman and nicobar islands .
that 's upset the 3,000 people employed in germany 's fireworks industry , which rakes in the bulk of its annual turnover in the last three days of each year . " it 's going to be very difficult for us now to match the € 97 million in sales we had last year , " said klaus gotzen who heads the business association for the german pyrotechnics industry . while gotzen said there was no question that donations to help victims in the tsunami-stricken region were necessary , he objected to the name the german aid organization agro action gave its fundraising campaign : " rice , not fireworks . " " i think it 's unfair that the call for donations has focused exclusively on our industry , " gotzen said .
" it would have made more sense to leave it up to people to decide for themselves what they 'd rather go without . " call already having effect germans have already started to take agro action 's message to heart .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.12.2004 calls grow to tax airlines for pollution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : planes pollute more than trains , but pay less environmental tax in germany , airlines enjoy generous government tax breaks while rail companies pay environmental and fuel taxes , even though they pollute less .
the paradox has environmentalists and rail officials upset . germany 's large environmental organizations as well as deutsche bahn , the country 's national rail operator , are demanding the rail network get the same treatment airlines do . the country 's airlines are currently not subject to any environmental and fuel tax and in the case of flights abroad , no value-added tax either .
deutsche bahn , on the other hand , is required by law to pay all three .
it then passes the costs on to passengers . deutsche bahn complains that the tax imbalance distorts competition , and environmentalists say the tax breaks for airlines amount to subsidizing a mode of transport that releases large amounts of pollutants . airlines - worst climate polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning of jet-engine fuel results in environmentally damaging emissions that predominantly consist of vapor , carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides . the effects of these substances are three times more pronounced at a higher altitude than they are on the ground , a fact that environmentalists say further exacerbates the " greenhouse effect , " wherein the trapped gases prevent heat being released from earth 's atmosphere and heat up the planet . gerhard timm , head of the german environmental organization bund -lrb- the association for environment and nature protection -rrb- , said that the international panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- had already concluded that co2 emissions released high up in the air were up to eight times more harmful than when released near the ground . culprit : discount airlines " the other problem is that air traffic in europe is one of the fastest growing in the world and increasing in the double digits every year , " timm said . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that aviation already causes four percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 .
according to the oecd , the impact of air traffic on global climate warming in 2030 will be more than three times higher than in 1990 .
the german environment ministry expects a threefold jump in co2 emissions by german airplanes by 2030 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers step off of a ryanair flight at brussels the environment lobby has already identified the main culprit responsible for the alarming rise in greenhouse gases : discount airlines . air travel has increased five fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the exploding popularity of budget airlines .
germany 's green lobby has little doubt that the no-frills travel boom is the country 's number one climate killer . eu moves to check imbalance in the face of such violations , environmentalists and deutsche bahn representatives are pushing for environmental taxes to be imposed on airlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they point out that that a rail journey is about a tenth as damaging to the environment as a airplane flight .
bund has calculated that the three tax breaks enjoyed by airlines costs the german finance ministry more than € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.8 billion -rrb- a year . the european union has attempted to correct the imbalance .
since the beginning of 2004 , a new eu energy tax directive explicitly mentions imposing a fuel tax on domestic flights as well as on planes operating within eu air space provided the participating eu member states reach agreement on it . but , unanimous agreement on the directive is still forthcoming .
" the eu regulation actually makes it possible for us in germany to make a unilateral move towards such a fuel tax on airlines , " timm said .
" the greens , the junior coalition partner in the governing coalition are in favor of it , but the bigger partner still has doubts , " he added , referring to the social democrats . pay back taxes or punish airlines bund has now kicked off a nationwide campaign together with deutsche bahn to demand a fuel tax on domestic air traffic . the initiative asks rail passengers in germany to lodge protests against airlines at large railway stations in the country as well as on the internet .
passengers can also calculate for themselves the tax breaks enjoyed by the airlines on a special form which can be downloaded from the internet and demand that the finance minister pay back the environmental tax charged on their tickets .
" that 's totally acceptable : passengers just have to say that they traveled by rail for so many kilometers and would like to have the taxes paid back , " said timm .
" or the other alternative in this campaign is that a similar tax should also be imposed on jet fuel . " marina joarder -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jetting around more responsibly budget airlines have made it easier for people to take to the skies , but on the downside frequent air travel pollutes the environment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.12.2004 calls grow to tax airlines for pollution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : planes pollute more than trains , but pay less environmental tax in germany , airlines enjoy generous government tax breaks while rail companies pay environmental and fuel taxes , even though they pollute less .
the paradox has environmentalists and rail officials upset . germany 's large environmental organizations as well as deutsche bahn , the country 's national rail operator , are demanding the rail network get the same treatment airlines do . the country 's airlines are currently not subject to any environmental and fuel tax and in the case of flights abroad , no value-added tax either .
deutsche bahn , on the other hand , is required by law to pay all three .
it then passes the costs on to passengers . deutsche bahn complains that the tax imbalance distorts competition , and environmentalists say the tax breaks for airlines amount to subsidizing a mode of transport that releases large amounts of pollutants . airlines - worst climate polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning of jet-engine fuel results in environmentally damaging emissions that predominantly consist of vapor , carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides . the effects of these substances are three times more pronounced at a higher altitude than they are on the ground , a fact that environmentalists say further exacerbates the " greenhouse effect , " wherein the trapped gases prevent heat being released from earth 's atmosphere and heat up the planet . gerhard timm , head of the german environmental organization bund -lrb- the association for environment and nature protection -rrb- , said that the international panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- had already concluded that co2 emissions released high up in the air were up to eight times more harmful than when released near the ground . culprit : discount airlines " the other problem is that air traffic in europe is one of the fastest growing in the world and increasing in the double digits every year , " timm said . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that aviation already causes four percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 .
according to the oecd , the impact of air traffic on global climate warming in 2030 will be more than three times higher than in 1990 .
the german environment ministry expects a threefold jump in co2 emissions by german airplanes by 2030 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers step off of a ryanair flight at brussels the environment lobby has already identified the main culprit responsible for the alarming rise in greenhouse gases : discount airlines . air travel has increased five fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the exploding popularity of budget airlines .
germany 's green lobby has little doubt that the no-frills travel boom is the country 's number one climate killer . eu moves to check imbalance in the face of such violations , environmentalists and deutsche bahn representatives are pushing for environmental taxes to be imposed on airlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they point out that that a rail journey is about a tenth as damaging to the environment as a airplane flight .
bund has calculated that the three tax breaks enjoyed by airlines costs the german finance ministry more than € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.8 billion -rrb- a year . the european union has attempted to correct the imbalance .
since the beginning of 2004 , a new eu energy tax directive explicitly mentions imposing a fuel tax on domestic flights as well as on planes operating within eu air space provided the participating eu member states reach agreement on it . but , unanimous agreement on the directive is still forthcoming .
" the eu regulation actually makes it possible for us in germany to make a unilateral move towards such a fuel tax on airlines , " timm said .
" the greens , the junior coalition partner in the governing coalition are in favor of it , but the bigger partner still has doubts , " he added , referring to the social democrats . pay back taxes or punish airlines bund has now kicked off a nationwide campaign together with deutsche bahn to demand a fuel tax on domestic air traffic . the initiative asks rail passengers in germany to lodge protests against airlines at large railway stations in the country as well as on the internet .
passengers can also calculate for themselves the tax breaks enjoyed by the airlines on a special form which can be downloaded from the internet and demand that the finance minister pay back the environmental tax charged on their tickets .
" that 's totally acceptable : passengers just have to say that they traveled by rail for so many kilometers and would like to have the taxes paid back , " said timm .
" or the other alternative in this campaign is that a similar tax should also be imposed on jet fuel .

calls by politicians and aid organizations for germans to donate the money they 'd otherwise spend on fireworks to the tsunami victims has worried the companies that rely on new year 's revenue for their survival . new year 's eve in germany is traditionally a noisy affair .
not content to leave the fireworks displays to the organizers of large parties , ordinary germans spend a lot of money - € 97 million -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- last year alone - on rockets , firecrackers , and sparklers . but this year , german politicians have been urging people to have a quieter celebration without the assorted noisemakers , and to spend the money instead on donations for the tsunami victims instead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims at a relief camp in port blair in india 's southeastern andaman and nicobar islands .
that 's upset the 3,000 people employed in germany 's fireworks industry , which rakes in the bulk of its annual turnover in the last three days of each year . " it 's going to be very difficult for us now to match the € 97 million in sales we had last year , " said klaus gotzen who heads the business association for the german pyrotechnics industry . while gotzen said there was no question that donations to help victims in the tsunami-stricken region were necessary , he objected to the name the german aid organization agro action gave its fundraising campaign : " rice , not fireworks . " " i think it 's unfair that the call for donations has focused exclusively on our industry , " gotzen said .
" it would have made more sense to leave it up to people to decide for themselves what they 'd rather go without . " call already having effect germans have already started to take agro action 's message to heart .
on thursday , retailers reported less demand for fireworks than in previous years .
a department store employee in frankfurt estimated a 20 percent drop in sales .
and a newspaper in kiel reported how one shop was even prepared to give customers refunds for fireworks they 'd already paid for . but some of the germany 's hobby pyrotechnicians are n't prepared to give up their fun on the loudest night of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators watch fireworks in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin , germany , during the new year celebrations on thursday , jan .

" a proper fireworks display is part of new year 's eve , " another shopper said .
" i wo n't go without . " for other germans , it 's not a question of one or the other .
a father in kiel , out shopping with his children , said he 'd still spend around € 10 on fireworks , but that the family would also make a charitable donation , as it does every year . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami death toll could reach 150,000 the indonesian health ministry says at least 79,940 have died as a result of the tsunami tidal waves that struck the region .

" germany , through the european union , will push the united nations and the world bank to help these countries in an efficient and unbureaucratic way .
for me , that includes reducing the debts of these countries , " he said .
" i want there to be lasting aid for the region .
i want us to feel a responsibility over a long period . " schröder has already proposed a moratorium on debt owed by indonesia and somalia , but his new appeal now includes other affected countries . french president jacques chirac on thursday told his government to push the paris club of creditor nations to put a moratorium on debt payments owed by some of the 11 asian countries which were hit by the disaster . canada has already done so , with canadian foreign minister pierre pettigrew saying the moratorium would help the battered asian nations dealwith both the immediate crisis and their long-term rebuilding efforts . a spokesman for the us agency for international development had said wednesday that washington was " open to all kinds of ideas " on debt reduction . bilateral partnerships in his speech dedicated almost entirely to the flood catastrophe , schröder also called for stronger bilateral partnerships between industrial nations and the nations hit by the tsunamis . bildunterschrift : in these photos released thursday , the shoreline of banda aceh in indonesia , is shown on june 23 , 2004 , above , and dec .

this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long-term . " schröder , calling the tsunami disaster the " worst natural catastrophe in human memory " , said he would present the plan to other members of the european union . reforms to continue the chancellor touched only briefly on matters of domestic policy , painting an optimistic picture for 2005 .

" germany , through the european union , will push the united nations and the world bank to help these countries in an efficient and unbureaucratic way .
for me , that includes reducing the debts of these countries , " he said .
" i want there to be lasting aid for the region .
i want us to feel a responsibility over a long period . " schröder has already proposed a moratorium on debt owed by indonesia and somalia , but his new appeal now includes other affected countries . french president jacques chirac on thursday told his government to push the paris club of creditor nations to put a moratorium on debt payments owed by some of the 11 asian countries which were hit by the disaster . canada has already done so , with canadian foreign minister pierre pettigrew saying the moratorium would help the battered asian nations dealwith both the immediate crisis and their long-term rebuilding efforts . a spokesman for the us agency for international development had said wednesday that washington was " open to all kinds of ideas " on debt reduction . bilateral partnerships in his speech dedicated almost entirely to the flood catastrophe , schröder also called for stronger bilateral partnerships between industrial nations and the nations hit by the tsunamis . bildunterschrift : in these photos released thursday , the shoreline of banda aceh in indonesia , is shown on june 23 , 2004 , above , and dec .

this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long-term . " schröder , calling the tsunami disaster the " worst natural catastrophe in human memory " , said he would present the plan to other members of the european union . reforms to continue the chancellor touched only briefly on matters of domestic policy , painting an optimistic picture for 2005 .

calls by politicians and aid organizations for germans to donate the money they 'd otherwise spend on fireworks to the tsunami victims has worried the companies that rely on new year 's revenue for their survival . new year 's eve in germany is traditionally a noisy affair .
not content to leave the fireworks displays to the organizers of large parties , ordinary germans spend a lot of money - € 97 million -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- last year alone - on rockets , firecrackers , and sparklers . but this year , german politicians have been urging people to have a quieter celebration without the assorted noisemakers , and to spend the money instead on donations for the tsunami victims instead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims at a relief camp in port blair in india 's southeastern andaman and nicobar islands .
that 's upset the 3,000 people employed in germany 's fireworks industry , which rakes in the bulk of its annual turnover in the last three days of each year . " it 's going to be very difficult for us now to match the € 97 million in sales we had last year , " said klaus gotzen who heads the business association for the german pyrotechnics industry . while gotzen said there was no question that donations to help victims in the tsunami-stricken region were necessary , he objected to the name the german aid organization agro action gave its fundraising campaign : " rice , not fireworks . " " i think it 's unfair that the call for donations has focused exclusively on our industry , " gotzen said .
" it would have made more sense to leave it up to people to decide for themselves what they 'd rather go without . " call already having effect germans have already started to take agro action 's message to heart .
on thursday , retailers reported less demand for fireworks than in previous years .
a department store employee in frankfurt estimated a 20 percent drop in sales .
and a newspaper in kiel reported how one shop was even prepared to give customers refunds for fireworks they 'd already paid for . but some of the germany 's hobby pyrotechnicians are n't prepared to give up their fun on the loudest night of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators watch fireworks in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin , germany , during the new year celebrations on thursday , jan .

" there 's no way i 'm going to give up my fireworks , " said one young man stocking up on rocket-like devices near leipzig .
" a proper fireworks display is part of new year 's eve , " another shopper said .
" i wo n't go without . " for other germans , it 's not a question of one or the other .
a father in kiel , out shopping with his children , said he 'd still spend around € 10 on fireworks , but that the family would also make a charitable donation , as it does every year . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami death toll could reach 150,000 the indonesian health ministry says at least 79,940 have died as a result of the tsunami tidal waves that struck the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.12.2004 calls grow to tax airlines for pollution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : planes pollute more than trains , but pay less environmental tax in germany , airlines enjoy generous government tax breaks while rail companies pay environmental and fuel taxes , even though they pollute less .
the paradox has environmentalists and rail officials upset . germany 's large environmental organizations as well as deutsche bahn , the country 's national rail operator , are demanding the rail network get the same treatment airlines do . the country 's airlines are currently not subject to any environmental and fuel tax and in the case of flights abroad , no value-added tax either .
deutsche bahn , on the other hand , is required by law to pay all three .
it then passes the costs on to passengers . deutsche bahn complains that the tax imbalance distorts competition , and environmentalists say the tax breaks for airlines amount to subsidizing a mode of transport that releases large amounts of pollutants . airlines - worst climate polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning of jet-engine fuel results in environmentally damaging emissions that predominantly consist of vapor , carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides . the effects of these substances are three times more pronounced at a higher altitude than they are on the ground , a fact that environmentalists say further exacerbates the " greenhouse effect , " wherein the trapped gases prevent heat being released from earth 's atmosphere and heat up the planet . gerhard timm , head of the german environmental organization bund -lrb- the association for environment and nature protection -rrb- , said that the international panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- had already concluded that co2 emissions released high up in the air were up to eight times more harmful than when released near the ground . culprit : discount airlines " the other problem is that air traffic in europe is one of the fastest growing in the world and increasing in the double digits every year , " timm said . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that aviation already causes four percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 .
according to the oecd , the impact of air traffic on global climate warming in 2030 will be more than three times higher than in 1990 .
the german environment ministry expects a threefold jump in co2 emissions by german airplanes by 2030 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers step off of a ryanair flight at brussels the environment lobby has already identified the main culprit responsible for the alarming rise in greenhouse gases : discount airlines . air travel has increased five fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the exploding popularity of budget airlines .
germany 's green lobby has little doubt that the no-frills travel boom is the country 's number one climate killer . eu moves to check imbalance in the face of such violations , environmentalists and deutsche bahn representatives are pushing for environmental taxes to be imposed on airlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they point out that that a rail journey is about a tenth as damaging to the environment as a airplane flight .
bund has calculated that the three tax breaks enjoyed by airlines costs the german finance ministry more than € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.8 billion -rrb- a year . the european union has attempted to correct the imbalance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.12.2004 calls grow to tax airlines for pollution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : planes pollute more than trains , but pay less environmental tax in germany , airlines enjoy generous government tax breaks while rail companies pay environmental and fuel taxes , even though they pollute less .
the paradox has environmentalists and rail officials upset . germany 's large environmental organizations as well as deutsche bahn , the country 's national rail operator , are demanding the rail network get the same treatment airlines do . the country 's airlines are currently not subject to any environmental and fuel tax and in the case of flights abroad , no value-added tax either .
deutsche bahn , on the other hand , is required by law to pay all three .
it then passes the costs on to passengers . deutsche bahn complains that the tax imbalance distorts competition , and environmentalists say the tax breaks for airlines amount to subsidizing a mode of transport that releases large amounts of pollutants . airlines - worst climate polluters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning of jet-engine fuel results in environmentally damaging emissions that predominantly consist of vapor , carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides . the effects of these substances are three times more pronounced at a higher altitude than they are on the ground , a fact that environmentalists say further exacerbates the " greenhouse effect , " wherein the trapped gases prevent heat being released from earth 's atmosphere and heat up the planet . gerhard timm , head of the german environmental organization bund -lrb- the association for environment and nature protection -rrb- , said that the international panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- had already concluded that co2 emissions released high up in the air were up to eight times more harmful than when released near the ground . culprit : discount airlines " the other problem is that air traffic in europe is one of the fastest growing in the world and increasing in the double digits every year , " timm said . the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that aviation already causes four percent of man-made global warming and that figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050 .
according to the oecd , the impact of air traffic on global climate warming in 2030 will be more than three times higher than in 1990 .
the german environment ministry expects a threefold jump in co2 emissions by german airplanes by 2030 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers step off of a ryanair flight at brussels the environment lobby has already identified the main culprit responsible for the alarming rise in greenhouse gases : discount airlines . air travel has increased five fold since 1970 , with much of that growth taking place in the last few years due to the exploding popularity of budget airlines .
germany 's green lobby has little doubt that the no-frills travel boom is the country 's number one climate killer . eu moves to check imbalance in the face of such violations , environmentalists and deutsche bahn representatives are pushing for environmental taxes to be imposed on airlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they point out that that a rail journey is about a tenth as damaging to the environment as a airplane flight .
bund has calculated that the three tax breaks enjoyed by airlines costs the german finance ministry more than € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.8 billion -rrb- a year . the european union has attempted to correct the imbalance .
since the beginning of 2004 , a new eu energy tax directive explicitly mentions imposing a fuel tax on domestic flights as well as on planes operating within eu air space provided the participating eu member states reach agreement on it . but , unanimous agreement on the directive is still forthcoming .
" the eu regulation actually makes it possible for us in germany to make a unilateral move towards such a fuel tax on airlines , " timm said .
" the greens , the junior coalition partner in the governing coalition are in favor of it , but the bigger partner still has doubts , " he added , referring to the social democrats . pay back taxes or punish airlines bund has now kicked off a nationwide campaign together with deutsche bahn to demand a fuel tax on domestic air traffic . the initiative asks rail passengers in germany to lodge protests against airlines at large railway stations in the country as well as on the internet .
passengers can also calculate for themselves the tax breaks enjoyed by the airlines on a special form which can be downloaded from the internet and demand that the finance minister pay back the environmental tax charged on their tickets .
" that 's totally acceptable : passengers just have to say that they traveled by rail for so many kilometers and would like to have the taxes paid back , " said timm .
" or the other alternative in this campaign is that a similar tax should also be imposed on jet fuel . " marina joarder -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jetting around more responsibly budget airlines have made it easier for people to take to the skies , but on the downside frequent air travel pollutes the environment .
a german initiative " atmosfair " aims to encourage passengers to restore the balance .

calls by politicians and aid organizations for germans to donate the money they 'd otherwise spend on fireworks to the tsunami victims has worried the companies that rely on new year 's revenue for their survival . new year 's eve in germany is traditionally a noisy affair .
not content to leave the fireworks displays to the organizers of large parties , ordinary germans spend a lot of money - € 97 million -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- last year alone - on rockets , firecrackers , and sparklers . but this year , german politicians have been urging people to have a quieter celebration without the assorted noisemakers , and to spend the money instead on donations for the tsunami victims instead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims at a relief camp in port blair in india 's southeastern andaman and nicobar islands .
that 's upset the 3,000 people employed in germany 's fireworks industry , which rakes in the bulk of its annual turnover in the last three days of each year . " it 's going to be very difficult for us now to match the € 97 million in sales we had last year , " said klaus gotzen who heads the business association for the german pyrotechnics industry . while gotzen said there was no question that donations to help victims in the tsunami-stricken region were necessary , he objected to the name the german aid organization agro action gave its fundraising campaign : " rice , not fireworks .

calls by politicians and aid organizations for germans to donate the money they 'd otherwise spend on fireworks to the tsunami victims has worried the companies that rely on new year 's revenue for their survival . new year 's eve in germany is traditionally a noisy affair .
not content to leave the fireworks displays to the organizers of large parties , ordinary germans spend a lot of money - € 97 million -lrb- $ 130 million -rrb- last year alone - on rockets , firecrackers , and sparklers . but this year , german politicians have been urging people to have a quieter celebration without the assorted noisemakers , and to spend the money instead on donations for the tsunami victims instead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims at a relief camp in port blair in india 's southeastern andaman and nicobar islands .
that 's upset the 3,000 people employed in germany 's fireworks industry , which rakes in the bulk of its annual turnover in the last three days of each year . " it 's going to be very difficult for us now to match the € 97 million in sales we had last year , " said klaus gotzen who heads the business association for the german pyrotechnics industry . while gotzen said there was no question that donations to help victims in the tsunami-stricken region were necessary , he objected to the name the german aid organization agro action gave its fundraising campaign : " rice , not fireworks . " " i think it 's unfair that the call for donations has focused exclusively on our industry , " gotzen said .
" it would have made more sense to leave it up to people to decide for themselves what they 'd rather go without . " call already having effect germans have already started to take agro action 's message to heart .
on thursday , retailers reported less demand for fireworks than in previous years .
a department store employee in frankfurt estimated a 20 percent drop in sales .
and a newspaper in kiel reported how one shop was even prepared to give customers refunds for fireworks they 'd already paid for . but some of the germany 's hobby pyrotechnicians are n't prepared to give up their fun on the loudest night of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators watch fireworks in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin , germany , during the new year celebrations on thursday , jan .
1 , 2004 .
" there 's no way i 'm going to give up my fireworks , " said one young man stocking up on rocket-like devices near leipzig .
" a proper fireworks display is part of new year 's eve , " another shopper said .
" i wo n't go without . " for other germans , it 's not a question of one or the other .
a father in kiel , out shopping with his children , said he 'd still spend around € 10 on fireworks , but that the family would also make a charitable donation , as it does every year . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami death toll could reach 150,000 the indonesian health ministry says at least 79,940 have died as a result of the tsunami tidal waves that struck the region .
