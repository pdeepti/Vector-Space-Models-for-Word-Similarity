some looked like " charcoal briquettes , " said michael knoche , the director of the 338-year-old library .
others , soaked in the water sprayed by firefighters , were several pounds heavier than their original weight . the damage done , it 's up to a team of bookbinders at the privately-run center for book preservation in leipzig to lessen its impact .
as of tuesday , a little more than 25,000 books were declared completely lost .
of the estimated 50,000 pulled from the burning building by a human chain of library employees and volunteers thursday night , more than 35,000 have suffered water damage , some of it heavy .

" there are several tons , " said reikov-räuchle . so far , the federal government has promised € 4 million in emergency money , half of which was transferred on monday , according to museum officials . an account set up for donations from the public has gotten a good reception and a series of benefit concerts are being planned .

the rest will be handled by the center , which is undertaking its biggest assignment since floods devastated several libraries along the elbe in 2002 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.09.2004 learning to learn in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a long way from kabul to saxony for afghan students after years of war and unrest , coming to germany was like a dream for a group of afghan students .
they experienced a completely different type of school , learning with computers and experimenting with creativity . ahmad farhad ’ s face is scarred .
during the war , he and three of his brothers were injured , he says .
he doesn ’ t elaborate , merely stares straight ahead , smiles , and changes the topic .
this exchange , he says , is a miracle .
ahmad is 19 years old and a student at kabul ’ s amani high school .
he and 18 other teenagers came to germany about three weeks ago as part of the first german-afghan student exchange program .
on wednesday , the group flies back home , and will take many memories and new ideas with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls and boys have separate schools in afghanistan .
here a girls class in novobod .
for the 18-year-old atifa formuli , one of the group 's eight girls , the exchange proves that men and women can study and work together .

equally impressed by what she saw in the german schools , atifa says she will tell the education ministry in afghanistan how students in germany learn .
she was especially intrigued by a particular creative exercise in which all the students in a classroom listened to music and then each drew their own pictures inspired by the music .
at first she thought such a task would be difficult , but it worked , she says , and she managed to come up with ideas on her own .
a german role model ?
" i saw that every person in germany was responsible for their own acts and worked by themselves .
and because of this they have helped make their country beautiful and clean , " atifa recalls .
" when we go back , we will say to everyone that we can also make our country like this , " she pledges .
atifa 's goal , like that of her classmates , is to help rebuild her country .
in order to do that the students all plan to go on to university and get a degree .
many would even like to study in germany and hope for financial support to do so .
it does n't matter if they come from a different cultural background , atifa says : " people are people wherever they are . "
at the moment are no plans for another group of afghan students to visit germany .
and , due to the tense security situation , a visit by german students to afghanistan is not planned any time soon . silke bartlick -lrb- db / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life in afghanistan deutsche welle reporters sandra petersmann and karen fischer explore the country , from kabul to kunduz , documenting the new struggles , the daily fight for survival , the joy of afghan children who are finally back in school and the fate of refugees who have returned to their homeland .
deutsche welle & cap anamur build 32 schools in afghanistan deutsche welle and cap anamur would like to thank all of the donors who have helped make the 100 classrooms for afghanistan program a total success .
germany paves the way for education in afghanistan while the army takes on an extended military mandate in afghanistan , germany keeps up a quiet but comprehensive educational mission in the ravaged country .

in both style and spirit , many resemble their predecessors of the " neue deutsche welle " -lrb- german new wave -rrb- , which rocked out german-style in the eighties . instead of cranking out cookie-cutter pop hits in english that currently dominate germany 's airwaves , a growing number of young germans are choosing to sing auf deutsch .
they are picking up on the tradition of acts such as nena , trio and falco - who helped make music with german lyrics in the late 1970s and early 1980s popular . deutsche welle interviewed the members of " 2raumwohnung , " inga humpe and tommie eckart , who along with bands like " wir sind helden " are launching the second wave . the name " 2raumwohnung " -lrb- 2-room apartment -rrb- has a lot of symbolic meaning related to german history .
how would you explain the name to your fans abroad ? tommi : the name originally comes from the fact that we 're two people and this is a two person project .
but then , of course , there 's this funny situation : due to the wall and the division between east and west , the language was also divided .
now , 15 years after the fall of the wall , there are still differences , and germans from the east and west have different ways of describing a two-room apartment because they prefer to use different words for room : " zimmer " in the west and " raum " in the east .
we took this linguistic anomaly to be a synonym for berlin , and since we are from the west we incorporated the " raum " into our name to represent a kind of connection . what is your relationship to the german language like ?
foreigners often describe the language as hard , but in your music you make it sound light and soft . inga : that 's true .
after i sing in german , i also think the language is quite hard .
we take great pains to make it sound softer .
but we also have a bit of experience singing in english .
now we have decided to record some of our songs in english , like " sexy girl " and " spiel mit , " which is on the premium version of our cd .
and just yesterday , we recorded an english version of " wir sind anderen . " i recently heard from toni kater , a berlin musician who is on the same label , that when she first met both of you , she identified your band with the " berlin scene . "
do you identify with any " scene " at all , and to what extent is your music tied to the city of berlin ? inga : with the " scene " no , but definitely with the city .
there are so many " scenes " in berlin , but the city is an important source of inspiration for us .
without berlin , we probably would n't exist .
berlin is so big and multi-faceted , and there 's so much freedom here that many different varieties of music can develop .
it 's nice , i think , to be connected to the soul of this city .
i will always be in love with berlin . when you write your songs , do you have a specific public in mind ? tommi : we try to make the kind of music we would enjoy and compose songs we would want to listen to , even if we were n't writing it ourselves .
that 's also how we approached the new album : even if we had n't made it ourselves , would we want to listen to it ?
at least this is what we always try and do .
we do n't have a particular person or listener in mind .
we simply make music for ourselves and for our friends .
i think our fans are not so different than we are . from which musical genre does " 2raumwohnung " draw inspiration ? tommi : we try to draw upon everything we like .
we are just as inspired by air and madonna as by miss kittin and märtini brös .
even older music , like kraftwerk and music from the ' 70s , has influenced us . what are you listening to at the moment ? tommi : i am listening to lots of air at the moment , and i love phoenix .
i guess i listen to other things too , like chet baker … the german press recently accused you of being too optimistic and not political enough .
do you have a response to them ?
and why are you so optimistic ? tommi : first of all , i think it is very important to be optimistic .
when we make music , we are simply in a good mood and people can tell .
but i also do n't agree that our music is not political .
when someone takes their own feelings seriously and shares it with other people , then it is perhaps not - strictly speaking - political , but it certainly has a greater meaning for society . inga : it was a very deliberate decision to be optimistic and to remain optimistic .
i think it 's not the best choice - just because the times are hard - to whine and complain along with everyone else .
instead , people should ask themselves what they can do to make things better for themselves and for everyone others .
i think positive thinking is the basis of that .
and besides , i do n't really understand why the germans complain so much - things are n't really that bad . do you plan on touring abroad ? inga : yes , lots .
we are always getting offers from brazil and mexico . tommi : sadly , it has n't worked out in brazil .
but we 've already played in russia and in japan and we have plans for concerts in spain and turkey . look for " 2raumwohnung " and other representatives of the new " german wave " at a venue near you soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy .

in both style and spirit , many resemble their predecessors of the " neue deutsche welle " -lrb- german new wave -rrb- , which rocked out german-style in the eighties . instead of cranking out cookie-cutter pop hits in english that currently dominate germany 's airwaves , a growing number of young germans are choosing to sing auf deutsch .
they are picking up on the tradition of acts such as nena , trio and falco - who helped make music with german lyrics in the late 1970s and early 1980s popular . deutsche welle interviewed the members of " 2raumwohnung , " inga humpe and tommie eckart , who along with bands like " wir sind helden " are launching the second wave . the name " 2raumwohnung " -lrb- 2-room apartment -rrb- has a lot of symbolic meaning related to german history .
how would you explain the name to your fans abroad ? tommi : the name originally comes from the fact that we 're two people and this is a two person project .
but then , of course , there 's this funny situation : due to the wall and the division between east and west , the language was also divided .
now , 15 years after the fall of the wall , there are still differences , and germans from the east and west have different ways of describing a two-room apartment because they prefer to use different words for room : " zimmer " in the west and " raum " in the east .
we took this linguistic anomaly to be a synonym for berlin , and since we are from the west we incorporated the " raum " into our name to represent a kind of connection . what is your relationship to the german language like ?
foreigners often describe the language as hard , but in your music you make it sound light and soft . inga : that 's true .
after i sing in german , i also think the language is quite hard .
we take great pains to make it sound softer .
but we also have a bit of experience singing in english .
now we have decided to record some of our songs in english , like " sexy girl " and " spiel mit , " which is on the premium version of our cd .
and just yesterday , we recorded an english version of " wir sind anderen . " i recently heard from toni kater , a berlin musician who is on the same label , that when she first met both of you , she identified your band with the " berlin scene . "
do you identify with any " scene " at all , and to what extent is your music tied to the city of berlin ? inga : with the " scene " no , but definitely with the city .
there are so many " scenes " in berlin , but the city is an important source of inspiration for us .
without berlin , we probably would n't exist .
berlin is so big and multi-faceted , and there 's so much freedom here that many different varieties of music can develop .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.09.2004 the computer as reading instructor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning the abcs with the pc although they ca n't read and write , that does n't mean illiterates ca n't learn .
but many are too ashamed to take a course .
that 's why a new german initiative offers instruction over the internet . some four million people in germany are illiterate .
even though they went to school , they never learned to read or write properly .
for most of them - adults who have gotten through life with a series of complex compensation strategies - admitting illiteracy is a difficult hurdle to overcome .
only 20,0000 of the country 's so-called functional illiterates -lrb- excluding foreigners who never went to school -rrb- have actually taken advantage of reading courses offered by outreach programs throughout the country .
the rest are often too ashamed to admit their problem by seeking help .
in order to combat illiteracy , a new initiative is being launched in germany to teach reading and writing anonymously via the internet .
on sept .
8 , international literacy day , a special web site goes online to provide individual instruction which serves either as a complement to classroom teaching or as a primary learning source for those not enrolled in a course .
called " alfa-portal literacy learning , " or apoll for short , the site is financed by the federal ministry for education and research .
less pressure on the pc " the biggest problem for a functioning illiterate is to out oneself , to take the first step of signing up for a course , " said christian fiebig , director of the apoll project .
" through the e-learning portal , we offer the possibility of learning anonymously without having to out oneself , " he told dw-world .
in the future some 17,000 instruction exercises will be available on the site for illiterates to set up their own individual learning plan .

but many are too ashamed to take a course .
that 's why a new german initiative offers instruction over the internet . some four million people in germany are illiterate .
even though they went to school , they never learned to read or write properly .
for most of them - adults who have gotten through life with a series of complex compensation strategies - admitting illiteracy is a difficult hurdle to overcome .
only 20,0000 of the country 's so-called functional illiterates -lrb- excluding foreigners who never went to school -rrb- have actually taken advantage of reading courses offered by outreach programs throughout the country .
the rest are often too ashamed to admit their problem by seeking help .
in order to combat illiteracy , a new initiative is being launched in germany to teach reading and writing anonymously via the internet .
on sept .
8 , international literacy day , a special web site goes online to provide individual instruction which serves either as a complement to classroom teaching or as a primary learning source for those not enrolled in a course .
called " alfa-portal literacy learning , " or apoll for short , the site is financed by the federal ministry for education and research .
less pressure on the pc " the biggest problem for a functioning illiterate is to out oneself , to take the first step of signing up for a course , " said christian fiebig , director of the apoll project .
" through the e-learning portal , we offer the possibility of learning anonymously without having to out oneself , " he told dw-world .
in the future some 17,000 instruction exercises will be available on the site for illiterates to set up their own individual learning plan .
the only prerequisite is that the internet user recognize the address of the web site , www.ich-will-schreiben-lernen.de -lrb- in english : i want to learn to write -rrb- , and save the url as a favorite to visit over and over again .
once at the site , they will be guided through a special tutorial that reads all the instructions and texts out loud .
learning any time at any pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading is a pleasure illiterates never get to appreciate the e-learning page asks each illiterate to evaluate their own skills and then conducts a short test to determine placement within the online course .
before instruction begins , the computer program asks each participant what their goal is : whether they want to be able to read and fill out official forms and deal with bureaucracy , read books or simply improve daily life .
each literacy participant receives an individually outlined program of instruction and exercises to complete for the week .
in the early stages of instruction audio clips and little pictures assist the literacy learner .
later , short news texts and stories will be provided as practice .
the apoll program offers participants the possibility to set the pace and learning intervals according to their own time frame , fiebig explained .
of course that means the illiterate sitting at home in front of the computer requires a good deal of self-discipline .
for this reason fiebig and his colleagues strongly encourage the e-learning participants to take a parallel classroom course .
to encourage learning and motivate the often frustrated participants , the apoll project also offers telephone advice and provides a forum for learners to communicate with one another via voicemail .
adult learners according to fiebig , working with the computer and internet is not a problem for the majority of illiterates .
" the computer and especially the internet are new types of media , and our target audience is very open to them . "
a study conducted recently showed that one-third of all illiterates in germany have a computer and internet connections , albeit mostly for entertainment purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading a train schedule is a real challenge for germany 's illiterates the majority of literacy learners are adults , equally divided between men and women .
most of them are between 30 and 45 years old , said fiebig .
once they reach their mid-adult years , " the difficulties and suffering connected to illiteracy become so significant , that illiterates no longer advance at work or are unable to follow what their children do in school , " said the apoll director .
" we also know that illiteracy isolates , " fiebig added - 51 percent of the target learners are singles .
expanding the literacy program in the long term , apoll hopes to expand their e-learning programs for foreigners living in germany , who never learned to read and write in their native language , let alone german .
because illiteracy is a world problem , and one which is particularly acute in developing countries , the institute for international cooperation -lrb- iz -rrb- in bonn is considering exporting a computer-supported initiative to combat illiteracy in developing countries .
if created , it could be germany 's contribution to the united nation 's decade of literacy , which the organization established in 2003 .

a world leader in developing and promoting renewable energy , germany 's fostering a boom in the solar technology market . tucked away behind trees in the middle of the countryside , the leipziger land solar power plant wednesday in the eastern german village of espenhain is invisible from the road .
it ’ s only when you drive through the gate and onto the site itself that you ’ re confronted with a vast field full of 33,500 shimmering gray panels tilted towards the sun at precisely 30 degrees - the optimum angle for absorbing radiation . the espenhain site , near leipzig , was a deposit for lignite dust - a type of brown coal - and was thus contaminated and couldn ’ t be used for anything else .
the lignite had to first be buried under 30 cm -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- of earth on the 20-hectare -lrb- 49-acre -rrb- plot , before the three-and-a-half meter high sloping frames which support the panels could be set up . the high performance modules , made of monocrystalline silicon , can handle the high voltage as well as delivering a high energy yield .
each panel produces 150 watts of energy .
the plant cost € 22 million -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- to build and is capable of generating five megawatts of electricity . pioneering change germany ’ s pioneering renewable energy law , which was passed four years ago and amended in april this year , decrees that any electricity producer - including private individuals - get paid for the amount they feed into the national grid .
this has encouraged thousands of people to install solar panels on their houses . it would be impossible to realize a project on the scale of the new plant without that kind of guarantee , according to annett fruehling , a project engineer for berlin-based firm geosol , which was responsible for the plant 's planning and development .
shell solar and siemens provided the equipment and technology . " we get a certain amount , a fixed price for the electricity we produce here , and this price is fixed for the next 20 years .
no bank would give you the money for a plant like this without any security on the other side , " fruehling told dw-radio .
" we can meet the electricity demand of 1,800 households , and , on the other hand , we save about 3,700 tons annually in -lrb- carbon dioxide emissions -rrb- . " " ideal for developing world " geosol is planning another solar plant in borna , not far from espenhain , fruehling said .
but the technology should n't be limited to the developed world , ronald uppmann , press officer of the german solar industry association solar e.v. , said .
due to the ease and speed with which solar modules can be installed , this type of clean energy is ideal for use in developing countries , uppmann said . " in wind energy and in photovoltaics and in solar thermal technologies germany is one of the leading nations in the world , uppmann said .
" it is very easy and very useful to export the technology .
so if you think of families that live in the jungle of brazil , they are not supplied with electricity at all , -lrb- but now -rrb- they have the possibility to put a little solar power plant on the rooftop and so they get the possibility to use light , they get the possibility to warm their water . " in the six years that chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats and environmentally-friendly greens has been in office , the amount of electricity generated in germany by renewable energy sources - as opposed to fossil and nuclear fuel - has more than doubled , from 4 to 9 percent .

a world leader in developing and promoting renewable energy , germany 's fostering a boom in the solar technology market . tucked away behind trees in the middle of the countryside , the leipziger land solar power plant wednesday in the eastern german village of espenhain is invisible from the road .
it ’ s only when you drive through the gate and onto the site itself that you ’ re confronted with a vast field full of 33,500 shimmering gray panels tilted towards the sun at precisely 30 degrees - the optimum angle for absorbing radiation . the espenhain site , near leipzig , was a deposit for lignite dust - a type of brown coal - and was thus contaminated and couldn ’ t be used for anything else .
the lignite had to first be buried under 30 cm -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- of earth on the 20-hectare -lrb- 49-acre -rrb- plot , before the three-and-a-half meter high sloping frames which support the panels could be set up . the high performance modules , made of monocrystalline silicon , can handle the high voltage as well as delivering a high energy yield .
each panel produces 150 watts of energy .
the plant cost € 22 million -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- to build and is capable of generating five megawatts of electricity . pioneering change germany ’ s pioneering renewable energy law , which was passed four years ago and amended in april this year , decrees that any electricity producer - including private individuals - get paid for the amount they feed into the national grid .

after more than 40 years in which they kept west berlin safe from the looming soviet threat , the final 2,000 soldiers pulled out of berlin on sept .
8 , 1994 .
soldiers , both from the us and the former soviet union , were no longer needed in the reunified city and the americans either went home or to still-existent bases in southern germany . before they left , 75,000 berliners lined the route upon which the us forces would parade for the last time .
they cheered the soldiers and a bundeswehr battalion was on hand to salute the outgoing troops . the decades together in berlin , the last bastion of west germany in the middle of the gdr , had sparked a special relationship between americans and west berliners .
at the latest , the love affair began in 1948 when the soviet union tried to hermetically seal off west berlin and force france , great britain and the u.s. to give up on the city . berlin airlift seals love affair the us responded by flying in humanitarian aid to tempelhof airport .
the so-called " raisin bombers " brought in desperately-needed supplies , flying their way into the hearts of the west berliners in the process . " above all , we learned what solidarity in the most dire emergency means , " former mayor eberhard diepgen remembered .
" the desire for freedom on the part of the berliners convinced the western world of germany 's will never to live under tyrants again . " the soviet union eventually gave up its attempt on grabbing west berlin .
the allied troops stayed , dividing up the divided city into three different sectors .
they did the same in the rest of germany in an effort to protect the country both from the ussr and itself , according to foreign policy scholar ingo peters . " stationing the troops was important , as a sort of insurance , so that what happened here , germany would n't do again , " peters told deutsche welle . germany 's new role in the world after reunification , allied soldiers were no longer needed .
upon their departure from the eventual german capital , chancellor helmut kohl told the troops that germany had learned by their example . " you can rely on us .
germany will never stand aside when peace and freedom are at stake in the world , " kohl said . german foreign policy has made good on that promise .
the country has come a long way from a policy of non-intervention under the protection of allied troops .
beginning with peacekeeping missions in bosnia after the bosnian war in the early 1990s , germany took part in nato military action against serbia in 1999 and has thousands of troops stationed in nato and un peacekeeping missions , including afghanistan , today . american troops remain in germany , in southern cities like landstuhl , rammstein and kaiserslautern .
but given recent announcements by the us military to move troops out of germany , those , too , may close one day .
but they most likely wo n't get the same send-off . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop pullout to hit local german economies the impact of us plans to pull some 70,000 troops out of europe and asia is likely to be felt most acutely in germany - especially in smaller towns whose economies depend on the us presence .

the friendly in berlin will be all about germany 's future not its past . germany 's new national team chief jürgen klinsmann pits his fledgling coaching skills against the world champions brazil on wednesday night in his first real test as head of the country 's soccer stars . and the former germany striker is optimistic his fully fit and highly motivated side can build on the 3-1 success over austria in his first game to wipe away the still painful memories of the 2-0 defeat at the hands of the brazilians in the 2002 world cup final . " a coach could n't wish for a better opportunity , " beamed klinsmann at the pre-match press conference on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.09.2004 russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says it reserves the right to pre-emptively hit terror bases in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases . " russia 's top general said his country was ready to attack " terrorist bases " anywhere in the caucasus , central asia and other areas near russia .
according to russian news agencies , chief of staff general yuri baluyevsky threatened pre-emptive strikes against organizations harboring terrorists .
" our position on pre-emptive strikes has been stated before , but i will repeat it .
we will take steps to liquidate terrorist bases in any region of the world , " he said after talks with us general james jones , nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
baluyevsky admitted that " military steps are an extreme measure in the fight against terrorism , " and said his country would not revert to the use of the country 's massive nuclear arsenal .
" this does not mean that we will resort to the use of nuclear force , " he said in a statement that has perplexed many european observers .
a first for moscow ?
embroiled in a five-year guerrilla war in rebel chechnya , moscow has frequently staged attacks against the break-away province , but outside its own borders russia has been hesitant to carry out pre-emptive strikes against terrorists .
so far it has only dropped a few bombs on the panskisi gorge in neighboring georgia , where it suspects chechen rebels are hiding and training .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces soldiers take position at the seized school in beslan , north ossetia , friday , sept .
3 , 2004 .
it is therefore all the more surprising that baluyevsky would make such statements , especially since president vladimir putin has not made any comments along the same lines since the hostage-taking crisis in a school in the russian province of north ossetia shocked the country and world a week ago .
a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner emma udwin said the threats would have more weight if coming from the russian president .
" i would pay more attention if it had come from putin , " she said when asked about baluyevsky 's remarks .
kremlin adopts us policy ?
the european commission 's chief spokesman , reijo kemppinen , also dismissed the comments , saying instead : " i think i 've heard that kind of statement before .
not from russia though . "
western analysts said wednesday 's remarks from chief of staff yuri baluyvsky carried echoes of the us doctrine in the " war on terror " of countering threats by launching first strikes , instead of waiting to be attacked .
on the other hand , russia 's sharply limited reach means the general 's warning would apply in practice to former soviet republics in the caucasus and central asia which moscow still regards as its sphere of influence .
" in practice this doctrine can only apply to the countries adjacent to russia which are not part of a global alliance , " jonathan eyal , russia analyst at the royal united services institute in london , told reuters wire service .
us-russian cooperation the chief of staff 's statements came during the first visit to russia by nato 's top commander .
jones , who stressed the two former cold war foes had entered a new friendly relationship since the september 11 attacks in the united states , said the bond between washington and moscow had grown even stronger after the seizing of the school in the town of beslan by terrorists .
" we face common threats and common challenges , " jones said .
" we are entering a period of heightened cooperation against these threats and this is very , very important . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tv grab from russian ntv showing a terrorist standing guard over hostages inside the school gymnasium in beslan , north ossetia .
the footage was shot by one of the terrorists .
at least 336 civilians , including hundreds of children , died in the three-day school siege in the north ossetian province which borders chechnya .
the american general referred to the hostage-taking as an " insidious attack . "
just like before the launch of the us-led strike against afghanistan that russia backed in october 2001 as a retaliation for the september 11 attacks staged by the afghan-based al qaeda terror network , the two generals said the beslan attack should redouble the two sides ' efforts to fight terror .
" today international terrorism has become an international force , and only through joint action -lrb- with nato -rrb- can we fight this scourge , " baluyevsky said .
the russian general added that the two sides agreed to exchange information on terror cells around the world and to coordinate a rapid response team to fight them . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : russia needs international solidarity official versions of the hostage drama in north ossetia and the true events on the ground are widely divergent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.09.2004 russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says it reserves the right to pre-emptively hit terror bases in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases . " russia 's top general said his country was ready to attack " terrorist bases " anywhere in the caucasus , central asia and other areas near russia .
according to russian news agencies , chief of staff general yuri baluyevsky threatened pre-emptive strikes against organizations harboring terrorists .
" our position on pre-emptive strikes has been stated before , but i will repeat it .
we will take steps to liquidate terrorist bases in any region of the world , " he said after talks with us general james jones , nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
baluyevsky admitted that " military steps are an extreme measure in the fight against terrorism , " and said his country would not revert to the use of the country 's massive nuclear arsenal .
" this does not mean that we will resort to the use of nuclear force , " he said in a statement that has perplexed many european observers .
a first for moscow ?
embroiled in a five-year guerrilla war in rebel chechnya , moscow has frequently staged attacks against the break-away province , but outside its own borders russia has been hesitant to carry out pre-emptive strikes against terrorists .
so far it has only dropped a few bombs on the panskisi gorge in neighboring georgia , where it suspects chechen rebels are hiding and training .

3 , 2004 .
it is therefore all the more surprising that baluyevsky would make such statements , especially since president vladimir putin has not made any comments along the same lines since the hostage-taking crisis in a school in the russian province of north ossetia shocked the country and world a week ago .
a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner emma udwin said the threats would have more weight if coming from the russian president .
" i would pay more attention if it had come from putin , " she said when asked about baluyevsky 's remarks .
kremlin adopts us policy ?
the european commission 's chief spokesman , reijo kemppinen , also dismissed the comments , saying instead : " i think i 've heard that kind of statement before .
not from russia though . "
western analysts said wednesday 's remarks from chief of staff yuri baluyvsky carried echoes of the us doctrine in the " war on terror " of countering threats by launching first strikes , instead of waiting to be attacked .
on the other hand , russia 's sharply limited reach means the general 's warning would apply in practice to former soviet republics in the caucasus and central asia which moscow still regards as its sphere of influence .
" in practice this doctrine can only apply to the countries adjacent to russia which are not part of a global alliance , " jonathan eyal , russia analyst at the royal united services institute in london , told reuters wire service .
us-russian cooperation the chief of staff 's statements came during the first visit to russia by nato 's top commander .
jones , who stressed the two former cold war foes had entered a new friendly relationship since the september 11 attacks in the united states , said the bond between washington and moscow had grown even stronger after the seizing of the school in the town of beslan by terrorists .
" we face common threats and common challenges , " jones said .
" we are entering a period of heightened cooperation against these threats and this is very , very important . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tv grab from russian ntv showing a terrorist standing guard over hostages inside the school gymnasium in beslan , north ossetia .
the footage was shot by one of the terrorists .
at least 336 civilians , including hundreds of children , died in the three-day school siege in the north ossetian province which borders chechnya .
the american general referred to the hostage-taking as an " insidious attack . "
just like before the launch of the us-led strike against afghanistan that russia backed in october 2001 as a retaliation for the september 11 attacks staged by the afghan-based al qaeda terror network , the two generals said the beslan attack should redouble the two sides ' efforts to fight terror .
" today international terrorism has become an international force , and only through joint action -lrb- with nato -rrb- can we fight this scourge , " baluyevsky said .
the russian general added that the two sides agreed to exchange information on terror cells around the world and to coordinate a rapid response team to fight them . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : russia needs international solidarity official versions of the hostage drama in north ossetia and the true events on the ground are widely divergent .

nato troops are expected to provide the much needed security for the historic event , but experts worry the alliance may be ill prepared for the job . when the more than 10 million eligible afghans go to the polls on oct .
9 , some 10,000 nato soldiers will be guaranteeing their safety .
in order to do so , the military alliance will have had to double its contingent from the 5,000 troops currently stationed in the country .
that increase in size corresponds to the pledge made to afghan president hamid karsai by the north atlantic alliance during the istanbul summit in june .
after a lengthy internal tug-of-war , the member states had agreed to boost their presence in the country in order to help ensure that the historical first elections take place peacefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurokorps troops head to afghanistan in aug .
2004 .
they will be part of the expanded nato security force .
" the nato contingent in afghanistan will be significantly strengthened in time for the elections , " announced the military alliance 's spokeswoman simone de manso .
the deployment is already underway and should be completed in time for the elections , she added .
" the additional troops will consist of an italian and a spanish battalion as well as a us reserve battalion stationed outside afghanistan , " said manso .
according to nato plans , the new troops are not intended as a permanent expansion of the current military presence in the country .
although the troops are only there to secure the election , " manso said they will " remain in afghanistan for as long as the local commander deems it necessary . "
false priorities despite the commitment to security , not everyone is convinced nato is approaching the elections realistically .
" i regard the whole situation as a mid-size farce , " argued albert stahel , professor for strategic military studies at the technical university in zurich .
the international community has set false priorities and is placing itself under unnecessary time pressure , stahel told dw-world .
" the elections are coming light years too early , as afghanistan is no where close to being mature enough for democracy , " he maintained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should rebuilding aghanistan take priority over elections ?
" rather than focusing on preparing for an election , -lrb- the international community -rrb- should be working to rebuild the country , for instance concentrating on the infrastructure and the water resources , " he said .
an election could be held once the much more crucial reconstruction work is completed - in a couple of years , stahel added .
the swiss expert also warned of placing too much faith in the elections .
" of course it will not be an election according to western democratic standards , " he said .
and in order to guarantee that the elections throughout the country take place freely and peacefully , a much larger military presence will be necessary .
" if one wanted to ensure that the election takes place more or less orderly , that can not be done with just 10,000 soldiers , " he stressed .
at the same time , though , the election can not be postponed , admitted stahel .
the international community can not change the timeframe with such short notice .
" if the election date is pushed back , the united nations , nato and the united states would risk losing face and the population in afghanistan would not go along with it either .

a world leader in developing and promoting renewable energy , germany 's fostering a boom in the solar technology market . tucked away behind trees in the middle of the countryside , the leipziger land solar power plant wednesday in the eastern german village of espenhain is invisible from the road .
it ’ s only when you drive through the gate and onto the site itself that you ’ re confronted with a vast field full of 33,500 shimmering gray panels tilted towards the sun at precisely 30 degrees - the optimum angle for absorbing radiation . the espenhain site , near leipzig , was a deposit for lignite dust - a type of brown coal - and was thus contaminated and couldn ’ t be used for anything else .
the lignite had to first be buried under 30 cm -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- of earth on the 20-hectare -lrb- 49-acre -rrb- plot , before the three-and-a-half meter high sloping frames which support the panels could be set up . the high performance modules , made of monocrystalline silicon , can handle the high voltage as well as delivering a high energy yield .
each panel produces 150 watts of energy .
the plant cost € 22 million -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- to build and is capable of generating five megawatts of electricity . pioneering change germany ’ s pioneering renewable energy law , which was passed four years ago and amended in april this year , decrees that any electricity producer - including private individuals - get paid for the amount they feed into the national grid .
this has encouraged thousands of people to install solar panels on their houses . it would be impossible to realize a project on the scale of the new plant without that kind of guarantee , according to annett fruehling , a project engineer for berlin-based firm geosol , which was responsible for the plant 's planning and development .
shell solar and siemens provided the equipment and technology . " we get a certain amount , a fixed price for the electricity we produce here , and this price is fixed for the next 20 years .
no bank would give you the money for a plant like this without any security on the other side , " fruehling told dw-radio .
" we can meet the electricity demand of 1,800 households , and , on the other hand , we save about 3,700 tons annually in -lrb- carbon dioxide emissions -rrb- . " " ideal for developing world " geosol is planning another solar plant in borna , not far from espenhain , fruehling said .
but the technology should n't be limited to the developed world , ronald uppmann , press officer of the german solar industry association solar e.v. , said .
due to the ease and speed with which solar modules can be installed , this type of clean energy is ideal for use in developing countries , uppmann said . " in wind energy and in photovoltaics and in solar thermal technologies germany is one of the leading nations in the world , uppmann said .
" it is very easy and very useful to export the technology .
so if you think of families that live in the jungle of brazil , they are not supplied with electricity at all , -lrb- but now -rrb- they have the possibility to put a little solar power plant on the rooftop and so they get the possibility to use light , they get the possibility to warm their water . " in the six years that chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats and environmentally-friendly greens has been in office , the amount of electricity generated in germany by renewable energy sources - as opposed to fossil and nuclear fuel - has more than doubled , from 4 to 9 percent .

a world leader in developing and promoting renewable energy , germany 's fostering a boom in the solar technology market . tucked away behind trees in the middle of the countryside , the leipziger land solar power plant wednesday in the eastern german village of espenhain is invisible from the road .
it ’ s only when you drive through the gate and onto the site itself that you ’ re confronted with a vast field full of 33,500 shimmering gray panels tilted towards the sun at precisely 30 degrees - the optimum angle for absorbing radiation . the espenhain site , near leipzig , was a deposit for lignite dust - a type of brown coal - and was thus contaminated and couldn ’ t be used for anything else .
the lignite had to first be buried under 30 cm -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- of earth on the 20-hectare -lrb- 49-acre -rrb- plot , before the three-and-a-half meter high sloping frames which support the panels could be set up . the high performance modules , made of monocrystalline silicon , can handle the high voltage as well as delivering a high energy yield .
each panel produces 150 watts of energy .
the plant cost € 22 million -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- to build and is capable of generating five megawatts of electricity . pioneering change germany ’ s pioneering renewable energy law , which was passed four years ago and amended in april this year , decrees that any electricity producer - including private individuals - get paid for the amount they feed into the national grid .
this has encouraged thousands of people to install solar panels on their houses . it would be impossible to realize a project on the scale of the new plant without that kind of guarantee , according to annett fruehling , a project engineer for berlin-based firm geosol , which was responsible for the plant 's planning and development .
shell solar and siemens provided the equipment and technology . " we get a certain amount , a fixed price for the electricity we produce here , and this price is fixed for the next 20 years .
no bank would give you the money for a plant like this without any security on the other side , " fruehling told dw-radio .
" we can meet the electricity demand of 1,800 households , and , on the other hand , we save about 3,700 tons annually in -lrb- carbon dioxide emissions -rrb- . " " ideal for developing world " geosol is planning another solar plant in borna , not far from espenhain , fruehling said .
but the technology should n't be limited to the developed world , ronald uppmann , press officer of the german solar industry association solar e.v. , said .
due to the ease and speed with which solar modules can be installed , this type of clean energy is ideal for use in developing countries , uppmann said . " in wind energy and in photovoltaics and in solar thermal technologies germany is one of the leading nations in the world , uppmann said .
" it is very easy and very useful to export the technology .
so if you think of families that live in the jungle of brazil , they are not supplied with electricity at all , -lrb- but now -rrb- they have the possibility to put a little solar power plant on the rooftop and so they get the possibility to use light , they get the possibility to warm their water . " in the six years that chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats and environmentally-friendly greens has been in office , the amount of electricity generated in germany by renewable energy sources - as opposed to fossil and nuclear fuel - has more than doubled , from 4 to 9 percent .
by supporting projects such as the leipziger land solar power plant , the government aims to increase this share still further - to 20 percent in 2020 , and 50 percent by 2050 . charlotte collins -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no " green " medals for athens greece promised to make athens 2004 the greenest olympics ever , but environmental groups have already given the athens olympic organizing committee -lrb- athoc -rrb- failing grades when it comes to protecting nature .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.09.2004 germany opens world 's biggest solar plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy for 1,800 households the world ’ s biggest solar power plant was inaugurated in the german town of espenhain wednesday .
a world leader in developing and promoting renewable energy , germany 's fostering a boom in the solar technology market . tucked away behind trees in the middle of the countryside , the leipziger land solar power plant wednesday in the eastern german village of espenhain is invisible from the road .
it ’ s only when you drive through the gate and onto the site itself that you ’ re confronted with a vast field full of 33,500 shimmering gray panels tilted towards the sun at precisely 30 degrees - the optimum angle for absorbing radiation . the espenhain site , near leipzig , was a deposit for lignite dust - a type of brown coal - and was thus contaminated and couldn ’ t be used for anything else .
the lignite had to first be buried under 30 cm -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- of earth on the 20-hectare -lrb- 49-acre -rrb- plot , before the three-and-a-half meter high sloping frames which support the panels could be set up . the high performance modules , made of monocrystalline silicon , can handle the high voltage as well as delivering a high energy yield .
each panel produces 150 watts of energy .
the plant cost € 22 million -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- to build and is capable of generating five megawatts of electricity . pioneering change germany ’ s pioneering renewable energy law , which was passed four years ago and amended in april this year , decrees that any electricity producer - including private individuals - get paid for the amount they feed into the national grid .
this has encouraged thousands of people to install solar panels on their houses . it would be impossible to realize a project on the scale of the new plant without that kind of guarantee , according to annett fruehling , a project engineer for berlin-based firm geosol , which was responsible for the plant 's planning and development .
shell solar and siemens provided the equipment and technology . " we get a certain amount , a fixed price for the electricity we produce here , and this price is fixed for the next 20 years .
no bank would give you the money for a plant like this without any security on the other side , " fruehling told dw-radio .
" we can meet the electricity demand of 1,800 households , and , on the other hand , we save about 3,700 tons annually in -lrb- carbon dioxide emissions -rrb- . " " ideal for developing world " geosol is planning another solar plant in borna , not far from espenhain , fruehling said .
but the technology should n't be limited to the developed world , ronald uppmann , press officer of the german solar industry association solar e.v. , said .
due to the ease and speed with which solar modules can be installed , this type of clean energy is ideal for use in developing countries , uppmann said . " in wind energy and in photovoltaics and in solar thermal technologies germany is one of the leading nations in the world , uppmann said .
" it is very easy and very useful to export the technology .
so if you think of families that live in the jungle of brazil , they are not supplied with electricity at all , -lrb- but now -rrb- they have the possibility to put a little solar power plant on the rooftop and so they get the possibility to use light , they get the possibility to warm their water . " in the six years that chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats and environmentally-friendly greens has been in office , the amount of electricity generated in germany by renewable energy sources - as opposed to fossil and nuclear fuel - has more than doubled , from 4 to 9 percent .
by supporting projects such as the leipziger land solar power plant , the government aims to increase this share still further - to 20 percent in 2020 , and 50 percent by 2050 . charlotte collins -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no " green " medals for athens greece promised to make athens 2004 the greenest olympics ever , but environmental groups have already given the athens olympic organizing committee -lrb- athoc -rrb- failing grades when it comes to protecting nature .

nato troops are expected to provide the much needed security for the historic event , but experts worry the alliance may be ill prepared for the job . when the more than 10 million eligible afghans go to the polls on oct .
9 , some 10,000 nato soldiers will be guaranteeing their safety .
in order to do so , the military alliance will have had to double its contingent from the 5,000 troops currently stationed in the country .
that increase in size corresponds to the pledge made to afghan president hamid karsai by the north atlantic alliance during the istanbul summit in june .
after a lengthy internal tug-of-war , the member states had agreed to boost their presence in the country in order to help ensure that the historical first elections take place peacefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurokorps troops head to afghanistan in aug .
2004 .
they will be part of the expanded nato security force .
" the nato contingent in afghanistan will be significantly strengthened in time for the elections , " announced the military alliance 's spokeswoman simone de manso .
the deployment is already underway and should be completed in time for the elections , she added .
" the additional troops will consist of an italian and a spanish battalion as well as a us reserve battalion stationed outside afghanistan , " said manso .
according to nato plans , the new troops are not intended as a permanent expansion of the current military presence in the country .
although the troops are only there to secure the election , " manso said they will " remain in afghanistan for as long as the local commander deems it necessary . "
false priorities despite the commitment to security , not everyone is convinced nato is approaching the elections realistically .
" i regard the whole situation as a mid-size farce , " argued albert stahel , professor for strategic military studies at the technical university in zurich .
the international community has set false priorities and is placing itself under unnecessary time pressure , stahel told dw-world .
" the elections are coming light years too early , as afghanistan is no where close to being mature enough for democracy , " he maintained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should rebuilding aghanistan take priority over elections ?
" rather than focusing on preparing for an election , -lrb- the international community -rrb- should be working to rebuild the country , for instance concentrating on the infrastructure and the water resources , " he said .
an election could be held once the much more crucial reconstruction work is completed - in a couple of years , stahel added .
the swiss expert also warned of placing too much faith in the elections .
" of course it will not be an election according to western democratic standards , " he said .
and in order to guarantee that the elections throughout the country take place freely and peacefully , a much larger military presence will be necessary .
" if one wanted to ensure that the election takes place more or less orderly , that can not be done with just 10,000 soldiers , " he stressed .
at the same time , though , the election can not be postponed , admitted stahel .
the international community can not change the timeframe with such short notice .
" if the election date is pushed back , the united nations , nato and the united states would risk losing face and the population in afghanistan would not go along with it either .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.09.2004 the computer as reading instructor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning the abcs with the pc although they ca n't read and write , that does n't mean illiterates ca n't learn .
but many are too ashamed to take a course .
that 's why a new german initiative offers instruction over the internet . some four million people in germany are illiterate .
even though they went to school , they never learned to read or write properly .
for most of them - adults who have gotten through life with a series of complex compensation strategies - admitting illiteracy is a difficult hurdle to overcome .
only 20,0000 of the country 's so-called functional illiterates -lrb- excluding foreigners who never went to school -rrb- have actually taken advantage of reading courses offered by outreach programs throughout the country .
the rest are often too ashamed to admit their problem by seeking help .
in order to combat illiteracy , a new initiative is being launched in germany to teach reading and writing anonymously via the internet .
on sept .
8 , international literacy day , a special web site goes online to provide individual instruction which serves either as a complement to classroom teaching or as a primary learning source for those not enrolled in a course .
called " alfa-portal literacy learning , " or apoll for short , the site is financed by the federal ministry for education and research .
less pressure on the pc " the biggest problem for a functioning illiterate is to out oneself , to take the first step of signing up for a course , " said christian fiebig , director of the apoll project .
" through the e-learning portal , we offer the possibility of learning anonymously without having to out oneself , " he told dw-world .
in the future some 17,000 instruction exercises will be available on the site for illiterates to set up their own individual learning plan .
the only prerequisite is that the internet user recognize the address of the web site , www.ich-will-schreiben-lernen.de -lrb- in english : i want to learn to write -rrb- , and save the url as a favorite to visit over and over again .
once at the site , they will be guided through a special tutorial that reads all the instructions and texts out loud .
learning any time at any pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading is a pleasure illiterates never get to appreciate the e-learning page asks each illiterate to evaluate their own skills and then conducts a short test to determine placement within the online course .
before instruction begins , the computer program asks each participant what their goal is : whether they want to be able to read and fill out official forms and deal with bureaucracy , read books or simply improve daily life .
each literacy participant receives an individually outlined program of instruction and exercises to complete for the week .
in the early stages of instruction audio clips and little pictures assist the literacy learner .
later , short news texts and stories will be provided as practice .
the apoll program offers participants the possibility to set the pace and learning intervals according to their own time frame , fiebig explained .

only 20,0000 of the country 's so-called functional illiterates -lrb- excluding foreigners who never went to school -rrb- have actually taken advantage of reading courses offered by outreach programs throughout the country .
the rest are often too ashamed to admit their problem by seeking help .
in order to combat illiteracy , a new initiative is being launched in germany to teach reading and writing anonymously via the internet .

each literacy participant receives an individually outlined program of instruction and exercises to complete for the week .
in the early stages of instruction audio clips and little pictures assist the literacy learner .
later , short news texts and stories will be provided as practice .
the apoll program offers participants the possibility to set the pace and learning intervals according to their own time frame , fiebig explained .

but many are too ashamed to take a course .
that 's why a new german initiative offers instruction over the internet . some four million people in germany are illiterate .
even though they went to school , they never learned to read or write properly .
for most of them - adults who have gotten through life with a series of complex compensation strategies - admitting illiteracy is a difficult hurdle to overcome .
only 20,0000 of the country 's so-called functional illiterates -lrb- excluding foreigners who never went to school -rrb- have actually taken advantage of reading courses offered by outreach programs throughout the country .
the rest are often too ashamed to admit their problem by seeking help .
in order to combat illiteracy , a new initiative is being launched in germany to teach reading and writing anonymously via the internet .
on sept .

called " alfa-portal literacy learning , " or apoll for short , the site is financed by the federal ministry for education and research .
less pressure on the pc " the biggest problem for a functioning illiterate is to out oneself , to take the first step of signing up for a course , " said christian fiebig , director of the apoll project .
" through the e-learning portal , we offer the possibility of learning anonymously without having to out oneself , " he told dw-world .
in the future some 17,000 instruction exercises will be available on the site for illiterates to set up their own individual learning plan .
the only prerequisite is that the internet user recognize the address of the web site , www.ich-will-schreiben-lernen.de -lrb- in english : i want to learn to write -rrb- , and save the url as a favorite to visit over and over again .

each literacy participant receives an individually outlined program of instruction and exercises to complete for the week .
in the early stages of instruction audio clips and little pictures assist the literacy learner .
later , short news texts and stories will be provided as practice .
the apoll program offers participants the possibility to set the pace and learning intervals according to their own time frame , fiebig explained .
of course that means the illiterate sitting at home in front of the computer requires a good deal of self-discipline .
for this reason fiebig and his colleagues strongly encourage the e-learning participants to take a parallel classroom course .
to encourage learning and motivate the often frustrated participants , the apoll project also offers telephone advice and provides a forum for learners to communicate with one another via voicemail .
adult learners according to fiebig , working with the computer and internet is not a problem for the majority of illiterates .
" the computer and especially the internet are new types of media , and our target audience is very open to them . "

" we also know that illiteracy isolates , " fiebig added - 51 percent of the target learners are singles .
expanding the literacy program in the long term , apoll hopes to expand their e-learning programs for foreigners living in germany , who never learned to read and write in their native language , let alone german .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.09.2004 rocking in german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 2raumwohnung " are making german lyrics popular again young german musicians are opting to sing in their native tongue .
in both style and spirit , many resemble their predecessors of the " neue deutsche welle " -lrb- german new wave -rrb- , which rocked out german-style in the eighties . instead of cranking out cookie-cutter pop hits in english that currently dominate germany 's airwaves , a growing number of young germans are choosing to sing auf deutsch .
they are picking up on the tradition of acts such as nena , trio and falco - who helped make music with german lyrics in the late 1970s and early 1980s popular . deutsche welle interviewed the members of " 2raumwohnung , " inga humpe and tommie eckart , who along with bands like " wir sind helden " are launching the second wave . the name " 2raumwohnung " -lrb- 2-room apartment -rrb- has a lot of symbolic meaning related to german history .
how would you explain the name to your fans abroad ? tommi : the name originally comes from the fact that we 're two people and this is a two person project .
but then , of course , there 's this funny situation : due to the wall and the division between east and west , the language was also divided .
now , 15 years after the fall of the wall , there are still differences , and germans from the east and west have different ways of describing a two-room apartment because they prefer to use different words for room : " zimmer " in the west and " raum " in the east .
we took this linguistic anomaly to be a synonym for berlin , and since we are from the west we incorporated the " raum " into our name to represent a kind of connection . what is your relationship to the german language like ?
foreigners often describe the language as hard , but in your music you make it sound light and soft . inga : that 's true .
after i sing in german , i also think the language is quite hard .
we take great pains to make it sound softer .
but we also have a bit of experience singing in english .
now we have decided to record some of our songs in english , like " sexy girl " and " spiel mit , " which is on the premium version of our cd .
and just yesterday , we recorded an english version of " wir sind anderen . " i recently heard from toni kater , a berlin musician who is on the same label , that when she first met both of you , she identified your band with the " berlin scene . "
do you identify with any " scene " at all , and to what extent is your music tied to the city of berlin ? inga : with the " scene " no , but definitely with the city .
there are so many " scenes " in berlin , but the city is an important source of inspiration for us .
without berlin , we probably would n't exist .
berlin is so big and multi-faceted , and there 's so much freedom here that many different varieties of music can develop .
it 's nice , i think , to be connected to the soul of this city .
i will always be in love with berlin . when you write your songs , do you have a specific public in mind ? tommi : we try to make the kind of music we would enjoy and compose songs we would want to listen to , even if we were n't writing it ourselves .
that 's also how we approached the new album : even if we had n't made it ourselves , would we want to listen to it ?
at least this is what we always try and do .
we do n't have a particular person or listener in mind .
we simply make music for ourselves and for our friends .
i think our fans are not so different than we are . from which musical genre does " 2raumwohnung " draw inspiration ? tommi : we try to draw upon everything we like .
we are just as inspired by air and madonna as by miss kittin and märtini brös .
even older music , like kraftwerk and music from the ' 70s , has influenced us . what are you listening to at the moment ? tommi : i am listening to lots of air at the moment , and i love phoenix .
i guess i listen to other things too , like chet baker … the german press recently accused you of being too optimistic and not political enough .
do you have a response to them ?
and why are you so optimistic ? tommi : first of all , i think it is very important to be optimistic .
when we make music , we are simply in a good mood and people can tell .
but i also do n't agree that our music is not political .
when someone takes their own feelings seriously and shares it with other people , then it is perhaps not - strictly speaking - political , but it certainly has a greater meaning for society . inga : it was a very deliberate decision to be optimistic and to remain optimistic .
i think it 's not the best choice - just because the times are hard - to whine and complain along with everyone else .
instead , people should ask themselves what they can do to make things better for themselves and for everyone others .
i think positive thinking is the basis of that .
and besides , i do n't really understand why the germans complain so much - things are n't really that bad . do you plan on touring abroad ? inga : yes , lots .
we are always getting offers from brazil and mexico . tommi : sadly , it has n't worked out in brazil .
but we 've already played in russia and in japan and we have plans for concerts in spain and turkey . look for " 2raumwohnung " and other representatives of the new " german wave " at a venue near you soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy .

they are picking up on the tradition of acts such as nena , trio and falco - who helped make music with german lyrics in the late 1970s and early 1980s popular . deutsche welle interviewed the members of " 2raumwohnung , " inga humpe and tommie eckart , who along with bands like " wir sind helden " are launching the second wave . the name " 2raumwohnung " -lrb- 2-room apartment -rrb- has a lot of symbolic meaning related to german history .
how would you explain the name to your fans abroad ? tommi : the name originally comes from the fact that we 're two people and this is a two person project .
but then , of course , there 's this funny situation : due to the wall and the division between east and west , the language was also divided .
now , 15 years after the fall of the wall , there are still differences , and germans from the east and west have different ways of describing a two-room apartment because they prefer to use different words for room : " zimmer " in the west and " raum " in the east .
we took this linguistic anomaly to be a synonym for berlin , and since we are from the west we incorporated the " raum " into our name to represent a kind of connection . what is your relationship to the german language like ?
foreigners often describe the language as hard , but in your music you make it sound light and soft . inga : that 's true .
after i sing in german , i also think the language is quite hard .
we take great pains to make it sound softer .
but we also have a bit of experience singing in english .
now we have decided to record some of our songs in english , like " sexy girl " and " spiel mit , " which is on the premium version of our cd .
and just yesterday , we recorded an english version of " wir sind anderen . " i recently heard from toni kater , a berlin musician who is on the same label , that when she first met both of you , she identified your band with the " berlin scene . "
do you identify with any " scene " at all , and to what extent is your music tied to the city of berlin ? inga : with the " scene " no , but definitely with the city .
there are so many " scenes " in berlin , but the city is an important source of inspiration for us .
without berlin , we probably would n't exist .
berlin is so big and multi-faceted , and there 's so much freedom here that many different varieties of music can develop .
it 's nice , i think , to be connected to the soul of this city .
i will always be in love with berlin . when you write your songs , do you have a specific public in mind ? tommi : we try to make the kind of music we would enjoy and compose songs we would want to listen to , even if we were n't writing it ourselves .
that 's also how we approached the new album : even if we had n't made it ourselves , would we want to listen to it ?
at least this is what we always try and do .
we do n't have a particular person or listener in mind .
we simply make music for ourselves and for our friends .
i think our fans are not so different than we are . from which musical genre does " 2raumwohnung " draw inspiration ? tommi : we try to draw upon everything we like .
we are just as inspired by air and madonna as by miss kittin and märtini brös .
even older music , like kraftwerk and music from the ' 70s , has influenced us . what are you listening to at the moment ? tommi : i am listening to lots of air at the moment , and i love phoenix .
i guess i listen to other things too , like chet baker … the german press recently accused you of being too optimistic and not political enough .
do you have a response to them ?
and why are you so optimistic ? tommi : first of all , i think it is very important to be optimistic .
when we make music , we are simply in a good mood and people can tell .
but i also do n't agree that our music is not political .
when someone takes their own feelings seriously and shares it with other people , then it is perhaps not - strictly speaking - political , but it certainly has a greater meaning for society . inga : it was a very deliberate decision to be optimistic and to remain optimistic .
i think it 's not the best choice - just because the times are hard - to whine and complain along with everyone else .
instead , people should ask themselves what they can do to make things better for themselves and for everyone others .
i think positive thinking is the basis of that .
and besides , i do n't really understand why the germans complain so much - things are n't really that bad . do you plan on touring abroad ? inga : yes , lots .
we are always getting offers from brazil and mexico . tommi : sadly , it has n't worked out in brazil .
but we 've already played in russia and in japan and we have plans for concerts in spain and turkey . look for " 2raumwohnung " and other representatives of the new " german wave " at a venue near you soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy .

in both style and spirit , many resemble their predecessors of the " neue deutsche welle " -lrb- german new wave -rrb- , which rocked out german-style in the eighties . instead of cranking out cookie-cutter pop hits in english that currently dominate germany 's airwaves , a growing number of young germans are choosing to sing auf deutsch .
they are picking up on the tradition of acts such as nena , trio and falco - who helped make music with german lyrics in the late 1970s and early 1980s popular . deutsche welle interviewed the members of " 2raumwohnung , " inga humpe and tommie eckart , who along with bands like " wir sind helden " are launching the second wave . the name " 2raumwohnung " -lrb- 2-room apartment -rrb- has a lot of symbolic meaning related to german history .
how would you explain the name to your fans abroad ? tommi : the name originally comes from the fact that we 're two people and this is a two person project .
but then , of course , there 's this funny situation : due to the wall and the division between east and west , the language was also divided .
now , 15 years after the fall of the wall , there are still differences , and germans from the east and west have different ways of describing a two-room apartment because they prefer to use different words for room : " zimmer " in the west and " raum " in the east .
we took this linguistic anomaly to be a synonym for berlin , and since we are from the west we incorporated the " raum " into our name to represent a kind of connection . what is your relationship to the german language like ?
foreigners often describe the language as hard , but in your music you make it sound light and soft . inga : that 's true .
after i sing in german , i also think the language is quite hard .
we take great pains to make it sound softer .
but we also have a bit of experience singing in english .
now we have decided to record some of our songs in english , like " sexy girl " and " spiel mit , " which is on the premium version of our cd .
and just yesterday , we recorded an english version of " wir sind anderen . " i recently heard from toni kater , a berlin musician who is on the same label , that when she first met both of you , she identified your band with the " berlin scene . "
do you identify with any " scene " at all , and to what extent is your music tied to the city of berlin ? inga : with the " scene " no , but definitely with the city .
there are so many " scenes " in berlin , but the city is an important source of inspiration for us .
without berlin , we probably would n't exist .
berlin is so big and multi-faceted , and there 's so much freedom here that many different varieties of music can develop .
it 's nice , i think , to be connected to the soul of this city .
i will always be in love with berlin . when you write your songs , do you have a specific public in mind ? tommi : we try to make the kind of music we would enjoy and compose songs we would want to listen to , even if we were n't writing it ourselves .
that 's also how we approached the new album : even if we had n't made it ourselves , would we want to listen to it ?
at least this is what we always try and do .
we do n't have a particular person or listener in mind .
we simply make music for ourselves and for our friends .
i think our fans are not so different than we are . from which musical genre does " 2raumwohnung " draw inspiration ? tommi : we try to draw upon everything we like .
we are just as inspired by air and madonna as by miss kittin and märtini brös .
even older music , like kraftwerk and music from the ' 70s , has influenced us . what are you listening to at the moment ? tommi : i am listening to lots of air at the moment , and i love phoenix .
i guess i listen to other things too , like chet baker … the german press recently accused you of being too optimistic and not political enough .
do you have a response to them ?
and why are you so optimistic ? tommi : first of all , i think it is very important to be optimistic .
when we make music , we are simply in a good mood and people can tell .
but i also do n't agree that our music is not political .
when someone takes their own feelings seriously and shares it with other people , then it is perhaps not - strictly speaking - political , but it certainly has a greater meaning for society . inga : it was a very deliberate decision to be optimistic and to remain optimistic .
i think it 's not the best choice - just because the times are hard - to whine and complain along with everyone else .
instead , people should ask themselves what they can do to make things better for themselves and for everyone others .
i think positive thinking is the basis of that .
and besides , i do n't really understand why the germans complain so much - things are n't really that bad . do you plan on touring abroad ? inga : yes , lots .
we are always getting offers from brazil and mexico . tommi : sadly , it has n't worked out in brazil .
but we 've already played in russia and in japan and we have plans for concerts in spain and turkey . look for " 2raumwohnung " and other representatives of the new " german wave " at a venue near you soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.09.2004 learning to learn in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a long way from kabul to saxony for afghan students after years of war and unrest , coming to germany was like a dream for a group of afghan students .
they experienced a completely different type of school , learning with computers and experimenting with creativity . ahmad farhad ’ s face is scarred .
during the war , he and three of his brothers were injured , he says .
he doesn ’ t elaborate , merely stares straight ahead , smiles , and changes the topic .
this exchange , he says , is a miracle .
ahmad is 19 years old and a student at kabul ’ s amani high school .
he and 18 other teenagers came to germany about three weeks ago as part of the first german-afghan student exchange program .
on wednesday , the group flies back home , and will take many memories and new ideas with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls and boys have separate schools in afghanistan .
here a girls class in novobod .
for the 18-year-old atifa formuli , one of the group 's eight girls , the exchange proves that men and women can study and work together .
wearing a simple black suit , and flashing green eyes under her headscarf , she explains what the last three weeks have meant for her : " when we come here it means that the position of girls and boys is equal . "
in kabul , boys and girls only spend the first two school years in the same classroom .
but here , atifa says , we can talk to each other .
atifa is a student at the aishe-e-durani girls school .
both her school and amani high school are backed by the german foreign ministry and offer german language classes .
the best students in each school are chosen to travel to saxony , in eastern germany , explains 16-year-old masih ullah hamkar .
they live with host families and experience going to a german school .
long hair and earrings for masih , just seeing the other students in school was an eye-opening experience .
" boys with long hair and earrings - that was something different , " he says .
" there aren ’ t too many like that in afghanistan .
and the girls dress so differently , too , " he recalls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school in tents in novobod although it was interesting to sit in the classroom with the german students , he says he doesn ’ t think much of discipline at the schools here .
in his country , masih says , students respect their teachers .
back home , as many as 60 students crowd into one classroom and a disciplinary slap in the face is not uncommon when the teacher wants to maintain order .
all the afghan students strive for one thing : to learn , to study , so that later , they can help rebuild their country .
during their stay in germany , they were amazed at the beautiful buildings , shops , highways , trains and the green landscape .
but they were especially interested in experiencing the country 's modern teaching methods .
more than rote learning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computers are still rare in afghanistan .
here young women learn an operation system at the shirzai training academy in kandahar , afghanistan .
" it was a real surprise to see the students go to different classrooms to study , " says mohammed feisal .
the teaching methods are very advanced , with computers and all kinds of technical equipment , he remembers .
" the students can see and experience everything , not just read about things in books .
that surprised me . "
equally impressed by what she saw in the german schools , atifa says she will tell the education ministry in afghanistan how students in germany learn .
she was especially intrigued by a particular creative exercise in which all the students in a classroom listened to music and then each drew their own pictures inspired by the music .
at first she thought such a task would be difficult , but it worked , she says , and she managed to come up with ideas on her own .
a german role model ?
" i saw that every person in germany was responsible for their own acts and worked by themselves .
and because of this they have helped make their country beautiful and clean , " atifa recalls .
" when we go back , we will say to everyone that we can also make our country like this , " she pledges .
atifa 's goal , like that of her classmates , is to help rebuild her country .
in order to do that the students all plan to go on to university and get a degree .
many would even like to study in germany and hope for financial support to do so .
it does n't matter if they come from a different cultural background , atifa says : " people are people wherever they are . "
at the moment are no plans for another group of afghan students to visit germany .
and , due to the tense security situation , a visit by german students to afghanistan is not planned any time soon . silke bartlick -lrb- db / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life in afghanistan deutsche welle reporters sandra petersmann and karen fischer explore the country , from kabul to kunduz , documenting the new struggles , the daily fight for survival , the joy of afghan children who are finally back in school and the fate of refugees who have returned to their homeland .
deutsche welle & cap anamur build 32 schools in afghanistan deutsche welle and cap anamur would like to thank all of the donors who have helped make the 100 classrooms for afghanistan program a total success .
germany paves the way for education in afghanistan while the army takes on an extended military mandate in afghanistan , germany keeps up a quiet but comprehensive educational mission in the ravaged country .

they experienced a completely different type of school , learning with computers and experimenting with creativity . ahmad farhad ’ s face is scarred .
during the war , he and three of his brothers were injured , he says .
he doesn ’ t elaborate , merely stares straight ahead , smiles , and changes the topic .
this exchange , he says , is a miracle .
ahmad is 19 years old and a student at kabul ’ s amani high school .
he and 18 other teenagers came to germany about three weeks ago as part of the first german-afghan student exchange program .
on wednesday , the group flies back home , and will take many memories and new ideas with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls and boys have separate schools in afghanistan .
here a girls class in novobod .
for the 18-year-old atifa formuli , one of the group 's eight girls , the exchange proves that men and women can study and work together .
wearing a simple black suit , and flashing green eyes under her headscarf , she explains what the last three weeks have meant for her : " when we come here it means that the position of girls and boys is equal . "
in kabul , boys and girls only spend the first two school years in the same classroom .
but here , atifa says , we can talk to each other .
atifa is a student at the aishe-e-durani girls school .
both her school and amani high school are backed by the german foreign ministry and offer german language classes .
the best students in each school are chosen to travel to saxony , in eastern germany , explains 16-year-old masih ullah hamkar .
they live with host families and experience going to a german school .
long hair and earrings for masih , just seeing the other students in school was an eye-opening experience .
" boys with long hair and earrings - that was something different , " he says .
" there aren ’ t too many like that in afghanistan .
and the girls dress so differently , too , " he recalls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school in tents in novobod although it was interesting to sit in the classroom with the german students , he says he doesn ’ t think much of discipline at the schools here .
in his country , masih says , students respect their teachers .
back home , as many as 60 students crowd into one classroom and a disciplinary slap in the face is not uncommon when the teacher wants to maintain order .
all the afghan students strive for one thing : to learn , to study , so that later , they can help rebuild their country .
during their stay in germany , they were amazed at the beautiful buildings , shops , highways , trains and the green landscape .
but they were especially interested in experiencing the country 's modern teaching methods .
more than rote learning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computers are still rare in afghanistan .
here young women learn an operation system at the shirzai training academy in kandahar , afghanistan .
" it was a real surprise to see the students go to different classrooms to study , " says mohammed feisal .
the teaching methods are very advanced , with computers and all kinds of technical equipment , he remembers .
" the students can see and experience everything , not just read about things in books .
that surprised me . "
equally impressed by what she saw in the german schools , atifa says she will tell the education ministry in afghanistan how students in germany learn .
she was especially intrigued by a particular creative exercise in which all the students in a classroom listened to music and then each drew their own pictures inspired by the music .
at first she thought such a task would be difficult , but it worked , she says , and she managed to come up with ideas on her own .
a german role model ?
" i saw that every person in germany was responsible for their own acts and worked by themselves .
and because of this they have helped make their country beautiful and clean , " atifa recalls .
" when we go back , we will say to everyone that we can also make our country like this , " she pledges .
atifa 's goal , like that of her classmates , is to help rebuild her country .
in order to do that the students all plan to go on to university and get a degree .
many would even like to study in germany and hope for financial support to do so .
it does n't matter if they come from a different cultural background , atifa says : " people are people wherever they are . "
at the moment are no plans for another group of afghan students to visit germany .

during the war , he and three of his brothers were injured , he says .
he doesn ’ t elaborate , merely stares straight ahead , smiles , and changes the topic .
this exchange , he says , is a miracle .
ahmad is 19 years old and a student at kabul ’ s amani high school .
he and 18 other teenagers came to germany about three weeks ago as part of the first german-afghan student exchange program .
on wednesday , the group flies back home , and will take many memories and new ideas with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls and boys have separate schools in afghanistan .

for the 18-year-old atifa formuli , one of the group 's eight girls , the exchange proves that men and women can study and work together .
wearing a simple black suit , and flashing green eyes under her headscarf , she explains what the last three weeks have meant for her : " when we come here it means that the position of girls and boys is equal . "
in kabul , boys and girls only spend the first two school years in the same classroom .
but here , atifa says , we can talk to each other .
atifa is a student at the aishe-e-durani girls school .
both her school and amani high school are backed by the german foreign ministry and offer german language classes .

in his country , masih says , students respect their teachers .
back home , as many as 60 students crowd into one classroom and a disciplinary slap in the face is not uncommon when the teacher wants to maintain order .
all the afghan students strive for one thing : to learn , to study , so that later , they can help rebuild their country .
during their stay in germany , they were amazed at the beautiful buildings , shops , highways , trains and the green landscape .

" the students can see and experience everything , not just read about things in books .
that surprised me . "
equally impressed by what she saw in the german schools , atifa says she will tell the education ministry in afghanistan how students in germany learn .
she was especially intrigued by a particular creative exercise in which all the students in a classroom listened to music and then each drew their own pictures inspired by the music .

atifa 's goal , like that of her classmates , is to help rebuild her country .
in order to do that the students all plan to go on to university and get a degree .
many would even like to study in germany and hope for financial support to do so .

some looked like " charcoal briquettes , " said michael knoche , the director of the 338-year-old library .
others , soaked in the water sprayed by firefighters , were several pounds heavier than their original weight . the damage done , it 's up to a team of bookbinders at the privately-run center for book preservation in leipzig to lessen its impact .
as of tuesday , a little more than 25,000 books were declared completely lost .
of the estimated 50,000 pulled from the burning building by a human chain of library employees and volunteers thursday night , more than 35,000 have suffered water damage , some of it heavy .
most of those have already arrived at the center . restoration begins at 20 below zero " it 's been intense , " said manuela reikov-räuchle , the head of the restoration department at the preservation center , in an interview with dw-world . " sometimes , the books are delivered , sometimes we 've been driving back and forth . " wrapped in foil , many are still dripping wet when they 're unpacked .
the race against time - and fungus - begins immediately .
after a quick cleaning with a brush , the books are deep frozen at minus 20 degrees to prevent microbacteria from taking over . for small books , the process is over in 24 hours .
larger ones are frozen for up to three days .
when they emerge from the freezer , they 're put through a process that evaporates the ice immediately into gas .
the same thing is done to dried fruit . knoche has yet to release a list of works currently undergoing restoration .
the bookbinders say there is no way to estimate yet how many of the books will , in fact , be restored to their original form .
money is definitely a factor . prohibitive prices restoration costs 10 euros per kilogram -lrb- 2.2 pounds -rrb- when the book is wet , according to the center .
most of the small books weigh between 1.5 and 2 kg , and the amounts begin skyrocketing when the larger books are factored in .
including transportation and storage , the state cultural minister in thuringia , where weimar is located , said tuesday the costs for each book would be between € 500 and € 1,000 -lrb- $ 600 and $ 1,200 -rrb- . " there are several tons , " said reikov-räuchle . so far , the federal government has promised € 4 million in emergency money , half of which was transferred on monday , according to museum officials . an account set up for donations from the public has gotten a good reception and a series of benefit concerts are being planned . " the resonance -lrb- in the public -rrb- has been inspiring , " said helmut seemann . electrical short is to blame police said tuesday that an electrical short in the upper story of the three-floor building was most likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire devastated two floors and much of the roof responsible for the blaze .
the two-story 18th century rococo hall , the building 's extravagant centerpiece , was completely gutted by flames but will eventually be restored , according to seemann .
it could take months , even years to determine whether it will hold the same collection .
some good news came on tuesday with the announcement that around 20,000 books with only minor water damage can be restored by the library itself .
the rest will be handled by the center , which is undertaking its biggest assignment since floods devastated several libraries along the elbe in 2002 .
it has had to put other projects , like work for the us library of congress , on hold .
though the 2002 floods kept them busy , this assignment is especially notable for the center . " these are world cultural treasures , " said reikov-räuchle .

some looked like " charcoal briquettes , " said michael knoche , the director of the 338-year-old library .
others , soaked in the water sprayed by firefighters , were several pounds heavier than their original weight . the damage done , it 's up to a team of bookbinders at the privately-run center for book preservation in leipzig to lessen its impact .
as of tuesday , a little more than 25,000 books were declared completely lost .
of the estimated 50,000 pulled from the burning building by a human chain of library employees and volunteers thursday night , more than 35,000 have suffered water damage , some of it heavy .
most of those have already arrived at the center . restoration begins at 20 below zero " it 's been intense , " said manuela reikov-räuchle , the head of the restoration department at the preservation center , in an interview with dw-world . " sometimes , the books are delivered , sometimes we 've been driving back and forth . " wrapped in foil , many are still dripping wet when they 're unpacked .
the race against time - and fungus - begins immediately .
after a quick cleaning with a brush , the books are deep frozen at minus 20 degrees to prevent microbacteria from taking over . for small books , the process is over in 24 hours .
larger ones are frozen for up to three days .
when they emerge from the freezer , they 're put through a process that evaporates the ice immediately into gas .
the same thing is done to dried fruit . knoche has yet to release a list of works currently undergoing restoration .
the bookbinders say there is no way to estimate yet how many of the books will , in fact , be restored to their original form .
money is definitely a factor . prohibitive prices restoration costs 10 euros per kilogram -lrb- 2.2 pounds -rrb- when the book is wet , according to the center .
most of the small books weigh between 1.5 and 2 kg , and the amounts begin skyrocketing when the larger books are factored in .
including transportation and storage , the state cultural minister in thuringia , where weimar is located , said tuesday the costs for each book would be between € 500 and € 1,000 -lrb- $ 600 and $ 1,200 -rrb- . " there are several tons , " said reikov-räuchle . so far , the federal government has promised € 4 million in emergency money , half of which was transferred on monday , according to museum officials . an account set up for donations from the public has gotten a good reception and a series of benefit concerts are being planned . " the resonance -lrb- in the public -rrb- has been inspiring , " said helmut seemann . electrical short is to blame police said tuesday that an electrical short in the upper story of the three-floor building was most likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire devastated two floors and much of the roof responsible for the blaze .
the two-story 18th century rococo hall , the building 's extravagant centerpiece , was completely gutted by flames but will eventually be restored , according to seemann .
it could take months , even years to determine whether it will hold the same collection .
some good news came on tuesday with the announcement that around 20,000 books with only minor water damage can be restored by the library itself .
the rest will be handled by the center , which is undertaking its biggest assignment since floods devastated several libraries along the elbe in 2002 .
it has had to put other projects , like work for the us library of congress , on hold .
though the 2002 floods kept them busy , this assignment is especially notable for the center . " these are world cultural treasures , " said reikov-räuchle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.09.2004 russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says it reserves the right to pre-emptively hit terror bases in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases . " russia 's top general said his country was ready to attack " terrorist bases " anywhere in the caucasus , central asia and other areas near russia .
according to russian news agencies , chief of staff general yuri baluyevsky threatened pre-emptive strikes against organizations harboring terrorists .
" our position on pre-emptive strikes has been stated before , but i will repeat it .
we will take steps to liquidate terrorist bases in any region of the world , " he said after talks with us general james jones , nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
baluyevsky admitted that " military steps are an extreme measure in the fight against terrorism , " and said his country would not revert to the use of the country 's massive nuclear arsenal .
" this does not mean that we will resort to the use of nuclear force , " he said in a statement that has perplexed many european observers .
a first for moscow ?
embroiled in a five-year guerrilla war in rebel chechnya , moscow has frequently staged attacks against the break-away province , but outside its own borders russia has been hesitant to carry out pre-emptive strikes against terrorists .
so far it has only dropped a few bombs on the panskisi gorge in neighboring georgia , where it suspects chechen rebels are hiding and training .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces soldiers take position at the seized school in beslan , north ossetia , friday , sept .
3 , 2004 .
it is therefore all the more surprising that baluyevsky would make such statements , especially since president vladimir putin has not made any comments along the same lines since the hostage-taking crisis in a school in the russian province of north ossetia shocked the country and world a week ago .
a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner emma udwin said the threats would have more weight if coming from the russian president .
" i would pay more attention if it had come from putin , " she said when asked about baluyevsky 's remarks .
kremlin adopts us policy ?
the european commission 's chief spokesman , reijo kemppinen , also dismissed the comments , saying instead : " i think i 've heard that kind of statement before .
not from russia though . "
western analysts said wednesday 's remarks from chief of staff yuri baluyvsky carried echoes of the us doctrine in the " war on terror " of countering threats by launching first strikes , instead of waiting to be attacked .
on the other hand , russia 's sharply limited reach means the general 's warning would apply in practice to former soviet republics in the caucasus and central asia which moscow still regards as its sphere of influence .
" in practice this doctrine can only apply to the countries adjacent to russia which are not part of a global alliance , " jonathan eyal , russia analyst at the royal united services institute in london , told reuters wire service .
us-russian cooperation the chief of staff 's statements came during the first visit to russia by nato 's top commander .
jones , who stressed the two former cold war foes had entered a new friendly relationship since the september 11 attacks in the united states , said the bond between washington and moscow had grown even stronger after the seizing of the school in the town of beslan by terrorists .
" we face common threats and common challenges , " jones said .
" we are entering a period of heightened cooperation against these threats and this is very , very important . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tv grab from russian ntv showing a terrorist standing guard over hostages inside the school gymnasium in beslan , north ossetia .
the footage was shot by one of the terrorists .
at least 336 civilians , including hundreds of children , died in the three-day school siege in the north ossetian province which borders chechnya .
the american general referred to the hostage-taking as an " insidious attack . "
just like before the launch of the us-led strike against afghanistan that russia backed in october 2001 as a retaliation for the september 11 attacks staged by the afghan-based al qaeda terror network , the two generals said the beslan attack should redouble the two sides ' efforts to fight terror .
" today international terrorism has become an international force , and only through joint action -lrb- with nato -rrb- can we fight this scourge , " baluyevsky said .
the russian general added that the two sides agreed to exchange information on terror cells around the world and to coordinate a rapid response team to fight them . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : russia needs international solidarity official versions of the hostage drama in north ossetia and the true events on the ground are widely divergent .

the european commission 's chief spokesman , reijo kemppinen , also dismissed the comments , saying instead : " i think i 've heard that kind of statement before .
not from russia though . "
western analysts said wednesday 's remarks from chief of staff yuri baluyvsky carried echoes of the us doctrine in the " war on terror " of countering threats by launching first strikes , instead of waiting to be attacked .
on the other hand , russia 's sharply limited reach means the general 's warning would apply in practice to former soviet republics in the caucasus and central asia which moscow still regards as its sphere of influence .
" in practice this doctrine can only apply to the countries adjacent to russia which are not part of a global alliance , " jonathan eyal , russia analyst at the royal united services institute in london , told reuters wire service .
us-russian cooperation the chief of staff 's statements came during the first visit to russia by nato 's top commander .
jones , who stressed the two former cold war foes had entered a new friendly relationship since the september 11 attacks in the united states , said the bond between washington and moscow had grown even stronger after the seizing of the school in the town of beslan by terrorists .
" we face common threats and common challenges , " jones said .
" we are entering a period of heightened cooperation against these threats and this is very , very important . "

just like before the launch of the us-led strike against afghanistan that russia backed in october 2001 as a retaliation for the september 11 attacks staged by the afghan-based al qaeda terror network , the two generals said the beslan attack should redouble the two sides ' efforts to fight terror .
" today international terrorism has become an international force , and only through joint action -lrb- with nato -rrb- can we fight this scourge , " baluyevsky said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.09.2004 russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says it reserves the right to pre-emptively hit terror bases in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases . " russia 's top general said his country was ready to attack " terrorist bases " anywhere in the caucasus , central asia and other areas near russia .
according to russian news agencies , chief of staff general yuri baluyevsky threatened pre-emptive strikes against organizations harboring terrorists .
" our position on pre-emptive strikes has been stated before , but i will repeat it .
we will take steps to liquidate terrorist bases in any region of the world , " he said after talks with us general james jones , nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
baluyevsky admitted that " military steps are an extreme measure in the fight against terrorism , " and said his country would not revert to the use of the country 's massive nuclear arsenal .
" this does not mean that we will resort to the use of nuclear force , " he said in a statement that has perplexed many european observers .
a first for moscow ?
embroiled in a five-year guerrilla war in rebel chechnya , moscow has frequently staged attacks against the break-away province , but outside its own borders russia has been hesitant to carry out pre-emptive strikes against terrorists .
so far it has only dropped a few bombs on the panskisi gorge in neighboring georgia , where it suspects chechen rebels are hiding and training .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces soldiers take position at the seized school in beslan , north ossetia , friday , sept .
3 , 2004 .
it is therefore all the more surprising that baluyevsky would make such statements , especially since president vladimir putin has not made any comments along the same lines since the hostage-taking crisis in a school in the russian province of north ossetia shocked the country and world a week ago .
a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner emma udwin said the threats would have more weight if coming from the russian president .
" i would pay more attention if it had come from putin , " she said when asked about baluyevsky 's remarks .

" a coach could n't wish for a better opportunity , " beamed klinsmann at the pre-match press conference on tuesday .
" i 'm absolutely convinced there will be an explosive atmosphere . " " this fixture is a classic and every single player will be particularly motivated , " klinsmann added .

" we want to know where the team stands 21 months before the 2006 world cup , which is so important for german football , " bierhoff told the assembled reporters on tuesday . players dismiss talk of revenge the players themselves are also unconcerned about avenging the heart-breaking defeat in yokohama .
" talking about revenge is absurd , " bayern munich goalkeeper oliver kahn told magazine kicker .
" you can not compare a world cup final with a friendly match . " meanwhile , brazilian-born germany striker kevin kuranyi also has other things on his mind , like showing the country of his birth what it let slip away .

the friendly in berlin will be all about germany 's future not its past . germany 's new national team chief jürgen klinsmann pits his fledgling coaching skills against the world champions brazil on wednesday night in his first real test as head of the country 's soccer stars . and the former germany striker is optimistic his fully fit and highly motivated side can build on the 3-1 success over austria in his first game to wipe away the still painful memories of the 2-0 defeat at the hands of the brazilians in the 2002 world cup final . " a coach could n't wish for a better opportunity , " beamed klinsmann at the pre-match press conference on tuesday .
" i 'm absolutely convinced there will be an explosive atmosphere . " " this fixture is a classic and every single player will be particularly motivated , " klinsmann added .
" i want the players to be more active , to move the ball forward quickly and to always do what 's best for the team .
i also want them to believe in themselves because football is very much a mental thing . " first home game will be crucial klinsmann will be facing a home crowd for the first time in his short reign since he took over the running of the national team from rudi völler after the euro 2004 debacle .
the former bayern munich , inter milan and monaco striker is hoping to get the support of a skeptical audience in berlin 's renovated olympic stadium where the friendly match is being played . bildunterschrift : joachim löw , jürgen klinsmann and oliver bierhoff want new scores settled not old ones .
despite being the first meeting between the two teams since germany 's stumble at the final hurdle at the world cup in japan / korea in 2002 , the coaching team of klinsmann , fellow ex-striker oliver bierhoff and joachim löw have been quick to play down talk of a revenge match against the team that ended germany 's improbable shot at glory two years ago , preferring to look to the future rather than the past . " we want to know where the team stands 21 months before the 2006 world cup , which is so important for german football , " bierhoff told the assembled reporters on tuesday . players dismiss talk of revenge the players themselves are also unconcerned about avenging the heart-breaking defeat in yokohama .
" talking about revenge is absurd , " bayern munich goalkeeper oliver kahn told magazine kicker .
" you can not compare a world cup final with a friendly match . " meanwhile , brazilian-born germany striker kevin kuranyi also has other things on his mind , like showing the country of his birth what it let slip away .
" things have been going well for me recently and it would be great to score a goal against brazil , " the 22-year-old stuttgart player told the press conference .
" hopefully , the brazilians will know about me after the game .

another german player who will want to show the brazilians what he is made of on the international stage is sebastian deisler , although it would not matter to the bayern munich midfielder who the opponents were on wednesday evening . almost exactly a year to the day since he last pulled on a national team jersey , the 24-year-old deisler will be looking to pull down the curtain on a troublesome year of injuries and depression by lining up alongside bayern munich club-mates michael ballack and torsten frings in the heart of klinsmann 's midfield .

" talking about revenge is absurd , " bayern munich goalkeeper oliver kahn told magazine kicker .
" you can not compare a world cup final with a friendly match . " meanwhile , brazilian-born germany striker kevin kuranyi also has other things on his mind , like showing the country of his birth what it let slip away .

" hopefully , the brazilians will know about me after the game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.09.2004 russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says it reserves the right to pre-emptively hit terror bases in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases . " russia 's top general said his country was ready to attack " terrorist bases " anywhere in the caucasus , central asia and other areas near russia .
according to russian news agencies , chief of staff general yuri baluyevsky threatened pre-emptive strikes against organizations harboring terrorists .
" our position on pre-emptive strikes has been stated before , but i will repeat it .
we will take steps to liquidate terrorist bases in any region of the world , " he said after talks with us general james jones , nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
baluyevsky admitted that " military steps are an extreme measure in the fight against terrorism , " and said his country would not revert to the use of the country 's massive nuclear arsenal .
" this does not mean that we will resort to the use of nuclear force , " he said in a statement that has perplexed many european observers .
a first for moscow ?
embroiled in a five-year guerrilla war in rebel chechnya , moscow has frequently staged attacks against the break-away province , but outside its own borders russia has been hesitant to carry out pre-emptive strikes against terrorists .
so far it has only dropped a few bombs on the panskisi gorge in neighboring georgia , where it suspects chechen rebels are hiding and training .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces soldiers take position at the seized school in beslan , north ossetia , friday , sept .
3 , 2004 .
it is therefore all the more surprising that baluyevsky would make such statements , especially since president vladimir putin has not made any comments along the same lines since the hostage-taking crisis in a school in the russian province of north ossetia shocked the country and world a week ago .
a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner emma udwin said the threats would have more weight if coming from the russian president .
" i would pay more attention if it had come from putin , " she said when asked about baluyevsky 's remarks .
kremlin adopts us policy ?
the european commission 's chief spokesman , reijo kemppinen , also dismissed the comments , saying instead : " i think i 've heard that kind of statement before .
not from russia though . "
western analysts said wednesday 's remarks from chief of staff yuri baluyvsky carried echoes of the us doctrine in the " war on terror " of countering threats by launching first strikes , instead of waiting to be attacked .
on the other hand , russia 's sharply limited reach means the general 's warning would apply in practice to former soviet republics in the caucasus and central asia which moscow still regards as its sphere of influence .
" in practice this doctrine can only apply to the countries adjacent to russia which are not part of a global alliance , " jonathan eyal , russia analyst at the royal united services institute in london , told reuters wire service .
us-russian cooperation the chief of staff 's statements came during the first visit to russia by nato 's top commander .
jones , who stressed the two former cold war foes had entered a new friendly relationship since the september 11 attacks in the united states , said the bond between washington and moscow had grown even stronger after the seizing of the school in the town of beslan by terrorists .
" we face common threats and common challenges , " jones said .
" we are entering a period of heightened cooperation against these threats and this is very , very important . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tv grab from russian ntv showing a terrorist standing guard over hostages inside the school gymnasium in beslan , north ossetia .
the footage was shot by one of the terrorists .
at least 336 civilians , including hundreds of children , died in the three-day school siege in the north ossetian province which borders chechnya .
the american general referred to the hostage-taking as an " insidious attack . "
just like before the launch of the us-led strike against afghanistan that russia backed in october 2001 as a retaliation for the september 11 attacks staged by the afghan-based al qaeda terror network , the two generals said the beslan attack should redouble the two sides ' efforts to fight terror .
" today international terrorism has become an international force , and only through joint action -lrb- with nato -rrb- can we fight this scourge , " baluyevsky said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.09.2004 learning to learn in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a long way from kabul to saxony for afghan students after years of war and unrest , coming to germany was like a dream for a group of afghan students .
they experienced a completely different type of school , learning with computers and experimenting with creativity . ahmad farhad ’ s face is scarred .
during the war , he and three of his brothers were injured , he says .
he doesn ’ t elaborate , merely stares straight ahead , smiles , and changes the topic .
this exchange , he says , is a miracle .
ahmad is 19 years old and a student at kabul ’ s amani high school .
he and 18 other teenagers came to germany about three weeks ago as part of the first german-afghan student exchange program .
on wednesday , the group flies back home , and will take many memories and new ideas with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls and boys have separate schools in afghanistan .
here a girls class in novobod .
for the 18-year-old atifa formuli , one of the group 's eight girls , the exchange proves that men and women can study and work together .
wearing a simple black suit , and flashing green eyes under her headscarf , she explains what the last three weeks have meant for her : " when we come here it means that the position of girls and boys is equal . "
in kabul , boys and girls only spend the first two school years in the same classroom .
but here , atifa says , we can talk to each other .
atifa is a student at the aishe-e-durani girls school .
both her school and amani high school are backed by the german foreign ministry and offer german language classes .
the best students in each school are chosen to travel to saxony , in eastern germany , explains 16-year-old masih ullah hamkar .
they live with host families and experience going to a german school .
long hair and earrings for masih , just seeing the other students in school was an eye-opening experience .
" boys with long hair and earrings - that was something different , " he says .
" there aren ’ t too many like that in afghanistan .
and the girls dress so differently , too , " he recalls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school in tents in novobod although it was interesting to sit in the classroom with the german students , he says he doesn ’ t think much of discipline at the schools here .
in his country , masih says , students respect their teachers .
back home , as many as 60 students crowd into one classroom and a disciplinary slap in the face is not uncommon when the teacher wants to maintain order .
all the afghan students strive for one thing : to learn , to study , so that later , they can help rebuild their country .
during their stay in germany , they were amazed at the beautiful buildings , shops , highways , trains and the green landscape .
but they were especially interested in experiencing the country 's modern teaching methods .
more than rote learning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computers are still rare in afghanistan .
here young women learn an operation system at the shirzai training academy in kandahar , afghanistan .
" it was a real surprise to see the students go to different classrooms to study , " says mohammed feisal .
the teaching methods are very advanced , with computers and all kinds of technical equipment , he remembers .
" the students can see and experience everything , not just read about things in books .
that surprised me . "
equally impressed by what she saw in the german schools , atifa says she will tell the education ministry in afghanistan how students in germany learn .
she was especially intrigued by a particular creative exercise in which all the students in a classroom listened to music and then each drew their own pictures inspired by the music .
at first she thought such a task would be difficult , but it worked , she says , and she managed to come up with ideas on her own .
a german role model ?
" i saw that every person in germany was responsible for their own acts and worked by themselves .
and because of this they have helped make their country beautiful and clean , " atifa recalls .

as of tuesday , a little more than 25,000 books were declared completely lost .
of the estimated 50,000 pulled from the burning building by a human chain of library employees and volunteers thursday night , more than 35,000 have suffered water damage , some of it heavy .
most of those have already arrived at the center . restoration begins at 20 below zero " it 's been intense , " said manuela reikov-räuchle , the head of the restoration department at the preservation center , in an interview with dw-world .

money is definitely a factor . prohibitive prices restoration costs 10 euros per kilogram -lrb- 2.2 pounds -rrb- when the book is wet , according to the center .
most of the small books weigh between 1.5 and 2 kg , and the amounts begin skyrocketing when the larger books are factored in .
including transportation and storage , the state cultural minister in thuringia , where weimar is located , said tuesday the costs for each book would be between € 500 and € 1,000 -lrb- $ 600 and $ 1,200 -rrb- . " there are several tons , " said reikov-räuchle . so far , the federal government has promised € 4 million in emergency money , half of which was transferred on monday , according to museum officials . an account set up for donations from the public has gotten a good reception and a series of benefit concerts are being planned .

the two-story 18th century rococo hall , the building 's extravagant centerpiece , was completely gutted by flames but will eventually be restored , according to seemann .
it could take months , even years to determine whether it will hold the same collection .
some good news came on tuesday with the announcement that around 20,000 books with only minor water damage can be restored by the library itself .
the rest will be handled by the center , which is undertaking its biggest assignment since floods devastated several libraries along the elbe in 2002 .
it has had to put other projects , like work for the us library of congress , on hold .
though the 2002 floods kept them busy , this assignment is especially notable for the center . " these are world cultural treasures , " said reikov-räuchle .

they experienced a completely different type of school , learning with computers and experimenting with creativity . ahmad farhad ’ s face is scarred .
during the war , he and three of his brothers were injured , he says .
he doesn ’ t elaborate , merely stares straight ahead , smiles , and changes the topic .
this exchange , he says , is a miracle .
ahmad is 19 years old and a student at kabul ’ s amani high school .
he and 18 other teenagers came to germany about three weeks ago as part of the first german-afghan student exchange program .
on wednesday , the group flies back home , and will take many memories and new ideas with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls and boys have separate schools in afghanistan .
here a girls class in novobod .
for the 18-year-old atifa formuli , one of the group 's eight girls , the exchange proves that men and women can study and work together .
wearing a simple black suit , and flashing green eyes under her headscarf , she explains what the last three weeks have meant for her : " when we come here it means that the position of girls and boys is equal . "
in kabul , boys and girls only spend the first two school years in the same classroom .
but here , atifa says , we can talk to each other .
atifa is a student at the aishe-e-durani girls school .
both her school and amani high school are backed by the german foreign ministry and offer german language classes .
the best students in each school are chosen to travel to saxony , in eastern germany , explains 16-year-old masih ullah hamkar .
they live with host families and experience going to a german school .
long hair and earrings for masih , just seeing the other students in school was an eye-opening experience .
" boys with long hair and earrings - that was something different , " he says .
" there aren ’ t too many like that in afghanistan .
and the girls dress so differently , too , " he recalls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school in tents in novobod although it was interesting to sit in the classroom with the german students , he says he doesn ’ t think much of discipline at the schools here .
in his country , masih says , students respect their teachers .
back home , as many as 60 students crowd into one classroom and a disciplinary slap in the face is not uncommon when the teacher wants to maintain order .
all the afghan students strive for one thing : to learn , to study , so that later , they can help rebuild their country .
during their stay in germany , they were amazed at the beautiful buildings , shops , highways , trains and the green landscape .
but they were especially interested in experiencing the country 's modern teaching methods .
more than rote learning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computers are still rare in afghanistan .
here young women learn an operation system at the shirzai training academy in kandahar , afghanistan .
" it was a real surprise to see the students go to different classrooms to study , " says mohammed feisal .
the teaching methods are very advanced , with computers and all kinds of technical equipment , he remembers .
" the students can see and experience everything , not just read about things in books .
that surprised me . "
equally impressed by what she saw in the german schools , atifa says she will tell the education ministry in afghanistan how students in germany learn .
she was especially intrigued by a particular creative exercise in which all the students in a classroom listened to music and then each drew their own pictures inspired by the music .
at first she thought such a task would be difficult , but it worked , she says , and she managed to come up with ideas on her own .
a german role model ?
" i saw that every person in germany was responsible for their own acts and worked by themselves .
and because of this they have helped make their country beautiful and clean , " atifa recalls .
" when we go back , we will say to everyone that we can also make our country like this , " she pledges .
atifa 's goal , like that of her classmates , is to help rebuild her country .
in order to do that the students all plan to go on to university and get a degree .
many would even like to study in germany and hope for financial support to do so .
it does n't matter if they come from a different cultural background , atifa says : " people are people wherever they are . "
at the moment are no plans for another group of afghan students to visit germany .

nato troops are expected to provide the much needed security for the historic event , but experts worry the alliance may be ill prepared for the job . when the more than 10 million eligible afghans go to the polls on oct .
9 , some 10,000 nato soldiers will be guaranteeing their safety .
in order to do so , the military alliance will have had to double its contingent from the 5,000 troops currently stationed in the country .
that increase in size corresponds to the pledge made to afghan president hamid karsai by the north atlantic alliance during the istanbul summit in june .
after a lengthy internal tug-of-war , the member states had agreed to boost their presence in the country in order to help ensure that the historical first elections take place peacefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurokorps troops head to afghanistan in aug .
2004 .
they will be part of the expanded nato security force .
" the nato contingent in afghanistan will be significantly strengthened in time for the elections , " announced the military alliance 's spokeswoman simone de manso .
the deployment is already underway and should be completed in time for the elections , she added .
" the additional troops will consist of an italian and a spanish battalion as well as a us reserve battalion stationed outside afghanistan , " said manso .
according to nato plans , the new troops are not intended as a permanent expansion of the current military presence in the country .
although the troops are only there to secure the election , " manso said they will " remain in afghanistan for as long as the local commander deems it necessary . "
false priorities despite the commitment to security , not everyone is convinced nato is approaching the elections realistically .
" i regard the whole situation as a mid-size farce , " argued albert stahel , professor for strategic military studies at the technical university in zurich .
the international community has set false priorities and is placing itself under unnecessary time pressure , stahel told dw-world .
" the elections are coming light years too early , as afghanistan is no where close to being mature enough for democracy , " he maintained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should rebuilding aghanistan take priority over elections ?
" rather than focusing on preparing for an election , -lrb- the international community -rrb- should be working to rebuild the country , for instance concentrating on the infrastructure and the water resources , " he said .
an election could be held once the much more crucial reconstruction work is completed - in a couple of years , stahel added .
the swiss expert also warned of placing too much faith in the elections .
" of course it will not be an election according to western democratic standards , " he said .
and in order to guarantee that the elections throughout the country take place freely and peacefully , a much larger military presence will be necessary .
" if one wanted to ensure that the election takes place more or less orderly , that can not be done with just 10,000 soldiers , " he stressed .
at the same time , though , the election can not be postponed , admitted stahel .
the international community can not change the timeframe with such short notice .
" if the election date is pushed back , the united nations , nato and the united states would risk losing face and the population in afghanistan would not go along with it either .

some looked like " charcoal briquettes , " said michael knoche , the director of the 338-year-old library .
others , soaked in the water sprayed by firefighters , were several pounds heavier than their original weight . the damage done , it 's up to a team of bookbinders at the privately-run center for book preservation in leipzig to lessen its impact .
as of tuesday , a little more than 25,000 books were declared completely lost .
of the estimated 50,000 pulled from the burning building by a human chain of library employees and volunteers thursday night , more than 35,000 have suffered water damage , some of it heavy .
most of those have already arrived at the center . restoration begins at 20 below zero " it 's been intense , " said manuela reikov-räuchle , the head of the restoration department at the preservation center , in an interview with dw-world . " sometimes , the books are delivered , sometimes we 've been driving back and forth . " wrapped in foil , many are still dripping wet when they 're unpacked .
the race against time - and fungus - begins immediately .
after a quick cleaning with a brush , the books are deep frozen at minus 20 degrees to prevent microbacteria from taking over . for small books , the process is over in 24 hours .
larger ones are frozen for up to three days .
when they emerge from the freezer , they 're put through a process that evaporates the ice immediately into gas .
the same thing is done to dried fruit . knoche has yet to release a list of works currently undergoing restoration .
the bookbinders say there is no way to estimate yet how many of the books will , in fact , be restored to their original form .
money is definitely a factor . prohibitive prices restoration costs 10 euros per kilogram -lrb- 2.2 pounds -rrb- when the book is wet , according to the center .
most of the small books weigh between 1.5 and 2 kg , and the amounts begin skyrocketing when the larger books are factored in .
including transportation and storage , the state cultural minister in thuringia , where weimar is located , said tuesday the costs for each book would be between € 500 and € 1,000 -lrb- $ 600 and $ 1,200 -rrb- . " there are several tons , " said reikov-räuchle . so far , the federal government has promised € 4 million in emergency money , half of which was transferred on monday , according to museum officials . an account set up for donations from the public has gotten a good reception and a series of benefit concerts are being planned . " the resonance -lrb- in the public -rrb- has been inspiring , " said helmut seemann . electrical short is to blame police said tuesday that an electrical short in the upper story of the three-floor building was most likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire devastated two floors and much of the roof responsible for the blaze .
the two-story 18th century rococo hall , the building 's extravagant centerpiece , was completely gutted by flames but will eventually be restored , according to seemann .
it could take months , even years to determine whether it will hold the same collection .
some good news came on tuesday with the announcement that around 20,000 books with only minor water damage can be restored by the library itself .
the rest will be handled by the center , which is undertaking its biggest assignment since floods devastated several libraries along the elbe in 2002 .
it has had to put other projects , like work for the us library of congress , on hold .
though the 2002 floods kept them busy , this assignment is especially notable for the center . " these are world cultural treasures , " said reikov-räuchle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.09.2004 learning to learn in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a long way from kabul to saxony for afghan students after years of war and unrest , coming to germany was like a dream for a group of afghan students .
they experienced a completely different type of school , learning with computers and experimenting with creativity . ahmad farhad ’ s face is scarred .
during the war , he and three of his brothers were injured , he says .
he doesn ’ t elaborate , merely stares straight ahead , smiles , and changes the topic .
this exchange , he says , is a miracle .
ahmad is 19 years old and a student at kabul ’ s amani high school .
he and 18 other teenagers came to germany about three weeks ago as part of the first german-afghan student exchange program .
on wednesday , the group flies back home , and will take many memories and new ideas with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls and boys have separate schools in afghanistan .
here a girls class in novobod .
for the 18-year-old atifa formuli , one of the group 's eight girls , the exchange proves that men and women can study and work together .
wearing a simple black suit , and flashing green eyes under her headscarf , she explains what the last three weeks have meant for her : " when we come here it means that the position of girls and boys is equal . "
in kabul , boys and girls only spend the first two school years in the same classroom .
but here , atifa says , we can talk to each other .
atifa is a student at the aishe-e-durani girls school .
both her school and amani high school are backed by the german foreign ministry and offer german language classes .
the best students in each school are chosen to travel to saxony , in eastern germany , explains 16-year-old masih ullah hamkar .
they live with host families and experience going to a german school .
long hair and earrings for masih , just seeing the other students in school was an eye-opening experience .
" boys with long hair and earrings - that was something different , " he says .
" there aren ’ t too many like that in afghanistan .
and the girls dress so differently , too , " he recalls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school in tents in novobod although it was interesting to sit in the classroom with the german students , he says he doesn ’ t think much of discipline at the schools here .
in his country , masih says , students respect their teachers .
back home , as many as 60 students crowd into one classroom and a disciplinary slap in the face is not uncommon when the teacher wants to maintain order .
all the afghan students strive for one thing : to learn , to study , so that later , they can help rebuild their country .
during their stay in germany , they were amazed at the beautiful buildings , shops , highways , trains and the green landscape .
but they were especially interested in experiencing the country 's modern teaching methods .
more than rote learning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computers are still rare in afghanistan .
here young women learn an operation system at the shirzai training academy in kandahar , afghanistan .
" it was a real surprise to see the students go to different classrooms to study , " says mohammed feisal .
the teaching methods are very advanced , with computers and all kinds of technical equipment , he remembers .
" the students can see and experience everything , not just read about things in books .
that surprised me . "
equally impressed by what she saw in the german schools , atifa says she will tell the education ministry in afghanistan how students in germany learn .
she was especially intrigued by a particular creative exercise in which all the students in a classroom listened to music and then each drew their own pictures inspired by the music .
at first she thought such a task would be difficult , but it worked , she says , and she managed to come up with ideas on her own .
a german role model ?
" i saw that every person in germany was responsible for their own acts and worked by themselves .
and because of this they have helped make their country beautiful and clean , " atifa recalls .
" when we go back , we will say to everyone that we can also make our country like this , " she pledges .
atifa 's goal , like that of her classmates , is to help rebuild her country .
in order to do that the students all plan to go on to university and get a degree .
many would even like to study in germany and hope for financial support to do so .
it does n't matter if they come from a different cultural background , atifa says : " people are people wherever they are . "
at the moment are no plans for another group of afghan students to visit germany .
and , due to the tense security situation , a visit by german students to afghanistan is not planned any time soon . silke bartlick -lrb- db / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life in afghanistan deutsche welle reporters sandra petersmann and karen fischer explore the country , from kabul to kunduz , documenting the new struggles , the daily fight for survival , the joy of afghan children who are finally back in school and the fate of refugees who have returned to their homeland .

they experienced a completely different type of school , learning with computers and experimenting with creativity . ahmad farhad ’ s face is scarred .
during the war , he and three of his brothers were injured , he says .
he doesn ’ t elaborate , merely stares straight ahead , smiles , and changes the topic .
this exchange , he says , is a miracle .
ahmad is 19 years old and a student at kabul ’ s amani high school .
he and 18 other teenagers came to germany about three weeks ago as part of the first german-afghan student exchange program .
on wednesday , the group flies back home , and will take many memories and new ideas with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls and boys have separate schools in afghanistan .
here a girls class in novobod .
for the 18-year-old atifa formuli , one of the group 's eight girls , the exchange proves that men and women can study and work together .
wearing a simple black suit , and flashing green eyes under her headscarf , she explains what the last three weeks have meant for her : " when we come here it means that the position of girls and boys is equal . "
in kabul , boys and girls only spend the first two school years in the same classroom .
but here , atifa says , we can talk to each other .
atifa is a student at the aishe-e-durani girls school .
both her school and amani high school are backed by the german foreign ministry and offer german language classes .
the best students in each school are chosen to travel to saxony , in eastern germany , explains 16-year-old masih ullah hamkar .
they live with host families and experience going to a german school .

back home , as many as 60 students crowd into one classroom and a disciplinary slap in the face is not uncommon when the teacher wants to maintain order .
all the afghan students strive for one thing : to learn , to study , so that later , they can help rebuild their country .

the teaching methods are very advanced , with computers and all kinds of technical equipment , he remembers .
" the students can see and experience everything , not just read about things in books .
that surprised me . "
equally impressed by what she saw in the german schools , atifa says she will tell the education ministry in afghanistan how students in germany learn .
she was especially intrigued by a particular creative exercise in which all the students in a classroom listened to music and then each drew their own pictures inspired by the music .

atifa 's goal , like that of her classmates , is to help rebuild her country .
in order to do that the students all plan to go on to university and get a degree .
many would even like to study in germany and hope for financial support to do so .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.09.2004 rocking in german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 2raumwohnung " are making german lyrics popular again young german musicians are opting to sing in their native tongue .
in both style and spirit , many resemble their predecessors of the " neue deutsche welle " -lrb- german new wave -rrb- , which rocked out german-style in the eighties . instead of cranking out cookie-cutter pop hits in english that currently dominate germany 's airwaves , a growing number of young germans are choosing to sing auf deutsch .
they are picking up on the tradition of acts such as nena , trio and falco - who helped make music with german lyrics in the late 1970s and early 1980s popular . deutsche welle interviewed the members of " 2raumwohnung , " inga humpe and tommie eckart , who along with bands like " wir sind helden " are launching the second wave . the name " 2raumwohnung " -lrb- 2-room apartment -rrb- has a lot of symbolic meaning related to german history .
how would you explain the name to your fans abroad ? tommi : the name originally comes from the fact that we 're two people and this is a two person project .
but then , of course , there 's this funny situation : due to the wall and the division between east and west , the language was also divided .
now , 15 years after the fall of the wall , there are still differences , and germans from the east and west have different ways of describing a two-room apartment because they prefer to use different words for room : " zimmer " in the west and " raum " in the east .
we took this linguistic anomaly to be a synonym for berlin , and since we are from the west we incorporated the " raum " into our name to represent a kind of connection . what is your relationship to the german language like ?
foreigners often describe the language as hard , but in your music you make it sound light and soft . inga : that 's true .
after i sing in german , i also think the language is quite hard .
we take great pains to make it sound softer .
but we also have a bit of experience singing in english .
now we have decided to record some of our songs in english , like " sexy girl " and " spiel mit , " which is on the premium version of our cd .
and just yesterday , we recorded an english version of " wir sind anderen . " i recently heard from toni kater , a berlin musician who is on the same label , that when she first met both of you , she identified your band with the " berlin scene . "
do you identify with any " scene " at all , and to what extent is your music tied to the city of berlin ? inga : with the " scene " no , but definitely with the city .
there are so many " scenes " in berlin , but the city is an important source of inspiration for us .
without berlin , we probably would n't exist .
berlin is so big and multi-faceted , and there 's so much freedom here that many different varieties of music can develop .
it 's nice , i think , to be connected to the soul of this city .
i will always be in love with berlin . when you write your songs , do you have a specific public in mind ? tommi : we try to make the kind of music we would enjoy and compose songs we would want to listen to , even if we were n't writing it ourselves .
that 's also how we approached the new album : even if we had n't made it ourselves , would we want to listen to it ?
at least this is what we always try and do .
we do n't have a particular person or listener in mind .
we simply make music for ourselves and for our friends .
i think our fans are not so different than we are . from which musical genre does " 2raumwohnung " draw inspiration ? tommi : we try to draw upon everything we like .
we are just as inspired by air and madonna as by miss kittin and märtini brös .
even older music , like kraftwerk and music from the ' 70s , has influenced us . what are you listening to at the moment ? tommi : i am listening to lots of air at the moment , and i love phoenix .
i guess i listen to other things too , like chet baker … the german press recently accused you of being too optimistic and not political enough .
do you have a response to them ?
and why are you so optimistic ? tommi : first of all , i think it is very important to be optimistic .
when we make music , we are simply in a good mood and people can tell .
but i also do n't agree that our music is not political .
when someone takes their own feelings seriously and shares it with other people , then it is perhaps not - strictly speaking - political , but it certainly has a greater meaning for society . inga : it was a very deliberate decision to be optimistic and to remain optimistic .
i think it 's not the best choice - just because the times are hard - to whine and complain along with everyone else .
instead , people should ask themselves what they can do to make things better for themselves and for everyone others .
i think positive thinking is the basis of that .
and besides , i do n't really understand why the germans complain so much - things are n't really that bad . do you plan on touring abroad ? inga : yes , lots .
we are always getting offers from brazil and mexico . tommi : sadly , it has n't worked out in brazil .
but we 've already played in russia and in japan and we have plans for concerts in spain and turkey . look for " 2raumwohnung " and other representatives of the new " german wave " at a venue near you soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy .

how would you explain the name to your fans abroad ? tommi : the name originally comes from the fact that we 're two people and this is a two person project .
but then , of course , there 's this funny situation : due to the wall and the division between east and west , the language was also divided .
now , 15 years after the fall of the wall , there are still differences , and germans from the east and west have different ways of describing a two-room apartment because they prefer to use different words for room : " zimmer " in the west and " raum " in the east .

after i sing in german , i also think the language is quite hard .

now we have decided to record some of our songs in english , like " sexy girl " and " spiel mit , " which is on the premium version of our cd .

there are so many " scenes " in berlin , but the city is an important source of inspiration for us .

berlin is so big and multi-faceted , and there 's so much freedom here that many different varieties of music can develop .
it 's nice , i think , to be connected to the soul of this city .
i will always be in love with berlin . when you write your songs , do you have a specific public in mind ? tommi : we try to make the kind of music we would enjoy and compose songs we would want to listen to , even if we were n't writing it ourselves .
that 's also how we approached the new album : even if we had n't made it ourselves , would we want to listen to it ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.09.2004 russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says it reserves the right to pre-emptively hit terror bases in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases . " russia 's top general said his country was ready to attack " terrorist bases " anywhere in the caucasus , central asia and other areas near russia .
according to russian news agencies , chief of staff general yuri baluyevsky threatened pre-emptive strikes against organizations harboring terrorists .
" our position on pre-emptive strikes has been stated before , but i will repeat it .
we will take steps to liquidate terrorist bases in any region of the world , " he said after talks with us general james jones , nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
baluyevsky admitted that " military steps are an extreme measure in the fight against terrorism , " and said his country would not revert to the use of the country 's massive nuclear arsenal .
" this does not mean that we will resort to the use of nuclear force , " he said in a statement that has perplexed many european observers .
a first for moscow ?
embroiled in a five-year guerrilla war in rebel chechnya , moscow has frequently staged attacks against the break-away province , but outside its own borders russia has been hesitant to carry out pre-emptive strikes against terrorists .
so far it has only dropped a few bombs on the panskisi gorge in neighboring georgia , where it suspects chechen rebels are hiding and training .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces soldiers take position at the seized school in beslan , north ossetia , friday , sept .
3 , 2004 .
it is therefore all the more surprising that baluyevsky would make such statements , especially since president vladimir putin has not made any comments along the same lines since the hostage-taking crisis in a school in the russian province of north ossetia shocked the country and world a week ago .
a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner emma udwin said the threats would have more weight if coming from the russian president .
" i would pay more attention if it had come from putin , " she said when asked about baluyevsky 's remarks .
kremlin adopts us policy ?
the european commission 's chief spokesman , reijo kemppinen , also dismissed the comments , saying instead : " i think i 've heard that kind of statement before .
not from russia though . "
western analysts said wednesday 's remarks from chief of staff yuri baluyvsky carried echoes of the us doctrine in the " war on terror " of countering threats by launching first strikes , instead of waiting to be attacked .
on the other hand , russia 's sharply limited reach means the general 's warning would apply in practice to former soviet republics in the caucasus and central asia which moscow still regards as its sphere of influence .
" in practice this doctrine can only apply to the countries adjacent to russia which are not part of a global alliance , " jonathan eyal , russia analyst at the royal united services institute in london , told reuters wire service .
us-russian cooperation the chief of staff 's statements came during the first visit to russia by nato 's top commander .
jones , who stressed the two former cold war foes had entered a new friendly relationship since the september 11 attacks in the united states , said the bond between washington and moscow had grown even stronger after the seizing of the school in the town of beslan by terrorists .
" we face common threats and common challenges , " jones said .
" we are entering a period of heightened cooperation against these threats and this is very , very important . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tv grab from russian ntv showing a terrorist standing guard over hostages inside the school gymnasium in beslan , north ossetia .
the footage was shot by one of the terrorists .
at least 336 civilians , including hundreds of children , died in the three-day school siege in the north ossetian province which borders chechnya .
the american general referred to the hostage-taking as an " insidious attack . "
just like before the launch of the us-led strike against afghanistan that russia backed in october 2001 as a retaliation for the september 11 attacks staged by the afghan-based al qaeda terror network , the two generals said the beslan attack should redouble the two sides ' efforts to fight terror .
" today international terrorism has become an international force , and only through joint action -lrb- with nato -rrb- can we fight this scourge , " baluyevsky said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bratwurst and burgers german-americans : more than bratwurst & beer " fahrenheit 9/11 " set to heat up germany one year later , germany anything but smug over iraq war us investors still like germany current affairs -pipe- 08.09.2004 when germans cheered us soldiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin brigade lowers the stars & stripes for the last time a decade ago wednesday , the united states closed one of its longest military chapters with the pullout of american troops out of berlin . the sight of tens of thousands of berliners cheering american troops is something hard to imagine nowadays . when the u.s. began its military invasion of iraq in march 2003 , hundreds of thousands of berlin residents took to the streets to protest against the war . the german government 's steadfast opposition to the us military invasion of iraq in 2003 was anchored in the anti-war sentiments of its population . ten years ago , the story was a different one .
after more than 40 years in which they kept west berlin safe from the looming soviet threat , the final 2,000 soldiers pulled out of berlin on sept .
8 , 1994 .
soldiers , both from the us and the former soviet union , were no longer needed in the reunified city and the americans either went home or to still-existent bases in southern germany . before they left , 75,000 berliners lined the route upon which the us forces would parade for the last time .
they cheered the soldiers and a bundeswehr battalion was on hand to salute the outgoing troops . the decades together in berlin , the last bastion of west germany in the middle of the gdr , had sparked a special relationship between americans and west berliners .
at the latest , the love affair began in 1948 when the soviet union tried to hermetically seal off west berlin and force france , great britain and the u.s. to give up on the city . berlin airlift seals love affair the us responded by flying in humanitarian aid to tempelhof airport .
the so-called " raisin bombers " brought in desperately-needed supplies , flying their way into the hearts of the west berliners in the process . " above all , we learned what solidarity in the most dire emergency means , " former mayor eberhard diepgen remembered .
" the desire for freedom on the part of the berliners convinced the western world of germany 's will never to live under tyrants again . " the soviet union eventually gave up its attempt on grabbing west berlin .
the allied troops stayed , dividing up the divided city into three different sectors .
they did the same in the rest of germany in an effort to protect the country both from the ussr and itself , according to foreign policy scholar ingo peters . " stationing the troops was important , as a sort of insurance , so that what happened here , germany would n't do again , " peters told deutsche welle . germany 's new role in the world after reunification , allied soldiers were no longer needed .
upon their departure from the eventual german capital , chancellor helmut kohl told the troops that germany had learned by their example . " you can rely on us .
germany will never stand aside when peace and freedom are at stake in the world , " kohl said . german foreign policy has made good on that promise .
the country has come a long way from a policy of non-intervention under the protection of allied troops .

a world leader in developing and promoting renewable energy , germany 's fostering a boom in the solar technology market . tucked away behind trees in the middle of the countryside , the leipziger land solar power plant wednesday in the eastern german village of espenhain is invisible from the road .
it ’ s only when you drive through the gate and onto the site itself that you ’ re confronted with a vast field full of 33,500 shimmering gray panels tilted towards the sun at precisely 30 degrees - the optimum angle for absorbing radiation . the espenhain site , near leipzig , was a deposit for lignite dust - a type of brown coal - and was thus contaminated and couldn ’ t be used for anything else .
the lignite had to first be buried under 30 cm -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- of earth on the 20-hectare -lrb- 49-acre -rrb- plot , before the three-and-a-half meter high sloping frames which support the panels could be set up . the high performance modules , made of monocrystalline silicon , can handle the high voltage as well as delivering a high energy yield .
each panel produces 150 watts of energy .
the plant cost € 22 million -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- to build and is capable of generating five megawatts of electricity . pioneering change germany ’ s pioneering renewable energy law , which was passed four years ago and amended in april this year , decrees that any electricity producer - including private individuals - get paid for the amount they feed into the national grid .
this has encouraged thousands of people to install solar panels on their houses . it would be impossible to realize a project on the scale of the new plant without that kind of guarantee , according to annett fruehling , a project engineer for berlin-based firm geosol , which was responsible for the plant 's planning and development .
shell solar and siemens provided the equipment and technology . " we get a certain amount , a fixed price for the electricity we produce here , and this price is fixed for the next 20 years .
no bank would give you the money for a plant like this without any security on the other side , " fruehling told dw-radio .
" we can meet the electricity demand of 1,800 households , and , on the other hand , we save about 3,700 tons annually in -lrb- carbon dioxide emissions -rrb- . " " ideal for developing world " geosol is planning another solar plant in borna , not far from espenhain , fruehling said .
but the technology should n't be limited to the developed world , ronald uppmann , press officer of the german solar industry association solar e.v. , said .
due to the ease and speed with which solar modules can be installed , this type of clean energy is ideal for use in developing countries , uppmann said . " in wind energy and in photovoltaics and in solar thermal technologies germany is one of the leading nations in the world , uppmann said .
" it is very easy and very useful to export the technology .
so if you think of families that live in the jungle of brazil , they are not supplied with electricity at all , -lrb- but now -rrb- they have the possibility to put a little solar power plant on the rooftop and so they get the possibility to use light , they get the possibility to warm their water . " in the six years that chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats and environmentally-friendly greens has been in office , the amount of electricity generated in germany by renewable energy sources - as opposed to fossil and nuclear fuel - has more than doubled , from 4 to 9 percent .
by supporting projects such as the leipziger land solar power plant , the government aims to increase this share still further - to 20 percent in 2020 , and 50 percent by 2050 . charlotte collins -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no " green " medals for athens greece promised to make athens 2004 the greenest olympics ever , but environmental groups have already given the athens olympic organizing committee -lrb- athoc -rrb- failing grades when it comes to protecting nature .

a world leader in developing and promoting renewable energy , germany 's fostering a boom in the solar technology market . tucked away behind trees in the middle of the countryside , the leipziger land solar power plant wednesday in the eastern german village of espenhain is invisible from the road .
it ’ s only when you drive through the gate and onto the site itself that you ’ re confronted with a vast field full of 33,500 shimmering gray panels tilted towards the sun at precisely 30 degrees - the optimum angle for absorbing radiation . the espenhain site , near leipzig , was a deposit for lignite dust - a type of brown coal - and was thus contaminated and couldn ’ t be used for anything else .
the lignite had to first be buried under 30 cm -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- of earth on the 20-hectare -lrb- 49-acre -rrb- plot , before the three-and-a-half meter high sloping frames which support the panels could be set up . the high performance modules , made of monocrystalline silicon , can handle the high voltage as well as delivering a high energy yield .
each panel produces 150 watts of energy .
the plant cost € 22 million -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- to build and is capable of generating five megawatts of electricity . pioneering change germany ’ s pioneering renewable energy law , which was passed four years ago and amended in april this year , decrees that any electricity producer - including private individuals - get paid for the amount they feed into the national grid .
this has encouraged thousands of people to install solar panels on their houses . it would be impossible to realize a project on the scale of the new plant without that kind of guarantee , according to annett fruehling , a project engineer for berlin-based firm geosol , which was responsible for the plant 's planning and development .
shell solar and siemens provided the equipment and technology . " we get a certain amount , a fixed price for the electricity we produce here , and this price is fixed for the next 20 years .
no bank would give you the money for a plant like this without any security on the other side , " fruehling told dw-radio .
" we can meet the electricity demand of 1,800 households , and , on the other hand , we save about 3,700 tons annually in -lrb- carbon dioxide emissions -rrb- . " " ideal for developing world " geosol is planning another solar plant in borna , not far from espenhain , fruehling said .

" russia 's top general said his country was ready to attack " terrorist bases " anywhere in the caucasus , central asia and other areas near russia .
according to russian news agencies , chief of staff general yuri baluyevsky threatened pre-emptive strikes against organizations harboring terrorists .
" our position on pre-emptive strikes has been stated before , but i will repeat it .
we will take steps to liquidate terrorist bases in any region of the world , " he said after talks with us general james jones , nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
baluyevsky admitted that " military steps are an extreme measure in the fight against terrorism , " and said his country would not revert to the use of the country 's massive nuclear arsenal .
" this does not mean that we will resort to the use of nuclear force , " he said in a statement that has perplexed many european observers .
a first for moscow ?
embroiled in a five-year guerrilla war in rebel chechnya , moscow has frequently staged attacks against the break-away province , but outside its own borders russia has been hesitant to carry out pre-emptive strikes against terrorists .
so far it has only dropped a few bombs on the panskisi gorge in neighboring georgia , where it suspects chechen rebels are hiding and training .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces soldiers take position at the seized school in beslan , north ossetia , friday , sept .
3 , 2004 .
it is therefore all the more surprising that baluyevsky would make such statements , especially since president vladimir putin has not made any comments along the same lines since the hostage-taking crisis in a school in the russian province of north ossetia shocked the country and world a week ago .
a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner emma udwin said the threats would have more weight if coming from the russian president .
" i would pay more attention if it had come from putin , " she said when asked about baluyevsky 's remarks .
kremlin adopts us policy ?
the european commission 's chief spokesman , reijo kemppinen , also dismissed the comments , saying instead : " i think i 've heard that kind of statement before .
not from russia though . "
western analysts said wednesday 's remarks from chief of staff yuri baluyvsky carried echoes of the us doctrine in the " war on terror " of countering threats by launching first strikes , instead of waiting to be attacked .
on the other hand , russia 's sharply limited reach means the general 's warning would apply in practice to former soviet republics in the caucasus and central asia which moscow still regards as its sphere of influence .
" in practice this doctrine can only apply to the countries adjacent to russia which are not part of a global alliance , " jonathan eyal , russia analyst at the royal united services institute in london , told reuters wire service .
us-russian cooperation the chief of staff 's statements came during the first visit to russia by nato 's top commander .
jones , who stressed the two former cold war foes had entered a new friendly relationship since the september 11 attacks in the united states , said the bond between washington and moscow had grown even stronger after the seizing of the school in the town of beslan by terrorists .
" we face common threats and common challenges , " jones said .
" we are entering a period of heightened cooperation against these threats and this is very , very important . "

at least 336 civilians , including hundreds of children , died in the three-day school siege in the north ossetian province which borders chechnya .
the american general referred to the hostage-taking as an " insidious attack . "
just like before the launch of the us-led strike against afghanistan that russia backed in october 2001 as a retaliation for the september 11 attacks staged by the afghan-based al qaeda terror network , the two generals said the beslan attack should redouble the two sides ' efforts to fight terror .
" today international terrorism has become an international force , and only through joint action -lrb- with nato -rrb- can we fight this scourge , " baluyevsky said .
the russian general added that the two sides agreed to exchange information on terror cells around the world and to coordinate a rapid response team to fight them . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : russia needs international solidarity official versions of the hostage drama in north ossetia and the true events on the ground are widely divergent .

some looked like " charcoal briquettes , " said michael knoche , the director of the 338-year-old library .
others , soaked in the water sprayed by firefighters , were several pounds heavier than their original weight . the damage done , it 's up to a team of bookbinders at the privately-run center for book preservation in leipzig to lessen its impact .
as of tuesday , a little more than 25,000 books were declared completely lost .
of the estimated 50,000 pulled from the burning building by a human chain of library employees and volunteers thursday night , more than 35,000 have suffered water damage , some of it heavy .
most of those have already arrived at the center . restoration begins at 20 below zero " it 's been intense , " said manuela reikov-räuchle , the head of the restoration department at the preservation center , in an interview with dw-world .

the race against time - and fungus - begins immediately .
after a quick cleaning with a brush , the books are deep frozen at minus 20 degrees to prevent microbacteria from taking over . for small books , the process is over in 24 hours .
larger ones are frozen for up to three days .
when they emerge from the freezer , they 're put through a process that evaporates the ice immediately into gas .
the same thing is done to dried fruit . knoche has yet to release a list of works currently undergoing restoration .
the bookbinders say there is no way to estimate yet how many of the books will , in fact , be restored to their original form .
money is definitely a factor . prohibitive prices restoration costs 10 euros per kilogram -lrb- 2.2 pounds -rrb- when the book is wet , according to the center .
most of the small books weigh between 1.5 and 2 kg , and the amounts begin skyrocketing when the larger books are factored in .

" there are several tons , " said reikov-räuchle . so far , the federal government has promised € 4 million in emergency money , half of which was transferred on monday , according to museum officials . an account set up for donations from the public has gotten a good reception and a series of benefit concerts are being planned .

the two-story 18th century rococo hall , the building 's extravagant centerpiece , was completely gutted by flames but will eventually be restored , according to seemann .
it could take months , even years to determine whether it will hold the same collection .
some good news came on tuesday with the announcement that around 20,000 books with only minor water damage can be restored by the library itself .
the rest will be handled by the center , which is undertaking its biggest assignment since floods devastated several libraries along the elbe in 2002 .

some looked like " charcoal briquettes , " said michael knoche , the director of the 338-year-old library .
others , soaked in the water sprayed by firefighters , were several pounds heavier than their original weight . the damage done , it 's up to a team of bookbinders at the privately-run center for book preservation in leipzig to lessen its impact .
as of tuesday , a little more than 25,000 books were declared completely lost .
of the estimated 50,000 pulled from the burning building by a human chain of library employees and volunteers thursday night , more than 35,000 have suffered water damage , some of it heavy .
most of those have already arrived at the center . restoration begins at 20 below zero " it 's been intense , " said manuela reikov-räuchle , the head of the restoration department at the preservation center , in an interview with dw-world .

larger ones are frozen for up to three days .
when they emerge from the freezer , they 're put through a process that evaporates the ice immediately into gas .
the same thing is done to dried fruit . knoche has yet to release a list of works currently undergoing restoration .
the bookbinders say there is no way to estimate yet how many of the books will , in fact , be restored to their original form .

" there are several tons , " said reikov-räuchle . so far , the federal government has promised € 4 million in emergency money , half of which was transferred on monday , according to museum officials . an account set up for donations from the public has gotten a good reception and a series of benefit concerts are being planned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.09.2004 learning to learn in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a long way from kabul to saxony for afghan students after years of war and unrest , coming to germany was like a dream for a group of afghan students .
they experienced a completely different type of school , learning with computers and experimenting with creativity . ahmad farhad ’ s face is scarred .
during the war , he and three of his brothers were injured , he says .
he doesn ’ t elaborate , merely stares straight ahead , smiles , and changes the topic .
this exchange , he says , is a miracle .
ahmad is 19 years old and a student at kabul ’ s amani high school .
he and 18 other teenagers came to germany about three weeks ago as part of the first german-afghan student exchange program .
on wednesday , the group flies back home , and will take many memories and new ideas with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls and boys have separate schools in afghanistan .
here a girls class in novobod .
for the 18-year-old atifa formuli , one of the group 's eight girls , the exchange proves that men and women can study and work together .
wearing a simple black suit , and flashing green eyes under her headscarf , she explains what the last three weeks have meant for her : " when we come here it means that the position of girls and boys is equal . "
in kabul , boys and girls only spend the first two school years in the same classroom .
but here , atifa says , we can talk to each other .
atifa is a student at the aishe-e-durani girls school .
both her school and amani high school are backed by the german foreign ministry and offer german language classes .
the best students in each school are chosen to travel to saxony , in eastern germany , explains 16-year-old masih ullah hamkar .
they live with host families and experience going to a german school .
long hair and earrings for masih , just seeing the other students in school was an eye-opening experience .
" boys with long hair and earrings - that was something different , " he says .
" there aren ’ t too many like that in afghanistan .
and the girls dress so differently , too , " he recalls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school in tents in novobod although it was interesting to sit in the classroom with the german students , he says he doesn ’ t think much of discipline at the schools here .
in his country , masih says , students respect their teachers .
back home , as many as 60 students crowd into one classroom and a disciplinary slap in the face is not uncommon when the teacher wants to maintain order .
all the afghan students strive for one thing : to learn , to study , so that later , they can help rebuild their country .
during their stay in germany , they were amazed at the beautiful buildings , shops , highways , trains and the green landscape .
but they were especially interested in experiencing the country 's modern teaching methods .
more than rote learning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computers are still rare in afghanistan .
here young women learn an operation system at the shirzai training academy in kandahar , afghanistan .
" it was a real surprise to see the students go to different classrooms to study , " says mohammed feisal .
the teaching methods are very advanced , with computers and all kinds of technical equipment , he remembers .
" the students can see and experience everything , not just read about things in books .
that surprised me . "
equally impressed by what she saw in the german schools , atifa says she will tell the education ministry in afghanistan how students in germany learn .
she was especially intrigued by a particular creative exercise in which all the students in a classroom listened to music and then each drew their own pictures inspired by the music .
at first she thought such a task would be difficult , but it worked , she says , and she managed to come up with ideas on her own .
a german role model ?
" i saw that every person in germany was responsible for their own acts and worked by themselves .
and because of this they have helped make their country beautiful and clean , " atifa recalls .
" when we go back , we will say to everyone that we can also make our country like this , " she pledges .
atifa 's goal , like that of her classmates , is to help rebuild her country .
in order to do that the students all plan to go on to university and get a degree .
many would even like to study in germany and hope for financial support to do so .

in order to do so , the military alliance will have had to double its contingent from the 5,000 troops currently stationed in the country .
that increase in size corresponds to the pledge made to afghan president hamid karsai by the north atlantic alliance during the istanbul summit in june .

they experienced a completely different type of school , learning with computers and experimenting with creativity . ahmad farhad ’ s face is scarred .
during the war , he and three of his brothers were injured , he says .
he doesn ’ t elaborate , merely stares straight ahead , smiles , and changes the topic .
this exchange , he says , is a miracle .
ahmad is 19 years old and a student at kabul ’ s amani high school .
he and 18 other teenagers came to germany about three weeks ago as part of the first german-afghan student exchange program .
on wednesday , the group flies back home , and will take many memories and new ideas with them .

here a girls class in novobod .
for the 18-year-old atifa formuli , one of the group 's eight girls , the exchange proves that men and women can study and work together .
wearing a simple black suit , and flashing green eyes under her headscarf , she explains what the last three weeks have meant for her : " when we come here it means that the position of girls and boys is equal . "
in kabul , boys and girls only spend the first two school years in the same classroom .
but here , atifa says , we can talk to each other .
atifa is a student at the aishe-e-durani girls school .

but many are too ashamed to take a course .
that 's why a new german initiative offers instruction over the internet . some four million people in germany are illiterate .
even though they went to school , they never learned to read or write properly .
for most of them - adults who have gotten through life with a series of complex compensation strategies - admitting illiteracy is a difficult hurdle to overcome .
only 20,0000 of the country 's so-called functional illiterates -lrb- excluding foreigners who never went to school -rrb- have actually taken advantage of reading courses offered by outreach programs throughout the country .
the rest are often too ashamed to admit their problem by seeking help .
in order to combat illiteracy , a new initiative is being launched in germany to teach reading and writing anonymously via the internet .
on sept .
8 , international literacy day , a special web site goes online to provide individual instruction which serves either as a complement to classroom teaching or as a primary learning source for those not enrolled in a course .
called " alfa-portal literacy learning , " or apoll for short , the site is financed by the federal ministry for education and research .
less pressure on the pc " the biggest problem for a functioning illiterate is to out oneself , to take the first step of signing up for a course , " said christian fiebig , director of the apoll project .
" through the e-learning portal , we offer the possibility of learning anonymously without having to out oneself , " he told dw-world .
in the future some 17,000 instruction exercises will be available on the site for illiterates to set up their own individual learning plan .
the only prerequisite is that the internet user recognize the address of the web site , www.ich-will-schreiben-lernen.de -lrb- in english : i want to learn to write -rrb- , and save the url as a favorite to visit over and over again .
once at the site , they will be guided through a special tutorial that reads all the instructions and texts out loud .
learning any time at any pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading is a pleasure illiterates never get to appreciate the e-learning page asks each illiterate to evaluate their own skills and then conducts a short test to determine placement within the online course .
before instruction begins , the computer program asks each participant what their goal is : whether they want to be able to read and fill out official forms and deal with bureaucracy , read books or simply improve daily life .
each literacy participant receives an individually outlined program of instruction and exercises to complete for the week .
in the early stages of instruction audio clips and little pictures assist the literacy learner .
later , short news texts and stories will be provided as practice .
the apoll program offers participants the possibility to set the pace and learning intervals according to their own time frame , fiebig explained .
of course that means the illiterate sitting at home in front of the computer requires a good deal of self-discipline .
for this reason fiebig and his colleagues strongly encourage the e-learning participants to take a parallel classroom course .
to encourage learning and motivate the often frustrated participants , the apoll project also offers telephone advice and provides a forum for learners to communicate with one another via voicemail .
adult learners according to fiebig , working with the computer and internet is not a problem for the majority of illiterates .
" the computer and especially the internet are new types of media , and our target audience is very open to them . "
a study conducted recently showed that one-third of all illiterates in germany have a computer and internet connections , albeit mostly for entertainment purposes .

most of them are between 30 and 45 years old , said fiebig .
once they reach their mid-adult years , " the difficulties and suffering connected to illiteracy become so significant , that illiterates no longer advance at work or are unable to follow what their children do in school , " said the apoll director .
" we also know that illiteracy isolates , " fiebig added - 51 percent of the target learners are singles .
expanding the literacy program in the long term , apoll hopes to expand their e-learning programs for foreigners living in germany , who never learned to read and write in their native language , let alone german .
because illiteracy is a world problem , and one which is particularly acute in developing countries , the institute for international cooperation -lrb- iz -rrb- in bonn is considering exporting a computer-supported initiative to combat illiteracy in developing countries .
if created , it could be germany 's contribution to the united nation 's decade of literacy , which the organization established in 2003 .

but many are too ashamed to take a course .
that 's why a new german initiative offers instruction over the internet . some four million people in germany are illiterate .
even though they went to school , they never learned to read or write properly .
for most of them - adults who have gotten through life with a series of complex compensation strategies - admitting illiteracy is a difficult hurdle to overcome .
only 20,0000 of the country 's so-called functional illiterates -lrb- excluding foreigners who never went to school -rrb- have actually taken advantage of reading courses offered by outreach programs throughout the country .
the rest are often too ashamed to admit their problem by seeking help .
in order to combat illiteracy , a new initiative is being launched in germany to teach reading and writing anonymously via the internet .
on sept .
8 , international literacy day , a special web site goes online to provide individual instruction which serves either as a complement to classroom teaching or as a primary learning source for those not enrolled in a course .
called " alfa-portal literacy learning , " or apoll for short , the site is financed by the federal ministry for education and research .
less pressure on the pc " the biggest problem for a functioning illiterate is to out oneself , to take the first step of signing up for a course , " said christian fiebig , director of the apoll project .
" through the e-learning portal , we offer the possibility of learning anonymously without having to out oneself , " he told dw-world .
in the future some 17,000 instruction exercises will be available on the site for illiterates to set up their own individual learning plan .
the only prerequisite is that the internet user recognize the address of the web site , www.ich-will-schreiben-lernen.de -lrb- in english : i want to learn to write -rrb- , and save the url as a favorite to visit over and over again .
once at the site , they will be guided through a special tutorial that reads all the instructions and texts out loud .
learning any time at any pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading is a pleasure illiterates never get to appreciate the e-learning page asks each illiterate to evaluate their own skills and then conducts a short test to determine placement within the online course .
before instruction begins , the computer program asks each participant what their goal is : whether they want to be able to read and fill out official forms and deal with bureaucracy , read books or simply improve daily life .
each literacy participant receives an individually outlined program of instruction and exercises to complete for the week .
in the early stages of instruction audio clips and little pictures assist the literacy learner .
later , short news texts and stories will be provided as practice .
the apoll program offers participants the possibility to set the pace and learning intervals according to their own time frame , fiebig explained .
of course that means the illiterate sitting at home in front of the computer requires a good deal of self-discipline .
for this reason fiebig and his colleagues strongly encourage the e-learning participants to take a parallel classroom course .
to encourage learning and motivate the often frustrated participants , the apoll project also offers telephone advice and provides a forum for learners to communicate with one another via voicemail .
adult learners according to fiebig , working with the computer and internet is not a problem for the majority of illiterates .
" the computer and especially the internet are new types of media , and our target audience is very open to them . "
a study conducted recently showed that one-third of all illiterates in germany have a computer and internet connections , albeit mostly for entertainment purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading a train schedule is a real challenge for germany 's illiterates the majority of literacy learners are adults , equally divided between men and women .
most of them are between 30 and 45 years old , said fiebig .
once they reach their mid-adult years , " the difficulties and suffering connected to illiteracy become so significant , that illiterates no longer advance at work or are unable to follow what their children do in school , " said the apoll director .
" we also know that illiteracy isolates , " fiebig added - 51 percent of the target learners are singles .
expanding the literacy program in the long term , apoll hopes to expand their e-learning programs for foreigners living in germany , who never learned to read and write in their native language , let alone german .
because illiteracy is a world problem , and one which is particularly acute in developing countries , the institute for international cooperation -lrb- iz -rrb- in bonn is considering exporting a computer-supported initiative to combat illiteracy in developing countries .
if created , it could be germany 's contribution to the united nation 's decade of literacy , which the organization established in 2003 .
at the moment , an e-learning project similar to the apoll project is in the works in india . monika hoegen -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trapped in illiteracy the european parliament has called for measures to combat illiteracy and social exclusion - a still widespread deficit across europe .

" a coach could n't wish for a better opportunity , " beamed klinsmann at the pre-match press conference on tuesday .
" i 'm absolutely convinced there will be an explosive atmosphere . " " this fixture is a classic and every single player will be particularly motivated , " klinsmann added .
" i want the players to be more active , to move the ball forward quickly and to always do what 's best for the team .

" we want to know where the team stands 21 months before the 2006 world cup , which is so important for german football , " bierhoff told the assembled reporters on tuesday . players dismiss talk of revenge the players themselves are also unconcerned about avenging the heart-breaking defeat in yokohama .

" we want to know where the team stands 21 months before the 2006 world cup , which is so important for german football , " bierhoff told the assembled reporters on tuesday . players dismiss talk of revenge the players themselves are also unconcerned about avenging the heart-breaking defeat in yokohama .
" talking about revenge is absurd , " bayern munich goalkeeper oliver kahn told magazine kicker .
" you can not compare a world cup final with a friendly match . " meanwhile , brazilian-born germany striker kevin kuranyi also has other things on his mind , like showing the country of his birth what it let slip away .

soldiers , both from the us and the former soviet union , were no longer needed in the reunified city and the americans either went home or to still-existent bases in southern germany . before they left , 75,000 berliners lined the route upon which the us forces would parade for the last time .

but many are too ashamed to take a course .
that 's why a new german initiative offers instruction over the internet . some four million people in germany are illiterate .
even though they went to school , they never learned to read or write properly .
for most of them - adults who have gotten through life with a series of complex compensation strategies - admitting illiteracy is a difficult hurdle to overcome .
only 20,0000 of the country 's so-called functional illiterates -lrb- excluding foreigners who never went to school -rrb- have actually taken advantage of reading courses offered by outreach programs throughout the country .
the rest are often too ashamed to admit their problem by seeking help .
in order to combat illiteracy , a new initiative is being launched in germany to teach reading and writing anonymously via the internet .
on sept .
8 , international literacy day , a special web site goes online to provide individual instruction which serves either as a complement to classroom teaching or as a primary learning source for those not enrolled in a course .
called " alfa-portal literacy learning , " or apoll for short , the site is financed by the federal ministry for education and research .
less pressure on the pc " the biggest problem for a functioning illiterate is to out oneself , to take the first step of signing up for a course , " said christian fiebig , director of the apoll project .
" through the e-learning portal , we offer the possibility of learning anonymously without having to out oneself , " he told dw-world .
in the future some 17,000 instruction exercises will be available on the site for illiterates to set up their own individual learning plan .
the only prerequisite is that the internet user recognize the address of the web site , www.ich-will-schreiben-lernen.de -lrb- in english : i want to learn to write -rrb- , and save the url as a favorite to visit over and over again .
once at the site , they will be guided through a special tutorial that reads all the instructions and texts out loud .
learning any time at any pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading is a pleasure illiterates never get to appreciate the e-learning page asks each illiterate to evaluate their own skills and then conducts a short test to determine placement within the online course .
before instruction begins , the computer program asks each participant what their goal is : whether they want to be able to read and fill out official forms and deal with bureaucracy , read books or simply improve daily life .
each literacy participant receives an individually outlined program of instruction and exercises to complete for the week .
in the early stages of instruction audio clips and little pictures assist the literacy learner .
later , short news texts and stories will be provided as practice .
the apoll program offers participants the possibility to set the pace and learning intervals according to their own time frame , fiebig explained .
of course that means the illiterate sitting at home in front of the computer requires a good deal of self-discipline .
for this reason fiebig and his colleagues strongly encourage the e-learning participants to take a parallel classroom course .
to encourage learning and motivate the often frustrated participants , the apoll project also offers telephone advice and provides a forum for learners to communicate with one another via voicemail .
adult learners according to fiebig , working with the computer and internet is not a problem for the majority of illiterates .
" the computer and especially the internet are new types of media , and our target audience is very open to them . "
a study conducted recently showed that one-third of all illiterates in germany have a computer and internet connections , albeit mostly for entertainment purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading a train schedule is a real challenge for germany 's illiterates the majority of literacy learners are adults , equally divided between men and women .
most of them are between 30 and 45 years old , said fiebig .
once they reach their mid-adult years , " the difficulties and suffering connected to illiteracy become so significant , that illiterates no longer advance at work or are unable to follow what their children do in school , " said the apoll director .
" we also know that illiteracy isolates , " fiebig added - 51 percent of the target learners are singles .
expanding the literacy program in the long term , apoll hopes to expand their e-learning programs for foreigners living in germany , who never learned to read and write in their native language , let alone german .
because illiteracy is a world problem , and one which is particularly acute in developing countries , the institute for international cooperation -lrb- iz -rrb- in bonn is considering exporting a computer-supported initiative to combat illiteracy in developing countries .
if created , it could be germany 's contribution to the united nation 's decade of literacy , which the organization established in 2003 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.09.2004 rocking in german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 2raumwohnung " are making german lyrics popular again young german musicians are opting to sing in their native tongue .
in both style and spirit , many resemble their predecessors of the " neue deutsche welle " -lrb- german new wave -rrb- , which rocked out german-style in the eighties . instead of cranking out cookie-cutter pop hits in english that currently dominate germany 's airwaves , a growing number of young germans are choosing to sing auf deutsch .
they are picking up on the tradition of acts such as nena , trio and falco - who helped make music with german lyrics in the late 1970s and early 1980s popular . deutsche welle interviewed the members of " 2raumwohnung , " inga humpe and tommie eckart , who along with bands like " wir sind helden " are launching the second wave . the name " 2raumwohnung " -lrb- 2-room apartment -rrb- has a lot of symbolic meaning related to german history .
how would you explain the name to your fans abroad ? tommi : the name originally comes from the fact that we 're two people and this is a two person project .
but then , of course , there 's this funny situation : due to the wall and the division between east and west , the language was also divided .
now , 15 years after the fall of the wall , there are still differences , and germans from the east and west have different ways of describing a two-room apartment because they prefer to use different words for room : " zimmer " in the west and " raum " in the east .
we took this linguistic anomaly to be a synonym for berlin , and since we are from the west we incorporated the " raum " into our name to represent a kind of connection . what is your relationship to the german language like ?
foreigners often describe the language as hard , but in your music you make it sound light and soft . inga : that 's true .
after i sing in german , i also think the language is quite hard .
we take great pains to make it sound softer .
but we also have a bit of experience singing in english .
now we have decided to record some of our songs in english , like " sexy girl " and " spiel mit , " which is on the premium version of our cd .
and just yesterday , we recorded an english version of " wir sind anderen . " i recently heard from toni kater , a berlin musician who is on the same label , that when she first met both of you , she identified your band with the " berlin scene . "
do you identify with any " scene " at all , and to what extent is your music tied to the city of berlin ? inga : with the " scene " no , but definitely with the city .
there are so many " scenes " in berlin , but the city is an important source of inspiration for us .
without berlin , we probably would n't exist .
berlin is so big and multi-faceted , and there 's so much freedom here that many different varieties of music can develop .
it 's nice , i think , to be connected to the soul of this city .
i will always be in love with berlin . when you write your songs , do you have a specific public in mind ? tommi : we try to make the kind of music we would enjoy and compose songs we would want to listen to , even if we were n't writing it ourselves .
that 's also how we approached the new album : even if we had n't made it ourselves , would we want to listen to it ?
at least this is what we always try and do .
we do n't have a particular person or listener in mind .
we simply make music for ourselves and for our friends .
i think our fans are not so different than we are . from which musical genre does " 2raumwohnung " draw inspiration ? tommi : we try to draw upon everything we like .
we are just as inspired by air and madonna as by miss kittin and märtini brös .
even older music , like kraftwerk and music from the ' 70s , has influenced us . what are you listening to at the moment ? tommi : i am listening to lots of air at the moment , and i love phoenix .
i guess i listen to other things too , like chet baker … the german press recently accused you of being too optimistic and not political enough .
do you have a response to them ?
and why are you so optimistic ? tommi : first of all , i think it is very important to be optimistic .
when we make music , we are simply in a good mood and people can tell .
but i also do n't agree that our music is not political .
when someone takes their own feelings seriously and shares it with other people , then it is perhaps not - strictly speaking - political , but it certainly has a greater meaning for society . inga : it was a very deliberate decision to be optimistic and to remain optimistic .
i think it 's not the best choice - just because the times are hard - to whine and complain along with everyone else .
instead , people should ask themselves what they can do to make things better for themselves and for everyone others .
i think positive thinking is the basis of that .
and besides , i do n't really understand why the germans complain so much - things are n't really that bad . do you plan on touring abroad ? inga : yes , lots .
we are always getting offers from brazil and mexico . tommi : sadly , it has n't worked out in brazil .
but we 've already played in russia and in japan and we have plans for concerts in spain and turkey . look for " 2raumwohnung " and other representatives of the new " german wave " at a venue near you soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy .

in both style and spirit , many resemble their predecessors of the " neue deutsche welle " -lrb- german new wave -rrb- , which rocked out german-style in the eighties . instead of cranking out cookie-cutter pop hits in english that currently dominate germany 's airwaves , a growing number of young germans are choosing to sing auf deutsch .
they are picking up on the tradition of acts such as nena , trio and falco - who helped make music with german lyrics in the late 1970s and early 1980s popular . deutsche welle interviewed the members of " 2raumwohnung , " inga humpe and tommie eckart , who along with bands like " wir sind helden " are launching the second wave . the name " 2raumwohnung " -lrb- 2-room apartment -rrb- has a lot of symbolic meaning related to german history .
how would you explain the name to your fans abroad ? tommi : the name originally comes from the fact that we 're two people and this is a two person project .
but then , of course , there 's this funny situation : due to the wall and the division between east and west , the language was also divided .
now , 15 years after the fall of the wall , there are still differences , and germans from the east and west have different ways of describing a two-room apartment because they prefer to use different words for room : " zimmer " in the west and " raum " in the east .
we took this linguistic anomaly to be a synonym for berlin , and since we are from the west we incorporated the " raum " into our name to represent a kind of connection . what is your relationship to the german language like ?
foreigners often describe the language as hard , but in your music you make it sound light and soft . inga : that 's true .
after i sing in german , i also think the language is quite hard .
we take great pains to make it sound softer .
but we also have a bit of experience singing in english .
now we have decided to record some of our songs in english , like " sexy girl " and " spiel mit , " which is on the premium version of our cd .
and just yesterday , we recorded an english version of " wir sind anderen . " i recently heard from toni kater , a berlin musician who is on the same label , that when she first met both of you , she identified your band with the " berlin scene . "
do you identify with any " scene " at all , and to what extent is your music tied to the city of berlin ? inga : with the " scene " no , but definitely with the city .
there are so many " scenes " in berlin , but the city is an important source of inspiration for us .
without berlin , we probably would n't exist .
berlin is so big and multi-faceted , and there 's so much freedom here that many different varieties of music can develop .
it 's nice , i think , to be connected to the soul of this city .
i will always be in love with berlin . when you write your songs , do you have a specific public in mind ? tommi : we try to make the kind of music we would enjoy and compose songs we would want to listen to , even if we were n't writing it ourselves .
that 's also how we approached the new album : even if we had n't made it ourselves , would we want to listen to it ?
at least this is what we always try and do .
we do n't have a particular person or listener in mind .
we simply make music for ourselves and for our friends .
i think our fans are not so different than we are . from which musical genre does " 2raumwohnung " draw inspiration ? tommi : we try to draw upon everything we like .
we are just as inspired by air and madonna as by miss kittin and märtini brös .
even older music , like kraftwerk and music from the ' 70s , has influenced us . what are you listening to at the moment ? tommi : i am listening to lots of air at the moment , and i love phoenix .
i guess i listen to other things too , like chet baker … the german press recently accused you of being too optimistic and not political enough .
do you have a response to them ?
and why are you so optimistic ? tommi : first of all , i think it is very important to be optimistic .
when we make music , we are simply in a good mood and people can tell .
but i also do n't agree that our music is not political .
when someone takes their own feelings seriously and shares it with other people , then it is perhaps not - strictly speaking - political , but it certainly has a greater meaning for society . inga : it was a very deliberate decision to be optimistic and to remain optimistic .
i think it 's not the best choice - just because the times are hard - to whine and complain along with everyone else .
instead , people should ask themselves what they can do to make things better for themselves and for everyone others .
i think positive thinking is the basis of that .
and besides , i do n't really understand why the germans complain so much - things are n't really that bad . do you plan on touring abroad ? inga : yes , lots .
we are always getting offers from brazil and mexico . tommi : sadly , it has n't worked out in brazil .
but we 've already played in russia and in japan and we have plans for concerts in spain and turkey . look for " 2raumwohnung " and other representatives of the new " german wave " at a venue near you soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy .

nato troops are expected to provide the much needed security for the historic event , but experts worry the alliance may be ill prepared for the job . when the more than 10 million eligible afghans go to the polls on oct .
9 , some 10,000 nato soldiers will be guaranteeing their safety .
in order to do so , the military alliance will have had to double its contingent from the 5,000 troops currently stationed in the country .
that increase in size corresponds to the pledge made to afghan president hamid karsai by the north atlantic alliance during the istanbul summit in june .
after a lengthy internal tug-of-war , the member states had agreed to boost their presence in the country in order to help ensure that the historical first elections take place peacefully .

they will be part of the expanded nato security force .
" the nato contingent in afghanistan will be significantly strengthened in time for the elections , " announced the military alliance 's spokeswoman simone de manso .
the deployment is already underway and should be completed in time for the elections , she added .
" the additional troops will consist of an italian and a spanish battalion as well as a us reserve battalion stationed outside afghanistan , " said manso .
according to nato plans , the new troops are not intended as a permanent expansion of the current military presence in the country .
although the troops are only there to secure the election , " manso said they will " remain in afghanistan for as long as the local commander deems it necessary . "
false priorities despite the commitment to security , not everyone is convinced nato is approaching the elections realistically .
" i regard the whole situation as a mid-size farce , " argued albert stahel , professor for strategic military studies at the technical university in zurich .
the international community has set false priorities and is placing itself under unnecessary time pressure , stahel told dw-world .
" the elections are coming light years too early , as afghanistan is no where close to being mature enough for democracy , " he maintained .

an election could be held once the much more crucial reconstruction work is completed - in a couple of years , stahel added .
the swiss expert also warned of placing too much faith in the elections .
" of course it will not be an election according to western democratic standards , " he said .
and in order to guarantee that the elections throughout the country take place freely and peacefully , a much larger military presence will be necessary .
" if one wanted to ensure that the election takes place more or less orderly , that can not be done with just 10,000 soldiers , " he stressed .
at the same time , though , the election can not be postponed , admitted stahel .
the international community can not change the timeframe with such short notice .
" if the election date is pushed back , the united nations , nato and the united states would risk losing face and the population in afghanistan would not go along with it either .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.09.2004 russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says it reserves the right to pre-emptively hit terror bases in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases . " russia 's top general said his country was ready to attack " terrorist bases " anywhere in the caucasus , central asia and other areas near russia .
according to russian news agencies , chief of staff general yuri baluyevsky threatened pre-emptive strikes against organizations harboring terrorists .
" our position on pre-emptive strikes has been stated before , but i will repeat it .
we will take steps to liquidate terrorist bases in any region of the world , " he said after talks with us general james jones , nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
baluyevsky admitted that " military steps are an extreme measure in the fight against terrorism , " and said his country would not revert to the use of the country 's massive nuclear arsenal .
" this does not mean that we will resort to the use of nuclear force , " he said in a statement that has perplexed many european observers .
a first for moscow ?
embroiled in a five-year guerrilla war in rebel chechnya , moscow has frequently staged attacks against the break-away province , but outside its own borders russia has been hesitant to carry out pre-emptive strikes against terrorists .
so far it has only dropped a few bombs on the panskisi gorge in neighboring georgia , where it suspects chechen rebels are hiding and training .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces soldiers take position at the seized school in beslan , north ossetia , friday , sept .
3 , 2004 .
it is therefore all the more surprising that baluyevsky would make such statements , especially since president vladimir putin has not made any comments along the same lines since the hostage-taking crisis in a school in the russian province of north ossetia shocked the country and world a week ago .
a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner emma udwin said the threats would have more weight if coming from the russian president .
" i would pay more attention if it had come from putin , " she said when asked about baluyevsky 's remarks .
kremlin adopts us policy ?
the european commission 's chief spokesman , reijo kemppinen , also dismissed the comments , saying instead : " i think i 've heard that kind of statement before .
not from russia though . "
western analysts said wednesday 's remarks from chief of staff yuri baluyvsky carried echoes of the us doctrine in the " war on terror " of countering threats by launching first strikes , instead of waiting to be attacked .
on the other hand , russia 's sharply limited reach means the general 's warning would apply in practice to former soviet republics in the caucasus and central asia which moscow still regards as its sphere of influence .
" in practice this doctrine can only apply to the countries adjacent to russia which are not part of a global alliance , " jonathan eyal , russia analyst at the royal united services institute in london , told reuters wire service .
us-russian cooperation the chief of staff 's statements came during the first visit to russia by nato 's top commander .
jones , who stressed the two former cold war foes had entered a new friendly relationship since the september 11 attacks in the united states , said the bond between washington and moscow had grown even stronger after the seizing of the school in the town of beslan by terrorists .
" we face common threats and common challenges , " jones said .
" we are entering a period of heightened cooperation against these threats and this is very , very important . "

the footage was shot by one of the terrorists .
at least 336 civilians , including hundreds of children , died in the three-day school siege in the north ossetian province which borders chechnya .
the american general referred to the hostage-taking as an " insidious attack . "
just like before the launch of the us-led strike against afghanistan that russia backed in october 2001 as a retaliation for the september 11 attacks staged by the afghan-based al qaeda terror network , the two generals said the beslan attack should redouble the two sides ' efforts to fight terror .
" today international terrorism has become an international force , and only through joint action -lrb- with nato -rrb- can we fight this scourge , " baluyevsky said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bratwurst and burgers german-americans : more than bratwurst & beer " fahrenheit 9/11 " set to heat up germany one year later , germany anything but smug over iraq war us investors still like germany current affairs -pipe- 08.09.2004 when germans cheered us soldiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin brigade lowers the stars & stripes for the last time a decade ago wednesday , the united states closed one of its longest military chapters with the pullout of american troops out of berlin . the sight of tens of thousands of berliners cheering american troops is something hard to imagine nowadays . when the u.s. began its military invasion of iraq in march 2003 , hundreds of thousands of berlin residents took to the streets to protest against the war . the german government 's steadfast opposition to the us military invasion of iraq in 2003 was anchored in the anti-war sentiments of its population . ten years ago , the story was a different one .
after more than 40 years in which they kept west berlin safe from the looming soviet threat , the final 2,000 soldiers pulled out of berlin on sept .
8 , 1994 .
soldiers , both from the us and the former soviet union , were no longer needed in the reunified city and the americans either went home or to still-existent bases in southern germany . before they left , 75,000 berliners lined the route upon which the us forces would parade for the last time .
they cheered the soldiers and a bundeswehr battalion was on hand to salute the outgoing troops . the decades together in berlin , the last bastion of west germany in the middle of the gdr , had sparked a special relationship between americans and west berliners .
at the latest , the love affair began in 1948 when the soviet union tried to hermetically seal off west berlin and force france , great britain and the u.s. to give up on the city . berlin airlift seals love affair the us responded by flying in humanitarian aid to tempelhof airport .
the so-called " raisin bombers " brought in desperately-needed supplies , flying their way into the hearts of the west berliners in the process . " above all , we learned what solidarity in the most dire emergency means , " former mayor eberhard diepgen remembered .
" the desire for freedom on the part of the berliners convinced the western world of germany 's will never to live under tyrants again . " the soviet union eventually gave up its attempt on grabbing west berlin .
the allied troops stayed , dividing up the divided city into three different sectors .
they did the same in the rest of germany in an effort to protect the country both from the ussr and itself , according to foreign policy scholar ingo peters . " stationing the troops was important , as a sort of insurance , so that what happened here , germany would n't do again , " peters told deutsche welle . germany 's new role in the world after reunification , allied soldiers were no longer needed .
upon their departure from the eventual german capital , chancellor helmut kohl told the troops that germany had learned by their example . " you can rely on us .
germany will never stand aside when peace and freedom are at stake in the world , " kohl said . german foreign policy has made good on that promise .
the country has come a long way from a policy of non-intervention under the protection of allied troops .

the friendly in berlin will be all about germany 's future not its past . germany 's new national team chief jürgen klinsmann pits his fledgling coaching skills against the world champions brazil on wednesday night in his first real test as head of the country 's soccer stars . and the former germany striker is optimistic his fully fit and highly motivated side can build on the 3-1 success over austria in his first game to wipe away the still painful memories of the 2-0 defeat at the hands of the brazilians in the 2002 world cup final . " a coach could n't wish for a better opportunity , " beamed klinsmann at the pre-match press conference on tuesday .
" i 'm absolutely convinced there will be an explosive atmosphere . " " this fixture is a classic and every single player will be particularly motivated , " klinsmann added .
" i want the players to be more active , to move the ball forward quickly and to always do what 's best for the team .
i also want them to believe in themselves because football is very much a mental thing . " first home game will be crucial klinsmann will be facing a home crowd for the first time in his short reign since he took over the running of the national team from rudi völler after the euro 2004 debacle .

" we want to know where the team stands 21 months before the 2006 world cup , which is so important for german football , " bierhoff told the assembled reporters on tuesday . players dismiss talk of revenge the players themselves are also unconcerned about avenging the heart-breaking defeat in yokohama .

according to russian news agencies , chief of staff general yuri baluyevsky threatened pre-emptive strikes against organizations harboring terrorists .
" our position on pre-emptive strikes has been stated before , but i will repeat it .
we will take steps to liquidate terrorist bases in any region of the world , " he said after talks with us general james jones , nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
baluyevsky admitted that " military steps are an extreme measure in the fight against terrorism , " and said his country would not revert to the use of the country 's massive nuclear arsenal .
" this does not mean that we will resort to the use of nuclear force , " he said in a statement that has perplexed many european observers .
a first for moscow ?
embroiled in a five-year guerrilla war in rebel chechnya , moscow has frequently staged attacks against the break-away province , but outside its own borders russia has been hesitant to carry out pre-emptive strikes against terrorists .
so far it has only dropped a few bombs on the panskisi gorge in neighboring georgia , where it suspects chechen rebels are hiding and training .

3 , 2004 .
it is therefore all the more surprising that baluyevsky would make such statements , especially since president vladimir putin has not made any comments along the same lines since the hostage-taking crisis in a school in the russian province of north ossetia shocked the country and world a week ago .
a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner emma udwin said the threats would have more weight if coming from the russian president .
" i would pay more attention if it had come from putin , " she said when asked about baluyevsky 's remarks .
kremlin adopts us policy ?
the european commission 's chief spokesman , reijo kemppinen , also dismissed the comments , saying instead : " i think i 've heard that kind of statement before .
not from russia though . "
western analysts said wednesday 's remarks from chief of staff yuri baluyvsky carried echoes of the us doctrine in the " war on terror " of countering threats by launching first strikes , instead of waiting to be attacked .
on the other hand , russia 's sharply limited reach means the general 's warning would apply in practice to former soviet republics in the caucasus and central asia which moscow still regards as its sphere of influence .
" in practice this doctrine can only apply to the countries adjacent to russia which are not part of a global alliance , " jonathan eyal , russia analyst at the royal united services institute in london , told reuters wire service .
us-russian cooperation the chief of staff 's statements came during the first visit to russia by nato 's top commander .
jones , who stressed the two former cold war foes had entered a new friendly relationship since the september 11 attacks in the united states , said the bond between washington and moscow had grown even stronger after the seizing of the school in the town of beslan by terrorists .
" we face common threats and common challenges , " jones said .
" we are entering a period of heightened cooperation against these threats and this is very , very important . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tv grab from russian ntv showing a terrorist standing guard over hostages inside the school gymnasium in beslan , north ossetia .
the footage was shot by one of the terrorists .
at least 336 civilians , including hundreds of children , died in the three-day school siege in the north ossetian province which borders chechnya .
the american general referred to the hostage-taking as an " insidious attack . "
just like before the launch of the us-led strike against afghanistan that russia backed in october 2001 as a retaliation for the september 11 attacks staged by the afghan-based al qaeda terror network , the two generals said the beslan attack should redouble the two sides ' efforts to fight terror .
" today international terrorism has become an international force , and only through joint action -lrb- with nato -rrb- can we fight this scourge , " baluyevsky said .
the russian general added that the two sides agreed to exchange information on terror cells around the world and to coordinate a rapid response team to fight them . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : russia needs international solidarity official versions of the hostage drama in north ossetia and the true events on the ground are widely divergent .

a world leader in developing and promoting renewable energy , germany 's fostering a boom in the solar technology market . tucked away behind trees in the middle of the countryside , the leipziger land solar power plant wednesday in the eastern german village of espenhain is invisible from the road .
it ’ s only when you drive through the gate and onto the site itself that you ’ re confronted with a vast field full of 33,500 shimmering gray panels tilted towards the sun at precisely 30 degrees - the optimum angle for absorbing radiation . the espenhain site , near leipzig , was a deposit for lignite dust - a type of brown coal - and was thus contaminated and couldn ’ t be used for anything else .
the lignite had to first be buried under 30 cm -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- of earth on the 20-hectare -lrb- 49-acre -rrb- plot , before the three-and-a-half meter high sloping frames which support the panels could be set up . the high performance modules , made of monocrystalline silicon , can handle the high voltage as well as delivering a high energy yield .
each panel produces 150 watts of energy .
the plant cost € 22 million -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- to build and is capable of generating five megawatts of electricity . pioneering change germany ’ s pioneering renewable energy law , which was passed four years ago and amended in april this year , decrees that any electricity producer - including private individuals - get paid for the amount they feed into the national grid .
this has encouraged thousands of people to install solar panels on their houses . it would be impossible to realize a project on the scale of the new plant without that kind of guarantee , according to annett fruehling , a project engineer for berlin-based firm geosol , which was responsible for the plant 's planning and development .

the friendly in berlin will be all about germany 's future not its past . germany 's new national team chief jürgen klinsmann pits his fledgling coaching skills against the world champions brazil on wednesday night in his first real test as head of the country 's soccer stars . and the former germany striker is optimistic his fully fit and highly motivated side can build on the 3-1 success over austria in his first game to wipe away the still painful memories of the 2-0 defeat at the hands of the brazilians in the 2002 world cup final . " a coach could n't wish for a better opportunity , " beamed klinsmann at the pre-match press conference on tuesday .
" i 'm absolutely convinced there will be an explosive atmosphere . " " this fixture is a classic and every single player will be particularly motivated , " klinsmann added .
" i want the players to be more active , to move the ball forward quickly and to always do what 's best for the team .
i also want them to believe in themselves because football is very much a mental thing . " first home game will be crucial klinsmann will be facing a home crowd for the first time in his short reign since he took over the running of the national team from rudi völler after the euro 2004 debacle .
the former bayern munich , inter milan and monaco striker is hoping to get the support of a skeptical audience in berlin 's renovated olympic stadium where the friendly match is being played . bildunterschrift : joachim löw , jürgen klinsmann and oliver bierhoff want new scores settled not old ones .
despite being the first meeting between the two teams since germany 's stumble at the final hurdle at the world cup in japan / korea in 2002 , the coaching team of klinsmann , fellow ex-striker oliver bierhoff and joachim löw have been quick to play down talk of a revenge match against the team that ended germany 's improbable shot at glory two years ago , preferring to look to the future rather than the past . " we want to know where the team stands 21 months before the 2006 world cup , which is so important for german football , " bierhoff told the assembled reporters on tuesday . players dismiss talk of revenge the players themselves are also unconcerned about avenging the heart-breaking defeat in yokohama .

" you can not compare a world cup final with a friendly match . " meanwhile , brazilian-born germany striker kevin kuranyi also has other things on his mind , like showing the country of his birth what it let slip away .

the friendly in berlin will be all about germany 's future not its past . germany 's new national team chief jürgen klinsmann pits his fledgling coaching skills against the world champions brazil on wednesday night in his first real test as head of the country 's soccer stars . and the former germany striker is optimistic his fully fit and highly motivated side can build on the 3-1 success over austria in his first game to wipe away the still painful memories of the 2-0 defeat at the hands of the brazilians in the 2002 world cup final . " a coach could n't wish for a better opportunity , " beamed klinsmann at the pre-match press conference on tuesday .
" i 'm absolutely convinced there will be an explosive atmosphere . " " this fixture is a classic and every single player will be particularly motivated , " klinsmann added .
" i want the players to be more active , to move the ball forward quickly and to always do what 's best for the team .
i also want them to believe in themselves because football is very much a mental thing . " first home game will be crucial klinsmann will be facing a home crowd for the first time in his short reign since he took over the running of the national team from rudi völler after the euro 2004 debacle .
the former bayern munich , inter milan and monaco striker is hoping to get the support of a skeptical audience in berlin 's renovated olympic stadium where the friendly match is being played . bildunterschrift : joachim löw , jürgen klinsmann and oliver bierhoff want new scores settled not old ones .

a world leader in developing and promoting renewable energy , germany 's fostering a boom in the solar technology market . tucked away behind trees in the middle of the countryside , the leipziger land solar power plant wednesday in the eastern german village of espenhain is invisible from the road .
it ’ s only when you drive through the gate and onto the site itself that you ’ re confronted with a vast field full of 33,500 shimmering gray panels tilted towards the sun at precisely 30 degrees - the optimum angle for absorbing radiation . the espenhain site , near leipzig , was a deposit for lignite dust - a type of brown coal - and was thus contaminated and couldn ’ t be used for anything else .
the lignite had to first be buried under 30 cm -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- of earth on the 20-hectare -lrb- 49-acre -rrb- plot , before the three-and-a-half meter high sloping frames which support the panels could be set up . the high performance modules , made of monocrystalline silicon , can handle the high voltage as well as delivering a high energy yield .
each panel produces 150 watts of energy .
the plant cost € 22 million -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- to build and is capable of generating five megawatts of electricity . pioneering change germany ’ s pioneering renewable energy law , which was passed four years ago and amended in april this year , decrees that any electricity producer - including private individuals - get paid for the amount they feed into the national grid .
this has encouraged thousands of people to install solar panels on their houses . it would be impossible to realize a project on the scale of the new plant without that kind of guarantee , according to annett fruehling , a project engineer for berlin-based firm geosol , which was responsible for the plant 's planning and development .
shell solar and siemens provided the equipment and technology . " we get a certain amount , a fixed price for the electricity we produce here , and this price is fixed for the next 20 years .
no bank would give you the money for a plant like this without any security on the other side , " fruehling told dw-radio .
" we can meet the electricity demand of 1,800 households , and , on the other hand , we save about 3,700 tons annually in -lrb- carbon dioxide emissions -rrb- . " " ideal for developing world " geosol is planning another solar plant in borna , not far from espenhain , fruehling said .
but the technology should n't be limited to the developed world , ronald uppmann , press officer of the german solar industry association solar e.v. , said .
due to the ease and speed with which solar modules can be installed , this type of clean energy is ideal for use in developing countries , uppmann said . " in wind energy and in photovoltaics and in solar thermal technologies germany is one of the leading nations in the world , uppmann said .
" it is very easy and very useful to export the technology .
so if you think of families that live in the jungle of brazil , they are not supplied with electricity at all , -lrb- but now -rrb- they have the possibility to put a little solar power plant on the rooftop and so they get the possibility to use light , they get the possibility to warm their water . " in the six years that chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats and environmentally-friendly greens has been in office , the amount of electricity generated in germany by renewable energy sources - as opposed to fossil and nuclear fuel - has more than doubled , from 4 to 9 percent .
by supporting projects such as the leipziger land solar power plant , the government aims to increase this share still further - to 20 percent in 2020 , and 50 percent by 2050 . charlotte collins -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no " green " medals for athens greece promised to make athens 2004 the greenest olympics ever , but environmental groups have already given the athens olympic organizing committee -lrb- athoc -rrb- failing grades when it comes to protecting nature .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.09.2004 learning to learn in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a long way from kabul to saxony for afghan students after years of war and unrest , coming to germany was like a dream for a group of afghan students .
they experienced a completely different type of school , learning with computers and experimenting with creativity . ahmad farhad ’ s face is scarred .
during the war , he and three of his brothers were injured , he says .
he doesn ’ t elaborate , merely stares straight ahead , smiles , and changes the topic .
this exchange , he says , is a miracle .
ahmad is 19 years old and a student at kabul ’ s amani high school .
he and 18 other teenagers came to germany about three weeks ago as part of the first german-afghan student exchange program .
on wednesday , the group flies back home , and will take many memories and new ideas with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls and boys have separate schools in afghanistan .
here a girls class in novobod .
for the 18-year-old atifa formuli , one of the group 's eight girls , the exchange proves that men and women can study and work together .
wearing a simple black suit , and flashing green eyes under her headscarf , she explains what the last three weeks have meant for her : " when we come here it means that the position of girls and boys is equal . "
in kabul , boys and girls only spend the first two school years in the same classroom .
but here , atifa says , we can talk to each other .
atifa is a student at the aishe-e-durani girls school .
both her school and amani high school are backed by the german foreign ministry and offer german language classes .
the best students in each school are chosen to travel to saxony , in eastern germany , explains 16-year-old masih ullah hamkar .
they live with host families and experience going to a german school .
long hair and earrings for masih , just seeing the other students in school was an eye-opening experience .
" boys with long hair and earrings - that was something different , " he says .
" there aren ’ t too many like that in afghanistan .
and the girls dress so differently , too , " he recalls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school in tents in novobod although it was interesting to sit in the classroom with the german students , he says he doesn ’ t think much of discipline at the schools here .
in his country , masih says , students respect their teachers .
back home , as many as 60 students crowd into one classroom and a disciplinary slap in the face is not uncommon when the teacher wants to maintain order .
all the afghan students strive for one thing : to learn , to study , so that later , they can help rebuild their country .
during their stay in germany , they were amazed at the beautiful buildings , shops , highways , trains and the green landscape .
but they were especially interested in experiencing the country 's modern teaching methods .
more than rote learning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computers are still rare in afghanistan .
here young women learn an operation system at the shirzai training academy in kandahar , afghanistan .
" it was a real surprise to see the students go to different classrooms to study , " says mohammed feisal .
the teaching methods are very advanced , with computers and all kinds of technical equipment , he remembers .
" the students can see and experience everything , not just read about things in books .
that surprised me . "
equally impressed by what she saw in the german schools , atifa says she will tell the education ministry in afghanistan how students in germany learn .
she was especially intrigued by a particular creative exercise in which all the students in a classroom listened to music and then each drew their own pictures inspired by the music .
at first she thought such a task would be difficult , but it worked , she says , and she managed to come up with ideas on her own .
a german role model ?
" i saw that every person in germany was responsible for their own acts and worked by themselves .
and because of this they have helped make their country beautiful and clean , " atifa recalls .
" when we go back , we will say to everyone that we can also make our country like this , " she pledges .
atifa 's goal , like that of her classmates , is to help rebuild her country .
in order to do that the students all plan to go on to university and get a degree .
many would even like to study in germany and hope for financial support to do so .
it does n't matter if they come from a different cultural background , atifa says : " people are people wherever they are . "
at the moment are no plans for another group of afghan students to visit germany .
and , due to the tense security situation , a visit by german students to afghanistan is not planned any time soon . silke bartlick -lrb- db / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life in afghanistan deutsche welle reporters sandra petersmann and karen fischer explore the country , from kabul to kunduz , documenting the new struggles , the daily fight for survival , the joy of afghan children who are finally back in school and the fate of refugees who have returned to their homeland .
deutsche welle & cap anamur build 32 schools in afghanistan deutsche welle and cap anamur would like to thank all of the donors who have helped make the 100 classrooms for afghanistan program a total success .
germany paves the way for education in afghanistan while the army takes on an extended military mandate in afghanistan , germany keeps up a quiet but comprehensive educational mission in the ravaged country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.09.2004 russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says it reserves the right to pre-emptively hit terror bases in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases . " russia 's top general said his country was ready to attack " terrorist bases " anywhere in the caucasus , central asia and other areas near russia .
according to russian news agencies , chief of staff general yuri baluyevsky threatened pre-emptive strikes against organizations harboring terrorists .
" our position on pre-emptive strikes has been stated before , but i will repeat it .
we will take steps to liquidate terrorist bases in any region of the world , " he said after talks with us general james jones , nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
baluyevsky admitted that " military steps are an extreme measure in the fight against terrorism , " and said his country would not revert to the use of the country 's massive nuclear arsenal .
" this does not mean that we will resort to the use of nuclear force , " he said in a statement that has perplexed many european observers .
a first for moscow ?
embroiled in a five-year guerrilla war in rebel chechnya , moscow has frequently staged attacks against the break-away province , but outside its own borders russia has been hesitant to carry out pre-emptive strikes against terrorists .
so far it has only dropped a few bombs on the panskisi gorge in neighboring georgia , where it suspects chechen rebels are hiding and training .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces soldiers take position at the seized school in beslan , north ossetia , friday , sept .
3 , 2004 .
it is therefore all the more surprising that baluyevsky would make such statements , especially since president vladimir putin has not made any comments along the same lines since the hostage-taking crisis in a school in the russian province of north ossetia shocked the country and world a week ago .
a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner emma udwin said the threats would have more weight if coming from the russian president .
" i would pay more attention if it had come from putin , " she said when asked about baluyevsky 's remarks .
kremlin adopts us policy ?
the european commission 's chief spokesman , reijo kemppinen , also dismissed the comments , saying instead : " i think i 've heard that kind of statement before .
not from russia though . "
western analysts said wednesday 's remarks from chief of staff yuri baluyvsky carried echoes of the us doctrine in the " war on terror " of countering threats by launching first strikes , instead of waiting to be attacked .
on the other hand , russia 's sharply limited reach means the general 's warning would apply in practice to former soviet republics in the caucasus and central asia which moscow still regards as its sphere of influence .
" in practice this doctrine can only apply to the countries adjacent to russia which are not part of a global alliance , " jonathan eyal , russia analyst at the royal united services institute in london , told reuters wire service .
us-russian cooperation the chief of staff 's statements came during the first visit to russia by nato 's top commander .
jones , who stressed the two former cold war foes had entered a new friendly relationship since the september 11 attacks in the united states , said the bond between washington and moscow had grown even stronger after the seizing of the school in the town of beslan by terrorists .
" we face common threats and common challenges , " jones said .
" we are entering a period of heightened cooperation against these threats and this is very , very important . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tv grab from russian ntv showing a terrorist standing guard over hostages inside the school gymnasium in beslan , north ossetia .
the footage was shot by one of the terrorists .
at least 336 civilians , including hundreds of children , died in the three-day school siege in the north ossetian province which borders chechnya .
the american general referred to the hostage-taking as an " insidious attack . "
just like before the launch of the us-led strike against afghanistan that russia backed in october 2001 as a retaliation for the september 11 attacks staged by the afghan-based al qaeda terror network , the two generals said the beslan attack should redouble the two sides ' efforts to fight terror .
" today international terrorism has become an international force , and only through joint action -lrb- with nato -rrb- can we fight this scourge , " baluyevsky said .
the russian general added that the two sides agreed to exchange information on terror cells around the world and to coordinate a rapid response team to fight them . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : russia needs international solidarity official versions of the hostage drama in north ossetia and the true events on the ground are widely divergent .

but many are too ashamed to take a course .
that 's why a new german initiative offers instruction over the internet . some four million people in germany are illiterate .
even though they went to school , they never learned to read or write properly .
for most of them - adults who have gotten through life with a series of complex compensation strategies - admitting illiteracy is a difficult hurdle to overcome .
only 20,0000 of the country 's so-called functional illiterates -lrb- excluding foreigners who never went to school -rrb- have actually taken advantage of reading courses offered by outreach programs throughout the country .
the rest are often too ashamed to admit their problem by seeking help .
in order to combat illiteracy , a new initiative is being launched in germany to teach reading and writing anonymously via the internet .
on sept .
8 , international literacy day , a special web site goes online to provide individual instruction which serves either as a complement to classroom teaching or as a primary learning source for those not enrolled in a course .
called " alfa-portal literacy learning , " or apoll for short , the site is financed by the federal ministry for education and research .
less pressure on the pc " the biggest problem for a functioning illiterate is to out oneself , to take the first step of signing up for a course , " said christian fiebig , director of the apoll project .
" through the e-learning portal , we offer the possibility of learning anonymously without having to out oneself , " he told dw-world .
in the future some 17,000 instruction exercises will be available on the site for illiterates to set up their own individual learning plan .
the only prerequisite is that the internet user recognize the address of the web site , www.ich-will-schreiben-lernen.de -lrb- in english : i want to learn to write -rrb- , and save the url as a favorite to visit over and over again .
once at the site , they will be guided through a special tutorial that reads all the instructions and texts out loud .
learning any time at any pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading is a pleasure illiterates never get to appreciate the e-learning page asks each illiterate to evaluate their own skills and then conducts a short test to determine placement within the online course .
before instruction begins , the computer program asks each participant what their goal is : whether they want to be able to read and fill out official forms and deal with bureaucracy , read books or simply improve daily life .
each literacy participant receives an individually outlined program of instruction and exercises to complete for the week .
in the early stages of instruction audio clips and little pictures assist the literacy learner .
later , short news texts and stories will be provided as practice .
the apoll program offers participants the possibility to set the pace and learning intervals according to their own time frame , fiebig explained .
of course that means the illiterate sitting at home in front of the computer requires a good deal of self-discipline .
for this reason fiebig and his colleagues strongly encourage the e-learning participants to take a parallel classroom course .
to encourage learning and motivate the often frustrated participants , the apoll project also offers telephone advice and provides a forum for learners to communicate with one another via voicemail .
adult learners according to fiebig , working with the computer and internet is not a problem for the majority of illiterates .
" the computer and especially the internet are new types of media , and our target audience is very open to them . "
a study conducted recently showed that one-third of all illiterates in germany have a computer and internet connections , albeit mostly for entertainment purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading a train schedule is a real challenge for germany 's illiterates the majority of literacy learners are adults , equally divided between men and women .
most of them are between 30 and 45 years old , said fiebig .
once they reach their mid-adult years , " the difficulties and suffering connected to illiteracy become so significant , that illiterates no longer advance at work or are unable to follow what their children do in school , " said the apoll director .
" we also know that illiteracy isolates , " fiebig added - 51 percent of the target learners are singles .
expanding the literacy program in the long term , apoll hopes to expand their e-learning programs for foreigners living in germany , who never learned to read and write in their native language , let alone german .
because illiteracy is a world problem , and one which is particularly acute in developing countries , the institute for international cooperation -lrb- iz -rrb- in bonn is considering exporting a computer-supported initiative to combat illiteracy in developing countries .
if created , it could be germany 's contribution to the united nation 's decade of literacy , which the organization established in 2003 .

before instruction begins , the computer program asks each participant what their goal is : whether they want to be able to read and fill out official forms and deal with bureaucracy , read books or simply improve daily life .
each literacy participant receives an individually outlined program of instruction and exercises to complete for the week .
in the early stages of instruction audio clips and little pictures assist the literacy learner .
later , short news texts and stories will be provided as practice .
the apoll program offers participants the possibility to set the pace and learning intervals according to their own time frame , fiebig explained .
of course that means the illiterate sitting at home in front of the computer requires a good deal of self-discipline .
for this reason fiebig and his colleagues strongly encourage the e-learning participants to take a parallel classroom course .
to encourage learning and motivate the often frustrated participants , the apoll project also offers telephone advice and provides a forum for learners to communicate with one another via voicemail .
adult learners according to fiebig , working with the computer and internet is not a problem for the majority of illiterates .
" the computer and especially the internet are new types of media , and our target audience is very open to them . "
a study conducted recently showed that one-third of all illiterates in germany have a computer and internet connections , albeit mostly for entertainment purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading a train schedule is a real challenge for germany 's illiterates the majority of literacy learners are adults , equally divided between men and women .
most of them are between 30 and 45 years old , said fiebig .
once they reach their mid-adult years , " the difficulties and suffering connected to illiteracy become so significant , that illiterates no longer advance at work or are unable to follow what their children do in school , " said the apoll director .
" we also know that illiteracy isolates , " fiebig added - 51 percent of the target learners are singles .
expanding the literacy program in the long term , apoll hopes to expand their e-learning programs for foreigners living in germany , who never learned to read and write in their native language , let alone german .
because illiteracy is a world problem , and one which is particularly acute in developing countries , the institute for international cooperation -lrb- iz -rrb- in bonn is considering exporting a computer-supported initiative to combat illiteracy in developing countries .
if created , it could be germany 's contribution to the united nation 's decade of literacy , which the organization established in 2003 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.09.2004 russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says it reserves the right to pre-emptively hit terror bases in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases . " russia 's top general said his country was ready to attack " terrorist bases " anywhere in the caucasus , central asia and other areas near russia .
according to russian news agencies , chief of staff general yuri baluyevsky threatened pre-emptive strikes against organizations harboring terrorists .
" our position on pre-emptive strikes has been stated before , but i will repeat it .
we will take steps to liquidate terrorist bases in any region of the world , " he said after talks with us general james jones , nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
baluyevsky admitted that " military steps are an extreme measure in the fight against terrorism , " and said his country would not revert to the use of the country 's massive nuclear arsenal .
" this does not mean that we will resort to the use of nuclear force , " he said in a statement that has perplexed many european observers .
a first for moscow ?
embroiled in a five-year guerrilla war in rebel chechnya , moscow has frequently staged attacks against the break-away province , but outside its own borders russia has been hesitant to carry out pre-emptive strikes against terrorists .
so far it has only dropped a few bombs on the panskisi gorge in neighboring georgia , where it suspects chechen rebels are hiding and training .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces soldiers take position at the seized school in beslan , north ossetia , friday , sept .
3 , 2004 .
it is therefore all the more surprising that baluyevsky would make such statements , especially since president vladimir putin has not made any comments along the same lines since the hostage-taking crisis in a school in the russian province of north ossetia shocked the country and world a week ago .
a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner emma udwin said the threats would have more weight if coming from the russian president .
" i would pay more attention if it had come from putin , " she said when asked about baluyevsky 's remarks .
kremlin adopts us policy ?
the european commission 's chief spokesman , reijo kemppinen , also dismissed the comments , saying instead : " i think i 've heard that kind of statement before .
not from russia though . "
western analysts said wednesday 's remarks from chief of staff yuri baluyvsky carried echoes of the us doctrine in the " war on terror " of countering threats by launching first strikes , instead of waiting to be attacked .
on the other hand , russia 's sharply limited reach means the general 's warning would apply in practice to former soviet republics in the caucasus and central asia which moscow still regards as its sphere of influence .
" in practice this doctrine can only apply to the countries adjacent to russia which are not part of a global alliance , " jonathan eyal , russia analyst at the royal united services institute in london , told reuters wire service .
us-russian cooperation the chief of staff 's statements came during the first visit to russia by nato 's top commander .
jones , who stressed the two former cold war foes had entered a new friendly relationship since the september 11 attacks in the united states , said the bond between washington and moscow had grown even stronger after the seizing of the school in the town of beslan by terrorists .
" we face common threats and common challenges , " jones said .
" we are entering a period of heightened cooperation against these threats and this is very , very important . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tv grab from russian ntv showing a terrorist standing guard over hostages inside the school gymnasium in beslan , north ossetia .
the footage was shot by one of the terrorists .
at least 336 civilians , including hundreds of children , died in the three-day school siege in the north ossetian province which borders chechnya .
the american general referred to the hostage-taking as an " insidious attack . "
just like before the launch of the us-led strike against afghanistan that russia backed in october 2001 as a retaliation for the september 11 attacks staged by the afghan-based al qaeda terror network , the two generals said the beslan attack should redouble the two sides ' efforts to fight terror .
" today international terrorism has become an international force , and only through joint action -lrb- with nato -rrb- can we fight this scourge , " baluyevsky said .

some looked like " charcoal briquettes , " said michael knoche , the director of the 338-year-old library .
others , soaked in the water sprayed by firefighters , were several pounds heavier than their original weight . the damage done , it 's up to a team of bookbinders at the privately-run center for book preservation in leipzig to lessen its impact .
as of tuesday , a little more than 25,000 books were declared completely lost .
of the estimated 50,000 pulled from the burning building by a human chain of library employees and volunteers thursday night , more than 35,000 have suffered water damage , some of it heavy .
most of those have already arrived at the center . restoration begins at 20 below zero " it 's been intense , " said manuela reikov-räuchle , the head of the restoration department at the preservation center , in an interview with dw-world . " sometimes , the books are delivered , sometimes we 've been driving back and forth . " wrapped in foil , many are still dripping wet when they 're unpacked .
the race against time - and fungus - begins immediately .
after a quick cleaning with a brush , the books are deep frozen at minus 20 degrees to prevent microbacteria from taking over . for small books , the process is over in 24 hours .
larger ones are frozen for up to three days .
when they emerge from the freezer , they 're put through a process that evaporates the ice immediately into gas .
the same thing is done to dried fruit . knoche has yet to release a list of works currently undergoing restoration .
the bookbinders say there is no way to estimate yet how many of the books will , in fact , be restored to their original form .
money is definitely a factor . prohibitive prices restoration costs 10 euros per kilogram -lrb- 2.2 pounds -rrb- when the book is wet , according to the center .
most of the small books weigh between 1.5 and 2 kg , and the amounts begin skyrocketing when the larger books are factored in .

" there are several tons , " said reikov-räuchle . so far , the federal government has promised € 4 million in emergency money , half of which was transferred on monday , according to museum officials . an account set up for donations from the public has gotten a good reception and a series of benefit concerts are being planned .

the two-story 18th century rococo hall , the building 's extravagant centerpiece , was completely gutted by flames but will eventually be restored , according to seemann .
it could take months , even years to determine whether it will hold the same collection .
some good news came on tuesday with the announcement that around 20,000 books with only minor water damage can be restored by the library itself .
the rest will be handled by the center , which is undertaking its biggest assignment since floods devastated several libraries along the elbe in 2002 .
it has had to put other projects , like work for the us library of congress , on hold .

but many are too ashamed to take a course .
that 's why a new german initiative offers instruction over the internet . some four million people in germany are illiterate .
even though they went to school , they never learned to read or write properly .
for most of them - adults who have gotten through life with a series of complex compensation strategies - admitting illiteracy is a difficult hurdle to overcome .
only 20,0000 of the country 's so-called functional illiterates -lrb- excluding foreigners who never went to school -rrb- have actually taken advantage of reading courses offered by outreach programs throughout the country .
the rest are often too ashamed to admit their problem by seeking help .
in order to combat illiteracy , a new initiative is being launched in germany to teach reading and writing anonymously via the internet .
on sept .
8 , international literacy day , a special web site goes online to provide individual instruction which serves either as a complement to classroom teaching or as a primary learning source for those not enrolled in a course .
called " alfa-portal literacy learning , " or apoll for short , the site is financed by the federal ministry for education and research .
less pressure on the pc " the biggest problem for a functioning illiterate is to out oneself , to take the first step of signing up for a course , " said christian fiebig , director of the apoll project .
" through the e-learning portal , we offer the possibility of learning anonymously without having to out oneself , " he told dw-world .
in the future some 17,000 instruction exercises will be available on the site for illiterates to set up their own individual learning plan .
the only prerequisite is that the internet user recognize the address of the web site , www.ich-will-schreiben-lernen.de -lrb- in english : i want to learn to write -rrb- , and save the url as a favorite to visit over and over again .
once at the site , they will be guided through a special tutorial that reads all the instructions and texts out loud .
learning any time at any pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading is a pleasure illiterates never get to appreciate the e-learning page asks each illiterate to evaluate their own skills and then conducts a short test to determine placement within the online course .
before instruction begins , the computer program asks each participant what their goal is : whether they want to be able to read and fill out official forms and deal with bureaucracy , read books or simply improve daily life .
each literacy participant receives an individually outlined program of instruction and exercises to complete for the week .
in the early stages of instruction audio clips and little pictures assist the literacy learner .
later , short news texts and stories will be provided as practice .
the apoll program offers participants the possibility to set the pace and learning intervals according to their own time frame , fiebig explained .
of course that means the illiterate sitting at home in front of the computer requires a good deal of self-discipline .
for this reason fiebig and his colleagues strongly encourage the e-learning participants to take a parallel classroom course .
to encourage learning and motivate the often frustrated participants , the apoll project also offers telephone advice and provides a forum for learners to communicate with one another via voicemail .
adult learners according to fiebig , working with the computer and internet is not a problem for the majority of illiterates .
" the computer and especially the internet are new types of media , and our target audience is very open to them . "
a study conducted recently showed that one-third of all illiterates in germany have a computer and internet connections , albeit mostly for entertainment purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading a train schedule is a real challenge for germany 's illiterates the majority of literacy learners are adults , equally divided between men and women .
most of them are between 30 and 45 years old , said fiebig .
once they reach their mid-adult years , " the difficulties and suffering connected to illiteracy become so significant , that illiterates no longer advance at work or are unable to follow what their children do in school , " said the apoll director .
" we also know that illiteracy isolates , " fiebig added - 51 percent of the target learners are singles .
expanding the literacy program in the long term , apoll hopes to expand their e-learning programs for foreigners living in germany , who never learned to read and write in their native language , let alone german .
because illiteracy is a world problem , and one which is particularly acute in developing countries , the institute for international cooperation -lrb- iz -rrb- in bonn is considering exporting a computer-supported initiative to combat illiteracy in developing countries .
if created , it could be germany 's contribution to the united nation 's decade of literacy , which the organization established in 2003 .

but many are too ashamed to take a course .
that 's why a new german initiative offers instruction over the internet . some four million people in germany are illiterate .
even though they went to school , they never learned to read or write properly .
for most of them - adults who have gotten through life with a series of complex compensation strategies - admitting illiteracy is a difficult hurdle to overcome .
only 20,0000 of the country 's so-called functional illiterates -lrb- excluding foreigners who never went to school -rrb- have actually taken advantage of reading courses offered by outreach programs throughout the country .
the rest are often too ashamed to admit their problem by seeking help .
in order to combat illiteracy , a new initiative is being launched in germany to teach reading and writing anonymously via the internet .
on sept .
8 , international literacy day , a special web site goes online to provide individual instruction which serves either as a complement to classroom teaching or as a primary learning source for those not enrolled in a course .
called " alfa-portal literacy learning , " or apoll for short , the site is financed by the federal ministry for education and research .
less pressure on the pc " the biggest problem for a functioning illiterate is to out oneself , to take the first step of signing up for a course , " said christian fiebig , director of the apoll project .
" through the e-learning portal , we offer the possibility of learning anonymously without having to out oneself , " he told dw-world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.09.2004 russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says it reserves the right to pre-emptively hit terror bases in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases . " russia 's top general said his country was ready to attack " terrorist bases " anywhere in the caucasus , central asia and other areas near russia .
according to russian news agencies , chief of staff general yuri baluyevsky threatened pre-emptive strikes against organizations harboring terrorists .
" our position on pre-emptive strikes has been stated before , but i will repeat it .
we will take steps to liquidate terrorist bases in any region of the world , " he said after talks with us general james jones , nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
baluyevsky admitted that " military steps are an extreme measure in the fight against terrorism , " and said his country would not revert to the use of the country 's massive nuclear arsenal .
" this does not mean that we will resort to the use of nuclear force , " he said in a statement that has perplexed many european observers .
a first for moscow ?
embroiled in a five-year guerrilla war in rebel chechnya , moscow has frequently staged attacks against the break-away province , but outside its own borders russia has been hesitant to carry out pre-emptive strikes against terrorists .
so far it has only dropped a few bombs on the panskisi gorge in neighboring georgia , where it suspects chechen rebels are hiding and training .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces soldiers take position at the seized school in beslan , north ossetia , friday , sept .
3 , 2004 .
it is therefore all the more surprising that baluyevsky would make such statements , especially since president vladimir putin has not made any comments along the same lines since the hostage-taking crisis in a school in the russian province of north ossetia shocked the country and world a week ago .
a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner emma udwin said the threats would have more weight if coming from the russian president .
" i would pay more attention if it had come from putin , " she said when asked about baluyevsky 's remarks .
kremlin adopts us policy ?
the european commission 's chief spokesman , reijo kemppinen , also dismissed the comments , saying instead : " i think i 've heard that kind of statement before .
not from russia though . "
western analysts said wednesday 's remarks from chief of staff yuri baluyvsky carried echoes of the us doctrine in the " war on terror " of countering threats by launching first strikes , instead of waiting to be attacked .
on the other hand , russia 's sharply limited reach means the general 's warning would apply in practice to former soviet republics in the caucasus and central asia which moscow still regards as its sphere of influence .
" in practice this doctrine can only apply to the countries adjacent to russia which are not part of a global alliance , " jonathan eyal , russia analyst at the royal united services institute in london , told reuters wire service .
us-russian cooperation the chief of staff 's statements came during the first visit to russia by nato 's top commander .
jones , who stressed the two former cold war foes had entered a new friendly relationship since the september 11 attacks in the united states , said the bond between washington and moscow had grown even stronger after the seizing of the school in the town of beslan by terrorists .
" we face common threats and common challenges , " jones said .
" we are entering a period of heightened cooperation against these threats and this is very , very important . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tv grab from russian ntv showing a terrorist standing guard over hostages inside the school gymnasium in beslan , north ossetia .
the footage was shot by one of the terrorists .
at least 336 civilians , including hundreds of children , died in the three-day school siege in the north ossetian province which borders chechnya .
the american general referred to the hostage-taking as an " insidious attack . "
just like before the launch of the us-led strike against afghanistan that russia backed in october 2001 as a retaliation for the september 11 attacks staged by the afghan-based al qaeda terror network , the two generals said the beslan attack should redouble the two sides ' efforts to fight terror .
" today international terrorism has become an international force , and only through joint action -lrb- with nato -rrb- can we fight this scourge , " baluyevsky said .
the russian general added that the two sides agreed to exchange information on terror cells around the world and to coordinate a rapid response team to fight them . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : russia needs international solidarity official versions of the hostage drama in north ossetia and the true events on the ground are widely divergent .

ahmad is 19 years old and a student at kabul ’ s amani high school .
he and 18 other teenagers came to germany about three weeks ago as part of the first german-afghan student exchange program .
on wednesday , the group flies back home , and will take many memories and new ideas with them .

atifa is a student at the aishe-e-durani girls school .

back home , as many as 60 students crowd into one classroom and a disciplinary slap in the face is not uncommon when the teacher wants to maintain order .
all the afghan students strive for one thing : to learn , to study , so that later , they can help rebuild their country .

the teaching methods are very advanced , with computers and all kinds of technical equipment , he remembers .
" the students can see and experience everything , not just read about things in books .
that surprised me . "
equally impressed by what she saw in the german schools , atifa says she will tell the education ministry in afghanistan how students in germany learn .
she was especially intrigued by a particular creative exercise in which all the students in a classroom listened to music and then each drew their own pictures inspired by the music .
at first she thought such a task would be difficult , but it worked , she says , and she managed to come up with ideas on her own .

they experienced a completely different type of school , learning with computers and experimenting with creativity . ahmad farhad ’ s face is scarred .
during the war , he and three of his brothers were injured , he says .
he doesn ’ t elaborate , merely stares straight ahead , smiles , and changes the topic .
this exchange , he says , is a miracle .
ahmad is 19 years old and a student at kabul ’ s amani high school .
he and 18 other teenagers came to germany about three weeks ago as part of the first german-afghan student exchange program .
on wednesday , the group flies back home , and will take many memories and new ideas with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls and boys have separate schools in afghanistan .
here a girls class in novobod .
for the 18-year-old atifa formuli , one of the group 's eight girls , the exchange proves that men and women can study and work together .
wearing a simple black suit , and flashing green eyes under her headscarf , she explains what the last three weeks have meant for her : " when we come here it means that the position of girls and boys is equal . "
in kabul , boys and girls only spend the first two school years in the same classroom .
but here , atifa says , we can talk to each other .
atifa is a student at the aishe-e-durani girls school .
both her school and amani high school are backed by the german foreign ministry and offer german language classes .
the best students in each school are chosen to travel to saxony , in eastern germany , explains 16-year-old masih ullah hamkar .
they live with host families and experience going to a german school .
long hair and earrings for masih , just seeing the other students in school was an eye-opening experience .
" boys with long hair and earrings - that was something different , " he says .
" there aren ’ t too many like that in afghanistan .
and the girls dress so differently , too , " he recalls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school in tents in novobod although it was interesting to sit in the classroom with the german students , he says he doesn ’ t think much of discipline at the schools here .
in his country , masih says , students respect their teachers .
back home , as many as 60 students crowd into one classroom and a disciplinary slap in the face is not uncommon when the teacher wants to maintain order .
all the afghan students strive for one thing : to learn , to study , so that later , they can help rebuild their country .
during their stay in germany , they were amazed at the beautiful buildings , shops , highways , trains and the green landscape .
but they were especially interested in experiencing the country 's modern teaching methods .
more than rote learning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computers are still rare in afghanistan .
here young women learn an operation system at the shirzai training academy in kandahar , afghanistan .
" it was a real surprise to see the students go to different classrooms to study , " says mohammed feisal .
the teaching methods are very advanced , with computers and all kinds of technical equipment , he remembers .
" the students can see and experience everything , not just read about things in books .
that surprised me . "
equally impressed by what she saw in the german schools , atifa says she will tell the education ministry in afghanistan how students in germany learn .
she was especially intrigued by a particular creative exercise in which all the students in a classroom listened to music and then each drew their own pictures inspired by the music .
at first she thought such a task would be difficult , but it worked , she says , and she managed to come up with ideas on her own .
a german role model ?
" i saw that every person in germany was responsible for their own acts and worked by themselves .
and because of this they have helped make their country beautiful and clean , " atifa recalls .
" when we go back , we will say to everyone that we can also make our country like this , " she pledges .
atifa 's goal , like that of her classmates , is to help rebuild her country .
in order to do that the students all plan to go on to university and get a degree .
many would even like to study in germany and hope for financial support to do so .
it does n't matter if they come from a different cultural background , atifa says : " people are people wherever they are . "

after more than 40 years in which they kept west berlin safe from the looming soviet threat , the final 2,000 soldiers pulled out of berlin on sept .
8 , 1994 .
soldiers , both from the us and the former soviet union , were no longer needed in the reunified city and the americans either went home or to still-existent bases in southern germany . before they left , 75,000 berliners lined the route upon which the us forces would parade for the last time .
they cheered the soldiers and a bundeswehr battalion was on hand to salute the outgoing troops . the decades together in berlin , the last bastion of west germany in the middle of the gdr , had sparked a special relationship between americans and west berliners .
at the latest , the love affair began in 1948 when the soviet union tried to hermetically seal off west berlin and force france , great britain and the u.s. to give up on the city . berlin airlift seals love affair the us responded by flying in humanitarian aid to tempelhof airport .
the so-called " raisin bombers " brought in desperately-needed supplies , flying their way into the hearts of the west berliners in the process . " above all , we learned what solidarity in the most dire emergency means , " former mayor eberhard diepgen remembered .
" the desire for freedom on the part of the berliners convinced the western world of germany 's will never to live under tyrants again . " the soviet union eventually gave up its attempt on grabbing west berlin .
the allied troops stayed , dividing up the divided city into three different sectors .
they did the same in the rest of germany in an effort to protect the country both from the ussr and itself , according to foreign policy scholar ingo peters . " stationing the troops was important , as a sort of insurance , so that what happened here , germany would n't do again , " peters told deutsche welle . germany 's new role in the world after reunification , allied soldiers were no longer needed .
upon their departure from the eventual german capital , chancellor helmut kohl told the troops that germany had learned by their example . " you can rely on us .
germany will never stand aside when peace and freedom are at stake in the world , " kohl said . german foreign policy has made good on that promise .
the country has come a long way from a policy of non-intervention under the protection of allied troops .
beginning with peacekeeping missions in bosnia after the bosnian war in the early 1990s , germany took part in nato military action against serbia in 1999 and has thousands of troops stationed in nato and un peacekeeping missions , including afghanistan , today . american troops remain in germany , in southern cities like landstuhl , rammstein and kaiserslautern .
but given recent announcements by the us military to move troops out of germany , those , too , may close one day .
but they most likely wo n't get the same send-off . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop pullout to hit local german economies the impact of us plans to pull some 70,000 troops out of europe and asia is likely to be felt most acutely in germany - especially in smaller towns whose economies depend on the us presence .

in both style and spirit , many resemble their predecessors of the " neue deutsche welle " -lrb- german new wave -rrb- , which rocked out german-style in the eighties . instead of cranking out cookie-cutter pop hits in english that currently dominate germany 's airwaves , a growing number of young germans are choosing to sing auf deutsch .
they are picking up on the tradition of acts such as nena , trio and falco - who helped make music with german lyrics in the late 1970s and early 1980s popular . deutsche welle interviewed the members of " 2raumwohnung , " inga humpe and tommie eckart , who along with bands like " wir sind helden " are launching the second wave . the name " 2raumwohnung " -lrb- 2-room apartment -rrb- has a lot of symbolic meaning related to german history .
how would you explain the name to your fans abroad ? tommi : the name originally comes from the fact that we 're two people and this is a two person project .
but then , of course , there 's this funny situation : due to the wall and the division between east and west , the language was also divided .
now , 15 years after the fall of the wall , there are still differences , and germans from the east and west have different ways of describing a two-room apartment because they prefer to use different words for room : " zimmer " in the west and " raum " in the east .
we took this linguistic anomaly to be a synonym for berlin , and since we are from the west we incorporated the " raum " into our name to represent a kind of connection . what is your relationship to the german language like ?
foreigners often describe the language as hard , but in your music you make it sound light and soft . inga : that 's true .
after i sing in german , i also think the language is quite hard .
we take great pains to make it sound softer .
but we also have a bit of experience singing in english .
now we have decided to record some of our songs in english , like " sexy girl " and " spiel mit , " which is on the premium version of our cd .
and just yesterday , we recorded an english version of " wir sind anderen . " i recently heard from toni kater , a berlin musician who is on the same label , that when she first met both of you , she identified your band with the " berlin scene . "
do you identify with any " scene " at all , and to what extent is your music tied to the city of berlin ? inga : with the " scene " no , but definitely with the city .
there are so many " scenes " in berlin , but the city is an important source of inspiration for us .
without berlin , we probably would n't exist .
berlin is so big and multi-faceted , and there 's so much freedom here that many different varieties of music can develop .
it 's nice , i think , to be connected to the soul of this city .
i will always be in love with berlin . when you write your songs , do you have a specific public in mind ? tommi : we try to make the kind of music we would enjoy and compose songs we would want to listen to , even if we were n't writing it ourselves .
that 's also how we approached the new album : even if we had n't made it ourselves , would we want to listen to it ?
at least this is what we always try and do .
we do n't have a particular person or listener in mind .
we simply make music for ourselves and for our friends .
i think our fans are not so different than we are . from which musical genre does " 2raumwohnung " draw inspiration ? tommi : we try to draw upon everything we like .
we are just as inspired by air and madonna as by miss kittin and märtini brös .
even older music , like kraftwerk and music from the ' 70s , has influenced us . what are you listening to at the moment ? tommi : i am listening to lots of air at the moment , and i love phoenix .
i guess i listen to other things too , like chet baker … the german press recently accused you of being too optimistic and not political enough .
do you have a response to them ?
and why are you so optimistic ? tommi : first of all , i think it is very important to be optimistic .
when we make music , we are simply in a good mood and people can tell .
but i also do n't agree that our music is not political .
when someone takes their own feelings seriously and shares it with other people , then it is perhaps not - strictly speaking - political , but it certainly has a greater meaning for society . inga : it was a very deliberate decision to be optimistic and to remain optimistic .
i think it 's not the best choice - just because the times are hard - to whine and complain along with everyone else .
instead , people should ask themselves what they can do to make things better for themselves and for everyone others .
i think positive thinking is the basis of that .
and besides , i do n't really understand why the germans complain so much - things are n't really that bad . do you plan on touring abroad ? inga : yes , lots .
we are always getting offers from brazil and mexico . tommi : sadly , it has n't worked out in brazil .
but we 've already played in russia and in japan and we have plans for concerts in spain and turkey . look for " 2raumwohnung " and other representatives of the new " german wave " at a venue near you soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy .

when we make music , we are simply in a good mood and people can tell .
but i also do n't agree that our music is not political .
when someone takes their own feelings seriously and shares it with other people , then it is perhaps not - strictly speaking - political , but it certainly has a greater meaning for society . inga : it was a very deliberate decision to be optimistic and to remain optimistic .
i think it 's not the best choice - just because the times are hard - to whine and complain along with everyone else .
instead , people should ask themselves what they can do to make things better for themselves and for everyone others .
i think positive thinking is the basis of that .
and besides , i do n't really understand why the germans complain so much - things are n't really that bad . do you plan on touring abroad ? inga : yes , lots .
we are always getting offers from brazil and mexico . tommi : sadly , it has n't worked out in brazil .
but we 've already played in russia and in japan and we have plans for concerts in spain and turkey . look for " 2raumwohnung " and other representatives of the new " german wave " at a venue near you soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy .

centuries old the vast collection , which the king started in 1723 , includes copper etchings and gold-filigreed ornaments , and a cherry pit in which at least 113 faces were carved - an earlier count , in 1595 , put the number at 185 .

work on the vault alone has cost around € 25 million -lrb- around $ 30 million -rrb- . most of the artifacts had already been moved to safety , when three of the eight rooms of the green vault were destroyed by allied bombers in february 1945 .
after the war , they were confiscated by the red army and sent to the soviet union .
the collection was finally returned to dresden in 1958 , where it has been on show at the albertinum museum for the past three decades . nearly 3,000 more valuables from the collection are due to be returned to the restored historic rooms of the green vault next to the modern new rooms where the current exhibit opened in late 2006 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years .

that 's why a new german initiative offers instruction over the internet . some four million people in germany are illiterate .
even though they went to school , they never learned to read or write properly .
for most of them - adults who have gotten through life with a series of complex compensation strategies - admitting illiteracy is a difficult hurdle to overcome .
only 20,0000 of the country 's so-called functional illiterates -lrb- excluding foreigners who never went to school -rrb- have actually taken advantage of reading courses offered by outreach programs throughout the country .
the rest are often too ashamed to admit their problem by seeking help .
in order to combat illiteracy , a new initiative is being launched in germany to teach reading and writing anonymously via the internet .
on sept .
8 , international literacy day , a special web site goes online to provide individual instruction which serves either as a complement to classroom teaching or as a primary learning source for those not enrolled in a course .
called " alfa-portal literacy learning , " or apoll for short , the site is financed by the federal ministry for education and research .
less pressure on the pc " the biggest problem for a functioning illiterate is to out oneself , to take the first step of signing up for a course , " said christian fiebig , director of the apoll project .
" through the e-learning portal , we offer the possibility of learning anonymously without having to out oneself , " he told dw-world .
in the future some 17,000 instruction exercises will be available on the site for illiterates to set up their own individual learning plan .

the apoll program offers participants the possibility to set the pace and learning intervals according to their own time frame , fiebig explained .
of course that means the illiterate sitting at home in front of the computer requires a good deal of self-discipline .
for this reason fiebig and his colleagues strongly encourage the e-learning participants to take a parallel classroom course .
to encourage learning and motivate the often frustrated participants , the apoll project also offers telephone advice and provides a forum for learners to communicate with one another via voicemail .
adult learners according to fiebig , working with the computer and internet is not a problem for the majority of illiterates .
" the computer and especially the internet are new types of media , and our target audience is very open to them . "

expanding the literacy program in the long term , apoll hopes to expand their e-learning programs for foreigners living in germany , who never learned to read and write in their native language , let alone german .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.09.2004 rocking in german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 2raumwohnung " are making german lyrics popular again young german musicians are opting to sing in their native tongue .
in both style and spirit , many resemble their predecessors of the " neue deutsche welle " -lrb- german new wave -rrb- , which rocked out german-style in the eighties . instead of cranking out cookie-cutter pop hits in english that currently dominate germany 's airwaves , a growing number of young germans are choosing to sing auf deutsch .
they are picking up on the tradition of acts such as nena , trio and falco - who helped make music with german lyrics in the late 1970s and early 1980s popular . deutsche welle interviewed the members of " 2raumwohnung , " inga humpe and tommie eckart , who along with bands like " wir sind helden " are launching the second wave . the name " 2raumwohnung " -lrb- 2-room apartment -rrb- has a lot of symbolic meaning related to german history .
how would you explain the name to your fans abroad ? tommi : the name originally comes from the fact that we 're two people and this is a two person project .
but then , of course , there 's this funny situation : due to the wall and the division between east and west , the language was also divided .
now , 15 years after the fall of the wall , there are still differences , and germans from the east and west have different ways of describing a two-room apartment because they prefer to use different words for room : " zimmer " in the west and " raum " in the east .
we took this linguistic anomaly to be a synonym for berlin , and since we are from the west we incorporated the " raum " into our name to represent a kind of connection . what is your relationship to the german language like ?
foreigners often describe the language as hard , but in your music you make it sound light and soft . inga : that 's true .
after i sing in german , i also think the language is quite hard .
we take great pains to make it sound softer .
but we also have a bit of experience singing in english .
now we have decided to record some of our songs in english , like " sexy girl " and " spiel mit , " which is on the premium version of our cd .
and just yesterday , we recorded an english version of " wir sind anderen . " i recently heard from toni kater , a berlin musician who is on the same label , that when she first met both of you , she identified your band with the " berlin scene . "
do you identify with any " scene " at all , and to what extent is your music tied to the city of berlin ? inga : with the " scene " no , but definitely with the city .
there are so many " scenes " in berlin , but the city is an important source of inspiration for us .
without berlin , we probably would n't exist .
berlin is so big and multi-faceted , and there 's so much freedom here that many different varieties of music can develop .
it 's nice , i think , to be connected to the soul of this city .
i will always be in love with berlin . when you write your songs , do you have a specific public in mind ? tommi : we try to make the kind of music we would enjoy and compose songs we would want to listen to , even if we were n't writing it ourselves .
that 's also how we approached the new album : even if we had n't made it ourselves , would we want to listen to it ?
at least this is what we always try and do .
we do n't have a particular person or listener in mind .
we simply make music for ourselves and for our friends .
i think our fans are not so different than we are . from which musical genre does " 2raumwohnung " draw inspiration ? tommi : we try to draw upon everything we like .
we are just as inspired by air and madonna as by miss kittin and märtini brös .
even older music , like kraftwerk and music from the ' 70s , has influenced us . what are you listening to at the moment ? tommi : i am listening to lots of air at the moment , and i love phoenix .
i guess i listen to other things too , like chet baker … the german press recently accused you of being too optimistic and not political enough .
do you have a response to them ?
and why are you so optimistic ? tommi : first of all , i think it is very important to be optimistic .
when we make music , we are simply in a good mood and people can tell .
but i also do n't agree that our music is not political .
when someone takes their own feelings seriously and shares it with other people , then it is perhaps not - strictly speaking - political , but it certainly has a greater meaning for society . inga : it was a very deliberate decision to be optimistic and to remain optimistic .
i think it 's not the best choice - just because the times are hard - to whine and complain along with everyone else .
instead , people should ask themselves what they can do to make things better for themselves and for everyone others .
i think positive thinking is the basis of that .

in both style and spirit , many resemble their predecessors of the " neue deutsche welle " -lrb- german new wave -rrb- , which rocked out german-style in the eighties . instead of cranking out cookie-cutter pop hits in english that currently dominate germany 's airwaves , a growing number of young germans are choosing to sing auf deutsch .
they are picking up on the tradition of acts such as nena , trio and falco - who helped make music with german lyrics in the late 1970s and early 1980s popular . deutsche welle interviewed the members of " 2raumwohnung , " inga humpe and tommie eckart , who along with bands like " wir sind helden " are launching the second wave . the name " 2raumwohnung " -lrb- 2-room apartment -rrb- has a lot of symbolic meaning related to german history .
how would you explain the name to your fans abroad ? tommi : the name originally comes from the fact that we 're two people and this is a two person project .
but then , of course , there 's this funny situation : due to the wall and the division between east and west , the language was also divided .
now , 15 years after the fall of the wall , there are still differences , and germans from the east and west have different ways of describing a two-room apartment because they prefer to use different words for room : " zimmer " in the west and " raum " in the east .
we took this linguistic anomaly to be a synonym for berlin , and since we are from the west we incorporated the " raum " into our name to represent a kind of connection . what is your relationship to the german language like ?
foreigners often describe the language as hard , but in your music you make it sound light and soft . inga : that 's true .
after i sing in german , i also think the language is quite hard .
we take great pains to make it sound softer .
but we also have a bit of experience singing in english .
now we have decided to record some of our songs in english , like " sexy girl " and " spiel mit , " which is on the premium version of our cd .
and just yesterday , we recorded an english version of " wir sind anderen . " i recently heard from toni kater , a berlin musician who is on the same label , that when she first met both of you , she identified your band with the " berlin scene . "
do you identify with any " scene " at all , and to what extent is your music tied to the city of berlin ? inga : with the " scene " no , but definitely with the city .
there are so many " scenes " in berlin , but the city is an important source of inspiration for us .
without berlin , we probably would n't exist .
berlin is so big and multi-faceted , and there 's so much freedom here that many different varieties of music can develop .
it 's nice , i think , to be connected to the soul of this city .
i will always be in love with berlin . when you write your songs , do you have a specific public in mind ? tommi : we try to make the kind of music we would enjoy and compose songs we would want to listen to , even if we were n't writing it ourselves .
that 's also how we approached the new album : even if we had n't made it ourselves , would we want to listen to it ?
at least this is what we always try and do .
we do n't have a particular person or listener in mind .
we simply make music for ourselves and for our friends .
i think our fans are not so different than we are . from which musical genre does " 2raumwohnung " draw inspiration ? tommi : we try to draw upon everything we like .
we are just as inspired by air and madonna as by miss kittin and märtini brös .
even older music , like kraftwerk and music from the ' 70s , has influenced us . what are you listening to at the moment ? tommi : i am listening to lots of air at the moment , and i love phoenix .
i guess i listen to other things too , like chet baker … the german press recently accused you of being too optimistic and not political enough .
do you have a response to them ?
and why are you so optimistic ? tommi : first of all , i think it is very important to be optimistic .
when we make music , we are simply in a good mood and people can tell .
but i also do n't agree that our music is not political .
when someone takes their own feelings seriously and shares it with other people , then it is perhaps not - strictly speaking - political , but it certainly has a greater meaning for society . inga : it was a very deliberate decision to be optimistic and to remain optimistic .
i think it 's not the best choice - just because the times are hard - to whine and complain along with everyone else .
instead , people should ask themselves what they can do to make things better for themselves and for everyone others .
i think positive thinking is the basis of that .
and besides , i do n't really understand why the germans complain so much - things are n't really that bad . do you plan on touring abroad ? inga : yes , lots .

in both style and spirit , many resemble their predecessors of the " neue deutsche welle " -lrb- german new wave -rrb- , which rocked out german-style in the eighties . instead of cranking out cookie-cutter pop hits in english that currently dominate germany 's airwaves , a growing number of young germans are choosing to sing auf deutsch .
they are picking up on the tradition of acts such as nena , trio and falco - who helped make music with german lyrics in the late 1970s and early 1980s popular . deutsche welle interviewed the members of " 2raumwohnung , " inga humpe and tommie eckart , who along with bands like " wir sind helden " are launching the second wave . the name " 2raumwohnung " -lrb- 2-room apartment -rrb- has a lot of symbolic meaning related to german history .
how would you explain the name to your fans abroad ? tommi : the name originally comes from the fact that we 're two people and this is a two person project .
but then , of course , there 's this funny situation : due to the wall and the division between east and west , the language was also divided .
now , 15 years after the fall of the wall , there are still differences , and germans from the east and west have different ways of describing a two-room apartment because they prefer to use different words for room : " zimmer " in the west and " raum " in the east .
we took this linguistic anomaly to be a synonym for berlin , and since we are from the west we incorporated the " raum " into our name to represent a kind of connection . what is your relationship to the german language like ?
foreigners often describe the language as hard , but in your music you make it sound light and soft . inga : that 's true .
after i sing in german , i also think the language is quite hard .
we take great pains to make it sound softer .
but we also have a bit of experience singing in english .
now we have decided to record some of our songs in english , like " sexy girl " and " spiel mit , " which is on the premium version of our cd .
and just yesterday , we recorded an english version of " wir sind anderen . " i recently heard from toni kater , a berlin musician who is on the same label , that when she first met both of you , she identified your band with the " berlin scene . "
do you identify with any " scene " at all , and to what extent is your music tied to the city of berlin ? inga : with the " scene " no , but definitely with the city .
there are so many " scenes " in berlin , but the city is an important source of inspiration for us .
without berlin , we probably would n't exist .
berlin is so big and multi-faceted , and there 's so much freedom here that many different varieties of music can develop .
it 's nice , i think , to be connected to the soul of this city .
i will always be in love with berlin . when you write your songs , do you have a specific public in mind ? tommi : we try to make the kind of music we would enjoy and compose songs we would want to listen to , even if we were n't writing it ourselves .
that 's also how we approached the new album : even if we had n't made it ourselves , would we want to listen to it ?
at least this is what we always try and do .
we do n't have a particular person or listener in mind .
we simply make music for ourselves and for our friends .
i think our fans are not so different than we are . from which musical genre does " 2raumwohnung " draw inspiration ? tommi : we try to draw upon everything we like .
we are just as inspired by air and madonna as by miss kittin and märtini brös .
even older music , like kraftwerk and music from the ' 70s , has influenced us . what are you listening to at the moment ? tommi : i am listening to lots of air at the moment , and i love phoenix .
i guess i listen to other things too , like chet baker … the german press recently accused you of being too optimistic and not political enough .
do you have a response to them ?
and why are you so optimistic ? tommi : first of all , i think it is very important to be optimistic .
when we make music , we are simply in a good mood and people can tell .
but i also do n't agree that our music is not political .
when someone takes their own feelings seriously and shares it with other people , then it is perhaps not - strictly speaking - political , but it certainly has a greater meaning for society . inga : it was a very deliberate decision to be optimistic and to remain optimistic .
i think it 's not the best choice - just because the times are hard - to whine and complain along with everyone else .
instead , people should ask themselves what they can do to make things better for themselves and for everyone others .
i think positive thinking is the basis of that .
and besides , i do n't really understand why the germans complain so much - things are n't really that bad . do you plan on touring abroad ? inga : yes , lots .
we are always getting offers from brazil and mexico . tommi : sadly , it has n't worked out in brazil .
but we 've already played in russia and in japan and we have plans for concerts in spain and turkey . look for " 2raumwohnung " and other representatives of the new " german wave " at a venue near you soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy .

but many are too ashamed to take a course .
that 's why a new german initiative offers instruction over the internet . some four million people in germany are illiterate .
even though they went to school , they never learned to read or write properly .
for most of them - adults who have gotten through life with a series of complex compensation strategies - admitting illiteracy is a difficult hurdle to overcome .
only 20,0000 of the country 's so-called functional illiterates -lrb- excluding foreigners who never went to school -rrb- have actually taken advantage of reading courses offered by outreach programs throughout the country .
the rest are often too ashamed to admit their problem by seeking help .
in order to combat illiteracy , a new initiative is being launched in germany to teach reading and writing anonymously via the internet .
on sept .
8 , international literacy day , a special web site goes online to provide individual instruction which serves either as a complement to classroom teaching or as a primary learning source for those not enrolled in a course .
called " alfa-portal literacy learning , " or apoll for short , the site is financed by the federal ministry for education and research .
less pressure on the pc " the biggest problem for a functioning illiterate is to out oneself , to take the first step of signing up for a course , " said christian fiebig , director of the apoll project .
" through the e-learning portal , we offer the possibility of learning anonymously without having to out oneself , " he told dw-world .
in the future some 17,000 instruction exercises will be available on the site for illiterates to set up their own individual learning plan .
the only prerequisite is that the internet user recognize the address of the web site , www.ich-will-schreiben-lernen.de -lrb- in english : i want to learn to write -rrb- , and save the url as a favorite to visit over and over again .
once at the site , they will be guided through a special tutorial that reads all the instructions and texts out loud .
learning any time at any pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading is a pleasure illiterates never get to appreciate the e-learning page asks each illiterate to evaluate their own skills and then conducts a short test to determine placement within the online course .
before instruction begins , the computer program asks each participant what their goal is : whether they want to be able to read and fill out official forms and deal with bureaucracy , read books or simply improve daily life .
each literacy participant receives an individually outlined program of instruction and exercises to complete for the week .
in the early stages of instruction audio clips and little pictures assist the literacy learner .
later , short news texts and stories will be provided as practice .
the apoll program offers participants the possibility to set the pace and learning intervals according to their own time frame , fiebig explained .
of course that means the illiterate sitting at home in front of the computer requires a good deal of self-discipline .
for this reason fiebig and his colleagues strongly encourage the e-learning participants to take a parallel classroom course .
to encourage learning and motivate the often frustrated participants , the apoll project also offers telephone advice and provides a forum for learners to communicate with one another via voicemail .
adult learners according to fiebig , working with the computer and internet is not a problem for the majority of illiterates .
" the computer and especially the internet are new types of media , and our target audience is very open to them . "
a study conducted recently showed that one-third of all illiterates in germany have a computer and internet connections , albeit mostly for entertainment purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading a train schedule is a real challenge for germany 's illiterates the majority of literacy learners are adults , equally divided between men and women .
most of them are between 30 and 45 years old , said fiebig .
once they reach their mid-adult years , " the difficulties and suffering connected to illiteracy become so significant , that illiterates no longer advance at work or are unable to follow what their children do in school , " said the apoll director .
" we also know that illiteracy isolates , " fiebig added - 51 percent of the target learners are singles .
expanding the literacy program in the long term , apoll hopes to expand their e-learning programs for foreigners living in germany , who never learned to read and write in their native language , let alone german .
because illiteracy is a world problem , and one which is particularly acute in developing countries , the institute for international cooperation -lrb- iz -rrb- in bonn is considering exporting a computer-supported initiative to combat illiteracy in developing countries .
if created , it could be germany 's contribution to the united nation 's decade of literacy , which the organization established in 2003 .
at the moment , an e-learning project similar to the apoll project is in the works in india . monika hoegen -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trapped in illiteracy the european parliament has called for measures to combat illiteracy and social exclusion - a still widespread deficit across europe .

a world leader in developing and promoting renewable energy , germany 's fostering a boom in the solar technology market . tucked away behind trees in the middle of the countryside , the leipziger land solar power plant wednesday in the eastern german village of espenhain is invisible from the road .
it ’ s only when you drive through the gate and onto the site itself that you ’ re confronted with a vast field full of 33,500 shimmering gray panels tilted towards the sun at precisely 30 degrees - the optimum angle for absorbing radiation . the espenhain site , near leipzig , was a deposit for lignite dust - a type of brown coal - and was thus contaminated and couldn ’ t be used for anything else .
the lignite had to first be buried under 30 cm -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- of earth on the 20-hectare -lrb- 49-acre -rrb- plot , before the three-and-a-half meter high sloping frames which support the panels could be set up . the high performance modules , made of monocrystalline silicon , can handle the high voltage as well as delivering a high energy yield .
each panel produces 150 watts of energy .
the plant cost € 22 million -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- to build and is capable of generating five megawatts of electricity . pioneering change germany ’ s pioneering renewable energy law , which was passed four years ago and amended in april this year , decrees that any electricity producer - including private individuals - get paid for the amount they feed into the national grid .
this has encouraged thousands of people to install solar panels on their houses . it would be impossible to realize a project on the scale of the new plant without that kind of guarantee , according to annett fruehling , a project engineer for berlin-based firm geosol , which was responsible for the plant 's planning and development .
shell solar and siemens provided the equipment and technology . " we get a certain amount , a fixed price for the electricity we produce here , and this price is fixed for the next 20 years .
no bank would give you the money for a plant like this without any security on the other side , " fruehling told dw-radio .
" we can meet the electricity demand of 1,800 households , and , on the other hand , we save about 3,700 tons annually in -lrb- carbon dioxide emissions -rrb- . " " ideal for developing world " geosol is planning another solar plant in borna , not far from espenhain , fruehling said .
but the technology should n't be limited to the developed world , ronald uppmann , press officer of the german solar industry association solar e.v. , said .
due to the ease and speed with which solar modules can be installed , this type of clean energy is ideal for use in developing countries , uppmann said . " in wind energy and in photovoltaics and in solar thermal technologies germany is one of the leading nations in the world , uppmann said .
" it is very easy and very useful to export the technology .
so if you think of families that live in the jungle of brazil , they are not supplied with electricity at all , -lrb- but now -rrb- they have the possibility to put a little solar power plant on the rooftop and so they get the possibility to use light , they get the possibility to warm their water . " in the six years that chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats and environmentally-friendly greens has been in office , the amount of electricity generated in germany by renewable energy sources - as opposed to fossil and nuclear fuel - has more than doubled , from 4 to 9 percent .
by supporting projects such as the leipziger land solar power plant , the government aims to increase this share still further - to 20 percent in 2020 , and 50 percent by 2050 . charlotte collins -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no " green " medals for athens greece promised to make athens 2004 the greenest olympics ever , but environmental groups have already given the athens olympic organizing committee -lrb- athoc -rrb- failing grades when it comes to protecting nature .

it ’ s only when you drive through the gate and onto the site itself that you ’ re confronted with a vast field full of 33,500 shimmering gray panels tilted towards the sun at precisely 30 degrees - the optimum angle for absorbing radiation . the espenhain site , near leipzig , was a deposit for lignite dust - a type of brown coal - and was thus contaminated and couldn ’ t be used for anything else .
the lignite had to first be buried under 30 cm -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- of earth on the 20-hectare -lrb- 49-acre -rrb- plot , before the three-and-a-half meter high sloping frames which support the panels could be set up . the high performance modules , made of monocrystalline silicon , can handle the high voltage as well as delivering a high energy yield .
each panel produces 150 watts of energy .
the plant cost € 22 million -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- to build and is capable of generating five megawatts of electricity . pioneering change germany ’ s pioneering renewable energy law , which was passed four years ago and amended in april this year , decrees that any electricity producer - including private individuals - get paid for the amount they feed into the national grid .
this has encouraged thousands of people to install solar panels on their houses . it would be impossible to realize a project on the scale of the new plant without that kind of guarantee , according to annett fruehling , a project engineer for berlin-based firm geosol , which was responsible for the plant 's planning and development .
shell solar and siemens provided the equipment and technology . " we get a certain amount , a fixed price for the electricity we produce here , and this price is fixed for the next 20 years .
no bank would give you the money for a plant like this without any security on the other side , " fruehling told dw-radio .
" we can meet the electricity demand of 1,800 households , and , on the other hand , we save about 3,700 tons annually in -lrb- carbon dioxide emissions -rrb- . " " ideal for developing world " geosol is planning another solar plant in borna , not far from espenhain , fruehling said .
but the technology should n't be limited to the developed world , ronald uppmann , press officer of the german solar industry association solar e.v. , said .
due to the ease and speed with which solar modules can be installed , this type of clean energy is ideal for use in developing countries , uppmann said . " in wind energy and in photovoltaics and in solar thermal technologies germany is one of the leading nations in the world , uppmann said .
" it is very easy and very useful to export the technology .
so if you think of families that live in the jungle of brazil , they are not supplied with electricity at all , -lrb- but now -rrb- they have the possibility to put a little solar power plant on the rooftop and so they get the possibility to use light , they get the possibility to warm their water . " in the six years that chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats and environmentally-friendly greens has been in office , the amount of electricity generated in germany by renewable energy sources - as opposed to fossil and nuclear fuel - has more than doubled , from 4 to 9 percent .
by supporting projects such as the leipziger land solar power plant , the government aims to increase this share still further - to 20 percent in 2020 , and 50 percent by 2050 . charlotte collins -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no " green " medals for athens greece promised to make athens 2004 the greenest olympics ever , but environmental groups have already given the athens olympic organizing committee -lrb- athoc -rrb- failing grades when it comes to protecting nature .

they cheered the soldiers and a bundeswehr battalion was on hand to salute the outgoing troops . the decades together in berlin , the last bastion of west germany in the middle of the gdr , had sparked a special relationship between americans and west berliners .
at the latest , the love affair began in 1948 when the soviet union tried to hermetically seal off west berlin and force france , great britain and the u.s. to give up on the city . berlin airlift seals love affair the us responded by flying in humanitarian aid to tempelhof airport .
the so-called " raisin bombers " brought in desperately-needed supplies , flying their way into the hearts of the west berliners in the process . " above all , we learned what solidarity in the most dire emergency means , " former mayor eberhard diepgen remembered .
" the desire for freedom on the part of the berliners convinced the western world of germany 's will never to live under tyrants again . " the soviet union eventually gave up its attempt on grabbing west berlin .
the allied troops stayed , dividing up the divided city into three different sectors .
they did the same in the rest of germany in an effort to protect the country both from the ussr and itself , according to foreign policy scholar ingo peters . " stationing the troops was important , as a sort of insurance , so that what happened here , germany would n't do again , " peters told deutsche welle . germany 's new role in the world after reunification , allied soldiers were no longer needed .
upon their departure from the eventual german capital , chancellor helmut kohl told the troops that germany had learned by their example . " you can rely on us .
germany will never stand aside when peace and freedom are at stake in the world , " kohl said . german foreign policy has made good on that promise .
the country has come a long way from a policy of non-intervention under the protection of allied troops .
beginning with peacekeeping missions in bosnia after the bosnian war in the early 1990s , germany took part in nato military action against serbia in 1999 and has thousands of troops stationed in nato and un peacekeeping missions , including afghanistan , today . american troops remain in germany , in southern cities like landstuhl , rammstein and kaiserslautern .
but given recent announcements by the us military to move troops out of germany , those , too , may close one day .
but they most likely wo n't get the same send-off . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop pullout to hit local german economies the impact of us plans to pull some 70,000 troops out of europe and asia is likely to be felt most acutely in germany - especially in smaller towns whose economies depend on the us presence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.09.2004 the computer as reading instructor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning the abcs with the pc although they ca n't read and write , that does n't mean illiterates ca n't learn .
but many are too ashamed to take a course .
that 's why a new german initiative offers instruction over the internet . some four million people in germany are illiterate .
even though they went to school , they never learned to read or write properly .
for most of them - adults who have gotten through life with a series of complex compensation strategies - admitting illiteracy is a difficult hurdle to overcome .
only 20,0000 of the country 's so-called functional illiterates -lrb- excluding foreigners who never went to school -rrb- have actually taken advantage of reading courses offered by outreach programs throughout the country .
the rest are often too ashamed to admit their problem by seeking help .
in order to combat illiteracy , a new initiative is being launched in germany to teach reading and writing anonymously via the internet .
on sept .
8 , international literacy day , a special web site goes online to provide individual instruction which serves either as a complement to classroom teaching or as a primary learning source for those not enrolled in a course .
called " alfa-portal literacy learning , " or apoll for short , the site is financed by the federal ministry for education and research .
less pressure on the pc " the biggest problem for a functioning illiterate is to out oneself , to take the first step of signing up for a course , " said christian fiebig , director of the apoll project .
" through the e-learning portal , we offer the possibility of learning anonymously without having to out oneself , " he told dw-world .
in the future some 17,000 instruction exercises will be available on the site for illiterates to set up their own individual learning plan .
the only prerequisite is that the internet user recognize the address of the web site , www.ich-will-schreiben-lernen.de -lrb- in english : i want to learn to write -rrb- , and save the url as a favorite to visit over and over again .
once at the site , they will be guided through a special tutorial that reads all the instructions and texts out loud .
learning any time at any pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading is a pleasure illiterates never get to appreciate the e-learning page asks each illiterate to evaluate their own skills and then conducts a short test to determine placement within the online course .
before instruction begins , the computer program asks each participant what their goal is : whether they want to be able to read and fill out official forms and deal with bureaucracy , read books or simply improve daily life .
each literacy participant receives an individually outlined program of instruction and exercises to complete for the week .
in the early stages of instruction audio clips and little pictures assist the literacy learner .
later , short news texts and stories will be provided as practice .
the apoll program offers participants the possibility to set the pace and learning intervals according to their own time frame , fiebig explained .
of course that means the illiterate sitting at home in front of the computer requires a good deal of self-discipline .
for this reason fiebig and his colleagues strongly encourage the e-learning participants to take a parallel classroom course .
to encourage learning and motivate the often frustrated participants , the apoll project also offers telephone advice and provides a forum for learners to communicate with one another via voicemail .
adult learners according to fiebig , working with the computer and internet is not a problem for the majority of illiterates .
" the computer and especially the internet are new types of media , and our target audience is very open to them . "
a study conducted recently showed that one-third of all illiterates in germany have a computer and internet connections , albeit mostly for entertainment purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading a train schedule is a real challenge for germany 's illiterates the majority of literacy learners are adults , equally divided between men and women .
most of them are between 30 and 45 years old , said fiebig .
once they reach their mid-adult years , " the difficulties and suffering connected to illiteracy become so significant , that illiterates no longer advance at work or are unable to follow what their children do in school , " said the apoll director .
" we also know that illiteracy isolates , " fiebig added - 51 percent of the target learners are singles .
expanding the literacy program in the long term , apoll hopes to expand their e-learning programs for foreigners living in germany , who never learned to read and write in their native language , let alone german .
because illiteracy is a world problem , and one which is particularly acute in developing countries , the institute for international cooperation -lrb- iz -rrb- in bonn is considering exporting a computer-supported initiative to combat illiteracy in developing countries .
if created , it could be germany 's contribution to the united nation 's decade of literacy , which the organization established in 2003 .
at the moment , an e-learning project similar to the apoll project is in the works in india . monika hoegen -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trapped in illiteracy the european parliament has called for measures to combat illiteracy and social exclusion - a still widespread deficit across europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.09.2004 the computer as reading instructor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning the abcs with the pc although they ca n't read and write , that does n't mean illiterates ca n't learn .
but many are too ashamed to take a course .
that 's why a new german initiative offers instruction over the internet . some four million people in germany are illiterate .
even though they went to school , they never learned to read or write properly .
for most of them - adults who have gotten through life with a series of complex compensation strategies - admitting illiteracy is a difficult hurdle to overcome .
only 20,0000 of the country 's so-called functional illiterates -lrb- excluding foreigners who never went to school -rrb- have actually taken advantage of reading courses offered by outreach programs throughout the country .
the rest are often too ashamed to admit their problem by seeking help .
in order to combat illiteracy , a new initiative is being launched in germany to teach reading and writing anonymously via the internet .
on sept .
8 , international literacy day , a special web site goes online to provide individual instruction which serves either as a complement to classroom teaching or as a primary learning source for those not enrolled in a course .
called " alfa-portal literacy learning , " or apoll for short , the site is financed by the federal ministry for education and research .
less pressure on the pc " the biggest problem for a functioning illiterate is to out oneself , to take the first step of signing up for a course , " said christian fiebig , director of the apoll project .
" through the e-learning portal , we offer the possibility of learning anonymously without having to out oneself , " he told dw-world .
in the future some 17,000 instruction exercises will be available on the site for illiterates to set up their own individual learning plan .
the only prerequisite is that the internet user recognize the address of the web site , www.ich-will-schreiben-lernen.de -lrb- in english : i want to learn to write -rrb- , and save the url as a favorite to visit over and over again .
once at the site , they will be guided through a special tutorial that reads all the instructions and texts out loud .
learning any time at any pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading is a pleasure illiterates never get to appreciate the e-learning page asks each illiterate to evaluate their own skills and then conducts a short test to determine placement within the online course .
before instruction begins , the computer program asks each participant what their goal is : whether they want to be able to read and fill out official forms and deal with bureaucracy , read books or simply improve daily life .
each literacy participant receives an individually outlined program of instruction and exercises to complete for the week .
in the early stages of instruction audio clips and little pictures assist the literacy learner .
later , short news texts and stories will be provided as practice .
the apoll program offers participants the possibility to set the pace and learning intervals according to their own time frame , fiebig explained .
of course that means the illiterate sitting at home in front of the computer requires a good deal of self-discipline .
for this reason fiebig and his colleagues strongly encourage the e-learning participants to take a parallel classroom course .
to encourage learning and motivate the often frustrated participants , the apoll project also offers telephone advice and provides a forum for learners to communicate with one another via voicemail .
adult learners according to fiebig , working with the computer and internet is not a problem for the majority of illiterates .
" the computer and especially the internet are new types of media , and our target audience is very open to them . "
a study conducted recently showed that one-third of all illiterates in germany have a computer and internet connections , albeit mostly for entertainment purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading a train schedule is a real challenge for germany 's illiterates the majority of literacy learners are adults , equally divided between men and women .
most of them are between 30 and 45 years old , said fiebig .
once they reach their mid-adult years , " the difficulties and suffering connected to illiteracy become so significant , that illiterates no longer advance at work or are unable to follow what their children do in school , " said the apoll director .
" we also know that illiteracy isolates , " fiebig added - 51 percent of the target learners are singles .
expanding the literacy program in the long term , apoll hopes to expand their e-learning programs for foreigners living in germany , who never learned to read and write in their native language , let alone german .
because illiteracy is a world problem , and one which is particularly acute in developing countries , the institute for international cooperation -lrb- iz -rrb- in bonn is considering exporting a computer-supported initiative to combat illiteracy in developing countries .
if created , it could be germany 's contribution to the united nation 's decade of literacy , which the organization established in 2003 .
at the moment , an e-learning project similar to the apoll project is in the works in india . monika hoegen -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trapped in illiteracy the european parliament has called for measures to combat illiteracy and social exclusion - a still widespread deficit across europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.09.2004 russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says it reserves the right to pre-emptively hit terror bases in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases . " russia 's top general said his country was ready to attack " terrorist bases " anywhere in the caucasus , central asia and other areas near russia .
according to russian news agencies , chief of staff general yuri baluyevsky threatened pre-emptive strikes against organizations harboring terrorists .
" our position on pre-emptive strikes has been stated before , but i will repeat it .
we will take steps to liquidate terrorist bases in any region of the world , " he said after talks with us general james jones , nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
baluyevsky admitted that " military steps are an extreme measure in the fight against terrorism , " and said his country would not revert to the use of the country 's massive nuclear arsenal .
" this does not mean that we will resort to the use of nuclear force , " he said in a statement that has perplexed many european observers .
a first for moscow ?
embroiled in a five-year guerrilla war in rebel chechnya , moscow has frequently staged attacks against the break-away province , but outside its own borders russia has been hesitant to carry out pre-emptive strikes against terrorists .
so far it has only dropped a few bombs on the panskisi gorge in neighboring georgia , where it suspects chechen rebels are hiding and training .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces soldiers take position at the seized school in beslan , north ossetia , friday , sept .
3 , 2004 .
it is therefore all the more surprising that baluyevsky would make such statements , especially since president vladimir putin has not made any comments along the same lines since the hostage-taking crisis in a school in the russian province of north ossetia shocked the country and world a week ago .
a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner emma udwin said the threats would have more weight if coming from the russian president .
" i would pay more attention if it had come from putin , " she said when asked about baluyevsky 's remarks .
kremlin adopts us policy ?
the european commission 's chief spokesman , reijo kemppinen , also dismissed the comments , saying instead : " i think i 've heard that kind of statement before .

western analysts said wednesday 's remarks from chief of staff yuri baluyvsky carried echoes of the us doctrine in the " war on terror " of countering threats by launching first strikes , instead of waiting to be attacked .
on the other hand , russia 's sharply limited reach means the general 's warning would apply in practice to former soviet republics in the caucasus and central asia which moscow still regards as its sphere of influence .
" in practice this doctrine can only apply to the countries adjacent to russia which are not part of a global alliance , " jonathan eyal , russia analyst at the royal united services institute in london , told reuters wire service .
us-russian cooperation the chief of staff 's statements came during the first visit to russia by nato 's top commander .
jones , who stressed the two former cold war foes had entered a new friendly relationship since the september 11 attacks in the united states , said the bond between washington and moscow had grown even stronger after the seizing of the school in the town of beslan by terrorists .
" we face common threats and common challenges , " jones said .
" we are entering a period of heightened cooperation against these threats and this is very , very important . "

" russia 's top general said his country was ready to attack " terrorist bases " anywhere in the caucasus , central asia and other areas near russia .
according to russian news agencies , chief of staff general yuri baluyevsky threatened pre-emptive strikes against organizations harboring terrorists .
" our position on pre-emptive strikes has been stated before , but i will repeat it .
we will take steps to liquidate terrorist bases in any region of the world , " he said after talks with us general james jones , nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
baluyevsky admitted that " military steps are an extreme measure in the fight against terrorism , " and said his country would not revert to the use of the country 's massive nuclear arsenal .
" this does not mean that we will resort to the use of nuclear force , " he said in a statement that has perplexed many european observers .
a first for moscow ?
embroiled in a five-year guerrilla war in rebel chechnya , moscow has frequently staged attacks against the break-away province , but outside its own borders russia has been hesitant to carry out pre-emptive strikes against terrorists .
so far it has only dropped a few bombs on the panskisi gorge in neighboring georgia , where it suspects chechen rebels are hiding and training .

it is therefore all the more surprising that baluyevsky would make such statements , especially since president vladimir putin has not made any comments along the same lines since the hostage-taking crisis in a school in the russian province of north ossetia shocked the country and world a week ago .
a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner emma udwin said the threats would have more weight if coming from the russian president .
" i would pay more attention if it had come from putin , " she said when asked about baluyevsky 's remarks .

the european commission 's chief spokesman , reijo kemppinen , also dismissed the comments , saying instead : " i think i 've heard that kind of statement before .

we will take steps to liquidate terrorist bases in any region of the world , " he said after talks with us general james jones , nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
baluyevsky admitted that " military steps are an extreme measure in the fight against terrorism , " and said his country would not revert to the use of the country 's massive nuclear arsenal .
" this does not mean that we will resort to the use of nuclear force , " he said in a statement that has perplexed many european observers .
a first for moscow ?
embroiled in a five-year guerrilla war in rebel chechnya , moscow has frequently staged attacks against the break-away province , but outside its own borders russia has been hesitant to carry out pre-emptive strikes against terrorists .
so far it has only dropped a few bombs on the panskisi gorge in neighboring georgia , where it suspects chechen rebels are hiding and training .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces soldiers take position at the seized school in beslan , north ossetia , friday , sept .
3 , 2004 .
it is therefore all the more surprising that baluyevsky would make such statements , especially since president vladimir putin has not made any comments along the same lines since the hostage-taking crisis in a school in the russian province of north ossetia shocked the country and world a week ago .
a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner emma udwin said the threats would have more weight if coming from the russian president .
" i would pay more attention if it had come from putin , " she said when asked about baluyevsky 's remarks .
kremlin adopts us policy ?
the european commission 's chief spokesman , reijo kemppinen , also dismissed the comments , saying instead : " i think i 've heard that kind of statement before .
not from russia though . "
western analysts said wednesday 's remarks from chief of staff yuri baluyvsky carried echoes of the us doctrine in the " war on terror " of countering threats by launching first strikes , instead of waiting to be attacked .
on the other hand , russia 's sharply limited reach means the general 's warning would apply in practice to former soviet republics in the caucasus and central asia which moscow still regards as its sphere of influence .
" in practice this doctrine can only apply to the countries adjacent to russia which are not part of a global alliance , " jonathan eyal , russia analyst at the royal united services institute in london , told reuters wire service .
us-russian cooperation the chief of staff 's statements came during the first visit to russia by nato 's top commander .
jones , who stressed the two former cold war foes had entered a new friendly relationship since the september 11 attacks in the united states , said the bond between washington and moscow had grown even stronger after the seizing of the school in the town of beslan by terrorists .
" we face common threats and common challenges , " jones said .
" we are entering a period of heightened cooperation against these threats and this is very , very important . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tv grab from russian ntv showing a terrorist standing guard over hostages inside the school gymnasium in beslan , north ossetia .
the footage was shot by one of the terrorists .
at least 336 civilians , including hundreds of children , died in the three-day school siege in the north ossetian province which borders chechnya .
the american general referred to the hostage-taking as an " insidious attack . "
just like before the launch of the us-led strike against afghanistan that russia backed in october 2001 as a retaliation for the september 11 attacks staged by the afghan-based al qaeda terror network , the two generals said the beslan attack should redouble the two sides ' efforts to fight terror .
" today international terrorism has become an international force , and only through joint action -lrb- with nato -rrb- can we fight this scourge , " baluyevsky said .
the russian general added that the two sides agreed to exchange information on terror cells around the world and to coordinate a rapid response team to fight them . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : russia needs international solidarity official versions of the hostage drama in north ossetia and the true events on the ground are widely divergent .

recently announced price increases by germany 's four biggest energy suppliers - rwe , eon , vattenfall europe and enbw - also caught germany 's federal cartel office 's attention .
some there think the companies are trying to increase profits before a regulatory committee is formed to look through their books sometime in late 2005 or 2006 .
enbw head utz claassen said the price increases are the result of too little competition in the energy market and germany 's decision to move to environmentally friendly energy sources and to stop using nuclear power . more briefs 07.09.2004 -pipe- germans are eating more fish again 07.09.2004 -pipe- german data point to stronger recovery 07.09.2004 -pipe- tui cancels hapag-lloyd ipo 06.09.2004 -pipe- german industrial orders gain 3 percent 06.09.2004 -pipe- deutsche bahn to cut 1,500 jobs 04.09.2004 -pipe- toll collect holds hopes for new start date 03.09.2004 -pipe- frankfurt banks in huge corruption scandal 03.09.2004 -pipe- corporate failures stabilising in germany radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

recently announced price increases by germany 's four biggest energy suppliers - rwe , eon , vattenfall europe and enbw - also caught germany 's federal cartel office 's attention .
some there think the companies are trying to increase profits before a regulatory committee is formed to look through their books sometime in late 2005 or 2006 .
enbw head utz claassen said the price increases are the result of too little competition in the energy market and germany 's decision to move to environmentally friendly energy sources and to stop using nuclear power . more briefs 07.09.2004 -pipe- germans are eating more fish again 07.09.2004 -pipe- german data point to stronger recovery 07.09.2004 -pipe- tui cancels hapag-lloyd ipo 06.09.2004 -pipe- german industrial orders gain 3 percent 06.09.2004 -pipe- deutsche bahn to cut 1,500 jobs 04.09.2004 -pipe- toll collect holds hopes for new start date 03.09.2004 -pipe- frankfurt banks in huge corruption scandal 03.09.2004 -pipe- corporate failures stabilising in germany radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

after more than 40 years in which they kept west berlin safe from the looming soviet threat , the final 2,000 soldiers pulled out of berlin on sept .
8 , 1994 .
soldiers , both from the us and the former soviet union , were no longer needed in the reunified city and the americans either went home or to still-existent bases in southern germany . before they left , 75,000 berliners lined the route upon which the us forces would parade for the last time .
they cheered the soldiers and a bundeswehr battalion was on hand to salute the outgoing troops . the decades together in berlin , the last bastion of west germany in the middle of the gdr , had sparked a special relationship between americans and west berliners .
at the latest , the love affair began in 1948 when the soviet union tried to hermetically seal off west berlin and force france , great britain and the u.s. to give up on the city . berlin airlift seals love affair the us responded by flying in humanitarian aid to tempelhof airport .
the so-called " raisin bombers " brought in desperately-needed supplies , flying their way into the hearts of the west berliners in the process . " above all , we learned what solidarity in the most dire emergency means , " former mayor eberhard diepgen remembered .
" the desire for freedom on the part of the berliners convinced the western world of germany 's will never to live under tyrants again . " the soviet union eventually gave up its attempt on grabbing west berlin .
the allied troops stayed , dividing up the divided city into three different sectors .
they did the same in the rest of germany in an effort to protect the country both from the ussr and itself , according to foreign policy scholar ingo peters . " stationing the troops was important , as a sort of insurance , so that what happened here , germany would n't do again , " peters told deutsche welle . germany 's new role in the world after reunification , allied soldiers were no longer needed .
upon their departure from the eventual german capital , chancellor helmut kohl told the troops that germany had learned by their example . " you can rely on us .
germany will never stand aside when peace and freedom are at stake in the world , " kohl said . german foreign policy has made good on that promise .
the country has come a long way from a policy of non-intervention under the protection of allied troops .
beginning with peacekeeping missions in bosnia after the bosnian war in the early 1990s , germany took part in nato military action against serbia in 1999 and has thousands of troops stationed in nato and un peacekeeping missions , including afghanistan , today . american troops remain in germany , in southern cities like landstuhl , rammstein and kaiserslautern .
but given recent announcements by the us military to move troops out of germany , those , too , may close one day .
but they most likely wo n't get the same send-off . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us troop pullout to hit local german economies the impact of us plans to pull some 70,000 troops out of europe and asia is likely to be felt most acutely in germany - especially in smaller towns whose economies depend on the us presence .

but many are too ashamed to take a course .
that 's why a new german initiative offers instruction over the internet . some four million people in germany are illiterate .
even though they went to school , they never learned to read or write properly .
for most of them - adults who have gotten through life with a series of complex compensation strategies - admitting illiteracy is a difficult hurdle to overcome .
only 20,0000 of the country 's so-called functional illiterates -lrb- excluding foreigners who never went to school -rrb- have actually taken advantage of reading courses offered by outreach programs throughout the country .
the rest are often too ashamed to admit their problem by seeking help .
in order to combat illiteracy , a new initiative is being launched in germany to teach reading and writing anonymously via the internet .
on sept .
8 , international literacy day , a special web site goes online to provide individual instruction which serves either as a complement to classroom teaching or as a primary learning source for those not enrolled in a course .
called " alfa-portal literacy learning , " or apoll for short , the site is financed by the federal ministry for education and research .
less pressure on the pc " the biggest problem for a functioning illiterate is to out oneself , to take the first step of signing up for a course , " said christian fiebig , director of the apoll project .
" through the e-learning portal , we offer the possibility of learning anonymously without having to out oneself , " he told dw-world .
in the future some 17,000 instruction exercises will be available on the site for illiterates to set up their own individual learning plan .
the only prerequisite is that the internet user recognize the address of the web site , www.ich-will-schreiben-lernen.de -lrb- in english : i want to learn to write -rrb- , and save the url as a favorite to visit over and over again .
once at the site , they will be guided through a special tutorial that reads all the instructions and texts out loud .
learning any time at any pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading is a pleasure illiterates never get to appreciate the e-learning page asks each illiterate to evaluate their own skills and then conducts a short test to determine placement within the online course .
before instruction begins , the computer program asks each participant what their goal is : whether they want to be able to read and fill out official forms and deal with bureaucracy , read books or simply improve daily life .
each literacy participant receives an individually outlined program of instruction and exercises to complete for the week .
in the early stages of instruction audio clips and little pictures assist the literacy learner .
later , short news texts and stories will be provided as practice .
the apoll program offers participants the possibility to set the pace and learning intervals according to their own time frame , fiebig explained .
of course that means the illiterate sitting at home in front of the computer requires a good deal of self-discipline .
for this reason fiebig and his colleagues strongly encourage the e-learning participants to take a parallel classroom course .
to encourage learning and motivate the often frustrated participants , the apoll project also offers telephone advice and provides a forum for learners to communicate with one another via voicemail .
adult learners according to fiebig , working with the computer and internet is not a problem for the majority of illiterates .
" the computer and especially the internet are new types of media , and our target audience is very open to them . "
a study conducted recently showed that one-third of all illiterates in germany have a computer and internet connections , albeit mostly for entertainment purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading a train schedule is a real challenge for germany 's illiterates the majority of literacy learners are adults , equally divided between men and women .
most of them are between 30 and 45 years old , said fiebig .
once they reach their mid-adult years , " the difficulties and suffering connected to illiteracy become so significant , that illiterates no longer advance at work or are unable to follow what their children do in school , " said the apoll director .
" we also know that illiteracy isolates , " fiebig added - 51 percent of the target learners are singles .
expanding the literacy program in the long term , apoll hopes to expand their e-learning programs for foreigners living in germany , who never learned to read and write in their native language , let alone german .
because illiteracy is a world problem , and one which is particularly acute in developing countries , the institute for international cooperation -lrb- iz -rrb- in bonn is considering exporting a computer-supported initiative to combat illiteracy in developing countries .
if created , it could be germany 's contribution to the united nation 's decade of literacy , which the organization established in 2003 .

of course that means the illiterate sitting at home in front of the computer requires a good deal of self-discipline .
for this reason fiebig and his colleagues strongly encourage the e-learning participants to take a parallel classroom course .
to encourage learning and motivate the often frustrated participants , the apoll project also offers telephone advice and provides a forum for learners to communicate with one another via voicemail .
adult learners according to fiebig , working with the computer and internet is not a problem for the majority of illiterates .
" the computer and especially the internet are new types of media , and our target audience is very open to them . "
a study conducted recently showed that one-third of all illiterates in germany have a computer and internet connections , albeit mostly for entertainment purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading a train schedule is a real challenge for germany 's illiterates the majority of literacy learners are adults , equally divided between men and women .
most of them are between 30 and 45 years old , said fiebig .
once they reach their mid-adult years , " the difficulties and suffering connected to illiteracy become so significant , that illiterates no longer advance at work or are unable to follow what their children do in school , " said the apoll director .
" we also know that illiteracy isolates , " fiebig added - 51 percent of the target learners are singles .
expanding the literacy program in the long term , apoll hopes to expand their e-learning programs for foreigners living in germany , who never learned to read and write in their native language , let alone german .
because illiteracy is a world problem , and one which is particularly acute in developing countries , the institute for international cooperation -lrb- iz -rrb- in bonn is considering exporting a computer-supported initiative to combat illiteracy in developing countries .
if created , it could be germany 's contribution to the united nation 's decade of literacy , which the organization established in 2003 .

a world leader in developing and promoting renewable energy , germany 's fostering a boom in the solar technology market . tucked away behind trees in the middle of the countryside , the leipziger land solar power plant wednesday in the eastern german village of espenhain is invisible from the road .
it ’ s only when you drive through the gate and onto the site itself that you ’ re confronted with a vast field full of 33,500 shimmering gray panels tilted towards the sun at precisely 30 degrees - the optimum angle for absorbing radiation . the espenhain site , near leipzig , was a deposit for lignite dust - a type of brown coal - and was thus contaminated and couldn ’ t be used for anything else .
the lignite had to first be buried under 30 cm -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- of earth on the 20-hectare -lrb- 49-acre -rrb- plot , before the three-and-a-half meter high sloping frames which support the panels could be set up . the high performance modules , made of monocrystalline silicon , can handle the high voltage as well as delivering a high energy yield .
each panel produces 150 watts of energy .
the plant cost € 22 million -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- to build and is capable of generating five megawatts of electricity . pioneering change germany ’ s pioneering renewable energy law , which was passed four years ago and amended in april this year , decrees that any electricity producer - including private individuals - get paid for the amount they feed into the national grid .
this has encouraged thousands of people to install solar panels on their houses . it would be impossible to realize a project on the scale of the new plant without that kind of guarantee , according to annett fruehling , a project engineer for berlin-based firm geosol , which was responsible for the plant 's planning and development .
shell solar and siemens provided the equipment and technology . " we get a certain amount , a fixed price for the electricity we produce here , and this price is fixed for the next 20 years .
no bank would give you the money for a plant like this without any security on the other side , " fruehling told dw-radio .
" we can meet the electricity demand of 1,800 households , and , on the other hand , we save about 3,700 tons annually in -lrb- carbon dioxide emissions -rrb- . " " ideal for developing world " geosol is planning another solar plant in borna , not far from espenhain , fruehling said .
but the technology should n't be limited to the developed world , ronald uppmann , press officer of the german solar industry association solar e.v. , said .
due to the ease and speed with which solar modules can be installed , this type of clean energy is ideal for use in developing countries , uppmann said . " in wind energy and in photovoltaics and in solar thermal technologies germany is one of the leading nations in the world , uppmann said .
" it is very easy and very useful to export the technology .

" in the six years that chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats and environmentally-friendly greens has been in office , the amount of electricity generated in germany by renewable energy sources - as opposed to fossil and nuclear fuel - has more than doubled , from 4 to 9 percent .

the lignite had to first be buried under 30 cm -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- of earth on the 20-hectare -lrb- 49-acre -rrb- plot , before the three-and-a-half meter high sloping frames which support the panels could be set up . the high performance modules , made of monocrystalline silicon , can handle the high voltage as well as delivering a high energy yield .
each panel produces 150 watts of energy .
the plant cost € 22 million -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- to build and is capable of generating five megawatts of electricity . pioneering change germany ’ s pioneering renewable energy law , which was passed four years ago and amended in april this year , decrees that any electricity producer - including private individuals - get paid for the amount they feed into the national grid .
this has encouraged thousands of people to install solar panels on their houses . it would be impossible to realize a project on the scale of the new plant without that kind of guarantee , according to annett fruehling , a project engineer for berlin-based firm geosol , which was responsible for the plant 's planning and development .
shell solar and siemens provided the equipment and technology . " we get a certain amount , a fixed price for the electricity we produce here , and this price is fixed for the next 20 years .
no bank would give you the money for a plant like this without any security on the other side , " fruehling told dw-radio .
" we can meet the electricity demand of 1,800 households , and , on the other hand , we save about 3,700 tons annually in -lrb- carbon dioxide emissions -rrb- . " " ideal for developing world " geosol is planning another solar plant in borna , not far from espenhain , fruehling said .
but the technology should n't be limited to the developed world , ronald uppmann , press officer of the german solar industry association solar e.v. , said .
due to the ease and speed with which solar modules can be installed , this type of clean energy is ideal for use in developing countries , uppmann said . " in wind energy and in photovoltaics and in solar thermal technologies germany is one of the leading nations in the world , uppmann said .
" it is very easy and very useful to export the technology .
so if you think of families that live in the jungle of brazil , they are not supplied with electricity at all , -lrb- but now -rrb- they have the possibility to put a little solar power plant on the rooftop and so they get the possibility to use light , they get the possibility to warm their water . " in the six years that chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats and environmentally-friendly greens has been in office , the amount of electricity generated in germany by renewable energy sources - as opposed to fossil and nuclear fuel - has more than doubled , from 4 to 9 percent .
by supporting projects such as the leipziger land solar power plant , the government aims to increase this share still further - to 20 percent in 2020 , and 50 percent by 2050 . charlotte collins -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no " green " medals for athens greece promised to make athens 2004 the greenest olympics ever , but environmental groups have already given the athens olympic organizing committee -lrb- athoc -rrb- failing grades when it comes to protecting nature .

but many are too ashamed to take a course .
that 's why a new german initiative offers instruction over the internet . some four million people in germany are illiterate .
even though they went to school , they never learned to read or write properly .
for most of them - adults who have gotten through life with a series of complex compensation strategies - admitting illiteracy is a difficult hurdle to overcome .
only 20,0000 of the country 's so-called functional illiterates -lrb- excluding foreigners who never went to school -rrb- have actually taken advantage of reading courses offered by outreach programs throughout the country .
the rest are often too ashamed to admit their problem by seeking help .
in order to combat illiteracy , a new initiative is being launched in germany to teach reading and writing anonymously via the internet .
on sept .
8 , international literacy day , a special web site goes online to provide individual instruction which serves either as a complement to classroom teaching or as a primary learning source for those not enrolled in a course .
called " alfa-portal literacy learning , " or apoll for short , the site is financed by the federal ministry for education and research .
less pressure on the pc " the biggest problem for a functioning illiterate is to out oneself , to take the first step of signing up for a course , " said christian fiebig , director of the apoll project .
" through the e-learning portal , we offer the possibility of learning anonymously without having to out oneself , " he told dw-world .
in the future some 17,000 instruction exercises will be available on the site for illiterates to set up their own individual learning plan .
the only prerequisite is that the internet user recognize the address of the web site , www.ich-will-schreiben-lernen.de -lrb- in english : i want to learn to write -rrb- , and save the url as a favorite to visit over and over again .
once at the site , they will be guided through a special tutorial that reads all the instructions and texts out loud .
learning any time at any pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading is a pleasure illiterates never get to appreciate the e-learning page asks each illiterate to evaluate their own skills and then conducts a short test to determine placement within the online course .
before instruction begins , the computer program asks each participant what their goal is : whether they want to be able to read and fill out official forms and deal with bureaucracy , read books or simply improve daily life .
each literacy participant receives an individually outlined program of instruction and exercises to complete for the week .
in the early stages of instruction audio clips and little pictures assist the literacy learner .
later , short news texts and stories will be provided as practice .
the apoll program offers participants the possibility to set the pace and learning intervals according to their own time frame , fiebig explained .
of course that means the illiterate sitting at home in front of the computer requires a good deal of self-discipline .
for this reason fiebig and his colleagues strongly encourage the e-learning participants to take a parallel classroom course .
to encourage learning and motivate the often frustrated participants , the apoll project also offers telephone advice and provides a forum for learners to communicate with one another via voicemail .
adult learners according to fiebig , working with the computer and internet is not a problem for the majority of illiterates .
" the computer and especially the internet are new types of media , and our target audience is very open to them . "
a study conducted recently showed that one-third of all illiterates in germany have a computer and internet connections , albeit mostly for entertainment purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading a train schedule is a real challenge for germany 's illiterates the majority of literacy learners are adults , equally divided between men and women .
most of them are between 30 and 45 years old , said fiebig .
once they reach their mid-adult years , " the difficulties and suffering connected to illiteracy become so significant , that illiterates no longer advance at work or are unable to follow what their children do in school , " said the apoll director .
" we also know that illiteracy isolates , " fiebig added - 51 percent of the target learners are singles .
expanding the literacy program in the long term , apoll hopes to expand their e-learning programs for foreigners living in germany , who never learned to read and write in their native language , let alone german .
because illiteracy is a world problem , and one which is particularly acute in developing countries , the institute for international cooperation -lrb- iz -rrb- in bonn is considering exporting a computer-supported initiative to combat illiteracy in developing countries .
if created , it could be germany 's contribution to the united nation 's decade of literacy , which the organization established in 2003 .

only 20,0000 of the country 's so-called functional illiterates -lrb- excluding foreigners who never went to school -rrb- have actually taken advantage of reading courses offered by outreach programs throughout the country .
the rest are often too ashamed to admit their problem by seeking help .
in order to combat illiteracy , a new initiative is being launched in germany to teach reading and writing anonymously via the internet .
on sept .
8 , international literacy day , a special web site goes online to provide individual instruction which serves either as a complement to classroom teaching or as a primary learning source for those not enrolled in a course .
called " alfa-portal literacy learning , " or apoll for short , the site is financed by the federal ministry for education and research .
less pressure on the pc " the biggest problem for a functioning illiterate is to out oneself , to take the first step of signing up for a course , " said christian fiebig , director of the apoll project .
" through the e-learning portal , we offer the possibility of learning anonymously without having to out oneself , " he told dw-world .
in the future some 17,000 instruction exercises will be available on the site for illiterates to set up their own individual learning plan .
the only prerequisite is that the internet user recognize the address of the web site , www.ich-will-schreiben-lernen.de -lrb- in english : i want to learn to write -rrb- , and save the url as a favorite to visit over and over again .
once at the site , they will be guided through a special tutorial that reads all the instructions and texts out loud .
learning any time at any pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading is a pleasure illiterates never get to appreciate the e-learning page asks each illiterate to evaluate their own skills and then conducts a short test to determine placement within the online course .
before instruction begins , the computer program asks each participant what their goal is : whether they want to be able to read and fill out official forms and deal with bureaucracy , read books or simply improve daily life .
each literacy participant receives an individually outlined program of instruction and exercises to complete for the week .
in the early stages of instruction audio clips and little pictures assist the literacy learner .
later , short news texts and stories will be provided as practice .
the apoll program offers participants the possibility to set the pace and learning intervals according to their own time frame , fiebig explained .
of course that means the illiterate sitting at home in front of the computer requires a good deal of self-discipline .
for this reason fiebig and his colleagues strongly encourage the e-learning participants to take a parallel classroom course .
to encourage learning and motivate the often frustrated participants , the apoll project also offers telephone advice and provides a forum for learners to communicate with one another via voicemail .
adult learners according to fiebig , working with the computer and internet is not a problem for the majority of illiterates .
" the computer and especially the internet are new types of media , and our target audience is very open to them . "
a study conducted recently showed that one-third of all illiterates in germany have a computer and internet connections , albeit mostly for entertainment purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading a train schedule is a real challenge for germany 's illiterates the majority of literacy learners are adults , equally divided between men and women .
most of them are between 30 and 45 years old , said fiebig .
once they reach their mid-adult years , " the difficulties and suffering connected to illiteracy become so significant , that illiterates no longer advance at work or are unable to follow what their children do in school , " said the apoll director .
" we also know that illiteracy isolates , " fiebig added - 51 percent of the target learners are singles .
expanding the literacy program in the long term , apoll hopes to expand their e-learning programs for foreigners living in germany , who never learned to read and write in their native language , let alone german .
because illiteracy is a world problem , and one which is particularly acute in developing countries , the institute for international cooperation -lrb- iz -rrb- in bonn is considering exporting a computer-supported initiative to combat illiteracy in developing countries .
if created , it could be germany 's contribution to the united nation 's decade of literacy , which the organization established in 2003 .
at the moment , an e-learning project similar to the apoll project is in the works in india . monika hoegen -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trapped in illiteracy the european parliament has called for measures to combat illiteracy and social exclusion - a still widespread deficit across europe .

nato troops are expected to provide the much needed security for the historic event , but experts worry the alliance may be ill prepared for the job . when the more than 10 million eligible afghans go to the polls on oct .
9 , some 10,000 nato soldiers will be guaranteeing their safety .
in order to do so , the military alliance will have had to double its contingent from the 5,000 troops currently stationed in the country .
that increase in size corresponds to the pledge made to afghan president hamid karsai by the north atlantic alliance during the istanbul summit in june .
after a lengthy internal tug-of-war , the member states had agreed to boost their presence in the country in order to help ensure that the historical first elections take place peacefully .

" the nato contingent in afghanistan will be significantly strengthened in time for the elections , " announced the military alliance 's spokeswoman simone de manso .
the deployment is already underway and should be completed in time for the elections , she added .
" the additional troops will consist of an italian and a spanish battalion as well as a us reserve battalion stationed outside afghanistan , " said manso .
according to nato plans , the new troops are not intended as a permanent expansion of the current military presence in the country .
although the troops are only there to secure the election , " manso said they will " remain in afghanistan for as long as the local commander deems it necessary . "
false priorities despite the commitment to security , not everyone is convinced nato is approaching the elections realistically .
" i regard the whole situation as a mid-size farce , " argued albert stahel , professor for strategic military studies at the technical university in zurich .

an election could be held once the much more crucial reconstruction work is completed - in a couple of years , stahel added .
the swiss expert also warned of placing too much faith in the elections .
" of course it will not be an election according to western democratic standards , " he said .
and in order to guarantee that the elections throughout the country take place freely and peacefully , a much larger military presence will be necessary .
" if one wanted to ensure that the election takes place more or less orderly , that can not be done with just 10,000 soldiers , " he stressed .
at the same time , though , the election can not be postponed , admitted stahel .
the international community can not change the timeframe with such short notice .

they experienced a completely different type of school , learning with computers and experimenting with creativity . ahmad farhad ’ s face is scarred .
during the war , he and three of his brothers were injured , he says .
he doesn ’ t elaborate , merely stares straight ahead , smiles , and changes the topic .
this exchange , he says , is a miracle .
ahmad is 19 years old and a student at kabul ’ s amani high school .
he and 18 other teenagers came to germany about three weeks ago as part of the first german-afghan student exchange program .
on wednesday , the group flies back home , and will take many memories and new ideas with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls and boys have separate schools in afghanistan .
here a girls class in novobod .
for the 18-year-old atifa formuli , one of the group 's eight girls , the exchange proves that men and women can study and work together .
wearing a simple black suit , and flashing green eyes under her headscarf , she explains what the last three weeks have meant for her : " when we come here it means that the position of girls and boys is equal . "
in kabul , boys and girls only spend the first two school years in the same classroom .
but here , atifa says , we can talk to each other .
atifa is a student at the aishe-e-durani girls school .
both her school and amani high school are backed by the german foreign ministry and offer german language classes .
the best students in each school are chosen to travel to saxony , in eastern germany , explains 16-year-old masih ullah hamkar .
they live with host families and experience going to a german school .
long hair and earrings for masih , just seeing the other students in school was an eye-opening experience .
" boys with long hair and earrings - that was something different , " he says .
" there aren ’ t too many like that in afghanistan .
and the girls dress so differently , too , " he recalls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school in tents in novobod although it was interesting to sit in the classroom with the german students , he says he doesn ’ t think much of discipline at the schools here .
in his country , masih says , students respect their teachers .
back home , as many as 60 students crowd into one classroom and a disciplinary slap in the face is not uncommon when the teacher wants to maintain order .
all the afghan students strive for one thing : to learn , to study , so that later , they can help rebuild their country .
during their stay in germany , they were amazed at the beautiful buildings , shops , highways , trains and the green landscape .
but they were especially interested in experiencing the country 's modern teaching methods .
more than rote learning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computers are still rare in afghanistan .
here young women learn an operation system at the shirzai training academy in kandahar , afghanistan .
" it was a real surprise to see the students go to different classrooms to study , " says mohammed feisal .
the teaching methods are very advanced , with computers and all kinds of technical equipment , he remembers .
" the students can see and experience everything , not just read about things in books .
that surprised me . "
equally impressed by what she saw in the german schools , atifa says she will tell the education ministry in afghanistan how students in germany learn .
she was especially intrigued by a particular creative exercise in which all the students in a classroom listened to music and then each drew their own pictures inspired by the music .
at first she thought such a task would be difficult , but it worked , she says , and she managed to come up with ideas on her own .
a german role model ?
" i saw that every person in germany was responsible for their own acts and worked by themselves .
and because of this they have helped make their country beautiful and clean , " atifa recalls .
" when we go back , we will say to everyone that we can also make our country like this , " she pledges .
atifa 's goal , like that of her classmates , is to help rebuild her country .
in order to do that the students all plan to go on to university and get a degree .
many would even like to study in germany and hope for financial support to do so .
it does n't matter if they come from a different cultural background , atifa says : " people are people wherever they are . "
at the moment are no plans for another group of afghan students to visit germany .
and , due to the tense security situation , a visit by german students to afghanistan is not planned any time soon . silke bartlick -lrb- db / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life in afghanistan deutsche welle reporters sandra petersmann and karen fischer explore the country , from kabul to kunduz , documenting the new struggles , the daily fight for survival , the joy of afghan children who are finally back in school and the fate of refugees who have returned to their homeland .

they experienced a completely different type of school , learning with computers and experimenting with creativity . ahmad farhad ’ s face is scarred .
during the war , he and three of his brothers were injured , he says .
he doesn ’ t elaborate , merely stares straight ahead , smiles , and changes the topic .
this exchange , he says , is a miracle .
ahmad is 19 years old and a student at kabul ’ s amani high school .
he and 18 other teenagers came to germany about three weeks ago as part of the first german-afghan student exchange program .
on wednesday , the group flies back home , and will take many memories and new ideas with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls and boys have separate schools in afghanistan .
here a girls class in novobod .
for the 18-year-old atifa formuli , one of the group 's eight girls , the exchange proves that men and women can study and work together .
wearing a simple black suit , and flashing green eyes under her headscarf , she explains what the last three weeks have meant for her : " when we come here it means that the position of girls and boys is equal . "
in kabul , boys and girls only spend the first two school years in the same classroom .
but here , atifa says , we can talk to each other .
atifa is a student at the aishe-e-durani girls school .
both her school and amani high school are backed by the german foreign ministry and offer german language classes .
the best students in each school are chosen to travel to saxony , in eastern germany , explains 16-year-old masih ullah hamkar .
they live with host families and experience going to a german school .
long hair and earrings for masih , just seeing the other students in school was an eye-opening experience .
" boys with long hair and earrings - that was something different , " he says .
" there aren ’ t too many like that in afghanistan .
and the girls dress so differently , too , " he recalls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school in tents in novobod although it was interesting to sit in the classroom with the german students , he says he doesn ’ t think much of discipline at the schools here .
in his country , masih says , students respect their teachers .
back home , as many as 60 students crowd into one classroom and a disciplinary slap in the face is not uncommon when the teacher wants to maintain order .
all the afghan students strive for one thing : to learn , to study , so that later , they can help rebuild their country .
during their stay in germany , they were amazed at the beautiful buildings , shops , highways , trains and the green landscape .
but they were especially interested in experiencing the country 's modern teaching methods .
more than rote learning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computers are still rare in afghanistan .
here young women learn an operation system at the shirzai training academy in kandahar , afghanistan .
" it was a real surprise to see the students go to different classrooms to study , " says mohammed feisal .
the teaching methods are very advanced , with computers and all kinds of technical equipment , he remembers .
" the students can see and experience everything , not just read about things in books .
that surprised me . "
equally impressed by what she saw in the german schools , atifa says she will tell the education ministry in afghanistan how students in germany learn .
she was especially intrigued by a particular creative exercise in which all the students in a classroom listened to music and then each drew their own pictures inspired by the music .
at first she thought such a task would be difficult , but it worked , she says , and she managed to come up with ideas on her own .
a german role model ?
" i saw that every person in germany was responsible for their own acts and worked by themselves .
and because of this they have helped make their country beautiful and clean , " atifa recalls .
" when we go back , we will say to everyone that we can also make our country like this , " she pledges .
atifa 's goal , like that of her classmates , is to help rebuild her country .
in order to do that the students all plan to go on to university and get a degree .
many would even like to study in germany and hope for financial support to do so .
it does n't matter if they come from a different cultural background , atifa says : " people are people wherever they are . "
at the moment are no plans for another group of afghan students to visit germany .

nato troops are expected to provide the much needed security for the historic event , but experts worry the alliance may be ill prepared for the job . when the more than 10 million eligible afghans go to the polls on oct .
9 , some 10,000 nato soldiers will be guaranteeing their safety .
in order to do so , the military alliance will have had to double its contingent from the 5,000 troops currently stationed in the country .
that increase in size corresponds to the pledge made to afghan president hamid karsai by the north atlantic alliance during the istanbul summit in june .
after a lengthy internal tug-of-war , the member states had agreed to boost their presence in the country in order to help ensure that the historical first elections take place peacefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurokorps troops head to afghanistan in aug .
2004 .
they will be part of the expanded nato security force .
" the nato contingent in afghanistan will be significantly strengthened in time for the elections , " announced the military alliance 's spokeswoman simone de manso .
the deployment is already underway and should be completed in time for the elections , she added .
" the additional troops will consist of an italian and a spanish battalion as well as a us reserve battalion stationed outside afghanistan , " said manso .
according to nato plans , the new troops are not intended as a permanent expansion of the current military presence in the country .
although the troops are only there to secure the election , " manso said they will " remain in afghanistan for as long as the local commander deems it necessary . "
false priorities despite the commitment to security , not everyone is convinced nato is approaching the elections realistically .
" i regard the whole situation as a mid-size farce , " argued albert stahel , professor for strategic military studies at the technical university in zurich .
the international community has set false priorities and is placing itself under unnecessary time pressure , stahel told dw-world .
" the elections are coming light years too early , as afghanistan is no where close to being mature enough for democracy , " he maintained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should rebuilding aghanistan take priority over elections ?
" rather than focusing on preparing for an election , -lrb- the international community -rrb- should be working to rebuild the country , for instance concentrating on the infrastructure and the water resources , " he said .
an election could be held once the much more crucial reconstruction work is completed - in a couple of years , stahel added .
the swiss expert also warned of placing too much faith in the elections .
" of course it will not be an election according to western democratic standards , " he said .
and in order to guarantee that the elections throughout the country take place freely and peacefully , a much larger military presence will be necessary .
" if one wanted to ensure that the election takes place more or less orderly , that can not be done with just 10,000 soldiers , " he stressed .
at the same time , though , the election can not be postponed , admitted stahel .
the international community can not change the timeframe with such short notice .
" if the election date is pushed back , the united nations , nato and the united states would risk losing face and the population in afghanistan would not go along with it either .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.09.2004 russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says it reserves the right to pre-emptively hit terror bases in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases . " russia 's top general said his country was ready to attack " terrorist bases " anywhere in the caucasus , central asia and other areas near russia .
according to russian news agencies , chief of staff general yuri baluyevsky threatened pre-emptive strikes against organizations harboring terrorists .
" our position on pre-emptive strikes has been stated before , but i will repeat it .
we will take steps to liquidate terrorist bases in any region of the world , " he said after talks with us general james jones , nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
baluyevsky admitted that " military steps are an extreme measure in the fight against terrorism , " and said his country would not revert to the use of the country 's massive nuclear arsenal .
" this does not mean that we will resort to the use of nuclear force , " he said in a statement that has perplexed many european observers .
a first for moscow ?
embroiled in a five-year guerrilla war in rebel chechnya , moscow has frequently staged attacks against the break-away province , but outside its own borders russia has been hesitant to carry out pre-emptive strikes against terrorists .
so far it has only dropped a few bombs on the panskisi gorge in neighboring georgia , where it suspects chechen rebels are hiding and training .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces soldiers take position at the seized school in beslan , north ossetia , friday , sept .
3 , 2004 .
it is therefore all the more surprising that baluyevsky would make such statements , especially since president vladimir putin has not made any comments along the same lines since the hostage-taking crisis in a school in the russian province of north ossetia shocked the country and world a week ago .
a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner emma udwin said the threats would have more weight if coming from the russian president .
" i would pay more attention if it had come from putin , " she said when asked about baluyevsky 's remarks .
kremlin adopts us policy ?
the european commission 's chief spokesman , reijo kemppinen , also dismissed the comments , saying instead : " i think i 've heard that kind of statement before .
not from russia though . "
western analysts said wednesday 's remarks from chief of staff yuri baluyvsky carried echoes of the us doctrine in the " war on terror " of countering threats by launching first strikes , instead of waiting to be attacked .
on the other hand , russia 's sharply limited reach means the general 's warning would apply in practice to former soviet republics in the caucasus and central asia which moscow still regards as its sphere of influence .
" in practice this doctrine can only apply to the countries adjacent to russia which are not part of a global alliance , " jonathan eyal , russia analyst at the royal united services institute in london , told reuters wire service .
us-russian cooperation the chief of staff 's statements came during the first visit to russia by nato 's top commander .
jones , who stressed the two former cold war foes had entered a new friendly relationship since the september 11 attacks in the united states , said the bond between washington and moscow had grown even stronger after the seizing of the school in the town of beslan by terrorists .
" we face common threats and common challenges , " jones said .
" we are entering a period of heightened cooperation against these threats and this is very , very important . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tv grab from russian ntv showing a terrorist standing guard over hostages inside the school gymnasium in beslan , north ossetia .
the footage was shot by one of the terrorists .
at least 336 civilians , including hundreds of children , died in the three-day school siege in the north ossetian province which borders chechnya .
the american general referred to the hostage-taking as an " insidious attack . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.09.2004 russia threatens pre-emptive strikes against terrorists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says it reserves the right to pre-emptively hit terror bases in the aftermath of the school hostage-taking crisis in southern russia , a high-ranking general announced wednesday that moscow would adopt the us policy of carrying out pre-emptive strikes on " terrorist bases . " russia 's top general said his country was ready to attack " terrorist bases " anywhere in the caucasus , central asia and other areas near russia .
according to russian news agencies , chief of staff general yuri baluyevsky threatened pre-emptive strikes against organizations harboring terrorists .
" our position on pre-emptive strikes has been stated before , but i will repeat it .
we will take steps to liquidate terrorist bases in any region of the world , " he said after talks with us general james jones , nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
baluyevsky admitted that " military steps are an extreme measure in the fight against terrorism , " and said his country would not revert to the use of the country 's massive nuclear arsenal .
" this does not mean that we will resort to the use of nuclear force , " he said in a statement that has perplexed many european observers .
a first for moscow ?
embroiled in a five-year guerrilla war in rebel chechnya , moscow has frequently staged attacks against the break-away province , but outside its own borders russia has been hesitant to carry out pre-emptive strikes against terrorists .
so far it has only dropped a few bombs on the panskisi gorge in neighboring georgia , where it suspects chechen rebels are hiding and training .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : special forces soldiers take position at the seized school in beslan , north ossetia , friday , sept .
3 , 2004 .
it is therefore all the more surprising that baluyevsky would make such statements , especially since president vladimir putin has not made any comments along the same lines since the hostage-taking crisis in a school in the russian province of north ossetia shocked the country and world a week ago .
a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner emma udwin said the threats would have more weight if coming from the russian president .
" i would pay more attention if it had come from putin , " she said when asked about baluyevsky 's remarks .
kremlin adopts us policy ?
the european commission 's chief spokesman , reijo kemppinen , also dismissed the comments , saying instead : " i think i 've heard that kind of statement before .
not from russia though . "
western analysts said wednesday 's remarks from chief of staff yuri baluyvsky carried echoes of the us doctrine in the " war on terror " of countering threats by launching first strikes , instead of waiting to be attacked .
on the other hand , russia 's sharply limited reach means the general 's warning would apply in practice to former soviet republics in the caucasus and central asia which moscow still regards as its sphere of influence .
" in practice this doctrine can only apply to the countries adjacent to russia which are not part of a global alliance , " jonathan eyal , russia analyst at the royal united services institute in london , told reuters wire service .
us-russian cooperation the chief of staff 's statements came during the first visit to russia by nato 's top commander .
jones , who stressed the two former cold war foes had entered a new friendly relationship since the september 11 attacks in the united states , said the bond between washington and moscow had grown even stronger after the seizing of the school in the town of beslan by terrorists .
" we face common threats and common challenges , " jones said .
" we are entering a period of heightened cooperation against these threats and this is very , very important . "

the footage was shot by one of the terrorists .
at least 336 civilians , including hundreds of children , died in the three-day school siege in the north ossetian province which borders chechnya .
the american general referred to the hostage-taking as an " insidious attack . "

western analysts said wednesday 's remarks from chief of staff yuri baluyvsky carried echoes of the us doctrine in the " war on terror " of countering threats by launching first strikes , instead of waiting to be attacked .
on the other hand , russia 's sharply limited reach means the general 's warning would apply in practice to former soviet republics in the caucasus and central asia which moscow still regards as its sphere of influence .
" in practice this doctrine can only apply to the countries adjacent to russia which are not part of a global alliance , " jonathan eyal , russia analyst at the royal united services institute in london , told reuters wire service .
us-russian cooperation the chief of staff 's statements came during the first visit to russia by nato 's top commander .
jones , who stressed the two former cold war foes had entered a new friendly relationship since the september 11 attacks in the united states , said the bond between washington and moscow had grown even stronger after the seizing of the school in the town of beslan by terrorists .
" we face common threats and common challenges , " jones said .
" we are entering a period of heightened cooperation against these threats and this is very , very important . "

" russia 's top general said his country was ready to attack " terrorist bases " anywhere in the caucasus , central asia and other areas near russia .
according to russian news agencies , chief of staff general yuri baluyevsky threatened pre-emptive strikes against organizations harboring terrorists .
" our position on pre-emptive strikes has been stated before , but i will repeat it .
we will take steps to liquidate terrorist bases in any region of the world , " he said after talks with us general james jones , nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
baluyevsky admitted that " military steps are an extreme measure in the fight against terrorism , " and said his country would not revert to the use of the country 's massive nuclear arsenal .
" this does not mean that we will resort to the use of nuclear force , " he said in a statement that has perplexed many european observers .
a first for moscow ?
embroiled in a five-year guerrilla war in rebel chechnya , moscow has frequently staged attacks against the break-away province , but outside its own borders russia has been hesitant to carry out pre-emptive strikes against terrorists .
so far it has only dropped a few bombs on the panskisi gorge in neighboring georgia , where it suspects chechen rebels are hiding and training .

it is therefore all the more surprising that baluyevsky would make such statements , especially since president vladimir putin has not made any comments along the same lines since the hostage-taking crisis in a school in the russian province of north ossetia shocked the country and world a week ago .
a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner emma udwin said the threats would have more weight if coming from the russian president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.09.2004 germany opens world 's biggest solar plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy for 1,800 households the world ’ s biggest solar power plant was inaugurated in the german town of espenhain wednesday .
a world leader in developing and promoting renewable energy , germany 's fostering a boom in the solar technology market . tucked away behind trees in the middle of the countryside , the leipziger land solar power plant wednesday in the eastern german village of espenhain is invisible from the road .
it ’ s only when you drive through the gate and onto the site itself that you ’ re confronted with a vast field full of 33,500 shimmering gray panels tilted towards the sun at precisely 30 degrees - the optimum angle for absorbing radiation . the espenhain site , near leipzig , was a deposit for lignite dust - a type of brown coal - and was thus contaminated and couldn ’ t be used for anything else .
the lignite had to first be buried under 30 cm -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- of earth on the 20-hectare -lrb- 49-acre -rrb- plot , before the three-and-a-half meter high sloping frames which support the panels could be set up . the high performance modules , made of monocrystalline silicon , can handle the high voltage as well as delivering a high energy yield .
each panel produces 150 watts of energy .
the plant cost € 22 million -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- to build and is capable of generating five megawatts of electricity . pioneering change germany ’ s pioneering renewable energy law , which was passed four years ago and amended in april this year , decrees that any electricity producer - including private individuals - get paid for the amount they feed into the national grid .
this has encouraged thousands of people to install solar panels on their houses . it would be impossible to realize a project on the scale of the new plant without that kind of guarantee , according to annett fruehling , a project engineer for berlin-based firm geosol , which was responsible for the plant 's planning and development .
shell solar and siemens provided the equipment and technology . " we get a certain amount , a fixed price for the electricity we produce here , and this price is fixed for the next 20 years .
no bank would give you the money for a plant like this without any security on the other side , " fruehling told dw-radio .
" we can meet the electricity demand of 1,800 households , and , on the other hand , we save about 3,700 tons annually in -lrb- carbon dioxide emissions -rrb- . " " ideal for developing world " geosol is planning another solar plant in borna , not far from espenhain , fruehling said .
but the technology should n't be limited to the developed world , ronald uppmann , press officer of the german solar industry association solar e.v. , said .
due to the ease and speed with which solar modules can be installed , this type of clean energy is ideal for use in developing countries , uppmann said . " in wind energy and in photovoltaics and in solar thermal technologies germany is one of the leading nations in the world , uppmann said .
" it is very easy and very useful to export the technology .
so if you think of families that live in the jungle of brazil , they are not supplied with electricity at all , -lrb- but now -rrb- they have the possibility to put a little solar power plant on the rooftop and so they get the possibility to use light , they get the possibility to warm their water . " in the six years that chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats and environmentally-friendly greens has been in office , the amount of electricity generated in germany by renewable energy sources - as opposed to fossil and nuclear fuel - has more than doubled , from 4 to 9 percent .
by supporting projects such as the leipziger land solar power plant , the government aims to increase this share still further - to 20 percent in 2020 , and 50 percent by 2050 . charlotte collins -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no " green " medals for athens greece promised to make athens 2004 the greenest olympics ever , but environmental groups have already given the athens olympic organizing committee -lrb- athoc -rrb- failing grades when it comes to protecting nature .

how would you explain the name to your fans abroad ? tommi : the name originally comes from the fact that we 're two people and this is a two person project .
but then , of course , there 's this funny situation : due to the wall and the division between east and west , the language was also divided .
now , 15 years after the fall of the wall , there are still differences , and germans from the east and west have different ways of describing a two-room apartment because they prefer to use different words for room : " zimmer " in the west and " raum " in the east .
we took this linguistic anomaly to be a synonym for berlin , and since we are from the west we incorporated the " raum " into our name to represent a kind of connection . what is your relationship to the german language like ?
foreigners often describe the language as hard , but in your music you make it sound light and soft . inga : that 's true .
after i sing in german , i also think the language is quite hard .
we take great pains to make it sound softer .
but we also have a bit of experience singing in english .
now we have decided to record some of our songs in english , like " sexy girl " and " spiel mit , " which is on the premium version of our cd .
and just yesterday , we recorded an english version of " wir sind anderen . " i recently heard from toni kater , a berlin musician who is on the same label , that when she first met both of you , she identified your band with the " berlin scene . "
do you identify with any " scene " at all , and to what extent is your music tied to the city of berlin ? inga : with the " scene " no , but definitely with the city .
there are so many " scenes " in berlin , but the city is an important source of inspiration for us .
without berlin , we probably would n't exist .
berlin is so big and multi-faceted , and there 's so much freedom here that many different varieties of music can develop .
it 's nice , i think , to be connected to the soul of this city .
i will always be in love with berlin . when you write your songs , do you have a specific public in mind ? tommi : we try to make the kind of music we would enjoy and compose songs we would want to listen to , even if we were n't writing it ourselves .
that 's also how we approached the new album : even if we had n't made it ourselves , would we want to listen to it ?
at least this is what we always try and do .
we do n't have a particular person or listener in mind .
we simply make music for ourselves and for our friends .

we are just as inspired by air and madonna as by miss kittin and märtini brös .

i guess i listen to other things too , like chet baker … the german press recently accused you of being too optimistic and not political enough .
do you have a response to them ?
and why are you so optimistic ? tommi : first of all , i think it is very important to be optimistic .
when we make music , we are simply in a good mood and people can tell .
but i also do n't agree that our music is not political .
when someone takes their own feelings seriously and shares it with other people , then it is perhaps not - strictly speaking - political , but it certainly has a greater meaning for society . inga : it was a very deliberate decision to be optimistic and to remain optimistic .
i think it 's not the best choice - just because the times are hard - to whine and complain along with everyone else .
instead , people should ask themselves what they can do to make things better for themselves and for everyone others .
i think positive thinking is the basis of that .
and besides , i do n't really understand why the germans complain so much - things are n't really that bad . do you plan on touring abroad ? inga : yes , lots .

in both style and spirit , many resemble their predecessors of the " neue deutsche welle " -lrb- german new wave -rrb- , which rocked out german-style in the eighties . instead of cranking out cookie-cutter pop hits in english that currently dominate germany 's airwaves , a growing number of young germans are choosing to sing auf deutsch .
they are picking up on the tradition of acts such as nena , trio and falco - who helped make music with german lyrics in the late 1970s and early 1980s popular . deutsche welle interviewed the members of " 2raumwohnung , " inga humpe and tommie eckart , who along with bands like " wir sind helden " are launching the second wave . the name " 2raumwohnung " -lrb- 2-room apartment -rrb- has a lot of symbolic meaning related to german history .
how would you explain the name to your fans abroad ? tommi : the name originally comes from the fact that we 're two people and this is a two person project .
but then , of course , there 's this funny situation : due to the wall and the division between east and west , the language was also divided .
now , 15 years after the fall of the wall , there are still differences , and germans from the east and west have different ways of describing a two-room apartment because they prefer to use different words for room : " zimmer " in the west and " raum " in the east .
we took this linguistic anomaly to be a synonym for berlin , and since we are from the west we incorporated the " raum " into our name to represent a kind of connection . what is your relationship to the german language like ?
foreigners often describe the language as hard , but in your music you make it sound light and soft . inga : that 's true .
after i sing in german , i also think the language is quite hard .
we take great pains to make it sound softer .
but we also have a bit of experience singing in english .
now we have decided to record some of our songs in english , like " sexy girl " and " spiel mit , " which is on the premium version of our cd .
and just yesterday , we recorded an english version of " wir sind anderen . " i recently heard from toni kater , a berlin musician who is on the same label , that when she first met both of you , she identified your band with the " berlin scene . "
do you identify with any " scene " at all , and to what extent is your music tied to the city of berlin ? inga : with the " scene " no , but definitely with the city .
there are so many " scenes " in berlin , but the city is an important source of inspiration for us .
without berlin , we probably would n't exist .
berlin is so big and multi-faceted , and there 's so much freedom here that many different varieties of music can develop .
it 's nice , i think , to be connected to the soul of this city .
i will always be in love with berlin . when you write your songs , do you have a specific public in mind ? tommi : we try to make the kind of music we would enjoy and compose songs we would want to listen to , even if we were n't writing it ourselves .
that 's also how we approached the new album : even if we had n't made it ourselves , would we want to listen to it ?
at least this is what we always try and do .
we do n't have a particular person or listener in mind .
we simply make music for ourselves and for our friends .
i think our fans are not so different than we are . from which musical genre does " 2raumwohnung " draw inspiration ? tommi : we try to draw upon everything we like .
we are just as inspired by air and madonna as by miss kittin and märtini brös .
even older music , like kraftwerk and music from the ' 70s , has influenced us . what are you listening to at the moment ? tommi : i am listening to lots of air at the moment , and i love phoenix .
i guess i listen to other things too , like chet baker … the german press recently accused you of being too optimistic and not political enough .
do you have a response to them ?
and why are you so optimistic ? tommi : first of all , i think it is very important to be optimistic .
when we make music , we are simply in a good mood and people can tell .
but i also do n't agree that our music is not political .
when someone takes their own feelings seriously and shares it with other people , then it is perhaps not - strictly speaking - political , but it certainly has a greater meaning for society . inga : it was a very deliberate decision to be optimistic and to remain optimistic .
i think it 's not the best choice - just because the times are hard - to whine and complain along with everyone else .
instead , people should ask themselves what they can do to make things better for themselves and for everyone others .
i think positive thinking is the basis of that .
and besides , i do n't really understand why the germans complain so much - things are n't really that bad . do you plan on touring abroad ? inga : yes , lots .
we are always getting offers from brazil and mexico . tommi : sadly , it has n't worked out in brazil .
but we 've already played in russia and in japan and we have plans for concerts in spain and turkey . look for " 2raumwohnung " and other representatives of the new " german wave " at a venue near you soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy .

in both style and spirit , many resemble their predecessors of the " neue deutsche welle " -lrb- german new wave -rrb- , which rocked out german-style in the eighties . instead of cranking out cookie-cutter pop hits in english that currently dominate germany 's airwaves , a growing number of young germans are choosing to sing auf deutsch .
they are picking up on the tradition of acts such as nena , trio and falco - who helped make music with german lyrics in the late 1970s and early 1980s popular . deutsche welle interviewed the members of " 2raumwohnung , " inga humpe and tommie eckart , who along with bands like " wir sind helden " are launching the second wave . the name " 2raumwohnung " -lrb- 2-room apartment -rrb- has a lot of symbolic meaning related to german history .
how would you explain the name to your fans abroad ? tommi : the name originally comes from the fact that we 're two people and this is a two person project .
but then , of course , there 's this funny situation : due to the wall and the division between east and west , the language was also divided .
now , 15 years after the fall of the wall , there are still differences , and germans from the east and west have different ways of describing a two-room apartment because they prefer to use different words for room : " zimmer " in the west and " raum " in the east .
we took this linguistic anomaly to be a synonym for berlin , and since we are from the west we incorporated the " raum " into our name to represent a kind of connection . what is your relationship to the german language like ?
foreigners often describe the language as hard , but in your music you make it sound light and soft . inga : that 's true .
after i sing in german , i also think the language is quite hard .
we take great pains to make it sound softer .
but we also have a bit of experience singing in english .
now we have decided to record some of our songs in english , like " sexy girl " and " spiel mit , " which is on the premium version of our cd .
and just yesterday , we recorded an english version of " wir sind anderen . " i recently heard from toni kater , a berlin musician who is on the same label , that when she first met both of you , she identified your band with the " berlin scene . "
do you identify with any " scene " at all , and to what extent is your music tied to the city of berlin ? inga : with the " scene " no , but definitely with the city .
there are so many " scenes " in berlin , but the city is an important source of inspiration for us .
without berlin , we probably would n't exist .
berlin is so big and multi-faceted , and there 's so much freedom here that many different varieties of music can develop .
it 's nice , i think , to be connected to the soul of this city .
i will always be in love with berlin . when you write your songs , do you have a specific public in mind ? tommi : we try to make the kind of music we would enjoy and compose songs we would want to listen to , even if we were n't writing it ourselves .
that 's also how we approached the new album : even if we had n't made it ourselves , would we want to listen to it ?
at least this is what we always try and do .
we do n't have a particular person or listener in mind .
we simply make music for ourselves and for our friends .
i think our fans are not so different than we are . from which musical genre does " 2raumwohnung " draw inspiration ? tommi : we try to draw upon everything we like .
we are just as inspired by air and madonna as by miss kittin and märtini brös .
even older music , like kraftwerk and music from the ' 70s , has influenced us . what are you listening to at the moment ? tommi : i am listening to lots of air at the moment , and i love phoenix .
i guess i listen to other things too , like chet baker … the german press recently accused you of being too optimistic and not political enough .
do you have a response to them ?
and why are you so optimistic ? tommi : first of all , i think it is very important to be optimistic .
when we make music , we are simply in a good mood and people can tell .
but i also do n't agree that our music is not political .
when someone takes their own feelings seriously and shares it with other people , then it is perhaps not - strictly speaking - political , but it certainly has a greater meaning for society . inga : it was a very deliberate decision to be optimistic and to remain optimistic .
i think it 's not the best choice - just because the times are hard - to whine and complain along with everyone else .
instead , people should ask themselves what they can do to make things better for themselves and for everyone others .
i think positive thinking is the basis of that .
and besides , i do n't really understand why the germans complain so much - things are n't really that bad . do you plan on touring abroad ? inga : yes , lots .
we are always getting offers from brazil and mexico . tommi : sadly , it has n't worked out in brazil .
but we 've already played in russia and in japan and we have plans for concerts in spain and turkey . look for " 2raumwohnung " and other representatives of the new " german wave " at a venue near you soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.09.2004 germany opens world 's biggest solar plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy for 1,800 households the world ’ s biggest solar power plant was inaugurated in the german town of espenhain wednesday .
a world leader in developing and promoting renewable energy , germany 's fostering a boom in the solar technology market . tucked away behind trees in the middle of the countryside , the leipziger land solar power plant wednesday in the eastern german village of espenhain is invisible from the road .
it ’ s only when you drive through the gate and onto the site itself that you ’ re confronted with a vast field full of 33,500 shimmering gray panels tilted towards the sun at precisely 30 degrees - the optimum angle for absorbing radiation . the espenhain site , near leipzig , was a deposit for lignite dust - a type of brown coal - and was thus contaminated and couldn ’ t be used for anything else .
the lignite had to first be buried under 30 cm -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- of earth on the 20-hectare -lrb- 49-acre -rrb- plot , before the three-and-a-half meter high sloping frames which support the panels could be set up . the high performance modules , made of monocrystalline silicon , can handle the high voltage as well as delivering a high energy yield .
each panel produces 150 watts of energy .
the plant cost € 22 million -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- to build and is capable of generating five megawatts of electricity . pioneering change germany ’ s pioneering renewable energy law , which was passed four years ago and amended in april this year , decrees that any electricity producer - including private individuals - get paid for the amount they feed into the national grid .
this has encouraged thousands of people to install solar panels on their houses . it would be impossible to realize a project on the scale of the new plant without that kind of guarantee , according to annett fruehling , a project engineer for berlin-based firm geosol , which was responsible for the plant 's planning and development .
shell solar and siemens provided the equipment and technology . " we get a certain amount , a fixed price for the electricity we produce here , and this price is fixed for the next 20 years .
no bank would give you the money for a plant like this without any security on the other side , " fruehling told dw-radio .
" we can meet the electricity demand of 1,800 households , and , on the other hand , we save about 3,700 tons annually in -lrb- carbon dioxide emissions -rrb- . " " ideal for developing world " geosol is planning another solar plant in borna , not far from espenhain , fruehling said .
but the technology should n't be limited to the developed world , ronald uppmann , press officer of the german solar industry association solar e.v. , said .
due to the ease and speed with which solar modules can be installed , this type of clean energy is ideal for use in developing countries , uppmann said . " in wind energy and in photovoltaics and in solar thermal technologies germany is one of the leading nations in the world , uppmann said .
" it is very easy and very useful to export the technology .
so if you think of families that live in the jungle of brazil , they are not supplied with electricity at all , -lrb- but now -rrb- they have the possibility to put a little solar power plant on the rooftop and so they get the possibility to use light , they get the possibility to warm their water . " in the six years that chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats and environmentally-friendly greens has been in office , the amount of electricity generated in germany by renewable energy sources - as opposed to fossil and nuclear fuel - has more than doubled , from 4 to 9 percent .
by supporting projects such as the leipziger land solar power plant , the government aims to increase this share still further - to 20 percent in 2020 , and 50 percent by 2050 . charlotte collins -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no " green " medals for athens greece promised to make athens 2004 the greenest olympics ever , but environmental groups have already given the athens olympic organizing committee -lrb- athoc -rrb- failing grades when it comes to protecting nature .

sven jaschan , 18 , was arrested after telling officials he originally wanted to create a virus , " netsky , " to automatically remove two other viruses , mydoom and bagle , from infected computers .
he had developed several versions of " netsky " and , after modifying it , created " sasser . " " sasser , " which took advantage of a known flaw with microsoft corp. 's windows operating system , snarled tens of thousands of computers and caused internet traffic to slow .
prosecutors said they have been contacted by 143 plaintiffs with total damage claims of € 130,000 -lrb- $ 158,000 -rrb- but because many businesses and individuals never report such damages , prosecutors believe the actual figure is in the millions .
jaschan was caught after informants seeking a reward tipped off microsoft .
he was arrested sitting at his computer at the house of his mother , who runs a computer store in the small northern town of waffensen .
computer sabotage carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.09.2004 germany opens world 's biggest solar plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy for 1,800 households the world ’ s biggest solar power plant was inaugurated in the german town of espenhain wednesday .
a world leader in developing and promoting renewable energy , germany 's fostering a boom in the solar technology market . tucked away behind trees in the middle of the countryside , the leipziger land solar power plant wednesday in the eastern german village of espenhain is invisible from the road .
it ’ s only when you drive through the gate and onto the site itself that you ’ re confronted with a vast field full of 33,500 shimmering gray panels tilted towards the sun at precisely 30 degrees - the optimum angle for absorbing radiation . the espenhain site , near leipzig , was a deposit for lignite dust - a type of brown coal - and was thus contaminated and couldn ’ t be used for anything else .
the lignite had to first be buried under 30 cm -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- of earth on the 20-hectare -lrb- 49-acre -rrb- plot , before the three-and-a-half meter high sloping frames which support the panels could be set up . the high performance modules , made of monocrystalline silicon , can handle the high voltage as well as delivering a high energy yield .
each panel produces 150 watts of energy .
the plant cost € 22 million -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- to build and is capable of generating five megawatts of electricity . pioneering change germany ’ s pioneering renewable energy law , which was passed four years ago and amended in april this year , decrees that any electricity producer - including private individuals - get paid for the amount they feed into the national grid .
this has encouraged thousands of people to install solar panels on their houses . it would be impossible to realize a project on the scale of the new plant without that kind of guarantee , according to annett fruehling , a project engineer for berlin-based firm geosol , which was responsible for the plant 's planning and development .
shell solar and siemens provided the equipment and technology . " we get a certain amount , a fixed price for the electricity we produce here , and this price is fixed for the next 20 years .
no bank would give you the money for a plant like this without any security on the other side , " fruehling told dw-radio .
" we can meet the electricity demand of 1,800 households , and , on the other hand , we save about 3,700 tons annually in -lrb- carbon dioxide emissions -rrb- . " " ideal for developing world " geosol is planning another solar plant in borna , not far from espenhain , fruehling said .
but the technology should n't be limited to the developed world , ronald uppmann , press officer of the german solar industry association solar e.v. , said .
due to the ease and speed with which solar modules can be installed , this type of clean energy is ideal for use in developing countries , uppmann said . " in wind energy and in photovoltaics and in solar thermal technologies germany is one of the leading nations in the world , uppmann said .
" it is very easy and very useful to export the technology .
so if you think of families that live in the jungle of brazil , they are not supplied with electricity at all , -lrb- but now -rrb- they have the possibility to put a little solar power plant on the rooftop and so they get the possibility to use light , they get the possibility to warm their water . " in the six years that chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats and environmentally-friendly greens has been in office , the amount of electricity generated in germany by renewable energy sources - as opposed to fossil and nuclear fuel - has more than doubled , from 4 to 9 percent .
by supporting projects such as the leipziger land solar power plant , the government aims to increase this share still further - to 20 percent in 2020 , and 50 percent by 2050 . charlotte collins -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no " green " medals for athens greece promised to make athens 2004 the greenest olympics ever , but environmental groups have already given the athens olympic organizing committee -lrb- athoc -rrb- failing grades when it comes to protecting nature .

the nation 's near 2.0 percent growth along with current economic conditions should be enough to bring down the debt he said .
although he said there would be no special rules set just for germany , he argued that the pact 's conditions should be more flexible in allowing for longer periods of economic stagnation , such as during the past three years , while rewarding governments that save during good times . dw-world.de stability pact plans prompt criticism both german finance minister hans eichel and the european commission took flak for separate stability and growth pact proposals on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.09.2004 germany opens world 's biggest solar plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy for 1,800 households the world ’ s biggest solar power plant was inaugurated in the german town of espenhain wednesday .
a world leader in developing and promoting renewable energy , germany 's fostering a boom in the solar technology market . tucked away behind trees in the middle of the countryside , the leipziger land solar power plant wednesday in the eastern german village of espenhain is invisible from the road .
it ’ s only when you drive through the gate and onto the site itself that you ’ re confronted with a vast field full of 33,500 shimmering gray panels tilted towards the sun at precisely 30 degrees - the optimum angle for absorbing radiation . the espenhain site , near leipzig , was a deposit for lignite dust - a type of brown coal - and was thus contaminated and couldn ’ t be used for anything else .
the lignite had to first be buried under 30 cm -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- of earth on the 20-hectare -lrb- 49-acre -rrb- plot , before the three-and-a-half meter high sloping frames which support the panels could be set up . the high performance modules , made of monocrystalline silicon , can handle the high voltage as well as delivering a high energy yield .
each panel produces 150 watts of energy .
the plant cost € 22 million -lrb- $ 26.5 million -rrb- to build and is capable of generating five megawatts of electricity . pioneering change germany ’ s pioneering renewable energy law , which was passed four years ago and amended in april this year , decrees that any electricity producer - including private individuals - get paid for the amount they feed into the national grid .
this has encouraged thousands of people to install solar panels on their houses . it would be impossible to realize a project on the scale of the new plant without that kind of guarantee , according to annett fruehling , a project engineer for berlin-based firm geosol , which was responsible for the plant 's planning and development .
shell solar and siemens provided the equipment and technology . " we get a certain amount , a fixed price for the electricity we produce here , and this price is fixed for the next 20 years .
no bank would give you the money for a plant like this without any security on the other side , " fruehling told dw-radio .
" we can meet the electricity demand of 1,800 households , and , on the other hand , we save about 3,700 tons annually in -lrb- carbon dioxide emissions -rrb- . " " ideal for developing world " geosol is planning another solar plant in borna , not far from espenhain , fruehling said .
but the technology should n't be limited to the developed world , ronald uppmann , press officer of the german solar industry association solar e.v. , said .
due to the ease and speed with which solar modules can be installed , this type of clean energy is ideal for use in developing countries , uppmann said . " in wind energy and in photovoltaics and in solar thermal technologies germany is one of the leading nations in the world , uppmann said .
" it is very easy and very useful to export the technology .
so if you think of families that live in the jungle of brazil , they are not supplied with electricity at all , -lrb- but now -rrb- they have the possibility to put a little solar power plant on the rooftop and so they get the possibility to use light , they get the possibility to warm their water . " in the six years that chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats and environmentally-friendly greens has been in office , the amount of electricity generated in germany by renewable energy sources - as opposed to fossil and nuclear fuel - has more than doubled , from 4 to 9 percent .
by supporting projects such as the leipziger land solar power plant , the government aims to increase this share still further - to 20 percent in 2020 , and 50 percent by 2050 . charlotte collins -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no " green " medals for athens greece promised to make athens 2004 the greenest olympics ever , but environmental groups have already given the athens olympic organizing committee -lrb- athoc -rrb- failing grades when it comes to protecting nature .

" a coach could n't wish for a better opportunity , " beamed klinsmann at the pre-match press conference on tuesday .
" i 'm absolutely convinced there will be an explosive atmosphere . " " this fixture is a classic and every single player will be particularly motivated , " klinsmann added .
" i want the players to be more active , to move the ball forward quickly and to always do what 's best for the team .

" we want to know where the team stands 21 months before the 2006 world cup , which is so important for german football , " bierhoff told the assembled reporters on tuesday . players dismiss talk of revenge the players themselves are also unconcerned about avenging the heart-breaking defeat in yokohama .

" you can not compare a world cup final with a friendly match . " meanwhile , brazilian-born germany striker kevin kuranyi also has other things on his mind , like showing the country of his birth what it let slip away .
" things have been going well for me recently and it would be great to score a goal against brazil , " the 22-year-old stuttgart player told the press conference .

the friendly in berlin will be all about germany 's future not its past . germany 's new national team chief jürgen klinsmann pits his fledgling coaching skills against the world champions brazil on wednesday night in his first real test as head of the country 's soccer stars . and the former germany striker is optimistic his fully fit and highly motivated side can build on the 3-1 success over austria in his first game to wipe away the still painful memories of the 2-0 defeat at the hands of the brazilians in the 2002 world cup final . " a coach could n't wish for a better opportunity , " beamed klinsmann at the pre-match press conference on tuesday .
" i 'm absolutely convinced there will be an explosive atmosphere . " " this fixture is a classic and every single player will be particularly motivated , " klinsmann added .
" i want the players to be more active , to move the ball forward quickly and to always do what 's best for the team .
i also want them to believe in themselves because football is very much a mental thing . " first home game will be crucial klinsmann will be facing a home crowd for the first time in his short reign since he took over the running of the national team from rudi völler after the euro 2004 debacle .
the former bayern munich , inter milan and monaco striker is hoping to get the support of a skeptical audience in berlin 's renovated olympic stadium where the friendly match is being played . bildunterschrift : joachim löw , jürgen klinsmann and oliver bierhoff want new scores settled not old ones .
despite being the first meeting between the two teams since germany 's stumble at the final hurdle at the world cup in japan / korea in 2002 , the coaching team of klinsmann , fellow ex-striker oliver bierhoff and joachim löw have been quick to play down talk of a revenge match against the team that ended germany 's improbable shot at glory two years ago , preferring to look to the future rather than the past . " we want to know where the team stands 21 months before the 2006 world cup , which is so important for german football , " bierhoff told the assembled reporters on tuesday . players dismiss talk of revenge the players themselves are also unconcerned about avenging the heart-breaking defeat in yokohama .
" talking about revenge is absurd , " bayern munich goalkeeper oliver kahn told magazine kicker .
" you can not compare a world cup final with a friendly match . " meanwhile , brazilian-born germany striker kevin kuranyi also has other things on his mind , like showing the country of his birth what it let slip away .
" things have been going well for me recently and it would be great to score a goal against brazil , " the 22-year-old stuttgart player told the press conference .
" hopefully , the brazilians will know about me after the game .

another german player who will want to show the brazilians what he is made of on the international stage is sebastian deisler , although it would not matter to the bayern munich midfielder who the opponents were on wednesday evening . almost exactly a year to the day since he last pulled on a national team jersey , the 24-year-old deisler will be looking to pull down the curtain on a troublesome year of injuries and depression by lining up alongside bayern munich club-mates michael ballack and torsten frings in the heart of klinsmann 's midfield .

the legendary collection of 18th century treasures includes a cherry pit with 113 faces . the " new green vault " in the largely restored palace of august the strong -lrb- 1670-1733 -rrb- opened wednesday to the public with over virtually priceless 1,000 artifacts . " this is an important step on a long path , at the end of which the palace will be one of the most significant museums in europe , " georg milbradt , premier of the german state of saxony , said at a ceremony in dresden 's opulent baroque semper opera house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " daphne " drinking vessel , silver , gold plate , coral , abraham jamnitzer , nuremberg , late 16th century all together , the 4,000 artifacts in the green vault are a testimony to saxon elector and polish king august the strong 's passion for collecting and to the skills of saxon and european gold smiths and jewelers . " it is not the rebirth of the augustinian treasure chamber museum , but instead the contribution of the 21st century to the history of collecting , a gift from the past to the present and the future , " director dirk sydram said .
centuries old the vast collection , which the king started in 1723 , includes copper etchings and gold-filigreed ornaments , and a cherry pit in which at least 113 faces were carved - an earlier count , in 1595 , put the number at 185 .

work on the vault alone has cost around € 25 million -lrb- around $ 30 million -rrb- . most of the artifacts had already been moved to safety , when three of the eight rooms of the green vault were destroyed by allied bombers in february 1945 .
after the war , they were confiscated by the red army and sent to the soviet union .
the collection was finally returned to dresden in 1958 , where it has been on show at the albertinum museum for the past three decades . nearly 3,000 more valuables from the collection are due to be returned to the restored historic rooms of the green vault next to the modern new rooms where the current exhibit opened in late 2006 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years .

but many are too ashamed to take a course .
that 's why a new german initiative offers instruction over the internet . some four million people in germany are illiterate .
even though they went to school , they never learned to read or write properly .
for most of them - adults who have gotten through life with a series of complex compensation strategies - admitting illiteracy is a difficult hurdle to overcome .
only 20,0000 of the country 's so-called functional illiterates -lrb- excluding foreigners who never went to school -rrb- have actually taken advantage of reading courses offered by outreach programs throughout the country .
the rest are often too ashamed to admit their problem by seeking help .
in order to combat illiteracy , a new initiative is being launched in germany to teach reading and writing anonymously via the internet .
on sept .
8 , international literacy day , a special web site goes online to provide individual instruction which serves either as a complement to classroom teaching or as a primary learning source for those not enrolled in a course .
called " alfa-portal literacy learning , " or apoll for short , the site is financed by the federal ministry for education and research .
less pressure on the pc " the biggest problem for a functioning illiterate is to out oneself , to take the first step of signing up for a course , " said christian fiebig , director of the apoll project .
" through the e-learning portal , we offer the possibility of learning anonymously without having to out oneself , " he told dw-world .
in the future some 17,000 instruction exercises will be available on the site for illiterates to set up their own individual learning plan .
the only prerequisite is that the internet user recognize the address of the web site , www.ich-will-schreiben-lernen.de -lrb- in english : i want to learn to write -rrb- , and save the url as a favorite to visit over and over again .
once at the site , they will be guided through a special tutorial that reads all the instructions and texts out loud .
learning any time at any pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading is a pleasure illiterates never get to appreciate the e-learning page asks each illiterate to evaluate their own skills and then conducts a short test to determine placement within the online course .
before instruction begins , the computer program asks each participant what their goal is : whether they want to be able to read and fill out official forms and deal with bureaucracy , read books or simply improve daily life .
each literacy participant receives an individually outlined program of instruction and exercises to complete for the week .
in the early stages of instruction audio clips and little pictures assist the literacy learner .
later , short news texts and stories will be provided as practice .
the apoll program offers participants the possibility to set the pace and learning intervals according to their own time frame , fiebig explained .
of course that means the illiterate sitting at home in front of the computer requires a good deal of self-discipline .
for this reason fiebig and his colleagues strongly encourage the e-learning participants to take a parallel classroom course .
to encourage learning and motivate the often frustrated participants , the apoll project also offers telephone advice and provides a forum for learners to communicate with one another via voicemail .
adult learners according to fiebig , working with the computer and internet is not a problem for the majority of illiterates .
" the computer and especially the internet are new types of media , and our target audience is very open to them . "
a study conducted recently showed that one-third of all illiterates in germany have a computer and internet connections , albeit mostly for entertainment purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading a train schedule is a real challenge for germany 's illiterates the majority of literacy learners are adults , equally divided between men and women .
most of them are between 30 and 45 years old , said fiebig .
once they reach their mid-adult years , " the difficulties and suffering connected to illiteracy become so significant , that illiterates no longer advance at work or are unable to follow what their children do in school , " said the apoll director .
" we also know that illiteracy isolates , " fiebig added - 51 percent of the target learners are singles .
expanding the literacy program in the long term , apoll hopes to expand their e-learning programs for foreigners living in germany , who never learned to read and write in their native language , let alone german .
because illiteracy is a world problem , and one which is particularly acute in developing countries , the institute for international cooperation -lrb- iz -rrb- in bonn is considering exporting a computer-supported initiative to combat illiteracy in developing countries .
if created , it could be germany 's contribution to the united nation 's decade of literacy , which the organization established in 2003 .

adult learners according to fiebig , working with the computer and internet is not a problem for the majority of illiterates .
" the computer and especially the internet are new types of media , and our target audience is very open to them . "
a study conducted recently showed that one-third of all illiterates in germany have a computer and internet connections , albeit mostly for entertainment purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading a train schedule is a real challenge for germany 's illiterates the majority of literacy learners are adults , equally divided between men and women .
most of them are between 30 and 45 years old , said fiebig .
once they reach their mid-adult years , " the difficulties and suffering connected to illiteracy become so significant , that illiterates no longer advance at work or are unable to follow what their children do in school , " said the apoll director .
" we also know that illiteracy isolates , " fiebig added - 51 percent of the target learners are singles .
expanding the literacy program in the long term , apoll hopes to expand their e-learning programs for foreigners living in germany , who never learned to read and write in their native language , let alone german .
because illiteracy is a world problem , and one which is particularly acute in developing countries , the institute for international cooperation -lrb- iz -rrb- in bonn is considering exporting a computer-supported initiative to combat illiteracy in developing countries .
if created , it could be germany 's contribution to the united nation 's decade of literacy , which the organization established in 2003 .

but many are too ashamed to take a course .
that 's why a new german initiative offers instruction over the internet . some four million people in germany are illiterate .
even though they went to school , they never learned to read or write properly .
for most of them - adults who have gotten through life with a series of complex compensation strategies - admitting illiteracy is a difficult hurdle to overcome .
only 20,0000 of the country 's so-called functional illiterates -lrb- excluding foreigners who never went to school -rrb- have actually taken advantage of reading courses offered by outreach programs throughout the country .
the rest are often too ashamed to admit their problem by seeking help .
in order to combat illiteracy , a new initiative is being launched in germany to teach reading and writing anonymously via the internet .
on sept .
8 , international literacy day , a special web site goes online to provide individual instruction which serves either as a complement to classroom teaching or as a primary learning source for those not enrolled in a course .
called " alfa-portal literacy learning , " or apoll for short , the site is financed by the federal ministry for education and research .
less pressure on the pc " the biggest problem for a functioning illiterate is to out oneself , to take the first step of signing up for a course , " said christian fiebig , director of the apoll project .
" through the e-learning portal , we offer the possibility of learning anonymously without having to out oneself , " he told dw-world .
in the future some 17,000 instruction exercises will be available on the site for illiterates to set up their own individual learning plan .
the only prerequisite is that the internet user recognize the address of the web site , www.ich-will-schreiben-lernen.de -lrb- in english : i want to learn to write -rrb- , and save the url as a favorite to visit over and over again .
once at the site , they will be guided through a special tutorial that reads all the instructions and texts out loud .
learning any time at any pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading is a pleasure illiterates never get to appreciate the e-learning page asks each illiterate to evaluate their own skills and then conducts a short test to determine placement within the online course .
before instruction begins , the computer program asks each participant what their goal is : whether they want to be able to read and fill out official forms and deal with bureaucracy , read books or simply improve daily life .
each literacy participant receives an individually outlined program of instruction and exercises to complete for the week .
in the early stages of instruction audio clips and little pictures assist the literacy learner .
later , short news texts and stories will be provided as practice .
the apoll program offers participants the possibility to set the pace and learning intervals according to their own time frame , fiebig explained .
of course that means the illiterate sitting at home in front of the computer requires a good deal of self-discipline .
for this reason fiebig and his colleagues strongly encourage the e-learning participants to take a parallel classroom course .
to encourage learning and motivate the often frustrated participants , the apoll project also offers telephone advice and provides a forum for learners to communicate with one another via voicemail .
adult learners according to fiebig , working with the computer and internet is not a problem for the majority of illiterates .
" the computer and especially the internet are new types of media , and our target audience is very open to them . "

" this is an important step on a long path , at the end of which the palace will be one of the most significant museums in europe , " georg milbradt , premier of the german state of saxony , said at a ceremony in dresden 's opulent baroque semper opera house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " daphne " drinking vessel , silver , gold plate , coral , abraham jamnitzer , nuremberg , late 16th century all together , the 4,000 artifacts in the green vault are a testimony to saxon elector and polish king august the strong 's passion for collecting and to the skills of saxon and european gold smiths and jewelers . " it is not the rebirth of the augustinian treasure chamber museum , but instead the contribution of the 21st century to the history of collecting , a gift from the past to the present and the future , " director dirk sydram said .
centuries old the vast collection , which the king started in 1723 , includes copper etchings and gold-filigreed ornaments , and a cherry pit in which at least 113 faces were carved - an earlier count , in 1595 , put the number at 185 .

after the war , they were confiscated by the red army and sent to the soviet union .
the collection was finally returned to dresden in 1958 , where it has been on show at the albertinum museum for the past three decades . nearly 3,000 more valuables from the collection are due to be returned to the restored historic rooms of the green vault next to the modern new rooms where the current exhibit opened in late 2006 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years .

in order to do so , the military alliance will have had to double its contingent from the 5,000 troops currently stationed in the country .
that increase in size corresponds to the pledge made to afghan president hamid karsai by the north atlantic alliance during the istanbul summit in june .
after a lengthy internal tug-of-war , the member states had agreed to boost their presence in the country in order to help ensure that the historical first elections take place peacefully .

" the nato contingent in afghanistan will be significantly strengthened in time for the elections , " announced the military alliance 's spokeswoman simone de manso .
the deployment is already underway and should be completed in time for the elections , she added .
" the additional troops will consist of an italian and a spanish battalion as well as a us reserve battalion stationed outside afghanistan , " said manso .

the council for national parks -lrb- cnp -rrb- says there are several old quarrying permits that could be used in the next 40 years in the national park .
it said , if used , such permissions could have potentially disastrous consequences for the landscape , archaeology and nature conservation .
the national park authority said if necessary it would always negotiate to minimise any potential damage .
environmental conditions the cnp said dartmoor had six dormant quarries , 16 old permits for extracting minerals and several active quarries .
there is also one dormant permit for exmoor .
the old quarries and permits could be used up until 2042 .
the cnp said current laws regulating those existing quarries did not impose modern environmental conditions , so companies operating within the law could damage national parks they worked in .
the council has called for tighter regulation of active quarries and for old dormant quarry permits to be dealt with .
as part of its 2004 to 2005 performance plan , the dartmoor national park authority said it expected " some changes to the operation within one of the working quarries and other reclamation work is expected " .
but it added : " usual liaison and negotiations will minimise damage to the national park .
no new major developments are anticipated during the year . "

the us army confirmed reports it is considering the break-up of the deal , thought to be worth $ 13bn -lrb- £ 7.3bn -rrb- .
it added the firm would be allowed to rebid if the contract is cancelled .
but halliburton chief executive dave lesar said that a fresh bid would depend on how many separate pieces emerged from the contract break-up .
the us army is now considering which parts of the multibillion-dollar logistics contract awarded to halliburton to feed , house , and operate services for troops could go to competitive bid .
charges concerns the company has been accused of overcharging since it was handed the no-bid contract last year .
us vice-president dick cheney headed the firm until he took office in 2001 .
he has , however , denied that this has led to preferential treatment for the firm .
on tuesday the wall street journal reported that the army planned to break up the contract , quoting an army memorandum which estimates the contract to be worth $ 13bn -lrb- £ 7.3bn -rrb- .
at this point i do n't see that we could lose , whatever the outcome , because if we keep some of it -lrb- the iraq contract -rrb- , it would be higher margins dave lesar , halliburton in the memo dated 25 august , the newspaper says , the army 's chief of procurement policy , tina balard , directed top officials to " immediately begin the transition to competitively awarded sustainment contracts for support of us military forces in iraq " .
the memo also addresses the army 's increasing frustration with efforts to devise a final estimated cost of the work , the journal continues .
us defence officials said the intention to break the contract with halliburton was not intended to penalise its kellogg brown & root -lrb- kbr -rrb- unit which handles the iraq operation .
kbr provides troops in kuwait and iraq with housing , dining halls , transportation and laundry services .
' normal process ' the army 's decision to review the contract was the usual procedure for big military contingency contracts some time after engagement , dan carlson , spokesman for us army field support - which oversees the halliburton contract - said .
" it 's a normal part of the process , " he added .
the final decision on which functions will be put out to tender will be left up to military commanders in iraq , who will then oversee them .
however , halliburton 's chief said he viewed the possible rebidding move as a positive one for the company which can make profit margins of around 2 % on the contract .
" at this point i do n't see that we could lose , whatever the outcome , because if we keep some of it , it would be higher margins , " he said .
" if we 're out , we 'll get our liquidity and we 'll move on with our business , " he added .

the final decision on which functions will be put out to tender will be left up to military commanders in iraq , who will then oversee them .
however , halliburton 's chief said he viewed the possible rebidding move as a positive one for the company which can make profit margins of around 2 % on the contract .
" at this point i do n't see that we could lose , whatever the outcome , because if we keep some of it , it would be higher margins , " he said .
" if we 're out , we 'll get our liquidity and we 'll move on with our business , " he added .

the local authority has agreed to help pay for improvements to the ageing sewage network in the east end of the city with funds of up to £ 4.5m.
the council said water and drainage were not its responsibility , but the regeneration of the east end was being held up by a lack of capacity .
it said a direct financial contribution was the only way forward .
scottish water said its priority had been improving tap water and it had no money left to pay for upgrades to infrastructure .
the new agreement will see both sides fund the upgrade , allowing work to get under way on several projects , including a £ 52m housing development at garthamlock .
up to £ 3.5m will be made available to scottish water between october 2004 and march 2006 , with the council carrying out an additional £ 1m of surface water management works at queenslie to assist with industrial developments .
council leader charlie gordon said : " while water and sewerage are not our responsibility , the council is determined to do all it can to ensure quality developments such as that proposed for garthamlock , and we are satisfied that giving £ 3.5m to scottish water is the right thing to do . "
the move is likely to fuel the debate on who should pay for this kind of work - scottish water , local authorities or developers .

the sale of the 18.25 % stake in qantas is expected to land ba at least a $ 1.1bn -lrb- £ 425m ; $ 753m -rrb- , the uk airline added .
" we now believe it is in our best interests to sell our shares to pay down our debt , " ba chief executive rod eddington said .
ba bought its stake in qantas in 1993 for a $ 665m -lrb- £ 304m at the time -rrb- and has since received a $ 600m in dividends .
qantas requested a trading halt for its shares before the australian market opened on wednesday .
neither airline now believes the shareholding is necessary for the ongoing conduct of that relationship geoff dixon , qantas check ba 's share price shares in the group closed 1.2 % higher on tuesday at a $ 3.33 .
ba 's original stake was 25 % of the australian airline , but this has since been diluted as qantas sold shares to fund expansion .
" ba has been a supportive shareholder over a period of some 10 years and both airlines have formed a strong and constructive relationship , " qantas chief executive geoff dixon said .
" neither airline now believes the shareholding is necessary for the ongoing conduct of that relationship , " he added .
bid rumours there has been speculation in australia that regional heavyweight singapore airlines may be interested in the sell-off , as it has been hunting for a strong foothold in the australian market for some time .
however , analysts expect institutional investors to snap up most of the stake .
both airlines said that the sale would have no effect on their current " joint service agreement " -lrb- jsa -rrb- .
the agreement includes joint flight schedules , sales , and operations between australia , europe , south east asia and the uk .
the two airlines operate the so-called " kangaroo route " between london and australia which allows them to co-ordinate schedules and fix prices .
the airline industry has been battling tough conditions in the past three years - struggling to recover from heavy losses after terrorism , the iraq war , and sars virus outbreak cut travel .
heavy competition from no-frills rivals and rising fuel costs are also taking their toll .
cost cutting in an effort to cut costs ba has slashed 13,000 jobs and cut costs by £ 869m .
it will put the money raised from the qantas stake sale towards reducing its £ 5.6bn -lrb- $ 10bn -rrb- debt mountain .
meanwhile , qantas also announced plans to lower its commission to travel agents for all flights sold in australia .
" distribution costs remain high and the current base-commission structure is simply not sustainable in such a low fare environment , " head of sales and distribution , rob gurney , said .
commissions paid on domestic flights will fall to 1 % from 5 % in january , as will cash paid out for flights to and from new zealand .
for international fares , commission payments will drop to 7 % from 9 % .
brent mitchell , analyst at shaw stockbroking , told news agency reuters that the move could be designed to shift more bookings to the internet where costs are cheaper .

" distribution costs remain high and the current base-commission structure is simply not sustainable in such a low fare environment , " head of sales and distribution , rob gurney , said .
commissions paid on domestic flights will fall to 1 % from 5 % in january , as will cash paid out for flights to and from new zealand .
for international fares , commission payments will drop to 7 % from 9 % .

blyth valley council wants users of personal watercraft to sign up to the " voluntary " registration scheme .
the move is aimed at reducing the risks to bathers and beach users .
the authority says those who do not register with the scheme will not be allowed to launch high-speed leisure craft from the beach .
in recent years blyth beach has become a popular location for water sports like surfing , canoeing and in particular , the use of personal watercraft .
as the numbers continue to rise , the council says it needs to better monitor watercraft users , and at the same time make sure that all beach users are protected .
' effective system ' bob watson , portfolio holder for community regeneration and culture , said : " i think it is excellent that other local authorities are recognising this scheme as something positive and are willing to adopt our code of conduct .
" we have put in place an effective system aimed at protecting all users of blyth beach , not just those who use personal watercraft . "
he said watercraft users will also have to stay within designated " zones " .
signs informing visitors about the new code of conduct will be erected at the main access points along the coastline .
the council 's coastal warden , arthur cranson , said : " the safe use of the beach and the sea is our first priority and encouraging people to use the area in harmony will certainly make that priority easier to achieve .
" the success of this scheme will hopefully help us to secure more funding to improve the facilities on the links for everyone . "

on its 500th anniversary , michelangelo 's david is as popular now as it was in 1504 .
the appeal is partly sheer size - standing five metres high , the sculpture is as tall as a double-decker bus .
worked from an enormous block of marble , it weighs in at a staggering six tonnes .
even to the untrained eye , the dimensions are overwhelming .
no wonder , then , that experts discovered signs of stress in david 's ankles last year .
superintendent of city museums antonio paolucci explains : " he 's a good looking guy with fragile ankles because when michelangelo worked his marble he lightened the lower part a bit too much . "
but size is not all that matters . "
it was very much a symbol of republican ideals " professor jane everson royal holloway college the statue represents one of the greatest achievements of arguably the world 's greatest artist .
" part of the appeal is that he actually managed to finish the whole thing .
michelangelo was famous for not finishing things , " says hugo chapman , curator of italian drawings at london 's british museum .
david also put michelangelo firmly in the a-list of renaissance artists .
the block of tuscan marble used for the statue had confounded great sculptors decades before michelangelo even picked up his chisel .
during the 1460s sculptors had been unable to cope with the size of the block because it was too big .
" at the beginning of the 16th century the idea was resurrected and the young michelangelo sensed an opportunity , " hugo chapman says .
he managed to carve the whole statue in less than two years .
given that he was an artist in his mid-20s with few high-profile pieces in his portfolio , this was a major step .
but not everyone appreciated david 's beauty .
stone-throwing on its way to be installed outside the florentine seat of government in 1504 , the statue was pelted with stones by local citizens .
some experts say the attack was politically motivated .
the people were angered at what they saw as a symbol of the florence republic as opposed to the reign of the exiled medici family .
other experts believe the stone-throwing was youthful thuggery .
either way , the statue survived unscathed and became an iconic symbol of florence .
" it was created at a time when there was a lot of tension in florence between the medici family and the republicans , " says jane everson , professor of italian literature at royal holloway college in london .
" it was very much a symbol of republican ideals because it is the image of the small david standing against goliath , " she adds .
but that is not the end of david 's story .
dirty a potted history reveals damage to the statue during riots in 1527 , when david lost the lower half of his left arm in a riot .
and in 1810 the statue was covered with a protective wax and in 1843 an attempt to remove the wax with hydrochloric acid also stripped away some of the original surface .
david was moved to his current home , the galleria dell accademia , in florence in 1873 for his own protection .
but in 1991 an italian painter launched a hammer attack on the statue , smashing off a toe .
and in the mid-1990s the suggestion that perhaps david was a little bit dirty and could do with a clean engulfed the art restoration community in a bitter 11-year row .
in 2003 the decision was made to clean the statue using distilled water .
critics howled that the method could seriously damage the masterpiece .
but in may this year the new-look , cleaner david was unveiled to the italian public , apparently unharmed by his overdue spring clean .
on wednesday florence will kick off nine months of festivities for david 's birthday .
concerts , fireworks , symposiums , exhibitions and of course official david 500 t-shirts will mark the occasion .
after half a millennium of washing , stone-throwing and hammering , david 's birthday party is definitely a well-earned celebration .

on its 500th anniversary , michelangelo 's david is as popular now as it was in 1504 .
the appeal is partly sheer size - standing five metres high , the sculpture is as tall as a double-decker bus .
worked from an enormous block of marble , it weighs in at a staggering six tonnes .
even to the untrained eye , the dimensions are overwhelming .
no wonder , then , that experts discovered signs of stress in david 's ankles last year .
superintendent of city museums antonio paolucci explains : " he 's a good looking guy with fragile ankles because when michelangelo worked his marble he lightened the lower part a bit too much . "

" part of the appeal is that he actually managed to finish the whole thing .
michelangelo was famous for not finishing things , " says hugo chapman , curator of italian drawings at london 's british museum .
david also put michelangelo firmly in the a-list of renaissance artists .
the block of tuscan marble used for the statue had confounded great sculptors decades before michelangelo even picked up his chisel .
during the 1460s sculptors had been unable to cope with the size of the block because it was too big .
" at the beginning of the 16th century the idea was resurrected and the young michelangelo sensed an opportunity , " hugo chapman says .

stone-throwing on its way to be installed outside the florentine seat of government in 1504 , the statue was pelted with stones by local citizens .
some experts say the attack was politically motivated .
the people were angered at what they saw as a symbol of the florence republic as opposed to the reign of the exiled medici family .
the restoration work sparked an 11-year-long argument other experts believe the stone-throwing was youthful thuggery .
either way , the statue survived unscathed and became an iconic symbol of florence .
" it was created at a time when there was a lot of tension in florence between the medici family and the republicans , " says jane everson , professor of italian literature at royal holloway college in london .
" it was very much a symbol of republican ideals because it is the image of the small david standing against goliath , " she adds .
but that is not the end of david 's story .
dirty a potted history reveals damage to the statue during riots in 1527 , when david lost the lower half of his left arm in a riot .
and in 1810 the statue was covered with a protective wax and in 1843 an attempt to remove the wax with hydrochloric acid also stripped away some of the original surface .
david was moved to his current home , the galleria dell accademia , in florence in 1873 for his own protection .
but in 1991 an italian painter launched a hammer attack on the statue , smashing off a toe .
and in the mid-1990s the suggestion that perhaps david was a little bit dirty and could do with a clean engulfed the art restoration community in a bitter 11-year row .
in 2003 the decision was made to clean the statue using distilled water .
critics howled that the method could seriously damage the masterpiece .
but in may this year the new-look , cleaner david was unveiled to the italian public , apparently unharmed by his overdue spring clean .

it was very much a symbol of republican ideals professor jane everson royal holloway college the statue represents one of the greatest achievements of arguably the world 's greatest artist .
" part of the appeal is that he actually managed to finish the whole thing .
michelangelo was famous for not finishing things , " says hugo chapman , curator of italian drawings at london 's british museum .
david also put michelangelo firmly in the a-list of renaissance artists .
the block of tuscan marble used for the statue had confounded great sculptors decades before michelangelo even picked up his chisel .
during the 1460s sculptors had been unable to cope with the size of the block because it was too big .
" at the beginning of the 16th century the idea was resurrected and the young michelangelo sensed an opportunity , " hugo chapman says .
he managed to carve the whole statue in less than two years .
given that he was an artist in his mid-20s with few high-profile pieces in his portfolio , this was a major step .
but not everyone appreciated david 's beauty .
stone-throwing on its way to be installed outside the florentine seat of government in 1504 , the statue was pelted with stones by local citizens .
some experts say the attack was politically motivated .
the people were angered at what they saw as a symbol of the florence republic as opposed to the reign of the exiled medici family .
the restoration work sparked an 11-year-long argument other experts believe the stone-throwing was youthful thuggery .
either way , the statue survived unscathed and became an iconic symbol of florence .
" it was created at a time when there was a lot of tension in florence between the medici family and the republicans , " says jane everson , professor of italian literature at royal holloway college in london .
" it was very much a symbol of republican ideals because it is the image of the small david standing against goliath , " she adds .
but that is not the end of david 's story .
dirty a potted history reveals damage to the statue during riots in 1527 , when david lost the lower half of his left arm in a riot .
and in 1810 the statue was covered with a protective wax and in 1843 an attempt to remove the wax with hydrochloric acid also stripped away some of the original surface .
david was moved to his current home , the galleria dell accademia , in florence in 1873 for his own protection .
but in 1991 an italian painter launched a hammer attack on the statue , smashing off a toe .
and in the mid-1990s the suggestion that perhaps david was a little bit dirty and could do with a clean engulfed the art restoration community in a bitter 11-year row .
in 2003 the decision was made to clean the statue using distilled water .
critics howled that the method could seriously damage the masterpiece .
but in may this year the new-look , cleaner david was unveiled to the italian public , apparently unharmed by his overdue spring clean .
on wednesday florence will kick off nine months of festivities for david 's birthday .
concerts , fireworks , symposiums , exhibitions and of course official david 500 t-shirts will mark the occasion .
after half a millennium of washing , stone-throwing and hammering , david 's birthday party is definitely a well-earned celebration .
