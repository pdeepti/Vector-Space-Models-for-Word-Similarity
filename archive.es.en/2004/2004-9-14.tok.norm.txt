the proposal is seen as another example of team chief jürgen klinsmann 's growing control . despite playing host to soccer 's most prestigious event , the world cup , in 2006 , germany may not play the opening game of the tournament .
germany 's organizing committee chairman franz beckenbauer said on monday that the option to pass the honor to reigning world champions brazil , providing they qualify , was being discussed . since 1974 the world cup winners have taken to the field in the opening match and it is expected that germany will allow this tradition to continue with brazil opening the tournament on june 9 , 2006 at munich 's new allianz arena . beckenbauer also confirmed that the possibility arose from discussions held with team chief jürgen klinsmann who had expressed a preference for the hosts to start the tournament three days later at the olympic stadium in berlin than in the opening match in munich .
it is believed his reasons centered on giving his team more time to prepare . " we , at the organizing committee , do n't mind whether germany or brazil play the opening game , " beckenbauer told german sports television channel dsf .
" we would have liked germany to start with a highlight but the brazil solution would not be bad either , " he added . team manager oliver bierhoff seemed to be more definite in his view . " we will step aside for brazil , " he told the german news agency dpa .

klinsmann , who was appointed in july , has also been stamping his identity on other areas of the world cup 2006 plan by informing the organizing committee that he was against the idea of having germany 's training camp in leverkusen , which he felt was not practical . the plan to have the camp in leverkusen was agreed when klinsmann 's predecessor rudi völler was still in charge and was seen as compensation after the city 's bid to stage games of the 2006 finals was turned down because its stadium was too small . " he -lrb- klinsmann -rrb- has the right to refuse what rudi völler found correct and to have the team training somewhere else , " beckenbauer said . leverkusen anger over dfb reverse this could cause problems for the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .

the proposal is seen as another example of team chief jürgen klinsmann 's growing control . despite playing host to soccer 's most prestigious event , the world cup , in 2006 , germany may not play the opening game of the tournament .
germany 's organizing committee chairman franz beckenbauer said on monday that the option to pass the honor to reigning world champions brazil , providing they qualify , was being discussed . since 1974 the world cup winners have taken to the field in the opening match and it is expected that germany will allow this tradition to continue with brazil opening the tournament on june 9 , 2006 at munich 's new allianz arena . beckenbauer also confirmed that the possibility arose from discussions held with team chief jürgen klinsmann who had expressed a preference for the hosts to start the tournament three days later at the olympic stadium in berlin than in the opening match in munich .
it is believed his reasons centered on giving his team more time to prepare . " we , at the organizing committee , do n't mind whether germany or brazil play the opening game , " beckenbauer told german sports television channel dsf .
" we would have liked germany to start with a highlight but the brazil solution would not be bad either , " he added . team manager oliver bierhoff seemed to be more definite in his view . " we will step aside for brazil , " he told the german news agency dpa .
" the reigning champions can open the world cup . " there has yet to be any official word on the decision . klinsmann exerting influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann is said to be getting his own way through strong words and deeds .
klinsmann , who was appointed in july , has also been stamping his identity on other areas of the world cup 2006 plan by informing the organizing committee that he was against the idea of having germany 's training camp in leverkusen , which he felt was not practical . the plan to have the camp in leverkusen was agreed when klinsmann 's predecessor rudi völler was still in charge and was seen as compensation after the city 's bid to stage games of the 2006 finals was turned down because its stadium was too small .

so why does it have such a bad reputation ? “ so if your body were berlin , which part would you get rid of , ” performance artists from the gob squad theater group asked the crowd on the recent opening night of the volkspalas t festival in berlin ’ s palace of the republic , which is welcoming the public until it closes for the last time in november . the gob squad ’ s badgering of visitors highlighted the building ’ s sorry plight .
an in-your-face example of everything that was wrong with east german urban planning , it 's fatally out of fashion - and it has to go . at least , according to the bundestag . resisting the inevitable ? but it ’ s not going quietly .
plenty of people would like it to remain , at least until berlin is better able to foot the bill for its demolition . given the city ’ s € 50 billion -lrb- $ 61.2 billion -rrb- debt , it seems like a sensible solution . “ right now , the idea of rebuilding the palace is completely inappropriate , ” said dagmar richter , a german-american architecture professor and critic . ron bloch , a spokesman for volkspalast festival , agreed . “ in these times of hartz iv -lrb- controversial social welfare reforms , -rrb- the government has more urgent things to worry about than tearing down an intact building at a cost of up to € 60 million , ” he observed wryly . so why exactly did the bundestag vote to tear down the palace of the republic and erect a copy of a baroque hohenzollern palace in its place ? ideological baggage crucially , the building is not just aesthetically out of fashion , it ’ s politically passé , too . in few other cities does urban planning carry the same sort of baggage it does in berlin .
what with the german capital ’ s unusually turbulent past , architecture has a political dimension which ensures it ’ s regularly propelled into mainstream debate . “ given the many turning points in german history - 1918 , 1933 , 1945 and 1989 - architecture in germany has , without a doubt , been considerably more politicized than in other countries , ” said hartmut frank , an architect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with simone hain , formerly of east germany ’ s prestigious bauakademie , frank has curated an exhibition with the title two german architectures which opens in leipzig this week .
organized by germany 's institute for foreign relations , or ifa , it illustrates that ultimately , east and west german architecture had more in common than might have been expected . as andreas ruby wrote in the german weekly die zeit , many buildings that typify east german architecture would be considered “ characteristic and quality examples of european architecture of the post-war decades if they ’ d been built , say , in cologne . ”
the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .
since 1989 , urban planners have been acutely aware that banishing the city ’ s communist legacy is a matter of both psychological and physical transformation . the process began in the early 1990s when statues of communist heroes were unceremoniously removed and many of east berlin ’ s streets rechristened .
monuments to lenin were dismantled , marx-engels-platz became hackescher markt - and the oppressive era of socialist dictatorship became an increasingly distant memory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ architecture here is much more about politics than aesthetics , ” she said , explaining the drab , minimalist look of many 1950s east german buildings .
“ that always meant architecture had less of an opportunity to be expressive than in a highly consumerist society like the us . ” richter also pointed out that germany was and still is scarred by the overtly monumental vision of nazi architect albert speer and has shyed away from bombastic building ever since . “ what we have instead is architecture that has more of a political role in the urban fabric , ” she said , adding that it ’ s a sign of the times that the architects currently involved in redesigning the city - such as helmut jahn and hans kollhoff , the man behind the plans for the new alexanderplatz in central berlin - are famously conservative , “ corporate ” architects . retro classics worth preserving but as berliners witness the bricks and mortar traces of the soviet era slowly disappear , many have reclaimed aspects of east german architecture and design as retro classics eminently worth preserving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen years after the fall of the wall , it ’ s more than okay to have a sentimental attachment to east germany - it ’ s positively fashionable .
the party crowd is flocking to the capital ’ s hip havens of sputnik chic , with 1960s-built venues such as cafe moskau and kino kosmos enjoying unprecedented popularity . not even its new-found fans would describe it as beautiful - but if it gets a stay of execution , perhaps the day will come when even the palace of the republic is considered fashionable . two german architectures runs from sept .

so why does it have such a bad reputation ? “ so if your body were berlin , which part would you get rid of , ” performance artists from the gob squad theater group asked the crowd on the recent opening night of the volkspalas t festival in berlin ’ s palace of the republic , which is welcoming the public until it closes for the last time in november . the gob squad ’ s badgering of visitors highlighted the building ’ s sorry plight .
an in-your-face example of everything that was wrong with east german urban planning , it 's fatally out of fashion - and it has to go . at least , according to the bundestag . resisting the inevitable ? but it ’ s not going quietly .
plenty of people would like it to remain , at least until berlin is better able to foot the bill for its demolition . given the city ’ s € 50 billion -lrb- $ 61.2 billion -rrb- debt , it seems like a sensible solution . “ right now , the idea of rebuilding the palace is completely inappropriate , ” said dagmar richter , a german-american architecture professor and critic . ron bloch , a spokesman for volkspalast festival , agreed . “ in these times of hartz iv -lrb- controversial social welfare reforms , -rrb- the government has more urgent things to worry about than tearing down an intact building at a cost of up to € 60 million , ” he observed wryly . so why exactly did the bundestag vote to tear down the palace of the republic and erect a copy of a baroque hohenzollern palace in its place ? ideological baggage crucially , the building is not just aesthetically out of fashion , it ’ s politically passé , too . in few other cities does urban planning carry the same sort of baggage it does in berlin .
what with the german capital ’ s unusually turbulent past , architecture has a political dimension which ensures it ’ s regularly propelled into mainstream debate . “ given the many turning points in german history - 1918 , 1933 , 1945 and 1989 - architecture in germany has , without a doubt , been considerably more politicized than in other countries , ” said hartmut frank , an architect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with simone hain , formerly of east germany ’ s prestigious bauakademie , frank has curated an exhibition with the title two german architectures which opens in leipzig this week .
organized by germany 's institute for foreign relations , or ifa , it illustrates that ultimately , east and west german architecture had more in common than might have been expected . as andreas ruby wrote in the german weekly die zeit , many buildings that typify east german architecture would be considered “ characteristic and quality examples of european architecture of the post-war decades if they ’ d been built , say , in cologne . ”
the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .
since 1989 , urban planners have been acutely aware that banishing the city ’ s communist legacy is a matter of both psychological and physical transformation . the process began in the early 1990s when statues of communist heroes were unceremoniously removed and many of east berlin ’ s streets rechristened .

so why does it have such a bad reputation ? “ so if your body were berlin , which part would you get rid of , ” performance artists from the gob squad theater group asked the crowd on the recent opening night of the volkspalas t festival in berlin ’ s palace of the republic , which is welcoming the public until it closes for the last time in november . the gob squad ’ s badgering of visitors highlighted the building ’ s sorry plight .
an in-your-face example of everything that was wrong with east german urban planning , it 's fatally out of fashion - and it has to go . at least , according to the bundestag . resisting the inevitable ? but it ’ s not going quietly .
plenty of people would like it to remain , at least until berlin is better able to foot the bill for its demolition . given the city ’ s € 50 billion -lrb- $ 61.2 billion -rrb- debt , it seems like a sensible solution . “ right now , the idea of rebuilding the palace is completely inappropriate , ” said dagmar richter , a german-american architecture professor and critic . ron bloch , a spokesman for volkspalast festival , agreed . “ in these times of hartz iv -lrb- controversial social welfare reforms , -rrb- the government has more urgent things to worry about than tearing down an intact building at a cost of up to € 60 million , ” he observed wryly . so why exactly did the bundestag vote to tear down the palace of the republic and erect a copy of a baroque hohenzollern palace in its place ? ideological baggage crucially , the building is not just aesthetically out of fashion , it ’ s politically passé , too . in few other cities does urban planning carry the same sort of baggage it does in berlin .
what with the german capital ’ s unusually turbulent past , architecture has a political dimension which ensures it ’ s regularly propelled into mainstream debate . “ given the many turning points in german history - 1918 , 1933 , 1945 and 1989 - architecture in germany has , without a doubt , been considerably more politicized than in other countries , ” said hartmut frank , an architect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with simone hain , formerly of east germany ’ s prestigious bauakademie , frank has curated an exhibition with the title two german architectures which opens in leipzig this week .
organized by germany 's institute for foreign relations , or ifa , it illustrates that ultimately , east and west german architecture had more in common than might have been expected . as andreas ruby wrote in the german weekly die zeit , many buildings that typify east german architecture would be considered “ characteristic and quality examples of european architecture of the post-war decades if they ’ d been built , say , in cologne . ”
the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .
since 1989 , urban planners have been acutely aware that banishing the city ’ s communist legacy is a matter of both psychological and physical transformation . the process began in the early 1990s when statues of communist heroes were unceremoniously removed and many of east berlin ’ s streets rechristened .
monuments to lenin were dismantled , marx-engels-platz became hackescher markt - and the oppressive era of socialist dictatorship became an increasingly distant memory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ architecture here is much more about politics than aesthetics , ” she said , explaining the drab , minimalist look of many 1950s east german buildings .
“ that always meant architecture had less of an opportunity to be expressive than in a highly consumerist society like the us . ” richter also pointed out that germany was and still is scarred by the overtly monumental vision of nazi architect albert speer and has shyed away from bombastic building ever since . “ what we have instead is architecture that has more of a political role in the urban fabric , ” she said , adding that it ’ s a sign of the times that the architects currently involved in redesigning the city - such as helmut jahn and hans kollhoff , the man behind the plans for the new alexanderplatz in central berlin - are famously conservative , “ corporate ” architects . retro classics worth preserving but as berliners witness the bricks and mortar traces of the soviet era slowly disappear , many have reclaimed aspects of east german architecture and design as retro classics eminently worth preserving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen years after the fall of the wall , it ’ s more than okay to have a sentimental attachment to east germany - it ’ s positively fashionable .
the party crowd is flocking to the capital ’ s hip havens of sputnik chic , with 1960s-built venues such as cafe moskau and kino kosmos enjoying unprecedented popularity . not even its new-found fans would describe it as beautiful - but if it gets a stay of execution , perhaps the day will come when even the palace of the republic is considered fashionable . two german architectures runs from sept .

the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .
since 1989 , urban planners have been acutely aware that banishing the city ’ s communist legacy is a matter of both psychological and physical transformation . the process began in the early 1990s when statues of communist heroes were unceremoniously removed and many of east berlin ’ s streets rechristened .
monuments to lenin were dismantled , marx-engels-platz became hackescher markt - and the oppressive era of socialist dictatorship became an increasingly distant memory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ architecture here is much more about politics than aesthetics , ” she said , explaining the drab , minimalist look of many 1950s east german buildings .
“ that always meant architecture had less of an opportunity to be expressive than in a highly consumerist society like the us . ” richter also pointed out that germany was and still is scarred by the overtly monumental vision of nazi architect albert speer and has shyed away from bombastic building ever since . “ what we have instead is architecture that has more of a political role in the urban fabric , ” she said , adding that it ’ s a sign of the times that the architects currently involved in redesigning the city - such as helmut jahn and hans kollhoff , the man behind the plans for the new alexanderplatz in central berlin - are famously conservative , “ corporate ” architects . retro classics worth preserving but as berliners witness the bricks and mortar traces of the soviet era slowly disappear , many have reclaimed aspects of east german architecture and design as retro classics eminently worth preserving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen years after the fall of the wall , it ’ s more than okay to have a sentimental attachment to east germany - it ’ s positively fashionable .
the party crowd is flocking to the capital ’ s hip havens of sputnik chic , with 1960s-built venues such as cafe moskau and kino kosmos enjoying unprecedented popularity . not even its new-found fans would describe it as beautiful - but if it gets a stay of execution , perhaps the day will come when even the palace of the republic is considered fashionable . two german architectures runs from sept .

an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees . the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- annual report “ education at a glance , ” published tuesday , has dealt another blow to an already stricken german education policy . the study , which compares education systems in the 30 oecd member countries , indicated that germany has a lot of work to do if it wants to produce graduates with qualifications comparable to other developed countries .
without significant educational reforms , germany could forfeit its economical competitiveness , the report warned . while oecd states increased their investments in primary and secondary schools by 21 percent and in universities by 30 percent from 1995 through 2001 , germany had only spent 6 and 7 percent more respectively , the study said .
in oecd countries , the number of college and university students increased by an average of 40 percent . but germany , austria and france experienced no growth at all . " the qualification level in the oecd states has risen dramatically since 1995 , while in germany nothing has happened , " german education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said .
the social democrat appealed to the opposition christian democratic union-run states to cooperate with the federal government to eliminate subsidies for homeowners and instead invest the money in education and research .
the lion 's share of german education funding and policy is determined at the state level . below average the study said germany spent less money than the average on each student and more on teachers ' salaries .
seven- and eight-year-old german pupils receive 160 fewer hours of lessons than the oecd average .
the discrepancy decreases in secondary schools , though 15-year-olds still get 66 hours of instruction less than the oecd midpoint .
kindergarten and primary school classes are also larger than the oecd average , which means that the children inevitably receive less individual attention aat one of the most crucial points in their education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher of the oecd “ what we have observed over time is that some countries have very dynamically expanded and extended their educational services , and in germany that kind of dynamic has been much less pronounced , " andreas schleicher , one of the study 's authors told dw-radio .
" over time , the divergence between the countries that move very fast and those that do not change is becoming bigger , ” he said . no longer the country of poets and philosophers three years ago , the oecd 's pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading , math and science when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
the assessment came as a shock to germans , who see their land as the “ country of poets and philosophers . ” education minister buhlman -lrb- photo , below -rrb- subsequently initiated a program to increase the number of all-day schools in germany , which the current report praised .
around 3,000 schools now provide full-day instruction .
but the majority of schools in germany continue to operate on a half-day basis , with lessons ending around lunchtime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn although he lauded the program , schleicher , who also coordinates the pisa study , said that all-day schools are already the norm in other oecd countries .
he focused criticism on germany 's track system , which separates students into different classes and schools depending on their achievements , thus determining whether they will gain the necessary qualifications to pursue further training or go to university after secondary school . in other countries " differences between people , between talents are not seen so much as a problem that must be resolved through school structures .
instead they deal with it constructively , " schleicher said . intensive discussion doris ahnen , the head of the education ministers ' conference , which is made up of the 16 state education ministers and senators , rebuffed the oecd criticism .
" in hardly another country has education been discussed so intensively since pisa , " bavarian public broadcaster bayerische rundfunk quoted ahnen as saying . bildunterschrift : baden-wurttemberg 's education minister , annette schavan , also dismissed the study .
" in germany there 's no lack of visions or of concrete reforms , " she said .
she accused the oecd of ignoring fundamental improvements to the education system . the gew teachers ' union demanded that the state education ministers take action to stop germany 's education system from deteriorating .

but when it comes to a car 's performance , they would rather take a drive than get their hands dirty fixing the motor . when germany 's automobile club for women was founded back in may 1926 with seven members , cars were still something of a rarity on german streets .
the site of a woman behind the wheel was virtually unheard of - let alone the notion of a lady actually taking an avid interest in the motorized vehicles .
but the founding mothers of ddac were not discouraged .
just two years after establishing the club , the motoring women organized their first long-distance race from berlin to oberhof , in southern germany .
the competition lasted two days and covered a stretch of 750 kilometers -lrb- 466 miles -rrb- .
today , that hardly seems much of a challenge , but more than 70 years ago , just arriving at the finish line was a real accomplishment .
more often than not , a car ended up in a ditch alongside the potholed roads .
back then the women had to rely a lot more on sheer strength and driving dexterity : there was no power steering , no four-wheel drive , no suspension system to assist the early women drivers .
since then , cars have developed by leaps and bounds in terms of technology and safety .
but the members of ddac have n't lost interest in the main focus of their club : driving for fun and leisure .
driving for fun " we drive normal cars , " christa reiners , head of the ddac branch in rheinland-ruhr in western germany , told dw-world .
" from the compact class to the large family car , everything has a place in our group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women drivers are no longer a rarity whereas their male counterparts frequently spend a good bit of time tuning up their motors and outfitting their cars with the latest in computer-assisted technology , the members of ddac rarely pick up a wrench .
instead , safety is their top priority .
" it is especially important that our vehicles are in excellent working condition , " reiners said , describing the ddac 's inclinations , which do n't differ that much from the interests and concerns of the average woman driver .
" complicated repairs are dealt with at the mechanic 's workshop . "
as a result , greasy hands and overalls are less common than extended car tours across the country .
christa reiners said the relationship between the club 's members and their automobiles is " rather playful , " but nonetheless demanding .
" in keeping with the tradition of our club , we are n't primarily interested in speeding , but rather in performing difficult orientation exercises or tests of skill , " she said .
taking women drivers seriously the way women think about cars is n't just visible on the road .
when faced with purchasing a new vehicle , many of their specific interests play a key role in decision-making .
however , a recent marketing study by the vocational college of niederrhein showed that woman often feel they are not taken seriously in the sales room .
" women are frequently insecure when they buy a car and they reveal that weakness to the salesperson , " said doris kortus-schultes .
the professor and author of the study examined the buying habits and interests of more than 1,200 women drivers , including car experts , senior citizens and immigrants .
according to the study , which the german women 's automobile club supported , female drivers do n't necessarily want to see more saleswomen in the showroom , but they do want to see more emphasis placed on honesty , respect , trustworthiness and understanding when it comes to selling a car .
even after the purchase , the women interviewed said they would like to have easy-to-read instruction manuals and a personal explanation and demonstration of a car 's features .

but when it comes to a car 's performance , they would rather take a drive than get their hands dirty fixing the motor . when germany 's automobile club for women was founded back in may 1926 with seven members , cars were still something of a rarity on german streets .
the site of a woman behind the wheel was virtually unheard of - let alone the notion of a lady actually taking an avid interest in the motorized vehicles .
but the founding mothers of ddac were not discouraged .
just two years after establishing the club , the motoring women organized their first long-distance race from berlin to oberhof , in southern germany .
the competition lasted two days and covered a stretch of 750 kilometers -lrb- 466 miles -rrb- .
today , that hardly seems much of a challenge , but more than 70 years ago , just arriving at the finish line was a real accomplishment .
more often than not , a car ended up in a ditch alongside the potholed roads .
back then the women had to rely a lot more on sheer strength and driving dexterity : there was no power steering , no four-wheel drive , no suspension system to assist the early women drivers .
since then , cars have developed by leaps and bounds in terms of technology and safety .
but the members of ddac have n't lost interest in the main focus of their club : driving for fun and leisure .
driving for fun " we drive normal cars , " christa reiners , head of the ddac branch in rheinland-ruhr in western germany , told dw-world .
" from the compact class to the large family car , everything has a place in our group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women drivers are no longer a rarity whereas their male counterparts frequently spend a good bit of time tuning up their motors and outfitting their cars with the latest in computer-assisted technology , the members of ddac rarely pick up a wrench .
instead , safety is their top priority .
" it is especially important that our vehicles are in excellent working condition , " reiners said , describing the ddac 's inclinations , which do n't differ that much from the interests and concerns of the average woman driver .
" complicated repairs are dealt with at the mechanic 's workshop . "
as a result , greasy hands and overalls are less common than extended car tours across the country .
christa reiners said the relationship between the club 's members and their automobiles is " rather playful , " but nonetheless demanding .
" in keeping with the tradition of our club , we are n't primarily interested in speeding , but rather in performing difficult orientation exercises or tests of skill , " she said .
taking women drivers seriously the way women think about cars is n't just visible on the road .
when faced with purchasing a new vehicle , many of their specific interests play a key role in decision-making .
however , a recent marketing study by the vocational college of niederrhein showed that woman often feel they are not taken seriously in the sales room .
" women are frequently insecure when they buy a car and they reveal that weakness to the salesperson , " said doris kortus-schultes .
the professor and author of the study examined the buying habits and interests of more than 1,200 women drivers , including car experts , senior citizens and immigrants .
according to the study , which the german women 's automobile club supported , female drivers do n't necessarily want to see more saleswomen in the showroom , but they do want to see more emphasis placed on honesty , respect , trustworthiness and understanding when it comes to selling a car .
even after the purchase , the women interviewed said they would like to have easy-to-read instruction manuals and a personal explanation and demonstration of a car 's features .
perhaps if female drivers are taken more seriously both on and off the road , the number of women who take an interest in their cars beyond the simple transportation aspect will also grow . ingo uhlenbruch -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de why german women ca n't read maps … but can park the car only some of the clichés about german drivers are true according to a new study .

he also rejected comparisons between the israeli fence and the berlin wall . " those who draw comparisons with the berlin wall are wrong , because it does not shut people in and deprive them of their freedom , " schily told deutschlandfunk radio on monday .
" its purpose is to protect israel from terrorists . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily schily , who is currently in israel for an international conference on terrorism , said the security barrier was the result of decades of failed efforts to prevent palestinian suicide bombers from crossing the border and attacking israel .
" all the efforts undertaken over many years , even decades , have unfortunately failed to bear fruit , " he said .
" so it is understandable that israel should try to erect a protective barrier , which furthermore has shown it works , and i think that the criticism is far from the reality . "
in the radio interview , schily also insisted the security barrier should be referred to as a " fence " and not a " wall , " as it is often called in germany .
palestinians demand explanations on tuesday , palestinian authorities demanded a thorough explanation for schily 's statements .
cabinet minister sajeb erekat said the german minister 's statements were " very strange and unusual , " and not in keeping with the official german position on the barrier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a palestinian couple walks through the fence israel built to separate israel and the palestinian territories , near the city of qalqilya .
only recently german foreign minister joschka fischer had criticized the barrier as " barely understandable " from a security point of view .
but a spokesman for the german foreign ministry on tuesday insisted there was no contradiction between the two ministers ' remarks .
he said that while the german government recognizes that every state has the right to defend its borders , it is still concerned over the route of the barrier , which at times cuts deep into palestinian territory .
palestinians say that the erection of concrete blocks , barbed wire , watchtowers and trenches juts into their land and is an attempt by israel to reduce the size of a future palestinian state .
the international court of justice ruled in july that the parts of the barrier built within the west bank are illegal and should be torn down .
israel is due to present a revised route of the barrier this week after the israeli supreme court ruled in a test case that the fundamental rights of tens of thousands of palestinians living near jerusalem had been violated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german carmakers face a bumpy ride 30,000 jobs on line at volkswagen volkswagen heading for bumpy 2004 ride peter hartz : the father of germany 's labor reforms daimlerchrysler reaches deal in labor dispute business -pipe- 14.09.2004 german auto industry at risk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german car made in hungary germany 's tradition as a center of car manufacturing could be in jeopardy as more businesses look to move east in response to rising wages and inflexible labor markets .
" made in germany " may soon be outdated . it 's an open secret that german carmakers are frustrated with high wages , employee benefits and inflexible working conditions , and that many are considering a move as a way out of the dilemma .
many in the sector have already set up manufacturing facilities abroad where wages and production costs are considerably lower than back home .
nearly every third german car supplier is already producing in eastern europe , and every sixth one has already set up sites in china .
but that 's only the beginning : every second automobile parts manufacturer is planning to move its production facilities outside of germany , according to a study published by the business consultancy firm ernst & young on monday .
looking to the east and far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturing in china - cheap and efficient .
the stuttgart-based business consultancy surveyed 200 german car suppliers with an annual turnover of between € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.12 million -rrb- and € 500 million .
nearly every second company had already established at least one production site abroad , and almost 40 percent of those questioned said they had concrete plans for shifting parts of their production to eastern europe .
some 23 percent , or close to one-fourth of all suppliers , said they planned to invest in china .
peter fuss , one of the authors of the ernst & young study said that various factors played a role in a company 's decision to move production outside germany .
whereas eastern europe attracts car companies primarily because of the low wages , he said china is particularly interesting because of its proximity to the growing asian market .
" logistical costs can be kept low because companies produce for the local market and parts do n't have to be shipped from western europe to china , " he said .
expanding exodus in a worldwide comparison of production sites , china and the czech republic topped the list , followed by hungary and poland .
both regions , china and eastern europe received top marks for car suppliers for low wage costs -lrb- 15 to 20 percent less than the hourly wage in germany -rrb- and in terms of flexibility and motivation of employees .
tax breaks and benefits for investing in industrially weak regions - aspects frequently criticized as unfair advantages by western european politicians - hardly played a role at all in the decision to move production outside of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes slk production in bremen according to ernst & young , fewer and fewer new manufacturing sites will be opened in western europe in the future .
while more factories close in germany and its neighboring western countries , the move east will not be limited to just the production of parts .
" over time things will develop , " fuss said .
" the companies interviewed in the survey clearly indicated that they are planning to move final assembly stages to eastern europe and china in the near future . "
that would mean that more complicated manufacturing processes - up to now largely based in germany would be affected by the outsourcing .
is germany 's auto industry at risk ?
the ernst & young study concluded that germany 's long tradition as a center of auto manufacturing is indeed in danger as more and more companies pack up and leave in search of better conditions abroad .

however , in order to capitalize on these strengths in the future , it will be crucial to identify innovative companies in these fields and promote them internationally , fuss said .
the threat of moving east is not necessarily connected to the loss of jobs , the study reported , with a view to the country 's rising unemployment rate .
" within the last few years there has been a considerable increase in the number of companies moving production to eastern europe and china , " fuss said .

many in the sector have already set up manufacturing facilities abroad where wages and production costs are considerably lower than back home .
nearly every third german car supplier is already producing in eastern europe , and every sixth one has already set up sites in china .
but that 's only the beginning : every second automobile parts manufacturer is planning to move its production facilities outside of germany , according to a study published by the business consultancy firm ernst & young on monday .
looking to the east and far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturing in china - cheap and efficient .
the stuttgart-based business consultancy surveyed 200 german car suppliers with an annual turnover of between € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.12 million -rrb- and € 500 million .
nearly every second company had already established at least one production site abroad , and almost 40 percent of those questioned said they had concrete plans for shifting parts of their production to eastern europe .
some 23 percent , or close to one-fourth of all suppliers , said they planned to invest in china .
peter fuss , one of the authors of the ernst & young study said that various factors played a role in a company 's decision to move production outside germany .
whereas eastern europe attracts car companies primarily because of the low wages , he said china is particularly interesting because of its proximity to the growing asian market .
" logistical costs can be kept low because companies produce for the local market and parts do n't have to be shipped from western europe to china , " he said .
expanding exodus in a worldwide comparison of production sites , china and the czech republic topped the list , followed by hungary and poland .
both regions , china and eastern europe received top marks for car suppliers for low wage costs -lrb- 15 to 20 percent less than the hourly wage in germany -rrb- and in terms of flexibility and motivation of employees .
tax breaks and benefits for investing in industrially weak regions - aspects frequently criticized as unfair advantages by western european politicians - hardly played a role at all in the decision to move production outside of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes slk production in bremen according to ernst & young , fewer and fewer new manufacturing sites will be opened in western europe in the future .
while more factories close in germany and its neighboring western countries , the move east will not be limited to just the production of parts .
" over time things will develop , " fuss said .
" the companies interviewed in the survey clearly indicated that they are planning to move final assembly stages to eastern europe and china in the near future . "
that would mean that more complicated manufacturing processes - up to now largely based in germany would be affected by the outsourcing .

many in the sector have already set up manufacturing facilities abroad where wages and production costs are considerably lower than back home .
nearly every third german car supplier is already producing in eastern europe , and every sixth one has already set up sites in china .
but that 's only the beginning : every second automobile parts manufacturer is planning to move its production facilities outside of germany , according to a study published by the business consultancy firm ernst & young on monday .
looking to the east and far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturing in china - cheap and efficient .
the stuttgart-based business consultancy surveyed 200 german car suppliers with an annual turnover of between € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.12 million -rrb- and € 500 million .
nearly every second company had already established at least one production site abroad , and almost 40 percent of those questioned said they had concrete plans for shifting parts of their production to eastern europe .
some 23 percent , or close to one-fourth of all suppliers , said they planned to invest in china .
peter fuss , one of the authors of the ernst & young study said that various factors played a role in a company 's decision to move production outside germany .
whereas eastern europe attracts car companies primarily because of the low wages , he said china is particularly interesting because of its proximity to the growing asian market .
" logistical costs can be kept low because companies produce for the local market and parts do n't have to be shipped from western europe to china , " he said .

both regions , china and eastern europe received top marks for car suppliers for low wage costs -lrb- 15 to 20 percent less than the hourly wage in germany -rrb- and in terms of flexibility and motivation of employees .
tax breaks and benefits for investing in industrially weak regions - aspects frequently criticized as unfair advantages by western european politicians - hardly played a role at all in the decision to move production outside of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes slk production in bremen according to ernst & young , fewer and fewer new manufacturing sites will be opened in western europe in the future .
while more factories close in germany and its neighboring western countries , the move east will not be limited to just the production of parts .
" over time things will develop , " fuss said .
" the companies interviewed in the survey clearly indicated that they are planning to move final assembly stages to eastern europe and china in the near future . "
that would mean that more complicated manufacturing processes - up to now largely based in germany would be affected by the outsourcing .

the attack led to the loss of civilians in an area where many turks live .
" i myself spoke to the american secretary of state -lrb- colin powell , -rrb- " foreign minister abdullah gul said , according to anatolia news agency reports .

so why does it have such a bad reputation ? “ so if your body were berlin , which part would you get rid of , ” performance artists from the gob squad theater group asked the crowd on the recent opening night of the volkspalas t festival in berlin ’ s palace of the republic , which is welcoming the public until it closes for the last time in november . the gob squad ’ s badgering of visitors highlighted the building ’ s sorry plight .
an in-your-face example of everything that was wrong with east german urban planning , it 's fatally out of fashion - and it has to go . at least , according to the bundestag . resisting the inevitable ? but it ’ s not going quietly .
plenty of people would like it to remain , at least until berlin is better able to foot the bill for its demolition . given the city ’ s € 50 billion -lrb- $ 61.2 billion -rrb- debt , it seems like a sensible solution . “ right now , the idea of rebuilding the palace is completely inappropriate , ” said dagmar richter , a german-american architecture professor and critic . ron bloch , a spokesman for volkspalast festival , agreed . “ in these times of hartz iv -lrb- controversial social welfare reforms , -rrb- the government has more urgent things to worry about than tearing down an intact building at a cost of up to € 60 million , ” he observed wryly . so why exactly did the bundestag vote to tear down the palace of the republic and erect a copy of a baroque hohenzollern palace in its place ? ideological baggage crucially , the building is not just aesthetically out of fashion , it ’ s politically passé , too . in few other cities does urban planning carry the same sort of baggage it does in berlin .
what with the german capital ’ s unusually turbulent past , architecture has a political dimension which ensures it ’ s regularly propelled into mainstream debate . “ given the many turning points in german history - 1918 , 1933 , 1945 and 1989 - architecture in germany has , without a doubt , been considerably more politicized than in other countries , ” said hartmut frank , an architect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with simone hain , formerly of east germany ’ s prestigious bauakademie , frank has curated an exhibition with the title two german architectures which opens in leipzig this week .
organized by germany 's institute for foreign relations , or ifa , it illustrates that ultimately , east and west german architecture had more in common than might have been expected . as andreas ruby wrote in the german weekly die zeit , many buildings that typify east german architecture would be considered “ characteristic and quality examples of european architecture of the post-war decades if they ’ d been built , say , in cologne . ”
the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .
since 1989 , urban planners have been acutely aware that banishing the city ’ s communist legacy is a matter of both psychological and physical transformation . the process began in the early 1990s when statues of communist heroes were unceremoniously removed and many of east berlin ’ s streets rechristened .
monuments to lenin were dismantled , marx-engels-platz became hackescher markt - and the oppressive era of socialist dictatorship became an increasingly distant memory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ architecture here is much more about politics than aesthetics , ” she said , explaining the drab , minimalist look of many 1950s east german buildings .
“ that always meant architecture had less of an opportunity to be expressive than in a highly consumerist society like the us . ” richter also pointed out that germany was and still is scarred by the overtly monumental vision of nazi architect albert speer and has shyed away from bombastic building ever since . “ what we have instead is architecture that has more of a political role in the urban fabric , ” she said , adding that it ’ s a sign of the times that the architects currently involved in redesigning the city - such as helmut jahn and hans kollhoff , the man behind the plans for the new alexanderplatz in central berlin - are famously conservative , “ corporate ” architects . retro classics worth preserving but as berliners witness the bricks and mortar traces of the soviet era slowly disappear , many have reclaimed aspects of east german architecture and design as retro classics eminently worth preserving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen years after the fall of the wall , it ’ s more than okay to have a sentimental attachment to east germany - it ’ s positively fashionable .
the party crowd is flocking to the capital ’ s hip havens of sputnik chic , with 1960s-built venues such as cafe moskau and kino kosmos enjoying unprecedented popularity . not even its new-found fans would describe it as beautiful - but if it gets a stay of execution , perhaps the day will come when even the palace of the republic is considered fashionable . two german architectures runs from sept .

1 and will reduce long-term unemployment benefits to the level of social welfare payments . losing momentum ? the figures were down on the 75,000 people who took part a week ago , and it is unclear whether momentum can be maintained for a nationwide protest on oct .
2 ; on the eve of the anniversary of german reunification in 1990 . the labor market changes will hit the former communist east hardest .
unemployment there is twice that in the west and young people have been abandoning the region in droves in search of a better future . ahead of the elections in brandenburg and saxony , voters have shown increasing signs they are disenchanted with chancellor gerhard schröder 's failure to find them jobs and revitalize the euro zone 's biggest economy . opinion polls suggest they will turn to parties on both extremes of the political spectrum , heaping more pressure on schröder in the wake of several recent bad election results . divisions also appear to be surfacing between eastern and western regions , with some in the more affluent parts of the country showing open resentment to the billions in " solidarity " payments that have been made to the east since the early 1990s . presidential participation german president horst köhler , a former head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , became mired in that debate after his comments in the weekly focus magazine were perceived as encouraging an abandoning of the eastern states . " there were and there are big differences in living standards everywhere in germany .
it 's the same from north to south as it is from east to west , " köhler told the news magazine in its monday edition . " if you want to level them out , you cement in place a subsidized state and place an intolerable burden of debt on the younger generation .
we must get away from a subsidised state , " he said . his remarks won a broadside from agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast , who said : " it 's not a president 's job to say : ' take care of your problems on your own . " ' the reaction to a prominent political figure addressing the virtual taboo of social inequality was also indicative of how much progress has been made just two months before the 15th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall . " it 's the first time that a senior german politician has called into question the central doctrine of unified germany , " said the daily berliner zeitung . " equalizing living standards is one of the founding myths of the united germany , " its editorial read under the headline " köhler was right .

so why does it have such a bad reputation ? “ so if your body were berlin , which part would you get rid of , ” performance artists from the gob squad theater group asked the crowd on the recent opening night of the volkspalas t festival in berlin ’ s palace of the republic , which is welcoming the public until it closes for the last time in november . the gob squad ’ s badgering of visitors highlighted the building ’ s sorry plight .
an in-your-face example of everything that was wrong with east german urban planning , it 's fatally out of fashion - and it has to go . at least , according to the bundestag . resisting the inevitable ? but it ’ s not going quietly .
plenty of people would like it to remain , at least until berlin is better able to foot the bill for its demolition . given the city ’ s € 50 billion -lrb- $ 61.2 billion -rrb- debt , it seems like a sensible solution . “ right now , the idea of rebuilding the palace is completely inappropriate , ” said dagmar richter , a german-american architecture professor and critic . ron bloch , a spokesman for volkspalast festival , agreed . “ in these times of hartz iv -lrb- controversial social welfare reforms , -rrb- the government has more urgent things to worry about than tearing down an intact building at a cost of up to € 60 million , ” he observed wryly . so why exactly did the bundestag vote to tear down the palace of the republic and erect a copy of a baroque hohenzollern palace in its place ? ideological baggage crucially , the building is not just aesthetically out of fashion , it ’ s politically passé , too . in few other cities does urban planning carry the same sort of baggage it does in berlin .
what with the german capital ’ s unusually turbulent past , architecture has a political dimension which ensures it ’ s regularly propelled into mainstream debate . “ given the many turning points in german history - 1918 , 1933 , 1945 and 1989 - architecture in germany has , without a doubt , been considerably more politicized than in other countries , ” said hartmut frank , an architect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with simone hain , formerly of east germany ’ s prestigious bauakademie , frank has curated an exhibition with the title two german architectures which opens in leipzig this week .
organized by germany 's institute for foreign relations , or ifa , it illustrates that ultimately , east and west german architecture had more in common than might have been expected . as andreas ruby wrote in the german weekly die zeit , many buildings that typify east german architecture would be considered “ characteristic and quality examples of european architecture of the post-war decades if they ’ d been built , say , in cologne . ”
the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .
since 1989 , urban planners have been acutely aware that banishing the city ’ s communist legacy is a matter of both psychological and physical transformation . the process began in the early 1990s when statues of communist heroes were unceremoniously removed and many of east berlin ’ s streets rechristened .
monuments to lenin were dismantled , marx-engels-platz became hackescher markt - and the oppressive era of socialist dictatorship became an increasingly distant memory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ architecture here is much more about politics than aesthetics , ” she said , explaining the drab , minimalist look of many 1950s east german buildings .
“ that always meant architecture had less of an opportunity to be expressive than in a highly consumerist society like the us . ” richter also pointed out that germany was and still is scarred by the overtly monumental vision of nazi architect albert speer and has shyed away from bombastic building ever since . “ what we have instead is architecture that has more of a political role in the urban fabric , ” she said , adding that it ’ s a sign of the times that the architects currently involved in redesigning the city - such as helmut jahn and hans kollhoff , the man behind the plans for the new alexanderplatz in central berlin - are famously conservative , “ corporate ” architects . retro classics worth preserving but as berliners witness the bricks and mortar traces of the soviet era slowly disappear , many have reclaimed aspects of east german architecture and design as retro classics eminently worth preserving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen years after the fall of the wall , it ’ s more than okay to have a sentimental attachment to east germany - it ’ s positively fashionable .
the party crowd is flocking to the capital ’ s hip havens of sputnik chic , with 1960s-built venues such as cafe moskau and kino kosmos enjoying unprecedented popularity . not even its new-found fans would describe it as beautiful - but if it gets a stay of execution , perhaps the day will come when even the palace of the republic is considered fashionable . two german architectures runs from sept .

the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .
since 1989 , urban planners have been acutely aware that banishing the city ’ s communist legacy is a matter of both psychological and physical transformation . the process began in the early 1990s when statues of communist heroes were unceremoniously removed and many of east berlin ’ s streets rechristened .
monuments to lenin were dismantled , marx-engels-platz became hackescher markt - and the oppressive era of socialist dictatorship became an increasingly distant memory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ architecture here is much more about politics than aesthetics , ” she said , explaining the drab , minimalist look of many 1950s east german buildings .
“ that always meant architecture had less of an opportunity to be expressive than in a highly consumerist society like the us . ” richter also pointed out that germany was and still is scarred by the overtly monumental vision of nazi architect albert speer and has shyed away from bombastic building ever since . “ what we have instead is architecture that has more of a political role in the urban fabric , ” she said , adding that it ’ s a sign of the times that the architects currently involved in redesigning the city - such as helmut jahn and hans kollhoff , the man behind the plans for the new alexanderplatz in central berlin - are famously conservative , “ corporate ” architects . retro classics worth preserving but as berliners witness the bricks and mortar traces of the soviet era slowly disappear , many have reclaimed aspects of east german architecture and design as retro classics eminently worth preserving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen years after the fall of the wall , it ’ s more than okay to have a sentimental attachment to east germany - it ’ s positively fashionable .
the party crowd is flocking to the capital ’ s hip havens of sputnik chic , with 1960s-built venues such as cafe moskau and kino kosmos enjoying unprecedented popularity . not even its new-found fans would describe it as beautiful - but if it gets a stay of execution , perhaps the day will come when even the palace of the republic is considered fashionable . two german architectures runs from sept .

so why does it have such a bad reputation ? “ so if your body were berlin , which part would you get rid of , ” performance artists from the gob squad theater group asked the crowd on the recent opening night of the volkspalas t festival in berlin ’ s palace of the republic , which is welcoming the public until it closes for the last time in november . the gob squad ’ s badgering of visitors highlighted the building ’ s sorry plight .
an in-your-face example of everything that was wrong with east german urban planning , it 's fatally out of fashion - and it has to go . at least , according to the bundestag . resisting the inevitable ? but it ’ s not going quietly .
plenty of people would like it to remain , at least until berlin is better able to foot the bill for its demolition . given the city ’ s € 50 billion -lrb- $ 61.2 billion -rrb- debt , it seems like a sensible solution . “ right now , the idea of rebuilding the palace is completely inappropriate , ” said dagmar richter , a german-american architecture professor and critic . ron bloch , a spokesman for volkspalast festival , agreed . “ in these times of hartz iv -lrb- controversial social welfare reforms , -rrb- the government has more urgent things to worry about than tearing down an intact building at a cost of up to € 60 million , ” he observed wryly . so why exactly did the bundestag vote to tear down the palace of the republic and erect a copy of a baroque hohenzollern palace in its place ? ideological baggage crucially , the building is not just aesthetically out of fashion , it ’ s politically passé , too . in few other cities does urban planning carry the same sort of baggage it does in berlin .
what with the german capital ’ s unusually turbulent past , architecture has a political dimension which ensures it ’ s regularly propelled into mainstream debate . “ given the many turning points in german history - 1918 , 1933 , 1945 and 1989 - architecture in germany has , without a doubt , been considerably more politicized than in other countries , ” said hartmut frank , an architect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with simone hain , formerly of east germany ’ s prestigious bauakademie , frank has curated an exhibition with the title two german architectures which opens in leipzig this week .

the majority of eastern , northern and south-western states all fall behind the german average of € 25,800 in gdp per person . rich southern states better off than north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's entertainment district the city states of hamburg , with a gdp per person of € 44,500 , and bremen , with € 35,300 , are the exceptions in the northern region and are more in line with the large and affluent southern states of bavaria -lrb- € 29,900 -rrb- and baden-württemberg -lrb- € 29,400 -rrb- .
the rest of the north is as far behind the southern giants as the eastern states are behind the poorest western regions . the core of horst köhler 's comments over the weekend regarding differences in eastern and western states was seized upon by opposition parties , seemingly intent on exploiting a real or imagined divide for their own purposes ahead of state elections . but a closer look at the german president 's interview with news magazine focus published on sunday shows that köhler in fact pointed out that the living standards and employment possibilities varied all over germany , a view supported by the institute 's statistics . benefit claimants favor bremen while the figures confirm that average unemployment in the eastern states is almost ten percent higher than the worst affected western region - bremen with 16.3 percent , 14.3 percent registered - northern and western states have a higher number of people claiming social benefits , with berlin the exception in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visitor takes a numbered ticket as he waits in line in a german labor office the statistics again show that unemployment in the south of germany is a lot less than in northern states and that bavaria and baden-württemberg are well below the german average of 12.9 percent .
the two large southern states have the least amount of benefit claimants , with bavaria recording the lowest figure of 17 per 1,000 citizens compared to bremen 's 92 per 1,000 , the largest in the country . economists line up behind köhler reactions to köhler 's remarks continue to surface with many economic experts and commentators agreeing with their president . " köhler is perfectly right in what he says , " said klaus von dohnanyi , head of a special government-appointed commission on east germany .
" of course there will be regional differences .
you have them in other countries , " the former senior social democratic politician told the associated press .
" but that does not mean köhler is accepting the high levels of unemployment in eastern germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coal mining regions are struggling to adapt to the changing economy michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industry , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that he " fully and completely " agreed with köhler 's comments .
rogowski added that it is not possible to guarantee identical standards of living for all people and that it is only possible to create identical conditions from which standards of living can develop . politicians warn of negative effects however , senior politicians continue to view the president 's remarks with concern .
renate künast , the agriculture and consumer affairs minister , said : " it 's not a president 's job to say : ' take care of your problems on your own . " ' " the message that comes across to east germans is : be satisfied , there wo n't be any more equality , " reinhard bütikofer , the head of the greens party , told the berliner zeitung . greens lawmaker fritz kuhn accused köhler of unwittingly helping the ex-communist pds party , which has been prominent in championing the perceived east-west divide ahead of state elections , saying they draw strength " from a fundamental sense of many east germans that they are second-class .

but when it comes to a car 's performance , they would rather take a drive than get their hands dirty fixing the motor . when germany 's automobile club for women was founded back in may 1926 with seven members , cars were still something of a rarity on german streets .
the site of a woman behind the wheel was virtually unheard of - let alone the notion of a lady actually taking an avid interest in the motorized vehicles .
but the founding mothers of ddac were not discouraged .
just two years after establishing the club , the motoring women organized their first long-distance race from berlin to oberhof , in southern germany .
the competition lasted two days and covered a stretch of 750 kilometers -lrb- 466 miles -rrb- .
today , that hardly seems much of a challenge , but more than 70 years ago , just arriving at the finish line was a real accomplishment .
more often than not , a car ended up in a ditch alongside the potholed roads .
back then the women had to rely a lot more on sheer strength and driving dexterity : there was no power steering , no four-wheel drive , no suspension system to assist the early women drivers .
since then , cars have developed by leaps and bounds in terms of technology and safety .
but the members of ddac have n't lost interest in the main focus of their club : driving for fun and leisure .
driving for fun " we drive normal cars , " christa reiners , head of the ddac branch in rheinland-ruhr in western germany , told dw-world .
" from the compact class to the large family car , everything has a place in our group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women drivers are no longer a rarity whereas their male counterparts frequently spend a good bit of time tuning up their motors and outfitting their cars with the latest in computer-assisted technology , the members of ddac rarely pick up a wrench .
instead , safety is their top priority .
" it is especially important that our vehicles are in excellent working condition , " reiners said , describing the ddac 's inclinations , which do n't differ that much from the interests and concerns of the average woman driver .
" complicated repairs are dealt with at the mechanic 's workshop . "
as a result , greasy hands and overalls are less common than extended car tours across the country .
christa reiners said the relationship between the club 's members and their automobiles is " rather playful , " but nonetheless demanding .
" in keeping with the tradition of our club , we are n't primarily interested in speeding , but rather in performing difficult orientation exercises or tests of skill , " she said .
taking women drivers seriously the way women think about cars is n't just visible on the road .
when faced with purchasing a new vehicle , many of their specific interests play a key role in decision-making .
however , a recent marketing study by the vocational college of niederrhein showed that woman often feel they are not taken seriously in the sales room .
" women are frequently insecure when they buy a car and they reveal that weakness to the salesperson , " said doris kortus-schultes .
the professor and author of the study examined the buying habits and interests of more than 1,200 women drivers , including car experts , senior citizens and immigrants .
according to the study , which the german women 's automobile club supported , female drivers do n't necessarily want to see more saleswomen in the showroom , but they do want to see more emphasis placed on honesty , respect , trustworthiness and understanding when it comes to selling a car .
even after the purchase , the women interviewed said they would like to have easy-to-read instruction manuals and a personal explanation and demonstration of a car 's features .
perhaps if female drivers are taken more seriously both on and off the road , the number of women who take an interest in their cars beyond the simple transportation aspect will also grow . ingo uhlenbruch -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de why german women ca n't read maps … but can park the car only some of the clichés about german drivers are true according to a new study .

the site of a woman behind the wheel was virtually unheard of - let alone the notion of a lady actually taking an avid interest in the motorized vehicles .
but the founding mothers of ddac were not discouraged .
just two years after establishing the club , the motoring women organized their first long-distance race from berlin to oberhof , in southern germany .
the competition lasted two days and covered a stretch of 750 kilometers -lrb- 466 miles -rrb- .
today , that hardly seems much of a challenge , but more than 70 years ago , just arriving at the finish line was a real accomplishment .
more often than not , a car ended up in a ditch alongside the potholed roads .
back then the women had to rely a lot more on sheer strength and driving dexterity : there was no power steering , no four-wheel drive , no suspension system to assist the early women drivers .
since then , cars have developed by leaps and bounds in terms of technology and safety .
but the members of ddac have n't lost interest in the main focus of their club : driving for fun and leisure .
driving for fun " we drive normal cars , " christa reiners , head of the ddac branch in rheinland-ruhr in western germany , told dw-world .
" from the compact class to the large family car , everything has a place in our group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women drivers are no longer a rarity whereas their male counterparts frequently spend a good bit of time tuning up their motors and outfitting their cars with the latest in computer-assisted technology , the members of ddac rarely pick up a wrench .
instead , safety is their top priority .
" it is especially important that our vehicles are in excellent working condition , " reiners said , describing the ddac 's inclinations , which do n't differ that much from the interests and concerns of the average woman driver .
" complicated repairs are dealt with at the mechanic 's workshop . "
as a result , greasy hands and overalls are less common than extended car tours across the country .
christa reiners said the relationship between the club 's members and their automobiles is " rather playful , " but nonetheless demanding .
" in keeping with the tradition of our club , we are n't primarily interested in speeding , but rather in performing difficult orientation exercises or tests of skill , " she said .
taking women drivers seriously the way women think about cars is n't just visible on the road .
when faced with purchasing a new vehicle , many of their specific interests play a key role in decision-making .
however , a recent marketing study by the vocational college of niederrhein showed that woman often feel they are not taken seriously in the sales room .
" women are frequently insecure when they buy a car and they reveal that weakness to the salesperson , " said doris kortus-schultes .
the professor and author of the study examined the buying habits and interests of more than 1,200 women drivers , including car experts , senior citizens and immigrants .
according to the study , which the german women 's automobile club supported , female drivers do n't necessarily want to see more saleswomen in the showroom , but they do want to see more emphasis placed on honesty , respect , trustworthiness and understanding when it comes to selling a car .
even after the purchase , the women interviewed said they would like to have easy-to-read instruction manuals and a personal explanation and demonstration of a car 's features .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.09.2004 turkey backs down on adultery law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while erdogan -lrb- left -rrb- was away , his deputy , gül , cleared the air under huge pressure from the european union , turkey back-pedaled away from a bill to re-criminalize adultery on tuesday . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , who over the past few days repeatedly spoke out in favor of re-criminalizing adultery , was far away in tajikistan when his colleagues announced the u-turn .
parliament had already started debating the issue , as foreign minister abdullah gül pulled aside the opposition leader for a brief exchange . the upshot was that party consensus was too important to waste on such a trifle . " parliament achieved this .
i thank the opposition for that and our -lrb- justice and development -rrb- ak-party , " justice minister cemil cicek said after announcing the decision .
" this is the image that turkey has always wished for .
this consensus is perhaps even more important than the new penal code itself . "
consensus above all formally , parliament concluded that changes to the new penal code would only be made after a consensus had been reached .
in effect , it meant that the islamic-conservative governing party would give up on making adultery a crime , a move that was supposed to appeal to the party 's provincial supporters . on monday , tourism minister erkan mumcu was the first cabinet member to distance himself from the law - probably fearing empty hotel rooms next summer .
by tuesday morning , even " regular " parliamentarians were reluctant to support the plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish and the european union flags but neither better judgment nor domestic criticism from the press and women 's groups tipped the scales .
instead , the decisive factor was most likely the warnings emanating from western europe .
parliamentarians familiar with eu law have sheepishly said as much . " the timing may not have been the best , " said yasar yakis , who leads the turkish parliament 's eu commission .
" that 's what many people in europe told us . " more than timing the timing was n't the only problem .
belgian foreign minister karel de gucht warned ankara on sunday that such a law would be a " serious obstacle " to turkey 's bid to join the european union .
in early october , the european commission is set to offer its assessment on whether to start accession talks with turkey , and eu government leaders will decide whether or not to set a date to begin negotiations in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borrell of spain although the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- does not formally play a roll in the decision , ep president josep borrell -lrb- photo -rrb- announced on tuesday that the body would compile its own report on whether turkey should join the bloc .
" it would … be a mistake if we did n't speak out on this issue , " borrell said .
he stressed that it must be clear to everyone what a " no " to turkey would mean for eu relations to the islamic world . turkey 's new penal code - without the singular contentious paragraphs on adultery - is a further step towards the eu .
the country 's parliament aims to pass the legislation by the weekend .
it will increase penalties for torture , punish rape in marriage , limit the practice of testing young women for virginity and increase penalties for builders whose buildings ca n't withstand earthquakes . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de verheugen warns turkey on adultery law eu commissioner günther verheugen warned turkey that proposals to revamp the turkish penal code , which would include the return of punishment for adultery , should not divert the country from its path to eu membership .
-lrb- sept .
10 , 2004 -rrb- turkey changes laws to meet eu standards the turkish government agreed on 348 new paragraphs to brings it 80-year-old penal code , which punished sheep theft harder than assault , up to european standard .
extending women 's rights was especially controversial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : educating germany germans mull sweeping education reforms report lambastes german schools germany to introduce federal school standards germany moves to all-day schools germany -pipe- 14.09.2004 bad grades for german schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a lot of homework to do to improve its education system germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .
an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees . the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- annual report “ education at a glance , ” published tuesday , has dealt another blow to an already stricken german education policy . the study , which compares education systems in the 30 oecd member countries , indicated that germany has a lot of work to do if it wants to produce graduates with qualifications comparable to other developed countries .
without significant educational reforms , germany could forfeit its economical competitiveness , the report warned . while oecd states increased their investments in primary and secondary schools by 21 percent and in universities by 30 percent from 1995 through 2001 , germany had only spent 6 and 7 percent more respectively , the study said .
in oecd countries , the number of college and university students increased by an average of 40 percent . but germany , austria and france experienced no growth at all . " the qualification level in the oecd states has risen dramatically since 1995 , while in germany nothing has happened , " german education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said .
the social democrat appealed to the opposition christian democratic union-run states to cooperate with the federal government to eliminate subsidies for homeowners and instead invest the money in education and research .
the lion 's share of german education funding and policy is determined at the state level . below average the study said germany spent less money than the average on each student and more on teachers ' salaries .
seven- and eight-year-old german pupils receive 160 fewer hours of lessons than the oecd average .
the discrepancy decreases in secondary schools , though 15-year-olds still get 66 hours of instruction less than the oecd midpoint .
kindergarten and primary school classes are also larger than the oecd average , which means that the children inevitably receive less individual attention aat one of the most crucial points in their education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher of the oecd “ what we have observed over time is that some countries have very dynamically expanded and extended their educational services , and in germany that kind of dynamic has been much less pronounced , " andreas schleicher , one of the study 's authors told dw-radio .
" over time , the divergence between the countries that move very fast and those that do not change is becoming bigger , ” he said . no longer the country of poets and philosophers three years ago , the oecd 's pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading , math and science when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
the assessment came as a shock to germans , who see their land as the “ country of poets and philosophers . ” education minister buhlman -lrb- photo , below -rrb- subsequently initiated a program to increase the number of all-day schools in germany , which the current report praised .
around 3,000 schools now provide full-day instruction .
but the majority of schools in germany continue to operate on a half-day basis , with lessons ending around lunchtime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn although he lauded the program , schleicher , who also coordinates the pisa study , said that all-day schools are already the norm in other oecd countries .
he focused criticism on germany 's track system , which separates students into different classes and schools depending on their achievements , thus determining whether they will gain the necessary qualifications to pursue further training or go to university after secondary school . in other countries " differences between people , between talents are not seen so much as a problem that must be resolved through school structures .
instead they deal with it constructively , " schleicher said . intensive discussion doris ahnen , the head of the education ministers ' conference , which is made up of the 16 state education ministers and senators , rebuffed the oecd criticism .
" in hardly another country has education been discussed so intensively since pisa , " bavarian public broadcaster bayerische rundfunk quoted ahnen as saying . bildunterschrift : baden-wurttemberg 's education minister , annette schavan , also dismissed the study .
" in germany there 's no lack of visions or of concrete reforms , " she said .
she accused the oecd of ignoring fundamental improvements to the education system . the gew teachers ' union demanded that the state education ministers take action to stop germany 's education system from deteriorating .
" the federal sectionalism of the states promotes germany 's further relegation , " gew head eva-marie stange said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting brain gain for german universities leading german education experts have called for more autonomy for german universities to improve competitiveness on an international level .

without significant educational reforms , germany could forfeit its economical competitiveness , the report warned . while oecd states increased their investments in primary and secondary schools by 21 percent and in universities by 30 percent from 1995 through 2001 , germany had only spent 6 and 7 percent more respectively , the study said .

beer frenzy in munich the dark cloud over oktoberfest the revelry begins at oktoberfest 2002 current affairs -pipe- 14.09.2004 oktoberfest is good for you , sort of großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of revelers , in theory , will improve their health at oktoberfest ten million people are expected to attend the 171st oktoberfest in munich this month .
those few who actually drink in moderation may be do their heart a world of good , according to a recent german study . there 's more good news for the estimated 10 million beer drinkers who are preparing to converge on munich for two weeks of hop-inspired revelry starting on september 18 .

" made in germany " may soon be outdated . it 's an open secret that german carmakers are frustrated with high wages , employee benefits and inflexible working conditions , and that many are considering a move as a way out of the dilemma .
many in the sector have already set up manufacturing facilities abroad where wages and production costs are considerably lower than back home .
nearly every third german car supplier is already producing in eastern europe , and every sixth one has already set up sites in china .
but that 's only the beginning : every second automobile parts manufacturer is planning to move its production facilities outside of germany , according to a study published by the business consultancy firm ernst & young on monday .
looking to the east and far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturing in china - cheap and efficient .
the stuttgart-based business consultancy surveyed 200 german car suppliers with an annual turnover of between € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.12 million -rrb- and € 500 million .
nearly every second company had already established at least one production site abroad , and almost 40 percent of those questioned said they had concrete plans for shifting parts of their production to eastern europe .
some 23 percent , or close to one-fourth of all suppliers , said they planned to invest in china .
peter fuss , one of the authors of the ernst & young study said that various factors played a role in a company 's decision to move production outside germany .
whereas eastern europe attracts car companies primarily because of the low wages , he said china is particularly interesting because of its proximity to the growing asian market .
" logistical costs can be kept low because companies produce for the local market and parts do n't have to be shipped from western europe to china , " he said .
expanding exodus in a worldwide comparison of production sites , china and the czech republic topped the list , followed by hungary and poland .
both regions , china and eastern europe received top marks for car suppliers for low wage costs -lrb- 15 to 20 percent less than the hourly wage in germany -rrb- and in terms of flexibility and motivation of employees .
tax breaks and benefits for investing in industrially weak regions - aspects frequently criticized as unfair advantages by western european politicians - hardly played a role at all in the decision to move production outside of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes slk production in bremen according to ernst & young , fewer and fewer new manufacturing sites will be opened in western europe in the future .
while more factories close in germany and its neighboring western countries , the move east will not be limited to just the production of parts .
" over time things will develop , " fuss said .
" the companies interviewed in the survey clearly indicated that they are planning to move final assembly stages to eastern europe and china in the near future . "
that would mean that more complicated manufacturing processes - up to now largely based in germany would be affected by the outsourcing .
is germany 's auto industry at risk ?
the ernst & young study concluded that germany 's long tradition as a center of auto manufacturing is indeed in danger as more and more companies pack up and leave in search of better conditions abroad .
at the same time , the move abroad represents " the last chance the companies have to reduce costs and remain competitive in the international market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20 million vw golfs have rolled off the assembly line at the carmaker 's headquarters in wolfsburg but the study also said that although manufacturing will move , germany will continue to hold on to its claim as a nation of carmakers in the fields of branding - the label " made in germany " will still hold sway over car buyers - and in the critical area of research and development .
however , in order to capitalize on these strengths in the future , it will be crucial to identify innovative companies in these fields and promote them internationally , fuss said .
the threat of moving east is not necessarily connected to the loss of jobs , the study reported , with a view to the country 's rising unemployment rate .
" within the last few years there has been a considerable increase in the number of companies moving production to eastern europe and china , " fuss said .
" but during that same time there has also been an increase in jobs in the car sector in germany . "
the key to guaranteeing that those jobs remain in germany in the future , is to focus more on innovation , design , research and development , he added . rolf wenkel -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 30,000 jobs on line at volkswagen europe 's biggest carmaker said 30,000 jobs could be cut in germany if unions do not agree to cost-cutting plans .

looking to the east and far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturing in china - cheap and efficient .
the stuttgart-based business consultancy surveyed 200 german car suppliers with an annual turnover of between € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.12 million -rrb- and € 500 million .
nearly every second company had already established at least one production site abroad , and almost 40 percent of those questioned said they had concrete plans for shifting parts of their production to eastern europe .
some 23 percent , or close to one-fourth of all suppliers , said they planned to invest in china .
peter fuss , one of the authors of the ernst & young study said that various factors played a role in a company 's decision to move production outside germany .
whereas eastern europe attracts car companies primarily because of the low wages , he said china is particularly interesting because of its proximity to the growing asian market .
" logistical costs can be kept low because companies produce for the local market and parts do n't have to be shipped from western europe to china , " he said .

tax breaks and benefits for investing in industrially weak regions - aspects frequently criticized as unfair advantages by western european politicians - hardly played a role at all in the decision to move production outside of germany .

that would mean that more complicated manufacturing processes - up to now largely based in germany would be affected by the outsourcing .
is germany 's auto industry at risk ?
the ernst & young study concluded that germany 's long tradition as a center of auto manufacturing is indeed in danger as more and more companies pack up and leave in search of better conditions abroad .

the proposal is seen as another example of team chief jürgen klinsmann 's growing control . despite playing host to soccer 's most prestigious event , the world cup , in 2006 , germany may not play the opening game of the tournament .
germany 's organizing committee chairman franz beckenbauer said on monday that the option to pass the honor to reigning world champions brazil , providing they qualify , was being discussed . since 1974 the world cup winners have taken to the field in the opening match and it is expected that germany will allow this tradition to continue with brazil opening the tournament on june 9 , 2006 at munich 's new allianz arena . beckenbauer also confirmed that the possibility arose from discussions held with team chief jürgen klinsmann who had expressed a preference for the hosts to start the tournament three days later at the olympic stadium in berlin than in the opening match in munich .
it is believed his reasons centered on giving his team more time to prepare . " we , at the organizing committee , do n't mind whether germany or brazil play the opening game , " beckenbauer told german sports television channel dsf .
" we would have liked germany to start with a highlight but the brazil solution would not be bad either , " he added . team manager oliver bierhoff seemed to be more definite in his view . " we will step aside for brazil , " he told the german news agency dpa .

klinsmann , who was appointed in july , has also been stamping his identity on other areas of the world cup 2006 plan by informing the organizing committee that he was against the idea of having germany 's training camp in leverkusen , which he felt was not practical . the plan to have the camp in leverkusen was agreed when klinsmann 's predecessor rudi völler was still in charge and was seen as compensation after the city 's bid to stage games of the 2006 finals was turned down because its stadium was too small . " he -lrb- klinsmann -rrb- has the right to refuse what rudi völler found correct and to have the team training somewhere else , " beckenbauer said . leverkusen anger over dfb reverse this could cause problems for the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
chemical giant bayer ag , leverkusen 's main sponsor , is accusing the dfb of breach of contract after they invested time and money in bringing the 2006 world cup to germany . bayer ag sports director meinolf sprink accused klinsmann and the dfb of lacking style in making the change , as well as breach of contract . " we have a clear written agreement .
i think it 's sad that we found this out through the press , " sprink told the ap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer calmund is angry over what he sees as a u-turn by the dfb over their world cup agreement .

the majority of eastern , northern and south-western states all fall behind the german average of € 25,800 in gdp per person . rich southern states better off than north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's entertainment district the city states of hamburg , with a gdp per person of € 44,500 , and bremen , with € 35,300 , are the exceptions in the northern region and are more in line with the large and affluent southern states of bavaria -lrb- € 29,900 -rrb- and baden-württemberg -lrb- € 29,400 -rrb- .
the rest of the north is as far behind the southern giants as the eastern states are behind the poorest western regions . the core of horst köhler 's comments over the weekend regarding differences in eastern and western states was seized upon by opposition parties , seemingly intent on exploiting a real or imagined divide for their own purposes ahead of state elections . but a closer look at the german president 's interview with news magazine focus published on sunday shows that köhler in fact pointed out that the living standards and employment possibilities varied all over germany , a view supported by the institute 's statistics . benefit claimants favor bremen while the figures confirm that average unemployment in the eastern states is almost ten percent higher than the worst affected western region - bremen with 16.3 percent , 14.3 percent registered - northern and western states have a higher number of people claiming social benefits , with berlin the exception in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visitor takes a numbered ticket as he waits in line in a german labor office the statistics again show that unemployment in the south of germany is a lot less than in northern states and that bavaria and baden-württemberg are well below the german average of 12.9 percent .
the two large southern states have the least amount of benefit claimants , with bavaria recording the lowest figure of 17 per 1,000 citizens compared to bremen 's 92 per 1,000 , the largest in the country . economists line up behind köhler reactions to köhler 's remarks continue to surface with many economic experts and commentators agreeing with their president . " köhler is perfectly right in what he says , " said klaus von dohnanyi , head of a special government-appointed commission on east germany .
" of course there will be regional differences .
you have them in other countries , " the former senior social democratic politician told the associated press .
" but that does not mean köhler is accepting the high levels of unemployment in eastern germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coal mining regions are struggling to adapt to the changing economy michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industry , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that he " fully and completely " agreed with köhler 's comments .
rogowski added that it is not possible to guarantee identical standards of living for all people and that it is only possible to create identical conditions from which standards of living can develop . politicians warn of negative effects however , senior politicians continue to view the president 's remarks with concern .
renate künast , the agriculture and consumer affairs minister , said : " it 's not a president 's job to say : ' take care of your problems on your own . " ' " the message that comes across to east germans is : be satisfied , there wo n't be any more equality , " reinhard bütikofer , the head of the greens party , told the berliner zeitung . greens lawmaker fritz kuhn accused köhler of unwittingly helping the ex-communist pds party , which has been prominent in championing the perceived east-west divide ahead of state elections , saying they draw strength " from a fundamental sense of many east germans that they are second-class .

2 ; on the eve of the anniversary of german reunification in 1990 . the labor market changes will hit the former communist east hardest .
unemployment there is twice that in the west and young people have been abandoning the region in droves in search of a better future . ahead of the elections in brandenburg and saxony , voters have shown increasing signs they are disenchanted with chancellor gerhard schröder 's failure to find them jobs and revitalize the euro zone 's biggest economy . opinion polls suggest they will turn to parties on both extremes of the political spectrum , heaping more pressure on schröder in the wake of several recent bad election results . divisions also appear to be surfacing between eastern and western regions , with some in the more affluent parts of the country showing open resentment to the billions in " solidarity " payments that have been made to the east since the early 1990s . presidential participation german president horst köhler , a former head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , became mired in that debate after his comments in the weekly focus magazine were perceived as encouraging an abandoning of the eastern states . " there were and there are big differences in living standards everywhere in germany .
it 's the same from north to south as it is from east to west , " köhler told the news magazine in its monday edition . " if you want to level them out , you cement in place a subsidized state and place an intolerable burden of debt on the younger generation .
we must get away from a subsidised state , " he said . his remarks won a broadside from agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast , who said : " it 's not a president 's job to say : ' take care of your problems on your own . " ' the reaction to a prominent political figure addressing the virtual taboo of social inequality was also indicative of how much progress has been made just two months before the 15th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall . " it 's the first time that a senior german politician has called into question the central doctrine of unified germany , " said the daily berliner zeitung . " equalizing living standards is one of the founding myths of the united germany , " its editorial read under the headline " köhler was right .

an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees . the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- annual report “ education at a glance , ” published tuesday , has dealt another blow to an already stricken german education policy . the study , which compares education systems in the 30 oecd member countries , indicated that germany has a lot of work to do if it wants to produce graduates with qualifications comparable to other developed countries .
without significant educational reforms , germany could forfeit its economical competitiveness , the report warned . while oecd states increased their investments in primary and secondary schools by 21 percent and in universities by 30 percent from 1995 through 2001 , germany had only spent 6 and 7 percent more respectively , the study said .
in oecd countries , the number of college and university students increased by an average of 40 percent . but germany , austria and france experienced no growth at all . " the qualification level in the oecd states has risen dramatically since 1995 , while in germany nothing has happened , " german education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said .
the social democrat appealed to the opposition christian democratic union-run states to cooperate with the federal government to eliminate subsidies for homeowners and instead invest the money in education and research .
the lion 's share of german education funding and policy is determined at the state level . below average the study said germany spent less money than the average on each student and more on teachers ' salaries .
seven- and eight-year-old german pupils receive 160 fewer hours of lessons than the oecd average .
the discrepancy decreases in secondary schools , though 15-year-olds still get 66 hours of instruction less than the oecd midpoint .
kindergarten and primary school classes are also larger than the oecd average , which means that the children inevitably receive less individual attention aat one of the most crucial points in their education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher of the oecd “ what we have observed over time is that some countries have very dynamically expanded and extended their educational services , and in germany that kind of dynamic has been much less pronounced , " andreas schleicher , one of the study 's authors told dw-radio .
" over time , the divergence between the countries that move very fast and those that do not change is becoming bigger , ” he said . no longer the country of poets and philosophers three years ago , the oecd 's pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading , math and science when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
the assessment came as a shock to germans , who see their land as the “ country of poets and philosophers . ” education minister buhlman -lrb- photo , below -rrb- subsequently initiated a program to increase the number of all-day schools in germany , which the current report praised .
around 3,000 schools now provide full-day instruction .
but the majority of schools in germany continue to operate on a half-day basis , with lessons ending around lunchtime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn although he lauded the program , schleicher , who also coordinates the pisa study , said that all-day schools are already the norm in other oecd countries .
he focused criticism on germany 's track system , which separates students into different classes and schools depending on their achievements , thus determining whether they will gain the necessary qualifications to pursue further training or go to university after secondary school . in other countries " differences between people , between talents are not seen so much as a problem that must be resolved through school structures .
instead they deal with it constructively , " schleicher said . intensive discussion doris ahnen , the head of the education ministers ' conference , which is made up of the 16 state education ministers and senators , rebuffed the oecd criticism .
" in hardly another country has education been discussed so intensively since pisa , " bavarian public broadcaster bayerische rundfunk quoted ahnen as saying . bildunterschrift : baden-wurttemberg 's education minister , annette schavan , also dismissed the study .
" in germany there 's no lack of visions or of concrete reforms , " she said .
she accused the oecd of ignoring fundamental improvements to the education system . the gew teachers ' union demanded that the state education ministers take action to stop germany 's education system from deteriorating .
" the federal sectionalism of the states promotes germany 's further relegation , " gew head eva-marie stange said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting brain gain for german universities leading german education experts have called for more autonomy for german universities to improve competitiveness on an international level .

the proposal is seen as another example of team chief jürgen klinsmann 's growing control . despite playing host to soccer 's most prestigious event , the world cup , in 2006 , germany may not play the opening game of the tournament .
germany 's organizing committee chairman franz beckenbauer said on monday that the option to pass the honor to reigning world champions brazil , providing they qualify , was being discussed . since 1974 the world cup winners have taken to the field in the opening match and it is expected that germany will allow this tradition to continue with brazil opening the tournament on june 9 , 2006 at munich 's new allianz arena . beckenbauer also confirmed that the possibility arose from discussions held with team chief jürgen klinsmann who had expressed a preference for the hosts to start the tournament three days later at the olympic stadium in berlin than in the opening match in munich .
it is believed his reasons centered on giving his team more time to prepare . " we , at the organizing committee , do n't mind whether germany or brazil play the opening game , " beckenbauer told german sports television channel dsf .
" we would have liked germany to start with a highlight but the brazil solution would not be bad either , " he added . team manager oliver bierhoff seemed to be more definite in his view . " we will step aside for brazil , " he told the german news agency dpa .
" the reigning champions can open the world cup . " there has yet to be any official word on the decision . klinsmann exerting influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann is said to be getting his own way through strong words and deeds .
klinsmann , who was appointed in july , has also been stamping his identity on other areas of the world cup 2006 plan by informing the organizing committee that he was against the idea of having germany 's training camp in leverkusen , which he felt was not practical . the plan to have the camp in leverkusen was agreed when klinsmann 's predecessor rudi völler was still in charge and was seen as compensation after the city 's bid to stage games of the 2006 finals was turned down because its stadium was too small . " he -lrb- klinsmann -rrb- has the right to refuse what rudi völler found correct and to have the team training somewhere else , " beckenbauer said . leverkusen anger over dfb reverse this could cause problems for the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
chemical giant bayer ag , leverkusen 's main sponsor , is accusing the dfb of breach of contract after they invested time and money in bringing the 2006 world cup to germany . bayer ag sports director meinolf sprink accused klinsmann and the dfb of lacking style in making the change , as well as breach of contract . " we have a clear written agreement .
i think it 's sad that we found this out through the press , " sprink told the ap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer calmund is angry over what he sees as a u-turn by the dfb over their world cup agreement .
" i think the dfb have forgotten what leverkusen and the bayer group have done to advertise this world cup , " raged leverkusen 's former general manager reiner calmund . " we are aware the promises have been made to leverkusen , " bierhoff said .
" but the situation is not optimal .
not because of leverkusen 's stadium , but because of the distance between the hotel and stadium .

so why does it have such a bad reputation ? “ so if your body were berlin , which part would you get rid of , ” performance artists from the gob squad theater group asked the crowd on the recent opening night of the volkspalas t festival in berlin ’ s palace of the republic , which is welcoming the public until it closes for the last time in november . the gob squad ’ s badgering of visitors highlighted the building ’ s sorry plight .
an in-your-face example of everything that was wrong with east german urban planning , it 's fatally out of fashion - and it has to go . at least , according to the bundestag . resisting the inevitable ? but it ’ s not going quietly .
plenty of people would like it to remain , at least until berlin is better able to foot the bill for its demolition . given the city ’ s € 50 billion -lrb- $ 61.2 billion -rrb- debt , it seems like a sensible solution . “ right now , the idea of rebuilding the palace is completely inappropriate , ” said dagmar richter , a german-american architecture professor and critic . ron bloch , a spokesman for volkspalast festival , agreed . “ in these times of hartz iv -lrb- controversial social welfare reforms , -rrb- the government has more urgent things to worry about than tearing down an intact building at a cost of up to € 60 million , ” he observed wryly . so why exactly did the bundestag vote to tear down the palace of the republic and erect a copy of a baroque hohenzollern palace in its place ? ideological baggage crucially , the building is not just aesthetically out of fashion , it ’ s politically passé , too . in few other cities does urban planning carry the same sort of baggage it does in berlin .
what with the german capital ’ s unusually turbulent past , architecture has a political dimension which ensures it ’ s regularly propelled into mainstream debate . “ given the many turning points in german history - 1918 , 1933 , 1945 and 1989 - architecture in germany has , without a doubt , been considerably more politicized than in other countries , ” said hartmut frank , an architect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with simone hain , formerly of east germany ’ s prestigious bauakademie , frank has curated an exhibition with the title two german architectures which opens in leipzig this week .
organized by germany 's institute for foreign relations , or ifa , it illustrates that ultimately , east and west german architecture had more in common than might have been expected . as andreas ruby wrote in the german weekly die zeit , many buildings that typify east german architecture would be considered “ characteristic and quality examples of european architecture of the post-war decades if they ’ d been built , say , in cologne . ”
the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .

so why does it have such a bad reputation ? “ so if your body were berlin , which part would you get rid of , ” performance artists from the gob squad theater group asked the crowd on the recent opening night of the volkspalas t festival in berlin ’ s palace of the republic , which is welcoming the public until it closes for the last time in november . the gob squad ’ s badgering of visitors highlighted the building ’ s sorry plight .
an in-your-face example of everything that was wrong with east german urban planning , it 's fatally out of fashion - and it has to go . at least , according to the bundestag . resisting the inevitable ? but it ’ s not going quietly .
plenty of people would like it to remain , at least until berlin is better able to foot the bill for its demolition . given the city ’ s € 50 billion -lrb- $ 61.2 billion -rrb- debt , it seems like a sensible solution . “ right now , the idea of rebuilding the palace is completely inappropriate , ” said dagmar richter , a german-american architecture professor and critic . ron bloch , a spokesman for volkspalast festival , agreed . “ in these times of hartz iv -lrb- controversial social welfare reforms , -rrb- the government has more urgent things to worry about than tearing down an intact building at a cost of up to € 60 million , ” he observed wryly . so why exactly did the bundestag vote to tear down the palace of the republic and erect a copy of a baroque hohenzollern palace in its place ? ideological baggage crucially , the building is not just aesthetically out of fashion , it ’ s politically passé , too . in few other cities does urban planning carry the same sort of baggage it does in berlin .
what with the german capital ’ s unusually turbulent past , architecture has a political dimension which ensures it ’ s regularly propelled into mainstream debate . “ given the many turning points in german history - 1918 , 1933 , 1945 and 1989 - architecture in germany has , without a doubt , been considerably more politicized than in other countries , ” said hartmut frank , an architect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with simone hain , formerly of east germany ’ s prestigious bauakademie , frank has curated an exhibition with the title two german architectures which opens in leipzig this week .
organized by germany 's institute for foreign relations , or ifa , it illustrates that ultimately , east and west german architecture had more in common than might have been expected . as andreas ruby wrote in the german weekly die zeit , many buildings that typify east german architecture would be considered “ characteristic and quality examples of european architecture of the post-war decades if they ’ d been built , say , in cologne . ”
the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .
since 1989 , urban planners have been acutely aware that banishing the city ’ s communist legacy is a matter of both psychological and physical transformation . the process began in the early 1990s when statues of communist heroes were unceremoniously removed and many of east berlin ’ s streets rechristened .

so why does it have such a bad reputation ? “ so if your body were berlin , which part would you get rid of , ” performance artists from the gob squad theater group asked the crowd on the recent opening night of the volkspalas t festival in berlin ’ s palace of the republic , which is welcoming the public until it closes for the last time in november . the gob squad ’ s badgering of visitors highlighted the building ’ s sorry plight .
an in-your-face example of everything that was wrong with east german urban planning , it 's fatally out of fashion - and it has to go . at least , according to the bundestag . resisting the inevitable ? but it ’ s not going quietly .
plenty of people would like it to remain , at least until berlin is better able to foot the bill for its demolition . given the city ’ s € 50 billion -lrb- $ 61.2 billion -rrb- debt , it seems like a sensible solution . “ right now , the idea of rebuilding the palace is completely inappropriate , ” said dagmar richter , a german-american architecture professor and critic . ron bloch , a spokesman for volkspalast festival , agreed . “ in these times of hartz iv -lrb- controversial social welfare reforms , -rrb- the government has more urgent things to worry about than tearing down an intact building at a cost of up to € 60 million , ” he observed wryly . so why exactly did the bundestag vote to tear down the palace of the republic and erect a copy of a baroque hohenzollern palace in its place ? ideological baggage crucially , the building is not just aesthetically out of fashion , it ’ s politically passé , too . in few other cities does urban planning carry the same sort of baggage it does in berlin .
what with the german capital ’ s unusually turbulent past , architecture has a political dimension which ensures it ’ s regularly propelled into mainstream debate . “ given the many turning points in german history - 1918 , 1933 , 1945 and 1989 - architecture in germany has , without a doubt , been considerably more politicized than in other countries , ” said hartmut frank , an architect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with simone hain , formerly of east germany ’ s prestigious bauakademie , frank has curated an exhibition with the title two german architectures which opens in leipzig this week .
organized by germany 's institute for foreign relations , or ifa , it illustrates that ultimately , east and west german architecture had more in common than might have been expected . as andreas ruby wrote in the german weekly die zeit , many buildings that typify east german architecture would be considered “ characteristic and quality examples of european architecture of the post-war decades if they ’ d been built , say , in cologne . ”
the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .
since 1989 , urban planners have been acutely aware that banishing the city ’ s communist legacy is a matter of both psychological and physical transformation . the process began in the early 1990s when statues of communist heroes were unceremoniously removed and many of east berlin ’ s streets rechristened .
monuments to lenin were dismantled , marx-engels-platz became hackescher markt - and the oppressive era of socialist dictatorship became an increasingly distant memory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ architecture here is much more about politics than aesthetics , ” she said , explaining the drab , minimalist look of many 1950s east german buildings .
“ that always meant architecture had less of an opportunity to be expressive than in a highly consumerist society like the us . ” richter also pointed out that germany was and still is scarred by the overtly monumental vision of nazi architect albert speer and has shyed away from bombastic building ever since . “ what we have instead is architecture that has more of a political role in the urban fabric , ” she said , adding that it ’ s a sign of the times that the architects currently involved in redesigning the city - such as helmut jahn and hans kollhoff , the man behind the plans for the new alexanderplatz in central berlin - are famously conservative , “ corporate ” architects . retro classics worth preserving but as berliners witness the bricks and mortar traces of the soviet era slowly disappear , many have reclaimed aspects of east german architecture and design as retro classics eminently worth preserving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen years after the fall of the wall , it ’ s more than okay to have a sentimental attachment to east germany - it ’ s positively fashionable .
the party crowd is flocking to the capital ’ s hip havens of sputnik chic , with 1960s-built venues such as cafe moskau and kino kosmos enjoying unprecedented popularity . not even its new-found fans would describe it as beautiful - but if it gets a stay of execution , perhaps the day will come when even the palace of the republic is considered fashionable . two german architectures runs from sept .

" made in germany " may soon be outdated . it 's an open secret that german carmakers are frustrated with high wages , employee benefits and inflexible working conditions , and that many are considering a move as a way out of the dilemma .
many in the sector have already set up manufacturing facilities abroad where wages and production costs are considerably lower than back home .
nearly every third german car supplier is already producing in eastern europe , and every sixth one has already set up sites in china .
but that 's only the beginning : every second automobile parts manufacturer is planning to move its production facilities outside of germany , according to a study published by the business consultancy firm ernst & young on monday .
looking to the east and far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturing in china - cheap and efficient .
the stuttgart-based business consultancy surveyed 200 german car suppliers with an annual turnover of between € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.12 million -rrb- and € 500 million .
nearly every second company had already established at least one production site abroad , and almost 40 percent of those questioned said they had concrete plans for shifting parts of their production to eastern europe .
some 23 percent , or close to one-fourth of all suppliers , said they planned to invest in china .
peter fuss , one of the authors of the ernst & young study said that various factors played a role in a company 's decision to move production outside germany .
whereas eastern europe attracts car companies primarily because of the low wages , he said china is particularly interesting because of its proximity to the growing asian market .
" logistical costs can be kept low because companies produce for the local market and parts do n't have to be shipped from western europe to china , " he said .
expanding exodus in a worldwide comparison of production sites , china and the czech republic topped the list , followed by hungary and poland .
both regions , china and eastern europe received top marks for car suppliers for low wage costs -lrb- 15 to 20 percent less than the hourly wage in germany -rrb- and in terms of flexibility and motivation of employees .
tax breaks and benefits for investing in industrially weak regions - aspects frequently criticized as unfair advantages by western european politicians - hardly played a role at all in the decision to move production outside of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes slk production in bremen according to ernst & young , fewer and fewer new manufacturing sites will be opened in western europe in the future .
while more factories close in germany and its neighboring western countries , the move east will not be limited to just the production of parts .
" over time things will develop , " fuss said .
" the companies interviewed in the survey clearly indicated that they are planning to move final assembly stages to eastern europe and china in the near future . "
that would mean that more complicated manufacturing processes - up to now largely based in germany would be affected by the outsourcing .
is germany 's auto industry at risk ?
the ernst & young study concluded that germany 's long tradition as a center of auto manufacturing is indeed in danger as more and more companies pack up and leave in search of better conditions abroad .
at the same time , the move abroad represents " the last chance the companies have to reduce costs and remain competitive in the international market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20 million vw golfs have rolled off the assembly line at the carmaker 's headquarters in wolfsburg but the study also said that although manufacturing will move , germany will continue to hold on to its claim as a nation of carmakers in the fields of branding - the label " made in germany " will still hold sway over car buyers - and in the critical area of research and development .
however , in order to capitalize on these strengths in the future , it will be crucial to identify innovative companies in these fields and promote them internationally , fuss said .
the threat of moving east is not necessarily connected to the loss of jobs , the study reported , with a view to the country 's rising unemployment rate .
" within the last few years there has been a considerable increase in the number of companies moving production to eastern europe and china , " fuss said .
" but during that same time there has also been an increase in jobs in the car sector in germany . "
the key to guaranteeing that those jobs remain in germany in the future , is to focus more on innovation , design , research and development , he added . rolf wenkel -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 30,000 jobs on line at volkswagen europe 's biggest carmaker said 30,000 jobs could be cut in germany if unions do not agree to cost-cutting plans .

" made in germany " may soon be outdated . it 's an open secret that german carmakers are frustrated with high wages , employee benefits and inflexible working conditions , and that many are considering a move as a way out of the dilemma .
many in the sector have already set up manufacturing facilities abroad where wages and production costs are considerably lower than back home .
nearly every third german car supplier is already producing in eastern europe , and every sixth one has already set up sites in china .
but that 's only the beginning : every second automobile parts manufacturer is planning to move its production facilities outside of germany , according to a study published by the business consultancy firm ernst & young on monday .
looking to the east and far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturing in china - cheap and efficient .
the stuttgart-based business consultancy surveyed 200 german car suppliers with an annual turnover of between € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.12 million -rrb- and € 500 million .
nearly every second company had already established at least one production site abroad , and almost 40 percent of those questioned said they had concrete plans for shifting parts of their production to eastern europe .
some 23 percent , or close to one-fourth of all suppliers , said they planned to invest in china .
peter fuss , one of the authors of the ernst & young study said that various factors played a role in a company 's decision to move production outside germany .
whereas eastern europe attracts car companies primarily because of the low wages , he said china is particularly interesting because of its proximity to the growing asian market .
" logistical costs can be kept low because companies produce for the local market and parts do n't have to be shipped from western europe to china , " he said .
expanding exodus in a worldwide comparison of production sites , china and the czech republic topped the list , followed by hungary and poland .
both regions , china and eastern europe received top marks for car suppliers for low wage costs -lrb- 15 to 20 percent less than the hourly wage in germany -rrb- and in terms of flexibility and motivation of employees .
tax breaks and benefits for investing in industrially weak regions - aspects frequently criticized as unfair advantages by western european politicians - hardly played a role at all in the decision to move production outside of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes slk production in bremen according to ernst & young , fewer and fewer new manufacturing sites will be opened in western europe in the future .
while more factories close in germany and its neighboring western countries , the move east will not be limited to just the production of parts .
" over time things will develop , " fuss said .
" the companies interviewed in the survey clearly indicated that they are planning to move final assembly stages to eastern europe and china in the near future . "
that would mean that more complicated manufacturing processes - up to now largely based in germany would be affected by the outsourcing .
is germany 's auto industry at risk ?
the ernst & young study concluded that germany 's long tradition as a center of auto manufacturing is indeed in danger as more and more companies pack up and leave in search of better conditions abroad .
at the same time , the move abroad represents " the last chance the companies have to reduce costs and remain competitive in the international market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20 million vw golfs have rolled off the assembly line at the carmaker 's headquarters in wolfsburg but the study also said that although manufacturing will move , germany will continue to hold on to its claim as a nation of carmakers in the fields of branding - the label " made in germany " will still hold sway over car buyers - and in the critical area of research and development .

but when it comes to a car 's performance , they would rather take a drive than get their hands dirty fixing the motor . when germany 's automobile club for women was founded back in may 1926 with seven members , cars were still something of a rarity on german streets .
the site of a woman behind the wheel was virtually unheard of - let alone the notion of a lady actually taking an avid interest in the motorized vehicles .
but the founding mothers of ddac were not discouraged .
just two years after establishing the club , the motoring women organized their first long-distance race from berlin to oberhof , in southern germany .
the competition lasted two days and covered a stretch of 750 kilometers -lrb- 466 miles -rrb- .
today , that hardly seems much of a challenge , but more than 70 years ago , just arriving at the finish line was a real accomplishment .
more often than not , a car ended up in a ditch alongside the potholed roads .
back then the women had to rely a lot more on sheer strength and driving dexterity : there was no power steering , no four-wheel drive , no suspension system to assist the early women drivers .
since then , cars have developed by leaps and bounds in terms of technology and safety .
but the members of ddac have n't lost interest in the main focus of their club : driving for fun and leisure .
driving for fun " we drive normal cars , " christa reiners , head of the ddac branch in rheinland-ruhr in western germany , told dw-world .
" from the compact class to the large family car , everything has a place in our group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women drivers are no longer a rarity whereas their male counterparts frequently spend a good bit of time tuning up their motors and outfitting their cars with the latest in computer-assisted technology , the members of ddac rarely pick up a wrench .
instead , safety is their top priority .
" it is especially important that our vehicles are in excellent working condition , " reiners said , describing the ddac 's inclinations , which do n't differ that much from the interests and concerns of the average woman driver .
" complicated repairs are dealt with at the mechanic 's workshop . "
as a result , greasy hands and overalls are less common than extended car tours across the country .
christa reiners said the relationship between the club 's members and their automobiles is " rather playful , " but nonetheless demanding .
" in keeping with the tradition of our club , we are n't primarily interested in speeding , but rather in performing difficult orientation exercises or tests of skill , " she said .
taking women drivers seriously the way women think about cars is n't just visible on the road .
when faced with purchasing a new vehicle , many of their specific interests play a key role in decision-making .
however , a recent marketing study by the vocational college of niederrhein showed that woman often feel they are not taken seriously in the sales room .
" women are frequently insecure when they buy a car and they reveal that weakness to the salesperson , " said doris kortus-schultes .
the professor and author of the study examined the buying habits and interests of more than 1,200 women drivers , including car experts , senior citizens and immigrants .
according to the study , which the german women 's automobile club supported , female drivers do n't necessarily want to see more saleswomen in the showroom , but they do want to see more emphasis placed on honesty , respect , trustworthiness and understanding when it comes to selling a car .
even after the purchase , the women interviewed said they would like to have easy-to-read instruction manuals and a personal explanation and demonstration of a car 's features .
perhaps if female drivers are taken more seriously both on and off the road , the number of women who take an interest in their cars beyond the simple transportation aspect will also grow . ingo uhlenbruch -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de why german women ca n't read maps … but can park the car only some of the clichés about german drivers are true according to a new study .

but when it comes to a car 's performance , they would rather take a drive than get their hands dirty fixing the motor . when germany 's automobile club for women was founded back in may 1926 with seven members , cars were still something of a rarity on german streets .
the site of a woman behind the wheel was virtually unheard of - let alone the notion of a lady actually taking an avid interest in the motorized vehicles .
but the founding mothers of ddac were not discouraged .
just two years after establishing the club , the motoring women organized their first long-distance race from berlin to oberhof , in southern germany .
the competition lasted two days and covered a stretch of 750 kilometers -lrb- 466 miles -rrb- .
today , that hardly seems much of a challenge , but more than 70 years ago , just arriving at the finish line was a real accomplishment .
more often than not , a car ended up in a ditch alongside the potholed roads .
back then the women had to rely a lot more on sheer strength and driving dexterity : there was no power steering , no four-wheel drive , no suspension system to assist the early women drivers .
since then , cars have developed by leaps and bounds in terms of technology and safety .
but the members of ddac have n't lost interest in the main focus of their club : driving for fun and leisure .
driving for fun " we drive normal cars , " christa reiners , head of the ddac branch in rheinland-ruhr in western germany , told dw-world .
" from the compact class to the large family car , everything has a place in our group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women drivers are no longer a rarity whereas their male counterparts frequently spend a good bit of time tuning up their motors and outfitting their cars with the latest in computer-assisted technology , the members of ddac rarely pick up a wrench .
instead , safety is their top priority .
" it is especially important that our vehicles are in excellent working condition , " reiners said , describing the ddac 's inclinations , which do n't differ that much from the interests and concerns of the average woman driver .
" complicated repairs are dealt with at the mechanic 's workshop . "
as a result , greasy hands and overalls are less common than extended car tours across the country .
christa reiners said the relationship between the club 's members and their automobiles is " rather playful , " but nonetheless demanding .

" this is the image that turkey has always wished for .
this consensus is perhaps even more important than the new penal code itself . "
consensus above all formally , parliament concluded that changes to the new penal code would only be made after a consensus had been reached .
in effect , it meant that the islamic-conservative governing party would give up on making adultery a crime , a move that was supposed to appeal to the party 's provincial supporters . on monday , tourism minister erkan mumcu was the first cabinet member to distance himself from the law - probably fearing empty hotel rooms next summer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.09.2004 turkey backs down on adultery law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while erdogan -lrb- left -rrb- was away , his deputy , gül , cleared the air under huge pressure from the european union , turkey back-pedaled away from a bill to re-criminalize adultery on tuesday . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , who over the past few days repeatedly spoke out in favor of re-criminalizing adultery , was far away in tajikistan when his colleagues announced the u-turn .
parliament had already started debating the issue , as foreign minister abdullah gül pulled aside the opposition leader for a brief exchange . the upshot was that party consensus was too important to waste on such a trifle . " parliament achieved this .
i thank the opposition for that and our -lrb- justice and development -rrb- ak-party , " justice minister cemil cicek said after announcing the decision .
" this is the image that turkey has always wished for .
this consensus is perhaps even more important than the new penal code itself . "
consensus above all formally , parliament concluded that changes to the new penal code would only be made after a consensus had been reached .
in effect , it meant that the islamic-conservative governing party would give up on making adultery a crime , a move that was supposed to appeal to the party 's provincial supporters . on monday , tourism minister erkan mumcu was the first cabinet member to distance himself from the law - probably fearing empty hotel rooms next summer .
by tuesday morning , even " regular " parliamentarians were reluctant to support the plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish and the european union flags but neither better judgment nor domestic criticism from the press and women 's groups tipped the scales .
instead , the decisive factor was most likely the warnings emanating from western europe .
parliamentarians familiar with eu law have sheepishly said as much . " the timing may not have been the best , " said yasar yakis , who leads the turkish parliament 's eu commission .
" that 's what many people in europe told us . " more than timing the timing was n't the only problem .
belgian foreign minister karel de gucht warned ankara on sunday that such a law would be a " serious obstacle " to turkey 's bid to join the european union .
in early october , the european commission is set to offer its assessment on whether to start accession talks with turkey , and eu government leaders will decide whether or not to set a date to begin negotiations in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borrell of spain although the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- does not formally play a roll in the decision , ep president josep borrell -lrb- photo -rrb- announced on tuesday that the body would compile its own report on whether turkey should join the bloc .
" it would … be a mistake if we did n't speak out on this issue , " borrell said .
he stressed that it must be clear to everyone what a " no " to turkey would mean for eu relations to the islamic world . turkey 's new penal code - without the singular contentious paragraphs on adultery - is a further step towards the eu .
the country 's parliament aims to pass the legislation by the weekend .
it will increase penalties for torture , punish rape in marriage , limit the practice of testing young women for virginity and increase penalties for builders whose buildings ca n't withstand earthquakes . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de verheugen warns turkey on adultery law eu commissioner günther verheugen warned turkey that proposals to revamp the turkish penal code , which would include the return of punishment for adultery , should not divert the country from its path to eu membership .
-lrb- sept .
10 , 2004 -rrb- turkey changes laws to meet eu standards the turkish government agreed on 348 new paragraphs to brings it 80-year-old penal code , which punished sheep theft harder than assault , up to european standard .
extending women 's rights was especially controversial .
-lrb- sept .
1 , 2004 -rrb- breaking the mold turkey 's bid for eu membership might still be a touch-and-go issue , but a look at germany ’ s cultural mainstream shows that the country ’ s turkish community has never been more visible .

an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees . the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- annual report “ education at a glance , ” published tuesday , has dealt another blow to an already stricken german education policy . the study , which compares education systems in the 30 oecd member countries , indicated that germany has a lot of work to do if it wants to produce graduates with qualifications comparable to other developed countries .
without significant educational reforms , germany could forfeit its economical competitiveness , the report warned . while oecd states increased their investments in primary and secondary schools by 21 percent and in universities by 30 percent from 1995 through 2001 , germany had only spent 6 and 7 percent more respectively , the study said .
in oecd countries , the number of college and university students increased by an average of 40 percent . but germany , austria and france experienced no growth at all . " the qualification level in the oecd states has risen dramatically since 1995 , while in germany nothing has happened , " german education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said .
the social democrat appealed to the opposition christian democratic union-run states to cooperate with the federal government to eliminate subsidies for homeowners and instead invest the money in education and research .
the lion 's share of german education funding and policy is determined at the state level . below average the study said germany spent less money than the average on each student and more on teachers ' salaries .
seven- and eight-year-old german pupils receive 160 fewer hours of lessons than the oecd average .
the discrepancy decreases in secondary schools , though 15-year-olds still get 66 hours of instruction less than the oecd midpoint .
kindergarten and primary school classes are also larger than the oecd average , which means that the children inevitably receive less individual attention aat one of the most crucial points in their education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher of the oecd “ what we have observed over time is that some countries have very dynamically expanded and extended their educational services , and in germany that kind of dynamic has been much less pronounced , " andreas schleicher , one of the study 's authors told dw-radio .
" over time , the divergence between the countries that move very fast and those that do not change is becoming bigger , ” he said . no longer the country of poets and philosophers three years ago , the oecd 's pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading , math and science when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
the assessment came as a shock to germans , who see their land as the “ country of poets and philosophers . ” education minister buhlman -lrb- photo , below -rrb- subsequently initiated a program to increase the number of all-day schools in germany , which the current report praised .
around 3,000 schools now provide full-day instruction .
but the majority of schools in germany continue to operate on a half-day basis , with lessons ending around lunchtime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn although he lauded the program , schleicher , who also coordinates the pisa study , said that all-day schools are already the norm in other oecd countries .
he focused criticism on germany 's track system , which separates students into different classes and schools depending on their achievements , thus determining whether they will gain the necessary qualifications to pursue further training or go to university after secondary school . in other countries " differences between people , between talents are not seen so much as a problem that must be resolved through school structures .
instead they deal with it constructively , " schleicher said . intensive discussion doris ahnen , the head of the education ministers ' conference , which is made up of the 16 state education ministers and senators , rebuffed the oecd criticism .
" in hardly another country has education been discussed so intensively since pisa , " bavarian public broadcaster bayerische rundfunk quoted ahnen as saying . bildunterschrift : baden-wurttemberg 's education minister , annette schavan , also dismissed the study .
" in germany there 's no lack of visions or of concrete reforms , " she said .
she accused the oecd of ignoring fundamental improvements to the education system . the gew teachers ' union demanded that the state education ministers take action to stop germany 's education system from deteriorating .

the majority of eastern , northern and south-western states all fall behind the german average of € 25,800 in gdp per person . rich southern states better off than north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's entertainment district the city states of hamburg , with a gdp per person of € 44,500 , and bremen , with € 35,300 , are the exceptions in the northern region and are more in line with the large and affluent southern states of bavaria -lrb- € 29,900 -rrb- and baden-württemberg -lrb- € 29,400 -rrb- .
the rest of the north is as far behind the southern giants as the eastern states are behind the poorest western regions . the core of horst köhler 's comments over the weekend regarding differences in eastern and western states was seized upon by opposition parties , seemingly intent on exploiting a real or imagined divide for their own purposes ahead of state elections . but a closer look at the german president 's interview with news magazine focus published on sunday shows that köhler in fact pointed out that the living standards and employment possibilities varied all over germany , a view supported by the institute 's statistics . benefit claimants favor bremen while the figures confirm that average unemployment in the eastern states is almost ten percent higher than the worst affected western region - bremen with 16.3 percent , 14.3 percent registered - northern and western states have a higher number of people claiming social benefits , with berlin the exception in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visitor takes a numbered ticket as he waits in line in a german labor office the statistics again show that unemployment in the south of germany is a lot less than in northern states and that bavaria and baden-württemberg are well below the german average of 12.9 percent .
the two large southern states have the least amount of benefit claimants , with bavaria recording the lowest figure of 17 per 1,000 citizens compared to bremen 's 92 per 1,000 , the largest in the country . economists line up behind köhler reactions to köhler 's remarks continue to surface with many economic experts and commentators agreeing with their president . " köhler is perfectly right in what he says , " said klaus von dohnanyi , head of a special government-appointed commission on east germany .
" of course there will be regional differences .
you have them in other countries , " the former senior social democratic politician told the associated press .
" but that does not mean köhler is accepting the high levels of unemployment in eastern germany .

an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees . the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- annual report “ education at a glance , ” published tuesday , has dealt another blow to an already stricken german education policy . the study , which compares education systems in the 30 oecd member countries , indicated that germany has a lot of work to do if it wants to produce graduates with qualifications comparable to other developed countries .
without significant educational reforms , germany could forfeit its economical competitiveness , the report warned . while oecd states increased their investments in primary and secondary schools by 21 percent and in universities by 30 percent from 1995 through 2001 , germany had only spent 6 and 7 percent more respectively , the study said .
in oecd countries , the number of college and university students increased by an average of 40 percent . but germany , austria and france experienced no growth at all . " the qualification level in the oecd states has risen dramatically since 1995 , while in germany nothing has happened , " german education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said .
the social democrat appealed to the opposition christian democratic union-run states to cooperate with the federal government to eliminate subsidies for homeowners and instead invest the money in education and research .
the lion 's share of german education funding and policy is determined at the state level . below average the study said germany spent less money than the average on each student and more on teachers ' salaries .
seven- and eight-year-old german pupils receive 160 fewer hours of lessons than the oecd average .
the discrepancy decreases in secondary schools , though 15-year-olds still get 66 hours of instruction less than the oecd midpoint .
kindergarten and primary school classes are also larger than the oecd average , which means that the children inevitably receive less individual attention aat one of the most crucial points in their education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher of the oecd “ what we have observed over time is that some countries have very dynamically expanded and extended their educational services , and in germany that kind of dynamic has been much less pronounced , " andreas schleicher , one of the study 's authors told dw-radio .
" over time , the divergence between the countries that move very fast and those that do not change is becoming bigger , ” he said . no longer the country of poets and philosophers three years ago , the oecd 's pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading , math and science when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
the assessment came as a shock to germans , who see their land as the “ country of poets and philosophers . ” education minister buhlman -lrb- photo , below -rrb- subsequently initiated a program to increase the number of all-day schools in germany , which the current report praised .
around 3,000 schools now provide full-day instruction .
but the majority of schools in germany continue to operate on a half-day basis , with lessons ending around lunchtime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn although he lauded the program , schleicher , who also coordinates the pisa study , said that all-day schools are already the norm in other oecd countries .
he focused criticism on germany 's track system , which separates students into different classes and schools depending on their achievements , thus determining whether they will gain the necessary qualifications to pursue further training or go to university after secondary school . in other countries " differences between people , between talents are not seen so much as a problem that must be resolved through school structures .
instead they deal with it constructively , " schleicher said . intensive discussion doris ahnen , the head of the education ministers ' conference , which is made up of the 16 state education ministers and senators , rebuffed the oecd criticism .
" in hardly another country has education been discussed so intensively since pisa , " bavarian public broadcaster bayerische rundfunk quoted ahnen as saying . bildunterschrift : baden-wurttemberg 's education minister , annette schavan , also dismissed the study .
" in germany there 's no lack of visions or of concrete reforms , " she said .
she accused the oecd of ignoring fundamental improvements to the education system . the gew teachers ' union demanded that the state education ministers take action to stop germany 's education system from deteriorating .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.09.2004 east german architecture 's second chance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace of the republic is fighting off the wrecking ball a new exhibition in leipzig reveals that east german architecture has a lot more to offer than urban eyesores .
so why does it have such a bad reputation ? “ so if your body were berlin , which part would you get rid of , ” performance artists from the gob squad theater group asked the crowd on the recent opening night of the volkspalas t festival in berlin ’ s palace of the republic , which is welcoming the public until it closes for the last time in november . the gob squad ’ s badgering of visitors highlighted the building ’ s sorry plight .
an in-your-face example of everything that was wrong with east german urban planning , it 's fatally out of fashion - and it has to go . at least , according to the bundestag . resisting the inevitable ? but it ’ s not going quietly .
plenty of people would like it to remain , at least until berlin is better able to foot the bill for its demolition . given the city ’ s € 50 billion -lrb- $ 61.2 billion -rrb- debt , it seems like a sensible solution . “ right now , the idea of rebuilding the palace is completely inappropriate , ” said dagmar richter , a german-american architecture professor and critic . ron bloch , a spokesman for volkspalast festival , agreed . “ in these times of hartz iv -lrb- controversial social welfare reforms , -rrb- the government has more urgent things to worry about than tearing down an intact building at a cost of up to € 60 million , ” he observed wryly . so why exactly did the bundestag vote to tear down the palace of the republic and erect a copy of a baroque hohenzollern palace in its place ? ideological baggage crucially , the building is not just aesthetically out of fashion , it ’ s politically passé , too . in few other cities does urban planning carry the same sort of baggage it does in berlin .
what with the german capital ’ s unusually turbulent past , architecture has a political dimension which ensures it ’ s regularly propelled into mainstream debate . “ given the many turning points in german history - 1918 , 1933 , 1945 and 1989 - architecture in germany has , without a doubt , been considerably more politicized than in other countries , ” said hartmut frank , an architect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with simone hain , formerly of east germany ’ s prestigious bauakademie , frank has curated an exhibition with the title two german architectures which opens in leipzig this week .
organized by germany 's institute for foreign relations , or ifa , it illustrates that ultimately , east and west german architecture had more in common than might have been expected . as andreas ruby wrote in the german weekly die zeit , many buildings that typify east german architecture would be considered “ characteristic and quality examples of european architecture of the post-war decades if they ’ d been built , say , in cologne . ”
the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .
since 1989 , urban planners have been acutely aware that banishing the city ’ s communist legacy is a matter of both psychological and physical transformation . the process began in the early 1990s when statues of communist heroes were unceremoniously removed and many of east berlin ’ s streets rechristened .
monuments to lenin were dismantled , marx-engels-platz became hackescher markt - and the oppressive era of socialist dictatorship became an increasingly distant memory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ architecture here is much more about politics than aesthetics , ” she said , explaining the drab , minimalist look of many 1950s east german buildings .
“ that always meant architecture had less of an opportunity to be expressive than in a highly consumerist society like the us . ” richter also pointed out that germany was and still is scarred by the overtly monumental vision of nazi architect albert speer and has shyed away from bombastic building ever since . “ what we have instead is architecture that has more of a political role in the urban fabric , ” she said , adding that it ’ s a sign of the times that the architects currently involved in redesigning the city - such as helmut jahn and hans kollhoff , the man behind the plans for the new alexanderplatz in central berlin - are famously conservative , “ corporate ” architects . retro classics worth preserving but as berliners witness the bricks and mortar traces of the soviet era slowly disappear , many have reclaimed aspects of east german architecture and design as retro classics eminently worth preserving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen years after the fall of the wall , it ’ s more than okay to have a sentimental attachment to east germany - it ’ s positively fashionable .
the party crowd is flocking to the capital ’ s hip havens of sputnik chic , with 1960s-built venues such as cafe moskau and kino kosmos enjoying unprecedented popularity . not even its new-found fans would describe it as beautiful - but if it gets a stay of execution , perhaps the day will come when even the palace of the republic is considered fashionable . two german architectures runs from sept .

an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees . the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- annual report “ education at a glance , ” published tuesday , has dealt another blow to an already stricken german education policy . the study , which compares education systems in the 30 oecd member countries , indicated that germany has a lot of work to do if it wants to produce graduates with qualifications comparable to other developed countries .
without significant educational reforms , germany could forfeit its economical competitiveness , the report warned . while oecd states increased their investments in primary and secondary schools by 21 percent and in universities by 30 percent from 1995 through 2001 , germany had only spent 6 and 7 percent more respectively , the study said .
in oecd countries , the number of college and university students increased by an average of 40 percent . but germany , austria and france experienced no growth at all . " the qualification level in the oecd states has risen dramatically since 1995 , while in germany nothing has happened , " german education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said .
the social democrat appealed to the opposition christian democratic union-run states to cooperate with the federal government to eliminate subsidies for homeowners and instead invest the money in education and research .
the lion 's share of german education funding and policy is determined at the state level . below average the study said germany spent less money than the average on each student and more on teachers ' salaries .
seven- and eight-year-old german pupils receive 160 fewer hours of lessons than the oecd average .
the discrepancy decreases in secondary schools , though 15-year-olds still get 66 hours of instruction less than the oecd midpoint .
kindergarten and primary school classes are also larger than the oecd average , which means that the children inevitably receive less individual attention aat one of the most crucial points in their education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher of the oecd “ what we have observed over time is that some countries have very dynamically expanded and extended their educational services , and in germany that kind of dynamic has been much less pronounced , " andreas schleicher , one of the study 's authors told dw-radio .
" over time , the divergence between the countries that move very fast and those that do not change is becoming bigger , ” he said . no longer the country of poets and philosophers three years ago , the oecd 's pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading , math and science when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
the assessment came as a shock to germans , who see their land as the “ country of poets and philosophers . ” education minister buhlman -lrb- photo , below -rrb- subsequently initiated a program to increase the number of all-day schools in germany , which the current report praised .
around 3,000 schools now provide full-day instruction .
but the majority of schools in germany continue to operate on a half-day basis , with lessons ending around lunchtime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn although he lauded the program , schleicher , who also coordinates the pisa study , said that all-day schools are already the norm in other oecd countries .
he focused criticism on germany 's track system , which separates students into different classes and schools depending on their achievements , thus determining whether they will gain the necessary qualifications to pursue further training or go to university after secondary school . in other countries " differences between people , between talents are not seen so much as a problem that must be resolved through school structures .
instead they deal with it constructively , " schleicher said . intensive discussion doris ahnen , the head of the education ministers ' conference , which is made up of the 16 state education ministers and senators , rebuffed the oecd criticism .
" in hardly another country has education been discussed so intensively since pisa , " bavarian public broadcaster bayerische rundfunk quoted ahnen as saying . bildunterschrift : baden-wurttemberg 's education minister , annette schavan , also dismissed the study .
" in germany there 's no lack of visions or of concrete reforms , " she said .
she accused the oecd of ignoring fundamental improvements to the education system . the gew teachers ' union demanded that the state education ministers take action to stop germany 's education system from deteriorating .

so why does it have such a bad reputation ? “ so if your body were berlin , which part would you get rid of , ” performance artists from the gob squad theater group asked the crowd on the recent opening night of the volkspalas t festival in berlin ’ s palace of the republic , which is welcoming the public until it closes for the last time in november . the gob squad ’ s badgering of visitors highlighted the building ’ s sorry plight .
an in-your-face example of everything that was wrong with east german urban planning , it 's fatally out of fashion - and it has to go . at least , according to the bundestag . resisting the inevitable ? but it ’ s not going quietly .
plenty of people would like it to remain , at least until berlin is better able to foot the bill for its demolition . given the city ’ s € 50 billion -lrb- $ 61.2 billion -rrb- debt , it seems like a sensible solution . “ right now , the idea of rebuilding the palace is completely inappropriate , ” said dagmar richter , a german-american architecture professor and critic . ron bloch , a spokesman for volkspalast festival , agreed . “ in these times of hartz iv -lrb- controversial social welfare reforms , -rrb- the government has more urgent things to worry about than tearing down an intact building at a cost of up to € 60 million , ” he observed wryly . so why exactly did the bundestag vote to tear down the palace of the republic and erect a copy of a baroque hohenzollern palace in its place ? ideological baggage crucially , the building is not just aesthetically out of fashion , it ’ s politically passé , too . in few other cities does urban planning carry the same sort of baggage it does in berlin .
what with the german capital ’ s unusually turbulent past , architecture has a political dimension which ensures it ’ s regularly propelled into mainstream debate . “ given the many turning points in german history - 1918 , 1933 , 1945 and 1989 - architecture in germany has , without a doubt , been considerably more politicized than in other countries , ” said hartmut frank , an architect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with simone hain , formerly of east germany ’ s prestigious bauakademie , frank has curated an exhibition with the title two german architectures which opens in leipzig this week .
organized by germany 's institute for foreign relations , or ifa , it illustrates that ultimately , east and west german architecture had more in common than might have been expected . as andreas ruby wrote in the german weekly die zeit , many buildings that typify east german architecture would be considered “ characteristic and quality examples of european architecture of the post-war decades if they ’ d been built , say , in cologne . ”
the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .
since 1989 , urban planners have been acutely aware that banishing the city ’ s communist legacy is a matter of both psychological and physical transformation . the process began in the early 1990s when statues of communist heroes were unceremoniously removed and many of east berlin ’ s streets rechristened .
monuments to lenin were dismantled , marx-engels-platz became hackescher markt - and the oppressive era of socialist dictatorship became an increasingly distant memory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ architecture here is much more about politics than aesthetics , ” she said , explaining the drab , minimalist look of many 1950s east german buildings .
“ that always meant architecture had less of an opportunity to be expressive than in a highly consumerist society like the us . ” richter also pointed out that germany was and still is scarred by the overtly monumental vision of nazi architect albert speer and has shyed away from bombastic building ever since . “ what we have instead is architecture that has more of a political role in the urban fabric , ” she said , adding that it ’ s a sign of the times that the architects currently involved in redesigning the city - such as helmut jahn and hans kollhoff , the man behind the plans for the new alexanderplatz in central berlin - are famously conservative , “ corporate ” architects . retro classics worth preserving but as berliners witness the bricks and mortar traces of the soviet era slowly disappear , many have reclaimed aspects of east german architecture and design as retro classics eminently worth preserving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen years after the fall of the wall , it ’ s more than okay to have a sentimental attachment to east germany - it ’ s positively fashionable .
the party crowd is flocking to the capital ’ s hip havens of sputnik chic , with 1960s-built venues such as cafe moskau and kino kosmos enjoying unprecedented popularity . not even its new-found fans would describe it as beautiful - but if it gets a stay of execution , perhaps the day will come when even the palace of the republic is considered fashionable . two german architectures runs from sept .

so why does it have such a bad reputation ? “ so if your body were berlin , which part would you get rid of , ” performance artists from the gob squad theater group asked the crowd on the recent opening night of the volkspalas t festival in berlin ’ s palace of the republic , which is welcoming the public until it closes for the last time in november . the gob squad ’ s badgering of visitors highlighted the building ’ s sorry plight .
an in-your-face example of everything that was wrong with east german urban planning , it 's fatally out of fashion - and it has to go . at least , according to the bundestag . resisting the inevitable ? but it ’ s not going quietly .
plenty of people would like it to remain , at least until berlin is better able to foot the bill for its demolition . given the city ’ s € 50 billion -lrb- $ 61.2 billion -rrb- debt , it seems like a sensible solution . “ right now , the idea of rebuilding the palace is completely inappropriate , ” said dagmar richter , a german-american architecture professor and critic . ron bloch , a spokesman for volkspalast festival , agreed . “ in these times of hartz iv -lrb- controversial social welfare reforms , -rrb- the government has more urgent things to worry about than tearing down an intact building at a cost of up to € 60 million , ” he observed wryly . so why exactly did the bundestag vote to tear down the palace of the republic and erect a copy of a baroque hohenzollern palace in its place ? ideological baggage crucially , the building is not just aesthetically out of fashion , it ’ s politically passé , too . in few other cities does urban planning carry the same sort of baggage it does in berlin .
what with the german capital ’ s unusually turbulent past , architecture has a political dimension which ensures it ’ s regularly propelled into mainstream debate . “ given the many turning points in german history - 1918 , 1933 , 1945 and 1989 - architecture in germany has , without a doubt , been considerably more politicized than in other countries , ” said hartmut frank , an architect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with simone hain , formerly of east germany ’ s prestigious bauakademie , frank has curated an exhibition with the title two german architectures which opens in leipzig this week .
organized by germany 's institute for foreign relations , or ifa , it illustrates that ultimately , east and west german architecture had more in common than might have been expected . as andreas ruby wrote in the german weekly die zeit , many buildings that typify east german architecture would be considered “ characteristic and quality examples of european architecture of the post-war decades if they ’ d been built , say , in cologne . ”
the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .
since 1989 , urban planners have been acutely aware that banishing the city ’ s communist legacy is a matter of both psychological and physical transformation . the process began in the early 1990s when statues of communist heroes were unceremoniously removed and many of east berlin ’ s streets rechristened .
monuments to lenin were dismantled , marx-engels-platz became hackescher markt - and the oppressive era of socialist dictatorship became an increasingly distant memory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ architecture here is much more about politics than aesthetics , ” she said , explaining the drab , minimalist look of many 1950s east german buildings .

so why does it have such a bad reputation ? “ so if your body were berlin , which part would you get rid of , ” performance artists from the gob squad theater group asked the crowd on the recent opening night of the volkspalas t festival in berlin ’ s palace of the republic , which is welcoming the public until it closes for the last time in november . the gob squad ’ s badgering of visitors highlighted the building ’ s sorry plight .
an in-your-face example of everything that was wrong with east german urban planning , it 's fatally out of fashion - and it has to go . at least , according to the bundestag . resisting the inevitable ? but it ’ s not going quietly .
plenty of people would like it to remain , at least until berlin is better able to foot the bill for its demolition . given the city ’ s € 50 billion -lrb- $ 61.2 billion -rrb- debt , it seems like a sensible solution . “ right now , the idea of rebuilding the palace is completely inappropriate , ” said dagmar richter , a german-american architecture professor and critic . ron bloch , a spokesman for volkspalast festival , agreed . “ in these times of hartz iv -lrb- controversial social welfare reforms , -rrb- the government has more urgent things to worry about than tearing down an intact building at a cost of up to € 60 million , ” he observed wryly . so why exactly did the bundestag vote to tear down the palace of the republic and erect a copy of a baroque hohenzollern palace in its place ? ideological baggage crucially , the building is not just aesthetically out of fashion , it ’ s politically passé , too . in few other cities does urban planning carry the same sort of baggage it does in berlin .
what with the german capital ’ s unusually turbulent past , architecture has a political dimension which ensures it ’ s regularly propelled into mainstream debate . “ given the many turning points in german history - 1918 , 1933 , 1945 and 1989 - architecture in germany has , without a doubt , been considerably more politicized than in other countries , ” said hartmut frank , an architect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with simone hain , formerly of east germany ’ s prestigious bauakademie , frank has curated an exhibition with the title two german architectures which opens in leipzig this week .
organized by germany 's institute for foreign relations , or ifa , it illustrates that ultimately , east and west german architecture had more in common than might have been expected . as andreas ruby wrote in the german weekly die zeit , many buildings that typify east german architecture would be considered “ characteristic and quality examples of european architecture of the post-war decades if they ’ d been built , say , in cologne . ”
the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .
since 1989 , urban planners have been acutely aware that banishing the city ’ s communist legacy is a matter of both psychological and physical transformation . the process began in the early 1990s when statues of communist heroes were unceremoniously removed and many of east berlin ’ s streets rechristened .
monuments to lenin were dismantled , marx-engels-platz became hackescher markt - and the oppressive era of socialist dictatorship became an increasingly distant memory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ architecture here is much more about politics than aesthetics , ” she said , explaining the drab , minimalist look of many 1950s east german buildings .
“ that always meant architecture had less of an opportunity to be expressive than in a highly consumerist society like the us . ” richter also pointed out that germany was and still is scarred by the overtly monumental vision of nazi architect albert speer and has shyed away from bombastic building ever since . “ what we have instead is architecture that has more of a political role in the urban fabric , ” she said , adding that it ’ s a sign of the times that the architects currently involved in redesigning the city - such as helmut jahn and hans kollhoff , the man behind the plans for the new alexanderplatz in central berlin - are famously conservative , “ corporate ” architects . retro classics worth preserving but as berliners witness the bricks and mortar traces of the soviet era slowly disappear , many have reclaimed aspects of east german architecture and design as retro classics eminently worth preserving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen years after the fall of the wall , it ’ s more than okay to have a sentimental attachment to east germany - it ’ s positively fashionable .
the party crowd is flocking to the capital ’ s hip havens of sputnik chic , with 1960s-built venues such as cafe moskau and kino kosmos enjoying unprecedented popularity . not even its new-found fans would describe it as beautiful - but if it gets a stay of execution , perhaps the day will come when even the palace of the republic is considered fashionable . two german architectures runs from sept .

but when it comes to a car 's performance , they would rather take a drive than get their hands dirty fixing the motor . when germany 's automobile club for women was founded back in may 1926 with seven members , cars were still something of a rarity on german streets .
the site of a woman behind the wheel was virtually unheard of - let alone the notion of a lady actually taking an avid interest in the motorized vehicles .
but the founding mothers of ddac were not discouraged .
just two years after establishing the club , the motoring women organized their first long-distance race from berlin to oberhof , in southern germany .
the competition lasted two days and covered a stretch of 750 kilometers -lrb- 466 miles -rrb- .
today , that hardly seems much of a challenge , but more than 70 years ago , just arriving at the finish line was a real accomplishment .
more often than not , a car ended up in a ditch alongside the potholed roads .
back then the women had to rely a lot more on sheer strength and driving dexterity : there was no power steering , no four-wheel drive , no suspension system to assist the early women drivers .
since then , cars have developed by leaps and bounds in terms of technology and safety .
but the members of ddac have n't lost interest in the main focus of their club : driving for fun and leisure .
driving for fun " we drive normal cars , " christa reiners , head of the ddac branch in rheinland-ruhr in western germany , told dw-world .
" from the compact class to the large family car , everything has a place in our group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women drivers are no longer a rarity whereas their male counterparts frequently spend a good bit of time tuning up their motors and outfitting their cars with the latest in computer-assisted technology , the members of ddac rarely pick up a wrench .
instead , safety is their top priority .
" it is especially important that our vehicles are in excellent working condition , " reiners said , describing the ddac 's inclinations , which do n't differ that much from the interests and concerns of the average woman driver .
" complicated repairs are dealt with at the mechanic 's workshop . "
as a result , greasy hands and overalls are less common than extended car tours across the country .
christa reiners said the relationship between the club 's members and their automobiles is " rather playful , " but nonetheless demanding .
" in keeping with the tradition of our club , we are n't primarily interested in speeding , but rather in performing difficult orientation exercises or tests of skill , " she said .
taking women drivers seriously the way women think about cars is n't just visible on the road .
when faced with purchasing a new vehicle , many of their specific interests play a key role in decision-making .
however , a recent marketing study by the vocational college of niederrhein showed that woman often feel they are not taken seriously in the sales room .
" women are frequently insecure when they buy a car and they reveal that weakness to the salesperson , " said doris kortus-schultes .
the professor and author of the study examined the buying habits and interests of more than 1,200 women drivers , including car experts , senior citizens and immigrants .
according to the study , which the german women 's automobile club supported , female drivers do n't necessarily want to see more saleswomen in the showroom , but they do want to see more emphasis placed on honesty , respect , trustworthiness and understanding when it comes to selling a car .
even after the purchase , the women interviewed said they would like to have easy-to-read instruction manuals and a personal explanation and demonstration of a car 's features .

but when it comes to a car 's performance , they would rather take a drive than get their hands dirty fixing the motor . when germany 's automobile club for women was founded back in may 1926 with seven members , cars were still something of a rarity on german streets .
the site of a woman behind the wheel was virtually unheard of - let alone the notion of a lady actually taking an avid interest in the motorized vehicles .
but the founding mothers of ddac were not discouraged .
just two years after establishing the club , the motoring women organized their first long-distance race from berlin to oberhof , in southern germany .
the competition lasted two days and covered a stretch of 750 kilometers -lrb- 466 miles -rrb- .
today , that hardly seems much of a challenge , but more than 70 years ago , just arriving at the finish line was a real accomplishment .
more often than not , a car ended up in a ditch alongside the potholed roads .
back then the women had to rely a lot more on sheer strength and driving dexterity : there was no power steering , no four-wheel drive , no suspension system to assist the early women drivers .
since then , cars have developed by leaps and bounds in terms of technology and safety .
but the members of ddac have n't lost interest in the main focus of their club : driving for fun and leisure .
driving for fun " we drive normal cars , " christa reiners , head of the ddac branch in rheinland-ruhr in western germany , told dw-world .
" from the compact class to the large family car , everything has a place in our group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women drivers are no longer a rarity whereas their male counterparts frequently spend a good bit of time tuning up their motors and outfitting their cars with the latest in computer-assisted technology , the members of ddac rarely pick up a wrench .
instead , safety is their top priority .
" it is especially important that our vehicles are in excellent working condition , " reiners said , describing the ddac 's inclinations , which do n't differ that much from the interests and concerns of the average woman driver .
" complicated repairs are dealt with at the mechanic 's workshop . "
as a result , greasy hands and overalls are less common than extended car tours across the country .
christa reiners said the relationship between the club 's members and their automobiles is " rather playful , " but nonetheless demanding .
" in keeping with the tradition of our club , we are n't primarily interested in speeding , but rather in performing difficult orientation exercises or tests of skill , " she said .
taking women drivers seriously the way women think about cars is n't just visible on the road .
when faced with purchasing a new vehicle , many of their specific interests play a key role in decision-making .
however , a recent marketing study by the vocational college of niederrhein showed that woman often feel they are not taken seriously in the sales room .
" women are frequently insecure when they buy a car and they reveal that weakness to the salesperson , " said doris kortus-schultes .
the professor and author of the study examined the buying habits and interests of more than 1,200 women drivers , including car experts , senior citizens and immigrants .
according to the study , which the german women 's automobile club supported , female drivers do n't necessarily want to see more saleswomen in the showroom , but they do want to see more emphasis placed on honesty , respect , trustworthiness and understanding when it comes to selling a car .
even after the purchase , the women interviewed said they would like to have easy-to-read instruction manuals and a personal explanation and demonstration of a car 's features .
perhaps if female drivers are taken more seriously both on and off the road , the number of women who take an interest in their cars beyond the simple transportation aspect will also grow . ingo uhlenbruch -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de why german women ca n't read maps … but can park the car only some of the clichés about german drivers are true according to a new study .

" the comment was a brutal put-down to us defence secretary donald rumsfeld , who ruffled feathers last year by lambasting france and germany and their allies as the " old " europe over their refusal to back the us-led intervention and subsequent occupation of iraq . zapatero 's surprise general election win three days after the madrid blasts led to a clean break with eight years of rightwing government under his predecessor jose maria aznar , a solid us ally who had backed the iraq conflict . aznar 's foreign policies caused a major breach in relations between madrid and most of its eu partners , with the notable exception of britain . zapatero told reporters he sees spain as belonging to " the heart of europe , " which he sees european union heavyweights france and germany as representing . ratifying a constitution " we must make a maximum effort to agree a constitution and bring it close to the peoples of europe so they can see how it affects their future and rights .
i have no doubt it will be ratified . " aside from the constitutional issue , monday 's talks also revolved around fighting terrorism and turkey 's application to join the 25-member european union , as well as deepening cooperation in the fields of defence and security . on the bulk of those issues both zapatero and schröder took their lead from chirac , the eu 's older statesman . chirac stressed that on iraq , he did not want to " sit in judgement on the position of any country , " but insisted that progress required broad international agreement . " the situation is serious and not getting any better .
i think a pandora 's box has been opened and we are not able to close it . " chirac also took the lead on discussion of eu finances , a bone of contention during aznar 's stewardship of spain when madrid rigidly stuck to the eu stability and growth pact in slashing deficits while paris and berlin exceeded the pact 's financial straitjacket . " unfortunately there are limits as to how much we can spend .
we have to be reasonable , " said chirac , who said solidarity and negotiation were the way forward in a spirit of compromise as eu aid is diverted in future to the bloc 's 10 mainly eastern european new members . " the best recipe is to be open to discussion .
there must be no brutal ruptures " of policy , said chirac , acknowledging germany 's role as the biggest contributor the state budget - and spain 's position as , to date , the prime beneficiary of eu largesse . united against terrorism on terrorism , zapatero took the lead . " terrorism is a general threat to us all and is blind , " he insisted when asked if a different approach should be adopted to different kinds of terrorism .
" the best way to deal with it is through international cooperation and the sharing of judicial and intelligence information .

2 ; on the eve of the anniversary of german reunification in 1990 . the labor market changes will hit the former communist east hardest .
unemployment there is twice that in the west and young people have been abandoning the region in droves in search of a better future . ahead of the elections in brandenburg and saxony , voters have shown increasing signs they are disenchanted with chancellor gerhard schröder 's failure to find them jobs and revitalize the euro zone 's biggest economy . opinion polls suggest they will turn to parties on both extremes of the political spectrum , heaping more pressure on schröder in the wake of several recent bad election results . divisions also appear to be surfacing between eastern and western regions , with some in the more affluent parts of the country showing open resentment to the billions in " solidarity " payments that have been made to the east since the early 1990s . presidential participation german president horst köhler , a former head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , became mired in that debate after his comments in the weekly focus magazine were perceived as encouraging an abandoning of the eastern states . " there were and there are big differences in living standards everywhere in germany .
it 's the same from north to south as it is from east to west , " köhler told the news magazine in its monday edition . " if you want to level them out , you cement in place a subsidized state and place an intolerable burden of debt on the younger generation .
we must get away from a subsidised state , " he said . his remarks won a broadside from agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast , who said : " it 's not a president 's job to say : ' take care of your problems on your own . " ' the reaction to a prominent political figure addressing the virtual taboo of social inequality was also indicative of how much progress has been made just two months before the 15th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall . " it 's the first time that a senior german politician has called into question the central doctrine of unified germany , " said the daily berliner zeitung . " equalizing living standards is one of the founding myths of the united germany , " its editorial read under the headline " köhler was right .

the proposal is seen as another example of team chief jürgen klinsmann 's growing control . despite playing host to soccer 's most prestigious event , the world cup , in 2006 , germany may not play the opening game of the tournament .
germany 's organizing committee chairman franz beckenbauer said on monday that the option to pass the honor to reigning world champions brazil , providing they qualify , was being discussed . since 1974 the world cup winners have taken to the field in the opening match and it is expected that germany will allow this tradition to continue with brazil opening the tournament on june 9 , 2006 at munich 's new allianz arena . beckenbauer also confirmed that the possibility arose from discussions held with team chief jürgen klinsmann who had expressed a preference for the hosts to start the tournament three days later at the olympic stadium in berlin than in the opening match in munich .
it is believed his reasons centered on giving his team more time to prepare . " we , at the organizing committee , do n't mind whether germany or brazil play the opening game , " beckenbauer told german sports television channel dsf .
" we would have liked germany to start with a highlight but the brazil solution would not be bad either , " he added . team manager oliver bierhoff seemed to be more definite in his view . " we will step aside for brazil , " he told the german news agency dpa .

klinsmann , who was appointed in july , has also been stamping his identity on other areas of the world cup 2006 plan by informing the organizing committee that he was against the idea of having germany 's training camp in leverkusen , which he felt was not practical . the plan to have the camp in leverkusen was agreed when klinsmann 's predecessor rudi völler was still in charge and was seen as compensation after the city 's bid to stage games of the 2006 finals was turned down because its stadium was too small . " he -lrb- klinsmann -rrb- has the right to refuse what rudi völler found correct and to have the team training somewhere else , " beckenbauer said . leverkusen anger over dfb reverse this could cause problems for the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
chemical giant bayer ag , leverkusen 's main sponsor , is accusing the dfb of breach of contract after they invested time and money in bringing the 2006 world cup to germany . bayer ag sports director meinolf sprink accused klinsmann and the dfb of lacking style in making the change , as well as breach of contract . " we have a clear written agreement .
i think it 's sad that we found this out through the press , " sprink told the ap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer calmund is angry over what he sees as a u-turn by the dfb over their world cup agreement .
" i think the dfb have forgotten what leverkusen and the bayer group have done to advertise this world cup , " raged leverkusen 's former general manager reiner calmund . " we are aware the promises have been made to leverkusen , " bierhoff said .

" we would have liked germany to start with a highlight but the brazil solution would not be bad either , " he added . team manager oliver bierhoff seemed to be more definite in his view . " we will step aside for brazil , " he told the german news agency dpa .

klinsmann , who was appointed in july , has also been stamping his identity on other areas of the world cup 2006 plan by informing the organizing committee that he was against the idea of having germany 's training camp in leverkusen , which he felt was not practical . the plan to have the camp in leverkusen was agreed when klinsmann 's predecessor rudi völler was still in charge and was seen as compensation after the city 's bid to stage games of the 2006 finals was turned down because its stadium was too small . " he -lrb- klinsmann -rrb- has the right to refuse what rudi völler found correct and to have the team training somewhere else , " beckenbauer said . leverkusen anger over dfb reverse this could cause problems for the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .

" made in germany " may soon be outdated . it 's an open secret that german carmakers are frustrated with high wages , employee benefits and inflexible working conditions , and that many are considering a move as a way out of the dilemma .
many in the sector have already set up manufacturing facilities abroad where wages and production costs are considerably lower than back home .
nearly every third german car supplier is already producing in eastern europe , and every sixth one has already set up sites in china .
but that 's only the beginning : every second automobile parts manufacturer is planning to move its production facilities outside of germany , according to a study published by the business consultancy firm ernst & young on monday .
looking to the east and far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturing in china - cheap and efficient .
the stuttgart-based business consultancy surveyed 200 german car suppliers with an annual turnover of between € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.12 million -rrb- and € 500 million .
nearly every second company had already established at least one production site abroad , and almost 40 percent of those questioned said they had concrete plans for shifting parts of their production to eastern europe .
some 23 percent , or close to one-fourth of all suppliers , said they planned to invest in china .
peter fuss , one of the authors of the ernst & young study said that various factors played a role in a company 's decision to move production outside germany .
whereas eastern europe attracts car companies primarily because of the low wages , he said china is particularly interesting because of its proximity to the growing asian market .
" logistical costs can be kept low because companies produce for the local market and parts do n't have to be shipped from western europe to china , " he said .
expanding exodus in a worldwide comparison of production sites , china and the czech republic topped the list , followed by hungary and poland .
both regions , china and eastern europe received top marks for car suppliers for low wage costs -lrb- 15 to 20 percent less than the hourly wage in germany -rrb- and in terms of flexibility and motivation of employees .
tax breaks and benefits for investing in industrially weak regions - aspects frequently criticized as unfair advantages by western european politicians - hardly played a role at all in the decision to move production outside of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes slk production in bremen according to ernst & young , fewer and fewer new manufacturing sites will be opened in western europe in the future .
while more factories close in germany and its neighboring western countries , the move east will not be limited to just the production of parts .
" over time things will develop , " fuss said .
" the companies interviewed in the survey clearly indicated that they are planning to move final assembly stages to eastern europe and china in the near future . "
that would mean that more complicated manufacturing processes - up to now largely based in germany would be affected by the outsourcing .
is germany 's auto industry at risk ?
the ernst & young study concluded that germany 's long tradition as a center of auto manufacturing is indeed in danger as more and more companies pack up and leave in search of better conditions abroad .
at the same time , the move abroad represents " the last chance the companies have to reduce costs and remain competitive in the international market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20 million vw golfs have rolled off the assembly line at the carmaker 's headquarters in wolfsburg but the study also said that although manufacturing will move , germany will continue to hold on to its claim as a nation of carmakers in the fields of branding - the label " made in germany " will still hold sway over car buyers - and in the critical area of research and development .
however , in order to capitalize on these strengths in the future , it will be crucial to identify innovative companies in these fields and promote them internationally , fuss said .
the threat of moving east is not necessarily connected to the loss of jobs , the study reported , with a view to the country 's rising unemployment rate .
" within the last few years there has been a considerable increase in the number of companies moving production to eastern europe and china , " fuss said .
" but during that same time there has also been an increase in jobs in the car sector in germany . "
the key to guaranteeing that those jobs remain in germany in the future , is to focus more on innovation , design , research and development , he added . rolf wenkel -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 30,000 jobs on line at volkswagen europe 's biggest carmaker said 30,000 jobs could be cut in germany if unions do not agree to cost-cutting plans .
volkswagen is pushing for a wage freeze and more flexibility in working hours to counteract falling sales .
-lrb- sept .

but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created .

" made in germany " may soon be outdated . it 's an open secret that german carmakers are frustrated with high wages , employee benefits and inflexible working conditions , and that many are considering a move as a way out of the dilemma .
many in the sector have already set up manufacturing facilities abroad where wages and production costs are considerably lower than back home .
nearly every third german car supplier is already producing in eastern europe , and every sixth one has already set up sites in china .
but that 's only the beginning : every second automobile parts manufacturer is planning to move its production facilities outside of germany , according to a study published by the business consultancy firm ernst & young on monday .
looking to the east and far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturing in china - cheap and efficient .
the stuttgart-based business consultancy surveyed 200 german car suppliers with an annual turnover of between € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.12 million -rrb- and € 500 million .
nearly every second company had already established at least one production site abroad , and almost 40 percent of those questioned said they had concrete plans for shifting parts of their production to eastern europe .
some 23 percent , or close to one-fourth of all suppliers , said they planned to invest in china .
peter fuss , one of the authors of the ernst & young study said that various factors played a role in a company 's decision to move production outside germany .
whereas eastern europe attracts car companies primarily because of the low wages , he said china is particularly interesting because of its proximity to the growing asian market .
" logistical costs can be kept low because companies produce for the local market and parts do n't have to be shipped from western europe to china , " he said .
expanding exodus in a worldwide comparison of production sites , china and the czech republic topped the list , followed by hungary and poland .
both regions , china and eastern europe received top marks for car suppliers for low wage costs -lrb- 15 to 20 percent less than the hourly wage in germany -rrb- and in terms of flexibility and motivation of employees .
tax breaks and benefits for investing in industrially weak regions - aspects frequently criticized as unfair advantages by western european politicians - hardly played a role at all in the decision to move production outside of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes slk production in bremen according to ernst & young , fewer and fewer new manufacturing sites will be opened in western europe in the future .
while more factories close in germany and its neighboring western countries , the move east will not be limited to just the production of parts .
" over time things will develop , " fuss said .
" the companies interviewed in the survey clearly indicated that they are planning to move final assembly stages to eastern europe and china in the near future . "
that would mean that more complicated manufacturing processes - up to now largely based in germany would be affected by the outsourcing .
is germany 's auto industry at risk ?
the ernst & young study concluded that germany 's long tradition as a center of auto manufacturing is indeed in danger as more and more companies pack up and leave in search of better conditions abroad .
at the same time , the move abroad represents " the last chance the companies have to reduce costs and remain competitive in the international market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20 million vw golfs have rolled off the assembly line at the carmaker 's headquarters in wolfsburg but the study also said that although manufacturing will move , germany will continue to hold on to its claim as a nation of carmakers in the fields of branding - the label " made in germany " will still hold sway over car buyers - and in the critical area of research and development .
however , in order to capitalize on these strengths in the future , it will be crucial to identify innovative companies in these fields and promote them internationally , fuss said .
the threat of moving east is not necessarily connected to the loss of jobs , the study reported , with a view to the country 's rising unemployment rate .
" within the last few years there has been a considerable increase in the number of companies moving production to eastern europe and china , " fuss said .
" but during that same time there has also been an increase in jobs in the car sector in germany . "

" made in germany " may soon be outdated . it 's an open secret that german carmakers are frustrated with high wages , employee benefits and inflexible working conditions , and that many are considering a move as a way out of the dilemma .
many in the sector have already set up manufacturing facilities abroad where wages and production costs are considerably lower than back home .
nearly every third german car supplier is already producing in eastern europe , and every sixth one has already set up sites in china .
but that 's only the beginning : every second automobile parts manufacturer is planning to move its production facilities outside of germany , according to a study published by the business consultancy firm ernst & young on monday .
looking to the east and far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturing in china - cheap and efficient .
the stuttgart-based business consultancy surveyed 200 german car suppliers with an annual turnover of between € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.12 million -rrb- and € 500 million .
nearly every second company had already established at least one production site abroad , and almost 40 percent of those questioned said they had concrete plans for shifting parts of their production to eastern europe .
some 23 percent , or close to one-fourth of all suppliers , said they planned to invest in china .
peter fuss , one of the authors of the ernst & young study said that various factors played a role in a company 's decision to move production outside germany .
whereas eastern europe attracts car companies primarily because of the low wages , he said china is particularly interesting because of its proximity to the growing asian market .
" logistical costs can be kept low because companies produce for the local market and parts do n't have to be shipped from western europe to china , " he said .
expanding exodus in a worldwide comparison of production sites , china and the czech republic topped the list , followed by hungary and poland .
both regions , china and eastern europe received top marks for car suppliers for low wage costs -lrb- 15 to 20 percent less than the hourly wage in germany -rrb- and in terms of flexibility and motivation of employees .
tax breaks and benefits for investing in industrially weak regions - aspects frequently criticized as unfair advantages by western european politicians - hardly played a role at all in the decision to move production outside of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes slk production in bremen according to ernst & young , fewer and fewer new manufacturing sites will be opened in western europe in the future .
while more factories close in germany and its neighboring western countries , the move east will not be limited to just the production of parts .
" over time things will develop , " fuss said .
" the companies interviewed in the survey clearly indicated that they are planning to move final assembly stages to eastern europe and china in the near future . "
that would mean that more complicated manufacturing processes - up to now largely based in germany would be affected by the outsourcing .
is germany 's auto industry at risk ?
the ernst & young study concluded that germany 's long tradition as a center of auto manufacturing is indeed in danger as more and more companies pack up and leave in search of better conditions abroad .
at the same time , the move abroad represents " the last chance the companies have to reduce costs and remain competitive in the international market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20 million vw golfs have rolled off the assembly line at the carmaker 's headquarters in wolfsburg but the study also said that although manufacturing will move , germany will continue to hold on to its claim as a nation of carmakers in the fields of branding - the label " made in germany " will still hold sway over car buyers - and in the critical area of research and development .
however , in order to capitalize on these strengths in the future , it will be crucial to identify innovative companies in these fields and promote them internationally , fuss said .
the threat of moving east is not necessarily connected to the loss of jobs , the study reported , with a view to the country 's rising unemployment rate .
" within the last few years there has been a considerable increase in the number of companies moving production to eastern europe and china , " fuss said .
" but during that same time there has also been an increase in jobs in the car sector in germany . "
the key to guaranteeing that those jobs remain in germany in the future , is to focus more on innovation , design , research and development , he added . rolf wenkel -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 30,000 jobs on line at volkswagen europe 's biggest carmaker said 30,000 jobs could be cut in germany if unions do not agree to cost-cutting plans .

an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees . the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- annual report “ education at a glance , ” published tuesday , has dealt another blow to an already stricken german education policy . the study , which compares education systems in the 30 oecd member countries , indicated that germany has a lot of work to do if it wants to produce graduates with qualifications comparable to other developed countries .
without significant educational reforms , germany could forfeit its economical competitiveness , the report warned . while oecd states increased their investments in primary and secondary schools by 21 percent and in universities by 30 percent from 1995 through 2001 , germany had only spent 6 and 7 percent more respectively , the study said .
in oecd countries , the number of college and university students increased by an average of 40 percent . but germany , austria and france experienced no growth at all . " the qualification level in the oecd states has risen dramatically since 1995 , while in germany nothing has happened , " german education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said .
the social democrat appealed to the opposition christian democratic union-run states to cooperate with the federal government to eliminate subsidies for homeowners and instead invest the money in education and research .
the lion 's share of german education funding and policy is determined at the state level . below average the study said germany spent less money than the average on each student and more on teachers ' salaries .
seven- and eight-year-old german pupils receive 160 fewer hours of lessons than the oecd average .
the discrepancy decreases in secondary schools , though 15-year-olds still get 66 hours of instruction less than the oecd midpoint .
kindergarten and primary school classes are also larger than the oecd average , which means that the children inevitably receive less individual attention aat one of the most crucial points in their education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher of the oecd “ what we have observed over time is that some countries have very dynamically expanded and extended their educational services , and in germany that kind of dynamic has been much less pronounced , " andreas schleicher , one of the study 's authors told dw-radio .
" over time , the divergence between the countries that move very fast and those that do not change is becoming bigger , ” he said . no longer the country of poets and philosophers three years ago , the oecd 's pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading , math and science when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
the assessment came as a shock to germans , who see their land as the “ country of poets and philosophers . ” education minister buhlman -lrb- photo , below -rrb- subsequently initiated a program to increase the number of all-day schools in germany , which the current report praised .
around 3,000 schools now provide full-day instruction .
but the majority of schools in germany continue to operate on a half-day basis , with lessons ending around lunchtime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn although he lauded the program , schleicher , who also coordinates the pisa study , said that all-day schools are already the norm in other oecd countries .
he focused criticism on germany 's track system , which separates students into different classes and schools depending on their achievements , thus determining whether they will gain the necessary qualifications to pursue further training or go to university after secondary school . in other countries " differences between people , between talents are not seen so much as a problem that must be resolved through school structures .
instead they deal with it constructively , " schleicher said . intensive discussion doris ahnen , the head of the education ministers ' conference , which is made up of the 16 state education ministers and senators , rebuffed the oecd criticism .
" in hardly another country has education been discussed so intensively since pisa , " bavarian public broadcaster bayerische rundfunk quoted ahnen as saying . bildunterschrift : baden-wurttemberg 's education minister , annette schavan , also dismissed the study .
" in germany there 's no lack of visions or of concrete reforms , " she said .
she accused the oecd of ignoring fundamental improvements to the education system . the gew teachers ' union demanded that the state education ministers take action to stop germany 's education system from deteriorating .
" the federal sectionalism of the states promotes germany 's further relegation , " gew head eva-marie stange said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting brain gain for german universities leading german education experts have called for more autonomy for german universities to improve competitiveness on an international level .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.09.2004 turkey backs down on adultery law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while erdogan -lrb- left -rrb- was away , his deputy , gül , cleared the air under huge pressure from the european union , turkey back-pedaled away from a bill to re-criminalize adultery on tuesday . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , who over the past few days repeatedly spoke out in favor of re-criminalizing adultery , was far away in tajikistan when his colleagues announced the u-turn .
parliament had already started debating the issue , as foreign minister abdullah gül pulled aside the opposition leader for a brief exchange . the upshot was that party consensus was too important to waste on such a trifle . " parliament achieved this .
i thank the opposition for that and our -lrb- justice and development -rrb- ak-party , " justice minister cemil cicek said after announcing the decision .
" this is the image that turkey has always wished for .
this consensus is perhaps even more important than the new penal code itself . "
consensus above all formally , parliament concluded that changes to the new penal code would only be made after a consensus had been reached .
in effect , it meant that the islamic-conservative governing party would give up on making adultery a crime , a move that was supposed to appeal to the party 's provincial supporters . on monday , tourism minister erkan mumcu was the first cabinet member to distance himself from the law - probably fearing empty hotel rooms next summer .
by tuesday morning , even " regular " parliamentarians were reluctant to support the plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish and the european union flags but neither better judgment nor domestic criticism from the press and women 's groups tipped the scales .
instead , the decisive factor was most likely the warnings emanating from western europe .
parliamentarians familiar with eu law have sheepishly said as much . " the timing may not have been the best , " said yasar yakis , who leads the turkish parliament 's eu commission .
" that 's what many people in europe told us . " more than timing the timing was n't the only problem .
belgian foreign minister karel de gucht warned ankara on sunday that such a law would be a " serious obstacle " to turkey 's bid to join the european union .
in early october , the european commission is set to offer its assessment on whether to start accession talks with turkey , and eu government leaders will decide whether or not to set a date to begin negotiations in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josep borrell of spain although the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- does not formally play a roll in the decision , ep president josep borrell -lrb- photo -rrb- announced on tuesday that the body would compile its own report on whether turkey should join the bloc .
" it would … be a mistake if we did n't speak out on this issue , " borrell said .

" made in germany " may soon be outdated . it 's an open secret that german carmakers are frustrated with high wages , employee benefits and inflexible working conditions , and that many are considering a move as a way out of the dilemma .
many in the sector have already set up manufacturing facilities abroad where wages and production costs are considerably lower than back home .
nearly every third german car supplier is already producing in eastern europe , and every sixth one has already set up sites in china .
but that 's only the beginning : every second automobile parts manufacturer is planning to move its production facilities outside of germany , according to a study published by the business consultancy firm ernst & young on monday .
looking to the east and far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturing in china - cheap and efficient .
the stuttgart-based business consultancy surveyed 200 german car suppliers with an annual turnover of between € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.12 million -rrb- and € 500 million .
nearly every second company had already established at least one production site abroad , and almost 40 percent of those questioned said they had concrete plans for shifting parts of their production to eastern europe .
some 23 percent , or close to one-fourth of all suppliers , said they planned to invest in china .
peter fuss , one of the authors of the ernst & young study said that various factors played a role in a company 's decision to move production outside germany .
whereas eastern europe attracts car companies primarily because of the low wages , he said china is particularly interesting because of its proximity to the growing asian market .
" logistical costs can be kept low because companies produce for the local market and parts do n't have to be shipped from western europe to china , " he said .
expanding exodus in a worldwide comparison of production sites , china and the czech republic topped the list , followed by hungary and poland .
both regions , china and eastern europe received top marks for car suppliers for low wage costs -lrb- 15 to 20 percent less than the hourly wage in germany -rrb- and in terms of flexibility and motivation of employees .
tax breaks and benefits for investing in industrially weak regions - aspects frequently criticized as unfair advantages by western european politicians - hardly played a role at all in the decision to move production outside of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes slk production in bremen according to ernst & young , fewer and fewer new manufacturing sites will be opened in western europe in the future .
while more factories close in germany and its neighboring western countries , the move east will not be limited to just the production of parts .
" over time things will develop , " fuss said .
" the companies interviewed in the survey clearly indicated that they are planning to move final assembly stages to eastern europe and china in the near future . "
that would mean that more complicated manufacturing processes - up to now largely based in germany would be affected by the outsourcing .
is germany 's auto industry at risk ?
the ernst & young study concluded that germany 's long tradition as a center of auto manufacturing is indeed in danger as more and more companies pack up and leave in search of better conditions abroad .
at the same time , the move abroad represents " the last chance the companies have to reduce costs and remain competitive in the international market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20 million vw golfs have rolled off the assembly line at the carmaker 's headquarters in wolfsburg but the study also said that although manufacturing will move , germany will continue to hold on to its claim as a nation of carmakers in the fields of branding - the label " made in germany " will still hold sway over car buyers - and in the critical area of research and development .
however , in order to capitalize on these strengths in the future , it will be crucial to identify innovative companies in these fields and promote them internationally , fuss said .
the threat of moving east is not necessarily connected to the loss of jobs , the study reported , with a view to the country 's rising unemployment rate .
" within the last few years there has been a considerable increase in the number of companies moving production to eastern europe and china , " fuss said .
" but during that same time there has also been an increase in jobs in the car sector in germany . "
the key to guaranteeing that those jobs remain in germany in the future , is to focus more on innovation , design , research and development , he added . rolf wenkel -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 30,000 jobs on line at volkswagen europe 's biggest carmaker said 30,000 jobs could be cut in germany if unions do not agree to cost-cutting plans .

not only will the huge numbers of oktoberfest visitors be partaking of the finest beers , bavarian cuisine and entertainment at the world 's biggest beer festival , they may even be improving their health while doing so . a recent study by the university of heidelberg has revealed that drinking a " moderate " amount of alcohol can boost the recovery of patients who have had heart surgery and can help stave off cardiac episodes for those who have not . men who drank about six or more units a week after surgery to open blocked arteries were less likely to have renewed furring up of their arteries , according to the study published in the health journal heart this week .
they were also half as likely to need repeated unclogging surgery as men who drank little or no alcohol . the report also contains evidence that suggests people who drink about one unit a day have a lower risk of heart attack , chronic heart trouble or sudden coronary death than heavier drinkers or those who do not drink at all .

nearly every third german car supplier is already producing in eastern europe , and every sixth one has already set up sites in china .

looking to the east and far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturing in china - cheap and efficient .
the stuttgart-based business consultancy surveyed 200 german car suppliers with an annual turnover of between € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.12 million -rrb- and € 500 million .
nearly every second company had already established at least one production site abroad , and almost 40 percent of those questioned said they had concrete plans for shifting parts of their production to eastern europe .
some 23 percent , or close to one-fourth of all suppliers , said they planned to invest in china .
peter fuss , one of the authors of the ernst & young study said that various factors played a role in a company 's decision to move production outside germany .
whereas eastern europe attracts car companies primarily because of the low wages , he said china is particularly interesting because of its proximity to the growing asian market .

but when it comes to a car 's performance , they would rather take a drive than get their hands dirty fixing the motor . when germany 's automobile club for women was founded back in may 1926 with seven members , cars were still something of a rarity on german streets .
the site of a woman behind the wheel was virtually unheard of - let alone the notion of a lady actually taking an avid interest in the motorized vehicles .
but the founding mothers of ddac were not discouraged .
just two years after establishing the club , the motoring women organized their first long-distance race from berlin to oberhof , in southern germany .
the competition lasted two days and covered a stretch of 750 kilometers -lrb- 466 miles -rrb- .
today , that hardly seems much of a challenge , but more than 70 years ago , just arriving at the finish line was a real accomplishment .
more often than not , a car ended up in a ditch alongside the potholed roads .
back then the women had to rely a lot more on sheer strength and driving dexterity : there was no power steering , no four-wheel drive , no suspension system to assist the early women drivers .
since then , cars have developed by leaps and bounds in terms of technology and safety .
but the members of ddac have n't lost interest in the main focus of their club : driving for fun and leisure .
driving for fun " we drive normal cars , " christa reiners , head of the ddac branch in rheinland-ruhr in western germany , told dw-world .
" from the compact class to the large family car , everything has a place in our group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women drivers are no longer a rarity whereas their male counterparts frequently spend a good bit of time tuning up their motors and outfitting their cars with the latest in computer-assisted technology , the members of ddac rarely pick up a wrench .
instead , safety is their top priority .
" it is especially important that our vehicles are in excellent working condition , " reiners said , describing the ddac 's inclinations , which do n't differ that much from the interests and concerns of the average woman driver .
" complicated repairs are dealt with at the mechanic 's workshop . "
as a result , greasy hands and overalls are less common than extended car tours across the country .
christa reiners said the relationship between the club 's members and their automobiles is " rather playful , " but nonetheless demanding .
" in keeping with the tradition of our club , we are n't primarily interested in speeding , but rather in performing difficult orientation exercises or tests of skill , " she said .
taking women drivers seriously the way women think about cars is n't just visible on the road .
when faced with purchasing a new vehicle , many of their specific interests play a key role in decision-making .
however , a recent marketing study by the vocational college of niederrhein showed that woman often feel they are not taken seriously in the sales room .
" women are frequently insecure when they buy a car and they reveal that weakness to the salesperson , " said doris kortus-schultes .
the professor and author of the study examined the buying habits and interests of more than 1,200 women drivers , including car experts , senior citizens and immigrants .
according to the study , which the german women 's automobile club supported , female drivers do n't necessarily want to see more saleswomen in the showroom , but they do want to see more emphasis placed on honesty , respect , trustworthiness and understanding when it comes to selling a car .
even after the purchase , the women interviewed said they would like to have easy-to-read instruction manuals and a personal explanation and demonstration of a car 's features .
perhaps if female drivers are taken more seriously both on and off the road , the number of women who take an interest in their cars beyond the simple transportation aspect will also grow . ingo uhlenbruch -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de why german women ca n't read maps … but can park the car only some of the clichés about german drivers are true according to a new study .

so why does it have such a bad reputation ? “ so if your body were berlin , which part would you get rid of , ” performance artists from the gob squad theater group asked the crowd on the recent opening night of the volkspalas t festival in berlin ’ s palace of the republic , which is welcoming the public until it closes for the last time in november . the gob squad ’ s badgering of visitors highlighted the building ’ s sorry plight .
an in-your-face example of everything that was wrong with east german urban planning , it 's fatally out of fashion - and it has to go . at least , according to the bundestag . resisting the inevitable ? but it ’ s not going quietly .
plenty of people would like it to remain , at least until berlin is better able to foot the bill for its demolition . given the city ’ s € 50 billion -lrb- $ 61.2 billion -rrb- debt , it seems like a sensible solution . “ right now , the idea of rebuilding the palace is completely inappropriate , ” said dagmar richter , a german-american architecture professor and critic . ron bloch , a spokesman for volkspalast festival , agreed . “ in these times of hartz iv -lrb- controversial social welfare reforms , -rrb- the government has more urgent things to worry about than tearing down an intact building at a cost of up to € 60 million , ” he observed wryly . so why exactly did the bundestag vote to tear down the palace of the republic and erect a copy of a baroque hohenzollern palace in its place ? ideological baggage crucially , the building is not just aesthetically out of fashion , it ’ s politically passé , too . in few other cities does urban planning carry the same sort of baggage it does in berlin .
what with the german capital ’ s unusually turbulent past , architecture has a political dimension which ensures it ’ s regularly propelled into mainstream debate . “ given the many turning points in german history - 1918 , 1933 , 1945 and 1989 - architecture in germany has , without a doubt , been considerably more politicized than in other countries , ” said hartmut frank , an architect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with simone hain , formerly of east germany ’ s prestigious bauakademie , frank has curated an exhibition with the title two german architectures which opens in leipzig this week .
organized by germany 's institute for foreign relations , or ifa , it illustrates that ultimately , east and west german architecture had more in common than might have been expected . as andreas ruby wrote in the german weekly die zeit , many buildings that typify east german architecture would be considered “ characteristic and quality examples of european architecture of the post-war decades if they ’ d been built , say , in cologne . ”
the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .
since 1989 , urban planners have been acutely aware that banishing the city ’ s communist legacy is a matter of both psychological and physical transformation . the process began in the early 1990s when statues of communist heroes were unceremoniously removed and many of east berlin ’ s streets rechristened .
monuments to lenin were dismantled , marx-engels-platz became hackescher markt - and the oppressive era of socialist dictatorship became an increasingly distant memory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ architecture here is much more about politics than aesthetics , ” she said , explaining the drab , minimalist look of many 1950s east german buildings .
“ that always meant architecture had less of an opportunity to be expressive than in a highly consumerist society like the us . ” richter also pointed out that germany was and still is scarred by the overtly monumental vision of nazi architect albert speer and has shyed away from bombastic building ever since . “ what we have instead is architecture that has more of a political role in the urban fabric , ” she said , adding that it ’ s a sign of the times that the architects currently involved in redesigning the city - such as helmut jahn and hans kollhoff , the man behind the plans for the new alexanderplatz in central berlin - are famously conservative , “ corporate ” architects . retro classics worth preserving but as berliners witness the bricks and mortar traces of the soviet era slowly disappear , many have reclaimed aspects of east german architecture and design as retro classics eminently worth preserving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen years after the fall of the wall , it ’ s more than okay to have a sentimental attachment to east germany - it ’ s positively fashionable .
the party crowd is flocking to the capital ’ s hip havens of sputnik chic , with 1960s-built venues such as cafe moskau and kino kosmos enjoying unprecedented popularity . not even its new-found fans would describe it as beautiful - but if it gets a stay of execution , perhaps the day will come when even the palace of the republic is considered fashionable . two german architectures runs from sept .

so why does it have such a bad reputation ? “ so if your body were berlin , which part would you get rid of , ” performance artists from the gob squad theater group asked the crowd on the recent opening night of the volkspalas t festival in berlin ’ s palace of the republic , which is welcoming the public until it closes for the last time in november . the gob squad ’ s badgering of visitors highlighted the building ’ s sorry plight .
an in-your-face example of everything that was wrong with east german urban planning , it 's fatally out of fashion - and it has to go . at least , according to the bundestag . resisting the inevitable ? but it ’ s not going quietly .
plenty of people would like it to remain , at least until berlin is better able to foot the bill for its demolition . given the city ’ s € 50 billion -lrb- $ 61.2 billion -rrb- debt , it seems like a sensible solution . “ right now , the idea of rebuilding the palace is completely inappropriate , ” said dagmar richter , a german-american architecture professor and critic . ron bloch , a spokesman for volkspalast festival , agreed . “ in these times of hartz iv -lrb- controversial social welfare reforms , -rrb- the government has more urgent things to worry about than tearing down an intact building at a cost of up to € 60 million , ” he observed wryly . so why exactly did the bundestag vote to tear down the palace of the republic and erect a copy of a baroque hohenzollern palace in its place ? ideological baggage crucially , the building is not just aesthetically out of fashion , it ’ s politically passé , too . in few other cities does urban planning carry the same sort of baggage it does in berlin .
what with the german capital ’ s unusually turbulent past , architecture has a political dimension which ensures it ’ s regularly propelled into mainstream debate . “ given the many turning points in german history - 1918 , 1933 , 1945 and 1989 - architecture in germany has , without a doubt , been considerably more politicized than in other countries , ” said hartmut frank , an architect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with simone hain , formerly of east germany ’ s prestigious bauakademie , frank has curated an exhibition with the title two german architectures which opens in leipzig this week .
organized by germany 's institute for foreign relations , or ifa , it illustrates that ultimately , east and west german architecture had more in common than might have been expected . as andreas ruby wrote in the german weekly die zeit , many buildings that typify east german architecture would be considered “ characteristic and quality examples of european architecture of the post-war decades if they ’ d been built , say , in cologne . ”
the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .
since 1989 , urban planners have been acutely aware that banishing the city ’ s communist legacy is a matter of both psychological and physical transformation . the process began in the early 1990s when statues of communist heroes were unceremoniously removed and many of east berlin ’ s streets rechristened .
monuments to lenin were dismantled , marx-engels-platz became hackescher markt - and the oppressive era of socialist dictatorship became an increasingly distant memory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ architecture here is much more about politics than aesthetics , ” she said , explaining the drab , minimalist look of many 1950s east german buildings .
“ that always meant architecture had less of an opportunity to be expressive than in a highly consumerist society like the us . ” richter also pointed out that germany was and still is scarred by the overtly monumental vision of nazi architect albert speer and has shyed away from bombastic building ever since . “ what we have instead is architecture that has more of a political role in the urban fabric , ” she said , adding that it ’ s a sign of the times that the architects currently involved in redesigning the city - such as helmut jahn and hans kollhoff , the man behind the plans for the new alexanderplatz in central berlin - are famously conservative , “ corporate ” architects . retro classics worth preserving but as berliners witness the bricks and mortar traces of the soviet era slowly disappear , many have reclaimed aspects of east german architecture and design as retro classics eminently worth preserving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen years after the fall of the wall , it ’ s more than okay to have a sentimental attachment to east germany - it ’ s positively fashionable .
the party crowd is flocking to the capital ’ s hip havens of sputnik chic , with 1960s-built venues such as cafe moskau and kino kosmos enjoying unprecedented popularity . not even its new-found fans would describe it as beautiful - but if it gets a stay of execution , perhaps the day will come when even the palace of the republic is considered fashionable . two german architectures runs from sept .

the proposal is seen as another example of team chief jürgen klinsmann 's growing control . despite playing host to soccer 's most prestigious event , the world cup , in 2006 , germany may not play the opening game of the tournament .
germany 's organizing committee chairman franz beckenbauer said on monday that the option to pass the honor to reigning world champions brazil , providing they qualify , was being discussed . since 1974 the world cup winners have taken to the field in the opening match and it is expected that germany will allow this tradition to continue with brazil opening the tournament on june 9 , 2006 at munich 's new allianz arena . beckenbauer also confirmed that the possibility arose from discussions held with team chief jürgen klinsmann who had expressed a preference for the hosts to start the tournament three days later at the olympic stadium in berlin than in the opening match in munich .
it is believed his reasons centered on giving his team more time to prepare . " we , at the organizing committee , do n't mind whether germany or brazil play the opening game , " beckenbauer told german sports television channel dsf .
" we would have liked germany to start with a highlight but the brazil solution would not be bad either , " he added . team manager oliver bierhoff seemed to be more definite in his view . " we will step aside for brazil , " he told the german news agency dpa .
" the reigning champions can open the world cup . " there has yet to be any official word on the decision . klinsmann exerting influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann is said to be getting his own way through strong words and deeds .
klinsmann , who was appointed in july , has also been stamping his identity on other areas of the world cup 2006 plan by informing the organizing committee that he was against the idea of having germany 's training camp in leverkusen , which he felt was not practical . the plan to have the camp in leverkusen was agreed when klinsmann 's predecessor rudi völler was still in charge and was seen as compensation after the city 's bid to stage games of the 2006 finals was turned down because its stadium was too small . " he -lrb- klinsmann -rrb- has the right to refuse what rudi völler found correct and to have the team training somewhere else , " beckenbauer said . leverkusen anger over dfb reverse this could cause problems for the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
chemical giant bayer ag , leverkusen 's main sponsor , is accusing the dfb of breach of contract after they invested time and money in bringing the 2006 world cup to germany . bayer ag sports director meinolf sprink accused klinsmann and the dfb of lacking style in making the change , as well as breach of contract . " we have a clear written agreement .
i think it 's sad that we found this out through the press , " sprink told the ap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer calmund is angry over what he sees as a u-turn by the dfb over their world cup agreement .
" i think the dfb have forgotten what leverkusen and the bayer group have done to advertise this world cup , " raged leverkusen 's former general manager reiner calmund . " we are aware the promises have been made to leverkusen , " bierhoff said .
" but the situation is not optimal .
not because of leverkusen 's stadium , but because of the distance between the hotel and stadium .

not only will the huge numbers of oktoberfest visitors be partaking of the finest beers , bavarian cuisine and entertainment at the world 's biggest beer festival , they may even be improving their health while doing so . a recent study by the university of heidelberg has revealed that drinking a " moderate " amount of alcohol can boost the recovery of patients who have had heart surgery and can help stave off cardiac episodes for those who have not . men who drank about six or more units a week after surgery to open blocked arteries were less likely to have renewed furring up of their arteries , according to the study published in the health journal heart this week .
they were also half as likely to need repeated unclogging surgery as men who drank little or no alcohol . the report also contains evidence that suggests people who drink about one unit a day have a lower risk of heart attack , chronic heart trouble or sudden coronary death than heavier drinkers or those who do not drink at all .

but there are words of caution in the beery air .

so why does it have such a bad reputation ? “ so if your body were berlin , which part would you get rid of , ” performance artists from the gob squad theater group asked the crowd on the recent opening night of the volkspalas t festival in berlin ’ s palace of the republic , which is welcoming the public until it closes for the last time in november . the gob squad ’ s badgering of visitors highlighted the building ’ s sorry plight .
an in-your-face example of everything that was wrong with east german urban planning , it 's fatally out of fashion - and it has to go . at least , according to the bundestag . resisting the inevitable ? but it ’ s not going quietly .
plenty of people would like it to remain , at least until berlin is better able to foot the bill for its demolition . given the city ’ s € 50 billion -lrb- $ 61.2 billion -rrb- debt , it seems like a sensible solution . “ right now , the idea of rebuilding the palace is completely inappropriate , ” said dagmar richter , a german-american architecture professor and critic . ron bloch , a spokesman for volkspalast festival , agreed . “ in these times of hartz iv -lrb- controversial social welfare reforms , -rrb- the government has more urgent things to worry about than tearing down an intact building at a cost of up to € 60 million , ” he observed wryly . so why exactly did the bundestag vote to tear down the palace of the republic and erect a copy of a baroque hohenzollern palace in its place ? ideological baggage crucially , the building is not just aesthetically out of fashion , it ’ s politically passé , too . in few other cities does urban planning carry the same sort of baggage it does in berlin .
what with the german capital ’ s unusually turbulent past , architecture has a political dimension which ensures it ’ s regularly propelled into mainstream debate . “ given the many turning points in german history - 1918 , 1933 , 1945 and 1989 - architecture in germany has , without a doubt , been considerably more politicized than in other countries , ” said hartmut frank , an architect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with simone hain , formerly of east germany ’ s prestigious bauakademie , frank has curated an exhibition with the title two german architectures which opens in leipzig this week .
organized by germany 's institute for foreign relations , or ifa , it illustrates that ultimately , east and west german architecture had more in common than might have been expected . as andreas ruby wrote in the german weekly die zeit , many buildings that typify east german architecture would be considered “ characteristic and quality examples of european architecture of the post-war decades if they ’ d been built , say , in cologne . ”
the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .
since 1989 , urban planners have been acutely aware that banishing the city ’ s communist legacy is a matter of both psychological and physical transformation . the process began in the early 1990s when statues of communist heroes were unceremoniously removed and many of east berlin ’ s streets rechristened .
monuments to lenin were dismantled , marx-engels-platz became hackescher markt - and the oppressive era of socialist dictatorship became an increasingly distant memory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ architecture here is much more about politics than aesthetics , ” she said , explaining the drab , minimalist look of many 1950s east german buildings .
“ that always meant architecture had less of an opportunity to be expressive than in a highly consumerist society like the us . ” richter also pointed out that germany was and still is scarred by the overtly monumental vision of nazi architect albert speer and has shyed away from bombastic building ever since . “ what we have instead is architecture that has more of a political role in the urban fabric , ” she said , adding that it ’ s a sign of the times that the architects currently involved in redesigning the city - such as helmut jahn and hans kollhoff , the man behind the plans for the new alexanderplatz in central berlin - are famously conservative , “ corporate ” architects . retro classics worth preserving but as berliners witness the bricks and mortar traces of the soviet era slowly disappear , many have reclaimed aspects of east german architecture and design as retro classics eminently worth preserving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen years after the fall of the wall , it ’ s more than okay to have a sentimental attachment to east germany - it ’ s positively fashionable .
the party crowd is flocking to the capital ’ s hip havens of sputnik chic , with 1960s-built venues such as cafe moskau and kino kosmos enjoying unprecedented popularity . not even its new-found fans would describe it as beautiful - but if it gets a stay of execution , perhaps the day will come when even the palace of the republic is considered fashionable . two german architectures runs from sept .

the proposal is seen as another example of team chief jürgen klinsmann 's growing control . despite playing host to soccer 's most prestigious event , the world cup , in 2006 , germany may not play the opening game of the tournament .
germany 's organizing committee chairman franz beckenbauer said on monday that the option to pass the honor to reigning world champions brazil , providing they qualify , was being discussed . since 1974 the world cup winners have taken to the field in the opening match and it is expected that germany will allow this tradition to continue with brazil opening the tournament on june 9 , 2006 at munich 's new allianz arena . beckenbauer also confirmed that the possibility arose from discussions held with team chief jürgen klinsmann who had expressed a preference for the hosts to start the tournament three days later at the olympic stadium in berlin than in the opening match in munich .
it is believed his reasons centered on giving his team more time to prepare . " we , at the organizing committee , do n't mind whether germany or brazil play the opening game , " beckenbauer told german sports television channel dsf .
" we would have liked germany to start with a highlight but the brazil solution would not be bad either , " he added . team manager oliver bierhoff seemed to be more definite in his view . " we will step aside for brazil , " he told the german news agency dpa .
" the reigning champions can open the world cup . " there has yet to be any official word on the decision . klinsmann exerting influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann is said to be getting his own way through strong words and deeds .
klinsmann , who was appointed in july , has also been stamping his identity on other areas of the world cup 2006 plan by informing the organizing committee that he was against the idea of having germany 's training camp in leverkusen , which he felt was not practical . the plan to have the camp in leverkusen was agreed when klinsmann 's predecessor rudi völler was still in charge and was seen as compensation after the city 's bid to stage games of the 2006 finals was turned down because its stadium was too small . " he -lrb- klinsmann -rrb- has the right to refuse what rudi völler found correct and to have the team training somewhere else , " beckenbauer said . leverkusen anger over dfb reverse this could cause problems for the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
chemical giant bayer ag , leverkusen 's main sponsor , is accusing the dfb of breach of contract after they invested time and money in bringing the 2006 world cup to germany . bayer ag sports director meinolf sprink accused klinsmann and the dfb of lacking style in making the change , as well as breach of contract . " we have a clear written agreement .
i think it 's sad that we found this out through the press , " sprink told the ap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer calmund is angry over what he sees as a u-turn by the dfb over their world cup agreement .
" i think the dfb have forgotten what leverkusen and the bayer group have done to advertise this world cup , " raged leverkusen 's former general manager reiner calmund . " we are aware the promises have been made to leverkusen , " bierhoff said .
" but the situation is not optimal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.09.2004 female fahrvergnügen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no back-seat driver required members in the german women 's automobile club enjoy sitting behind the wheel just as much as men .
but when it comes to a car 's performance , they would rather take a drive than get their hands dirty fixing the motor . when germany 's automobile club for women was founded back in may 1926 with seven members , cars were still something of a rarity on german streets .
the site of a woman behind the wheel was virtually unheard of - let alone the notion of a lady actually taking an avid interest in the motorized vehicles .
but the founding mothers of ddac were not discouraged .
just two years after establishing the club , the motoring women organized their first long-distance race from berlin to oberhof , in southern germany .
the competition lasted two days and covered a stretch of 750 kilometers -lrb- 466 miles -rrb- .
today , that hardly seems much of a challenge , but more than 70 years ago , just arriving at the finish line was a real accomplishment .
more often than not , a car ended up in a ditch alongside the potholed roads .
back then the women had to rely a lot more on sheer strength and driving dexterity : there was no power steering , no four-wheel drive , no suspension system to assist the early women drivers .
since then , cars have developed by leaps and bounds in terms of technology and safety .
but the members of ddac have n't lost interest in the main focus of their club : driving for fun and leisure .
driving for fun " we drive normal cars , " christa reiners , head of the ddac branch in rheinland-ruhr in western germany , told dw-world .
" from the compact class to the large family car , everything has a place in our group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women drivers are no longer a rarity whereas their male counterparts frequently spend a good bit of time tuning up their motors and outfitting their cars with the latest in computer-assisted technology , the members of ddac rarely pick up a wrench .
instead , safety is their top priority .
" it is especially important that our vehicles are in excellent working condition , " reiners said , describing the ddac 's inclinations , which do n't differ that much from the interests and concerns of the average woman driver .
" complicated repairs are dealt with at the mechanic 's workshop . "
as a result , greasy hands and overalls are less common than extended car tours across the country .
christa reiners said the relationship between the club 's members and their automobiles is " rather playful , " but nonetheless demanding .
" in keeping with the tradition of our club , we are n't primarily interested in speeding , but rather in performing difficult orientation exercises or tests of skill , " she said .
taking women drivers seriously the way women think about cars is n't just visible on the road .
when faced with purchasing a new vehicle , many of their specific interests play a key role in decision-making .
however , a recent marketing study by the vocational college of niederrhein showed that woman often feel they are not taken seriously in the sales room .
" women are frequently insecure when they buy a car and they reveal that weakness to the salesperson , " said doris kortus-schultes .
the professor and author of the study examined the buying habits and interests of more than 1,200 women drivers , including car experts , senior citizens and immigrants .
according to the study , which the german women 's automobile club supported , female drivers do n't necessarily want to see more saleswomen in the showroom , but they do want to see more emphasis placed on honesty , respect , trustworthiness and understanding when it comes to selling a car .
even after the purchase , the women interviewed said they would like to have easy-to-read instruction manuals and a personal explanation and demonstration of a car 's features .
perhaps if female drivers are taken more seriously both on and off the road , the number of women who take an interest in their cars beyond the simple transportation aspect will also grow . ingo uhlenbruch -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de why german women ca n't read maps … but can park the car only some of the clichés about german drivers are true according to a new study .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 14.09.2004 germany to forego world cup opener ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann prefers berlin 's new stadium for germany 's first game world cup 2006 hosts germany may pass the honor of playing the opening game of the soccer showpiece to current champions brazil .
the proposal is seen as another example of team chief jürgen klinsmann 's growing control . despite playing host to soccer 's most prestigious event , the world cup , in 2006 , germany may not play the opening game of the tournament .
germany 's organizing committee chairman franz beckenbauer said on monday that the option to pass the honor to reigning world champions brazil , providing they qualify , was being discussed . since 1974 the world cup winners have taken to the field in the opening match and it is expected that germany will allow this tradition to continue with brazil opening the tournament on june 9 , 2006 at munich 's new allianz arena . beckenbauer also confirmed that the possibility arose from discussions held with team chief jürgen klinsmann who had expressed a preference for the hosts to start the tournament three days later at the olympic stadium in berlin than in the opening match in munich .
it is believed his reasons centered on giving his team more time to prepare . " we , at the organizing committee , do n't mind whether germany or brazil play the opening game , " beckenbauer told german sports television channel dsf .
" we would have liked germany to start with a highlight but the brazil solution would not be bad either , " he added . team manager oliver bierhoff seemed to be more definite in his view . " we will step aside for brazil , " he told the german news agency dpa .
" the reigning champions can open the world cup . " there has yet to be any official word on the decision . klinsmann exerting influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann is said to be getting his own way through strong words and deeds .
klinsmann , who was appointed in july , has also been stamping his identity on other areas of the world cup 2006 plan by informing the organizing committee that he was against the idea of having germany 's training camp in leverkusen , which he felt was not practical . the plan to have the camp in leverkusen was agreed when klinsmann 's predecessor rudi völler was still in charge and was seen as compensation after the city 's bid to stage games of the 2006 finals was turned down because its stadium was too small . " he -lrb- klinsmann -rrb- has the right to refuse what rudi völler found correct and to have the team training somewhere else , " beckenbauer said . leverkusen anger over dfb reverse this could cause problems for the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
chemical giant bayer ag , leverkusen 's main sponsor , is accusing the dfb of breach of contract after they invested time and money in bringing the 2006 world cup to germany . bayer ag sports director meinolf sprink accused klinsmann and the dfb of lacking style in making the change , as well as breach of contract . " we have a clear written agreement .
i think it 's sad that we found this out through the press , " sprink told the ap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer calmund is angry over what he sees as a u-turn by the dfb over their world cup agreement .
" i think the dfb have forgotten what leverkusen and the bayer group have done to advertise this world cup , " raged leverkusen 's former general manager reiner calmund . " we are aware the promises have been made to leverkusen , " bierhoff said .

2 ; on the eve of the anniversary of german reunification in 1990 . the labor market changes will hit the former communist east hardest .
unemployment there is twice that in the west and young people have been abandoning the region in droves in search of a better future . ahead of the elections in brandenburg and saxony , voters have shown increasing signs they are disenchanted with chancellor gerhard schröder 's failure to find them jobs and revitalize the euro zone 's biggest economy . opinion polls suggest they will turn to parties on both extremes of the political spectrum , heaping more pressure on schröder in the wake of several recent bad election results . divisions also appear to be surfacing between eastern and western regions , with some in the more affluent parts of the country showing open resentment to the billions in " solidarity " payments that have been made to the east since the early 1990s . presidential participation german president horst köhler , a former head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , became mired in that debate after his comments in the weekly focus magazine were perceived as encouraging an abandoning of the eastern states . " there were and there are big differences in living standards everywhere in germany .
it 's the same from north to south as it is from east to west , " köhler told the news magazine in its monday edition . " if you want to level them out , you cement in place a subsidized state and place an intolerable burden of debt on the younger generation .
we must get away from a subsidised state , " he said . his remarks won a broadside from agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast , who said : " it 's not a president 's job to say : ' take care of your problems on your own . " ' the reaction to a prominent political figure addressing the virtual taboo of social inequality was also indicative of how much progress has been made just two months before the 15th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall . " it 's the first time that a senior german politician has called into question the central doctrine of unified germany , " said the daily berliner zeitung . " equalizing living standards is one of the founding myths of the united germany , " its editorial read under the headline " köhler was right .

the majority of eastern , northern and south-western states all fall behind the german average of € 25,800 in gdp per person . rich southern states better off than north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's entertainment district the city states of hamburg , with a gdp per person of € 44,500 , and bremen , with € 35,300 , are the exceptions in the northern region and are more in line with the large and affluent southern states of bavaria -lrb- € 29,900 -rrb- and baden-württemberg -lrb- € 29,400 -rrb- .
the rest of the north is as far behind the southern giants as the eastern states are behind the poorest western regions . the core of horst köhler 's comments over the weekend regarding differences in eastern and western states was seized upon by opposition parties , seemingly intent on exploiting a real or imagined divide for their own purposes ahead of state elections . but a closer look at the german president 's interview with news magazine focus published on sunday shows that köhler in fact pointed out that the living standards and employment possibilities varied all over germany , a view supported by the institute 's statistics . benefit claimants favor bremen while the figures confirm that average unemployment in the eastern states is almost ten percent higher than the worst affected western region - bremen with 16.3 percent , 14.3 percent registered - northern and western states have a higher number of people claiming social benefits , with berlin the exception in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visitor takes a numbered ticket as he waits in line in a german labor office the statistics again show that unemployment in the south of germany is a lot less than in northern states and that bavaria and baden-württemberg are well below the german average of 12.9 percent .
the two large southern states have the least amount of benefit claimants , with bavaria recording the lowest figure of 17 per 1,000 citizens compared to bremen 's 92 per 1,000 , the largest in the country . economists line up behind köhler reactions to köhler 's remarks continue to surface with many economic experts and commentators agreeing with their president . " köhler is perfectly right in what he says , " said klaus von dohnanyi , head of a special government-appointed commission on east germany .
" of course there will be regional differences .
you have them in other countries , " the former senior social democratic politician told the associated press .
" but that does not mean köhler is accepting the high levels of unemployment in eastern germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coal mining regions are struggling to adapt to the changing economy michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industry , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that he " fully and completely " agreed with köhler 's comments .
rogowski added that it is not possible to guarantee identical standards of living for all people and that it is only possible to create identical conditions from which standards of living can develop . politicians warn of negative effects however , senior politicians continue to view the president 's remarks with concern .
renate künast , the agriculture and consumer affairs minister , said : " it 's not a president 's job to say : ' take care of your problems on your own . " ' " the message that comes across to east germans is : be satisfied , there wo n't be any more equality , " reinhard bütikofer , the head of the greens party , told the berliner zeitung . greens lawmaker fritz kuhn accused köhler of unwittingly helping the ex-communist pds party , which has been prominent in championing the perceived east-west divide ahead of state elections , saying they draw strength " from a fundamental sense of many east germans that they are second-class .

" the comment was a brutal put-down to us defence secretary donald rumsfeld , who ruffled feathers last year by lambasting france and germany and their allies as the " old " europe over their refusal to back the us-led intervention and subsequent occupation of iraq . zapatero 's surprise general election win three days after the madrid blasts led to a clean break with eight years of rightwing government under his predecessor jose maria aznar , a solid us ally who had backed the iraq conflict . aznar 's foreign policies caused a major breach in relations between madrid and most of its eu partners , with the notable exception of britain . zapatero told reporters he sees spain as belonging to " the heart of europe , " which he sees european union heavyweights france and germany as representing . ratifying a constitution " we must make a maximum effort to agree a constitution and bring it close to the peoples of europe so they can see how it affects their future and rights .
i have no doubt it will be ratified . " aside from the constitutional issue , monday 's talks also revolved around fighting terrorism and turkey 's application to join the 25-member european union , as well as deepening cooperation in the fields of defence and security . on the bulk of those issues both zapatero and schröder took their lead from chirac , the eu 's older statesman . chirac stressed that on iraq , he did not want to " sit in judgement on the position of any country , " but insisted that progress required broad international agreement . " the situation is serious and not getting any better .
i think a pandora 's box has been opened and we are not able to close it . " chirac also took the lead on discussion of eu finances , a bone of contention during aznar 's stewardship of spain when madrid rigidly stuck to the eu stability and growth pact in slashing deficits while paris and berlin exceeded the pact 's financial straitjacket . " unfortunately there are limits as to how much we can spend .
we have to be reasonable , " said chirac , who said solidarity and negotiation were the way forward in a spirit of compromise as eu aid is diverted in future to the bloc 's 10 mainly eastern european new members . " the best recipe is to be open to discussion .
there must be no brutal ruptures " of policy , said chirac , acknowledging germany 's role as the biggest contributor the state budget - and spain 's position as , to date , the prime beneficiary of eu largesse . united against terrorism on terrorism , zapatero took the lead . " terrorism is a general threat to us all and is blind , " he insisted when asked if a different approach should be adopted to different kinds of terrorism .
" the best way to deal with it is through international cooperation and the sharing of judicial and intelligence information . " to that end , the three leaders said they had agreed to make available information to each other 's police forces on criminal records of each other 's nationals . schröder said germany was committed to the fight against terrorism in all its forms . " it has become crystal clear that terrorism is something which threatens us all , " said the german leader , who lamented " the terrible attacks we saw in madrid . " on turkey 's efforts to join the eu club , schroeder noted that " turkey has made enormous progress - i think everyone will acknowledge that fact .

the majority of eastern , northern and south-western states all fall behind the german average of € 25,800 in gdp per person . rich southern states better off than north bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's entertainment district the city states of hamburg , with a gdp per person of € 44,500 , and bremen , with € 35,300 , are the exceptions in the northern region and are more in line with the large and affluent southern states of bavaria -lrb- € 29,900 -rrb- and baden-württemberg -lrb- € 29,400 -rrb- .
the rest of the north is as far behind the southern giants as the eastern states are behind the poorest western regions . the core of horst köhler 's comments over the weekend regarding differences in eastern and western states was seized upon by opposition parties , seemingly intent on exploiting a real or imagined divide for their own purposes ahead of state elections . but a closer look at the german president 's interview with news magazine focus published on sunday shows that köhler in fact pointed out that the living standards and employment possibilities varied all over germany , a view supported by the institute 's statistics . benefit claimants favor bremen while the figures confirm that average unemployment in the eastern states is almost ten percent higher than the worst affected western region - bremen with 16.3 percent , 14.3 percent registered - northern and western states have a higher number of people claiming social benefits , with berlin the exception in the east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visitor takes a numbered ticket as he waits in line in a german labor office the statistics again show that unemployment in the south of germany is a lot less than in northern states and that bavaria and baden-württemberg are well below the german average of 12.9 percent .
the two large southern states have the least amount of benefit claimants , with bavaria recording the lowest figure of 17 per 1,000 citizens compared to bremen 's 92 per 1,000 , the largest in the country . economists line up behind köhler reactions to köhler 's remarks continue to surface with many economic experts and commentators agreeing with their president . " köhler is perfectly right in what he says , " said klaus von dohnanyi , head of a special government-appointed commission on east germany .
" of course there will be regional differences .
you have them in other countries , " the former senior social democratic politician told the associated press .
" but that does not mean köhler is accepting the high levels of unemployment in eastern germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coal mining regions are struggling to adapt to the changing economy michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industry , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that he " fully and completely " agreed with köhler 's comments .
rogowski added that it is not possible to guarantee identical standards of living for all people and that it is only possible to create identical conditions from which standards of living can develop . politicians warn of negative effects however , senior politicians continue to view the president 's remarks with concern .
renate künast , the agriculture and consumer affairs minister , said : " it 's not a president 's job to say : ' take care of your problems on your own . " ' " the message that comes across to east germans is : be satisfied , there wo n't be any more equality , " reinhard bütikofer , the head of the greens party , told the berliner zeitung . greens lawmaker fritz kuhn accused köhler of unwittingly helping the ex-communist pds party , which has been prominent in championing the perceived east-west divide ahead of state elections , saying they draw strength " from a fundamental sense of many east germans that they are second-class .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.09.2004 female fahrvergnügen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no back-seat driver required members in the german women 's automobile club enjoy sitting behind the wheel just as much as men .
but when it comes to a car 's performance , they would rather take a drive than get their hands dirty fixing the motor . when germany 's automobile club for women was founded back in may 1926 with seven members , cars were still something of a rarity on german streets .
the site of a woman behind the wheel was virtually unheard of - let alone the notion of a lady actually taking an avid interest in the motorized vehicles .
but the founding mothers of ddac were not discouraged .
just two years after establishing the club , the motoring women organized their first long-distance race from berlin to oberhof , in southern germany .
the competition lasted two days and covered a stretch of 750 kilometers -lrb- 466 miles -rrb- .
today , that hardly seems much of a challenge , but more than 70 years ago , just arriving at the finish line was a real accomplishment .
more often than not , a car ended up in a ditch alongside the potholed roads .
back then the women had to rely a lot more on sheer strength and driving dexterity : there was no power steering , no four-wheel drive , no suspension system to assist the early women drivers .
since then , cars have developed by leaps and bounds in terms of technology and safety .
but the members of ddac have n't lost interest in the main focus of their club : driving for fun and leisure .
driving for fun " we drive normal cars , " christa reiners , head of the ddac branch in rheinland-ruhr in western germany , told dw-world .
" from the compact class to the large family car , everything has a place in our group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women drivers are no longer a rarity whereas their male counterparts frequently spend a good bit of time tuning up their motors and outfitting their cars with the latest in computer-assisted technology , the members of ddac rarely pick up a wrench .
instead , safety is their top priority .
" it is especially important that our vehicles are in excellent working condition , " reiners said , describing the ddac 's inclinations , which do n't differ that much from the interests and concerns of the average woman driver .
" complicated repairs are dealt with at the mechanic 's workshop . "
as a result , greasy hands and overalls are less common than extended car tours across the country .
christa reiners said the relationship between the club 's members and their automobiles is " rather playful , " but nonetheless demanding .
" in keeping with the tradition of our club , we are n't primarily interested in speeding , but rather in performing difficult orientation exercises or tests of skill , " she said .
taking women drivers seriously the way women think about cars is n't just visible on the road .
when faced with purchasing a new vehicle , many of their specific interests play a key role in decision-making .
however , a recent marketing study by the vocational college of niederrhein showed that woman often feel they are not taken seriously in the sales room .
" women are frequently insecure when they buy a car and they reveal that weakness to the salesperson , " said doris kortus-schultes .
the professor and author of the study examined the buying habits and interests of more than 1,200 women drivers , including car experts , senior citizens and immigrants .
according to the study , which the german women 's automobile club supported , female drivers do n't necessarily want to see more saleswomen in the showroom , but they do want to see more emphasis placed on honesty , respect , trustworthiness and understanding when it comes to selling a car .
even after the purchase , the women interviewed said they would like to have easy-to-read instruction manuals and a personal explanation and demonstration of a car 's features .
perhaps if female drivers are taken more seriously both on and off the road , the number of women who take an interest in their cars beyond the simple transportation aspect will also grow . ingo uhlenbruch -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de why german women ca n't read maps … but can park the car only some of the clichés about german drivers are true according to a new study .
-lrb- aug .
28 , 2003 -rrb- car design à la lady even in this achingly modern 21st century , prejudice and preconception about dreaded " women drivers " still abound .
but there 's news for these macho male roadsters : women design cars .

not only will the huge numbers of oktoberfest visitors be partaking of the finest beers , bavarian cuisine and entertainment at the world 's biggest beer festival , they may even be improving their health while doing so . a recent study by the university of heidelberg has revealed that drinking a " moderate " amount of alcohol can boost the recovery of patients who have had heart surgery and can help stave off cardiac episodes for those who have not . men who drank about six or more units a week after surgery to open blocked arteries were less likely to have renewed furring up of their arteries , according to the study published in the health journal heart this week .
they were also half as likely to need repeated unclogging surgery as men who drank little or no alcohol . the report also contains evidence that suggests people who drink about one unit a day have a lower risk of heart attack , chronic heart trouble or sudden coronary death than heavier drinkers or those who do not drink at all . " -lrb- the report -rrb- further supports that moderate consumers of alcohol with an increased risk cardiovascular risk profile should not be advised to stop drinking , " the university study states . moderation is the key this will be music to the ears of the mass ranks of beer guzzlers who will be putting away an estimated six million liters -lrb- 1.6 million gallons -rrb- of suds over the festival fortnight .

an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees . the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- annual report “ education at a glance , ” published tuesday , has dealt another blow to an already stricken german education policy . the study , which compares education systems in the 30 oecd member countries , indicated that germany has a lot of work to do if it wants to produce graduates with qualifications comparable to other developed countries .
without significant educational reforms , germany could forfeit its economical competitiveness , the report warned . while oecd states increased their investments in primary and secondary schools by 21 percent and in universities by 30 percent from 1995 through 2001 , germany had only spent 6 and 7 percent more respectively , the study said .
in oecd countries , the number of college and university students increased by an average of 40 percent . but germany , austria and france experienced no growth at all . " the qualification level in the oecd states has risen dramatically since 1995 , while in germany nothing has happened , " german education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said .
the social democrat appealed to the opposition christian democratic union-run states to cooperate with the federal government to eliminate subsidies for homeowners and instead invest the money in education and research .
the lion 's share of german education funding and policy is determined at the state level . below average the study said germany spent less money than the average on each student and more on teachers ' salaries .
seven- and eight-year-old german pupils receive 160 fewer hours of lessons than the oecd average .
the discrepancy decreases in secondary schools , though 15-year-olds still get 66 hours of instruction less than the oecd midpoint .
kindergarten and primary school classes are also larger than the oecd average , which means that the children inevitably receive less individual attention aat one of the most crucial points in their education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher of the oecd “ what we have observed over time is that some countries have very dynamically expanded and extended their educational services , and in germany that kind of dynamic has been much less pronounced , " andreas schleicher , one of the study 's authors told dw-radio .
" over time , the divergence between the countries that move very fast and those that do not change is becoming bigger , ” he said . no longer the country of poets and philosophers three years ago , the oecd 's pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading , math and science when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
the assessment came as a shock to germans , who see their land as the “ country of poets and philosophers . ” education minister buhlman -lrb- photo , below -rrb- subsequently initiated a program to increase the number of all-day schools in germany , which the current report praised .
around 3,000 schools now provide full-day instruction .
but the majority of schools in germany continue to operate on a half-day basis , with lessons ending around lunchtime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn although he lauded the program , schleicher , who also coordinates the pisa study , said that all-day schools are already the norm in other oecd countries .
he focused criticism on germany 's track system , which separates students into different classes and schools depending on their achievements , thus determining whether they will gain the necessary qualifications to pursue further training or go to university after secondary school . in other countries " differences between people , between talents are not seen so much as a problem that must be resolved through school structures .
instead they deal with it constructively , " schleicher said . intensive discussion doris ahnen , the head of the education ministers ' conference , which is made up of the 16 state education ministers and senators , rebuffed the oecd criticism .
" in hardly another country has education been discussed so intensively since pisa , " bavarian public broadcaster bayerische rundfunk quoted ahnen as saying . bildunterschrift : baden-wurttemberg 's education minister , annette schavan , also dismissed the study .
" in germany there 's no lack of visions or of concrete reforms , " she said .
she accused the oecd of ignoring fundamental improvements to the education system . the gew teachers ' union demanded that the state education ministers take action to stop germany 's education system from deteriorating .

but when it comes to a car 's performance , they would rather take a drive than get their hands dirty fixing the motor . when germany 's automobile club for women was founded back in may 1926 with seven members , cars were still something of a rarity on german streets .
the site of a woman behind the wheel was virtually unheard of - let alone the notion of a lady actually taking an avid interest in the motorized vehicles .
but the founding mothers of ddac were not discouraged .
just two years after establishing the club , the motoring women organized their first long-distance race from berlin to oberhof , in southern germany .
the competition lasted two days and covered a stretch of 750 kilometers -lrb- 466 miles -rrb- .
today , that hardly seems much of a challenge , but more than 70 years ago , just arriving at the finish line was a real accomplishment .
more often than not , a car ended up in a ditch alongside the potholed roads .
back then the women had to rely a lot more on sheer strength and driving dexterity : there was no power steering , no four-wheel drive , no suspension system to assist the early women drivers .
since then , cars have developed by leaps and bounds in terms of technology and safety .
but the members of ddac have n't lost interest in the main focus of their club : driving for fun and leisure .
driving for fun " we drive normal cars , " christa reiners , head of the ddac branch in rheinland-ruhr in western germany , told dw-world .
" from the compact class to the large family car , everything has a place in our group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women drivers are no longer a rarity whereas their male counterparts frequently spend a good bit of time tuning up their motors and outfitting their cars with the latest in computer-assisted technology , the members of ddac rarely pick up a wrench .
instead , safety is their top priority .
" it is especially important that our vehicles are in excellent working condition , " reiners said , describing the ddac 's inclinations , which do n't differ that much from the interests and concerns of the average woman driver .
" complicated repairs are dealt with at the mechanic 's workshop . "
as a result , greasy hands and overalls are less common than extended car tours across the country .
christa reiners said the relationship between the club 's members and their automobiles is " rather playful , " but nonetheless demanding .
" in keeping with the tradition of our club , we are n't primarily interested in speeding , but rather in performing difficult orientation exercises or tests of skill , " she said .
taking women drivers seriously the way women think about cars is n't just visible on the road .
when faced with purchasing a new vehicle , many of their specific interests play a key role in decision-making .
however , a recent marketing study by the vocational college of niederrhein showed that woman often feel they are not taken seriously in the sales room .
" women are frequently insecure when they buy a car and they reveal that weakness to the salesperson , " said doris kortus-schultes .
the professor and author of the study examined the buying habits and interests of more than 1,200 women drivers , including car experts , senior citizens and immigrants .
according to the study , which the german women 's automobile club supported , female drivers do n't necessarily want to see more saleswomen in the showroom , but they do want to see more emphasis placed on honesty , respect , trustworthiness and understanding when it comes to selling a car .
even after the purchase , the women interviewed said they would like to have easy-to-read instruction manuals and a personal explanation and demonstration of a car 's features .
perhaps if female drivers are taken more seriously both on and off the road , the number of women who take an interest in their cars beyond the simple transportation aspect will also grow . ingo uhlenbruch -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de why german women ca n't read maps … but can park the car only some of the clichés about german drivers are true according to a new study .

so why does it have such a bad reputation ? “ so if your body were berlin , which part would you get rid of , ” performance artists from the gob squad theater group asked the crowd on the recent opening night of the volkspalas t festival in berlin ’ s palace of the republic , which is welcoming the public until it closes for the last time in november . the gob squad ’ s badgering of visitors highlighted the building ’ s sorry plight .
an in-your-face example of everything that was wrong with east german urban planning , it 's fatally out of fashion - and it has to go . at least , according to the bundestag . resisting the inevitable ? but it ’ s not going quietly .
plenty of people would like it to remain , at least until berlin is better able to foot the bill for its demolition . given the city ’ s € 50 billion -lrb- $ 61.2 billion -rrb- debt , it seems like a sensible solution . “ right now , the idea of rebuilding the palace is completely inappropriate , ” said dagmar richter , a german-american architecture professor and critic . ron bloch , a spokesman for volkspalast festival , agreed . “ in these times of hartz iv -lrb- controversial social welfare reforms , -rrb- the government has more urgent things to worry about than tearing down an intact building at a cost of up to € 60 million , ” he observed wryly . so why exactly did the bundestag vote to tear down the palace of the republic and erect a copy of a baroque hohenzollern palace in its place ? ideological baggage crucially , the building is not just aesthetically out of fashion , it ’ s politically passé , too . in few other cities does urban planning carry the same sort of baggage it does in berlin .
what with the german capital ’ s unusually turbulent past , architecture has a political dimension which ensures it ’ s regularly propelled into mainstream debate . “ given the many turning points in german history - 1918 , 1933 , 1945 and 1989 - architecture in germany has , without a doubt , been considerably more politicized than in other countries , ” said hartmut frank , an architect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with simone hain , formerly of east germany ’ s prestigious bauakademie , frank has curated an exhibition with the title two german architectures which opens in leipzig this week .
organized by germany 's institute for foreign relations , or ifa , it illustrates that ultimately , east and west german architecture had more in common than might have been expected . as andreas ruby wrote in the german weekly die zeit , many buildings that typify east german architecture would be considered “ characteristic and quality examples of european architecture of the post-war decades if they ’ d been built , say , in cologne . ”
the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .
since 1989 , urban planners have been acutely aware that banishing the city ’ s communist legacy is a matter of both psychological and physical transformation . the process began in the early 1990s when statues of communist heroes were unceremoniously removed and many of east berlin ’ s streets rechristened .
monuments to lenin were dismantled , marx-engels-platz became hackescher markt - and the oppressive era of socialist dictatorship became an increasingly distant memory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ architecture here is much more about politics than aesthetics , ” she said , explaining the drab , minimalist look of many 1950s east german buildings .
“ that always meant architecture had less of an opportunity to be expressive than in a highly consumerist society like the us . ” richter also pointed out that germany was and still is scarred by the overtly monumental vision of nazi architect albert speer and has shyed away from bombastic building ever since . “ what we have instead is architecture that has more of a political role in the urban fabric , ” she said , adding that it ’ s a sign of the times that the architects currently involved in redesigning the city - such as helmut jahn and hans kollhoff , the man behind the plans for the new alexanderplatz in central berlin - are famously conservative , “ corporate ” architects . retro classics worth preserving but as berliners witness the bricks and mortar traces of the soviet era slowly disappear , many have reclaimed aspects of east german architecture and design as retro classics eminently worth preserving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen years after the fall of the wall , it ’ s more than okay to have a sentimental attachment to east germany - it ’ s positively fashionable .
the party crowd is flocking to the capital ’ s hip havens of sputnik chic , with 1960s-built venues such as cafe moskau and kino kosmos enjoying unprecedented popularity . not even its new-found fans would describe it as beautiful - but if it gets a stay of execution , perhaps the day will come when even the palace of the republic is considered fashionable . two german architectures runs from sept .

so why does it have such a bad reputation ? “ so if your body were berlin , which part would you get rid of , ” performance artists from the gob squad theater group asked the crowd on the recent opening night of the volkspalas t festival in berlin ’ s palace of the republic , which is welcoming the public until it closes for the last time in november . the gob squad ’ s badgering of visitors highlighted the building ’ s sorry plight .
an in-your-face example of everything that was wrong with east german urban planning , it 's fatally out of fashion - and it has to go . at least , according to the bundestag . resisting the inevitable ? but it ’ s not going quietly .
plenty of people would like it to remain , at least until berlin is better able to foot the bill for its demolition . given the city ’ s € 50 billion -lrb- $ 61.2 billion -rrb- debt , it seems like a sensible solution . “ right now , the idea of rebuilding the palace is completely inappropriate , ” said dagmar richter , a german-american architecture professor and critic . ron bloch , a spokesman for volkspalast festival , agreed . “ in these times of hartz iv -lrb- controversial social welfare reforms , -rrb- the government has more urgent things to worry about than tearing down an intact building at a cost of up to € 60 million , ” he observed wryly . so why exactly did the bundestag vote to tear down the palace of the republic and erect a copy of a baroque hohenzollern palace in its place ? ideological baggage crucially , the building is not just aesthetically out of fashion , it ’ s politically passé , too . in few other cities does urban planning carry the same sort of baggage it does in berlin .
what with the german capital ’ s unusually turbulent past , architecture has a political dimension which ensures it ’ s regularly propelled into mainstream debate . “ given the many turning points in german history - 1918 , 1933 , 1945 and 1989 - architecture in germany has , without a doubt , been considerably more politicized than in other countries , ” said hartmut frank , an architect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with simone hain , formerly of east germany ’ s prestigious bauakademie , frank has curated an exhibition with the title two german architectures which opens in leipzig this week .
organized by germany 's institute for foreign relations , or ifa , it illustrates that ultimately , east and west german architecture had more in common than might have been expected . as andreas ruby wrote in the german weekly die zeit , many buildings that typify east german architecture would be considered “ characteristic and quality examples of european architecture of the post-war decades if they ’ d been built , say , in cologne . ”
the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .
since 1989 , urban planners have been acutely aware that banishing the city ’ s communist legacy is a matter of both psychological and physical transformation . the process began in the early 1990s when statues of communist heroes were unceremoniously removed and many of east berlin ’ s streets rechristened .
monuments to lenin were dismantled , marx-engels-platz became hackescher markt - and the oppressive era of socialist dictatorship became an increasingly distant memory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ architecture here is much more about politics than aesthetics , ” she said , explaining the drab , minimalist look of many 1950s east german buildings .
“ that always meant architecture had less of an opportunity to be expressive than in a highly consumerist society like the us . ” richter also pointed out that germany was and still is scarred by the overtly monumental vision of nazi architect albert speer and has shyed away from bombastic building ever since . “ what we have instead is architecture that has more of a political role in the urban fabric , ” she said , adding that it ’ s a sign of the times that the architects currently involved in redesigning the city - such as helmut jahn and hans kollhoff , the man behind the plans for the new alexanderplatz in central berlin - are famously conservative , “ corporate ” architects . retro classics worth preserving but as berliners witness the bricks and mortar traces of the soviet era slowly disappear , many have reclaimed aspects of east german architecture and design as retro classics eminently worth preserving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen years after the fall of the wall , it ’ s more than okay to have a sentimental attachment to east germany - it ’ s positively fashionable .
the party crowd is flocking to the capital ’ s hip havens of sputnik chic , with 1960s-built venues such as cafe moskau and kino kosmos enjoying unprecedented popularity . not even its new-found fans would describe it as beautiful - but if it gets a stay of execution , perhaps the day will come when even the palace of the republic is considered fashionable . two german architectures runs from sept .

" the comment was a brutal put-down to us defence secretary donald rumsfeld , who ruffled feathers last year by lambasting france and germany and their allies as the " old " europe over their refusal to back the us-led intervention and subsequent occupation of iraq . zapatero 's surprise general election win three days after the madrid blasts led to a clean break with eight years of rightwing government under his predecessor jose maria aznar , a solid us ally who had backed the iraq conflict . aznar 's foreign policies caused a major breach in relations between madrid and most of its eu partners , with the notable exception of britain . zapatero told reporters he sees spain as belonging to " the heart of europe , " which he sees european union heavyweights france and germany as representing . ratifying a constitution " we must make a maximum effort to agree a constitution and bring it close to the peoples of europe so they can see how it affects their future and rights .
i have no doubt it will be ratified . " aside from the constitutional issue , monday 's talks also revolved around fighting terrorism and turkey 's application to join the 25-member european union , as well as deepening cooperation in the fields of defence and security . on the bulk of those issues both zapatero and schröder took their lead from chirac , the eu 's older statesman . chirac stressed that on iraq , he did not want to " sit in judgement on the position of any country , " but insisted that progress required broad international agreement . " the situation is serious and not getting any better .
i think a pandora 's box has been opened and we are not able to close it . " chirac also took the lead on discussion of eu finances , a bone of contention during aznar 's stewardship of spain when madrid rigidly stuck to the eu stability and growth pact in slashing deficits while paris and berlin exceeded the pact 's financial straitjacket . " unfortunately there are limits as to how much we can spend .
we have to be reasonable , " said chirac , who said solidarity and negotiation were the way forward in a spirit of compromise as eu aid is diverted in future to the bloc 's 10 mainly eastern european new members . " the best recipe is to be open to discussion .
there must be no brutal ruptures " of policy , said chirac , acknowledging germany 's role as the biggest contributor the state budget - and spain 's position as , to date , the prime beneficiary of eu largesse . united against terrorism on terrorism , zapatero took the lead . " terrorism is a general threat to us all and is blind , " he insisted when asked if a different approach should be adopted to different kinds of terrorism .
" the best way to deal with it is through international cooperation and the sharing of judicial and intelligence information . " to that end , the three leaders said they had agreed to make available information to each other 's police forces on criminal records of each other 's nationals . schröder said germany was committed to the fight against terrorism in all its forms . " it has become crystal clear that terrorism is something which threatens us all , " said the german leader , who lamented " the terrible attacks we saw in madrid . " on turkey 's efforts to join the eu club , schroeder noted that " turkey has made enormous progress - i think everyone will acknowledge that fact . " the european commission is to publish a report on turkey next month ahead of a european council decision in december on when or if access talks should go ahead . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain gets back to business spanish prime minister zapatero is meeting with his german and french counterparts in madrid on monday , a further step in fine-tuning spain 's relationship to europe .

the site of a woman behind the wheel was virtually unheard of - let alone the notion of a lady actually taking an avid interest in the motorized vehicles .
but the founding mothers of ddac were not discouraged .
just two years after establishing the club , the motoring women organized their first long-distance race from berlin to oberhof , in southern germany .
the competition lasted two days and covered a stretch of 750 kilometers -lrb- 466 miles -rrb- .
today , that hardly seems much of a challenge , but more than 70 years ago , just arriving at the finish line was a real accomplishment .
more often than not , a car ended up in a ditch alongside the potholed roads .
back then the women had to rely a lot more on sheer strength and driving dexterity : there was no power steering , no four-wheel drive , no suspension system to assist the early women drivers .

an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees . the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- annual report “ education at a glance , ” published tuesday , has dealt another blow to an already stricken german education policy . the study , which compares education systems in the 30 oecd member countries , indicated that germany has a lot of work to do if it wants to produce graduates with qualifications comparable to other developed countries .
without significant educational reforms , germany could forfeit its economical competitiveness , the report warned . while oecd states increased their investments in primary and secondary schools by 21 percent and in universities by 30 percent from 1995 through 2001 , germany had only spent 6 and 7 percent more respectively , the study said .
in oecd countries , the number of college and university students increased by an average of 40 percent . but germany , austria and france experienced no growth at all . " the qualification level in the oecd states has risen dramatically since 1995 , while in germany nothing has happened , " german education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said .
the social democrat appealed to the opposition christian democratic union-run states to cooperate with the federal government to eliminate subsidies for homeowners and instead invest the money in education and research .
the lion 's share of german education funding and policy is determined at the state level . below average the study said germany spent less money than the average on each student and more on teachers ' salaries .
seven- and eight-year-old german pupils receive 160 fewer hours of lessons than the oecd average .
the discrepancy decreases in secondary schools , though 15-year-olds still get 66 hours of instruction less than the oecd midpoint .
kindergarten and primary school classes are also larger than the oecd average , which means that the children inevitably receive less individual attention aat one of the most crucial points in their education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher of the oecd “ what we have observed over time is that some countries have very dynamically expanded and extended their educational services , and in germany that kind of dynamic has been much less pronounced , " andreas schleicher , one of the study 's authors told dw-radio .
" over time , the divergence between the countries that move very fast and those that do not change is becoming bigger , ” he said . no longer the country of poets and philosophers three years ago , the oecd 's pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading , math and science when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
the assessment came as a shock to germans , who see their land as the “ country of poets and philosophers . ” education minister buhlman -lrb- photo , below -rrb- subsequently initiated a program to increase the number of all-day schools in germany , which the current report praised .

an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees . the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- annual report “ education at a glance , ” published tuesday , has dealt another blow to an already stricken german education policy . the study , which compares education systems in the 30 oecd member countries , indicated that germany has a lot of work to do if it wants to produce graduates with qualifications comparable to other developed countries .
without significant educational reforms , germany could forfeit its economical competitiveness , the report warned . while oecd states increased their investments in primary and secondary schools by 21 percent and in universities by 30 percent from 1995 through 2001 , germany had only spent 6 and 7 percent more respectively , the study said .
in oecd countries , the number of college and university students increased by an average of 40 percent . but germany , austria and france experienced no growth at all . " the qualification level in the oecd states has risen dramatically since 1995 , while in germany nothing has happened , " german education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said .
the social democrat appealed to the opposition christian democratic union-run states to cooperate with the federal government to eliminate subsidies for homeowners and instead invest the money in education and research .
the lion 's share of german education funding and policy is determined at the state level . below average the study said germany spent less money than the average on each student and more on teachers ' salaries .
seven- and eight-year-old german pupils receive 160 fewer hours of lessons than the oecd average .
the discrepancy decreases in secondary schools , though 15-year-olds still get 66 hours of instruction less than the oecd midpoint .
kindergarten and primary school classes are also larger than the oecd average , which means that the children inevitably receive less individual attention aat one of the most crucial points in their education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher of the oecd “ what we have observed over time is that some countries have very dynamically expanded and extended their educational services , and in germany that kind of dynamic has been much less pronounced , " andreas schleicher , one of the study 's authors told dw-radio .
" over time , the divergence between the countries that move very fast and those that do not change is becoming bigger , ” he said . no longer the country of poets and philosophers three years ago , the oecd 's pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading , math and science when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
the assessment came as a shock to germans , who see their land as the “ country of poets and philosophers . ” education minister buhlman -lrb- photo , below -rrb- subsequently initiated a program to increase the number of all-day schools in germany , which the current report praised .
around 3,000 schools now provide full-day instruction .
but the majority of schools in germany continue to operate on a half-day basis , with lessons ending around lunchtime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn although he lauded the program , schleicher , who also coordinates the pisa study , said that all-day schools are already the norm in other oecd countries .

" made in germany " may soon be outdated . it 's an open secret that german carmakers are frustrated with high wages , employee benefits and inflexible working conditions , and that many are considering a move as a way out of the dilemma .
many in the sector have already set up manufacturing facilities abroad where wages and production costs are considerably lower than back home .
nearly every third german car supplier is already producing in eastern europe , and every sixth one has already set up sites in china .
but that 's only the beginning : every second automobile parts manufacturer is planning to move its production facilities outside of germany , according to a study published by the business consultancy firm ernst & young on monday .
looking to the east and far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturing in china - cheap and efficient .
the stuttgart-based business consultancy surveyed 200 german car suppliers with an annual turnover of between € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.12 million -rrb- and € 500 million .
nearly every second company had already established at least one production site abroad , and almost 40 percent of those questioned said they had concrete plans for shifting parts of their production to eastern europe .
some 23 percent , or close to one-fourth of all suppliers , said they planned to invest in china .
peter fuss , one of the authors of the ernst & young study said that various factors played a role in a company 's decision to move production outside germany .
whereas eastern europe attracts car companies primarily because of the low wages , he said china is particularly interesting because of its proximity to the growing asian market .
" logistical costs can be kept low because companies produce for the local market and parts do n't have to be shipped from western europe to china , " he said .
expanding exodus in a worldwide comparison of production sites , china and the czech republic topped the list , followed by hungary and poland .
both regions , china and eastern europe received top marks for car suppliers for low wage costs -lrb- 15 to 20 percent less than the hourly wage in germany -rrb- and in terms of flexibility and motivation of employees .
tax breaks and benefits for investing in industrially weak regions - aspects frequently criticized as unfair advantages by western european politicians - hardly played a role at all in the decision to move production outside of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes slk production in bremen according to ernst & young , fewer and fewer new manufacturing sites will be opened in western europe in the future .
while more factories close in germany and its neighboring western countries , the move east will not be limited to just the production of parts .
" over time things will develop , " fuss said .
" the companies interviewed in the survey clearly indicated that they are planning to move final assembly stages to eastern europe and china in the near future . "
that would mean that more complicated manufacturing processes - up to now largely based in germany would be affected by the outsourcing .
is germany 's auto industry at risk ?
the ernst & young study concluded that germany 's long tradition as a center of auto manufacturing is indeed in danger as more and more companies pack up and leave in search of better conditions abroad .
at the same time , the move abroad represents " the last chance the companies have to reduce costs and remain competitive in the international market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20 million vw golfs have rolled off the assembly line at the carmaker 's headquarters in wolfsburg but the study also said that although manufacturing will move , germany will continue to hold on to its claim as a nation of carmakers in the fields of branding - the label " made in germany " will still hold sway over car buyers - and in the critical area of research and development .
however , in order to capitalize on these strengths in the future , it will be crucial to identify innovative companies in these fields and promote them internationally , fuss said .
the threat of moving east is not necessarily connected to the loss of jobs , the study reported , with a view to the country 's rising unemployment rate .
" within the last few years there has been a considerable increase in the number of companies moving production to eastern europe and china , " fuss said .
" but during that same time there has also been an increase in jobs in the car sector in germany . "
the key to guaranteeing that those jobs remain in germany in the future , is to focus more on innovation , design , research and development , he added . rolf wenkel -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 30,000 jobs on line at volkswagen europe 's biggest carmaker said 30,000 jobs could be cut in germany if unions do not agree to cost-cutting plans .

" the comment was a brutal put-down to us defence secretary donald rumsfeld , who ruffled feathers last year by lambasting france and germany and their allies as the " old " europe over their refusal to back the us-led intervention and subsequent occupation of iraq . zapatero 's surprise general election win three days after the madrid blasts led to a clean break with eight years of rightwing government under his predecessor jose maria aznar , a solid us ally who had backed the iraq conflict . aznar 's foreign policies caused a major breach in relations between madrid and most of its eu partners , with the notable exception of britain . zapatero told reporters he sees spain as belonging to " the heart of europe , " which he sees european union heavyweights france and germany as representing . ratifying a constitution " we must make a maximum effort to agree a constitution and bring it close to the peoples of europe so they can see how it affects their future and rights .
i have no doubt it will be ratified . " aside from the constitutional issue , monday 's talks also revolved around fighting terrorism and turkey 's application to join the 25-member european union , as well as deepening cooperation in the fields of defence and security . on the bulk of those issues both zapatero and schröder took their lead from chirac , the eu 's older statesman . chirac stressed that on iraq , he did not want to " sit in judgement on the position of any country , " but insisted that progress required broad international agreement . " the situation is serious and not getting any better .
i think a pandora 's box has been opened and we are not able to close it . " chirac also took the lead on discussion of eu finances , a bone of contention during aznar 's stewardship of spain when madrid rigidly stuck to the eu stability and growth pact in slashing deficits while paris and berlin exceeded the pact 's financial straitjacket . " unfortunately there are limits as to how much we can spend .
we have to be reasonable , " said chirac , who said solidarity and negotiation were the way forward in a spirit of compromise as eu aid is diverted in future to the bloc 's 10 mainly eastern european new members . " the best recipe is to be open to discussion .
there must be no brutal ruptures " of policy , said chirac , acknowledging germany 's role as the biggest contributor the state budget - and spain 's position as , to date , the prime beneficiary of eu largesse . united against terrorism on terrorism , zapatero took the lead . " terrorism is a general threat to us all and is blind , " he insisted when asked if a different approach should be adopted to different kinds of terrorism .
" the best way to deal with it is through international cooperation and the sharing of judicial and intelligence information . " to that end , the three leaders said they had agreed to make available information to each other 's police forces on criminal records of each other 's nationals . schröder said germany was committed to the fight against terrorism in all its forms . " it has become crystal clear that terrorism is something which threatens us all , " said the german leader , who lamented " the terrible attacks we saw in madrid . " on turkey 's efforts to join the eu club , schroeder noted that " turkey has made enormous progress - i think everyone will acknowledge that fact . " the european commission is to publish a report on turkey next month ahead of a european council decision in december on when or if access talks should go ahead . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain gets back to business spanish prime minister zapatero is meeting with his german and french counterparts in madrid on monday , a further step in fine-tuning spain 's relationship to europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.09.2004 female fahrvergnügen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no back-seat driver required members in the german women 's automobile club enjoy sitting behind the wheel just as much as men .
but when it comes to a car 's performance , they would rather take a drive than get their hands dirty fixing the motor . when germany 's automobile club for women was founded back in may 1926 with seven members , cars were still something of a rarity on german streets .
the site of a woman behind the wheel was virtually unheard of - let alone the notion of a lady actually taking an avid interest in the motorized vehicles .
but the founding mothers of ddac were not discouraged .
just two years after establishing the club , the motoring women organized their first long-distance race from berlin to oberhof , in southern germany .
the competition lasted two days and covered a stretch of 750 kilometers -lrb- 466 miles -rrb- .
today , that hardly seems much of a challenge , but more than 70 years ago , just arriving at the finish line was a real accomplishment .
more often than not , a car ended up in a ditch alongside the potholed roads .
back then the women had to rely a lot more on sheer strength and driving dexterity : there was no power steering , no four-wheel drive , no suspension system to assist the early women drivers .
since then , cars have developed by leaps and bounds in terms of technology and safety .
but the members of ddac have n't lost interest in the main focus of their club : driving for fun and leisure .
driving for fun " we drive normal cars , " christa reiners , head of the ddac branch in rheinland-ruhr in western germany , told dw-world .
" from the compact class to the large family car , everything has a place in our group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women drivers are no longer a rarity whereas their male counterparts frequently spend a good bit of time tuning up their motors and outfitting their cars with the latest in computer-assisted technology , the members of ddac rarely pick up a wrench .
instead , safety is their top priority .
" it is especially important that our vehicles are in excellent working condition , " reiners said , describing the ddac 's inclinations , which do n't differ that much from the interests and concerns of the average woman driver .
" complicated repairs are dealt with at the mechanic 's workshop . "
as a result , greasy hands and overalls are less common than extended car tours across the country .
christa reiners said the relationship between the club 's members and their automobiles is " rather playful , " but nonetheless demanding .
" in keeping with the tradition of our club , we are n't primarily interested in speeding , but rather in performing difficult orientation exercises or tests of skill , " she said .
taking women drivers seriously the way women think about cars is n't just visible on the road .
when faced with purchasing a new vehicle , many of their specific interests play a key role in decision-making .
however , a recent marketing study by the vocational college of niederrhein showed that woman often feel they are not taken seriously in the sales room .
" women are frequently insecure when they buy a car and they reveal that weakness to the salesperson , " said doris kortus-schultes .
the professor and author of the study examined the buying habits and interests of more than 1,200 women drivers , including car experts , senior citizens and immigrants .
according to the study , which the german women 's automobile club supported , female drivers do n't necessarily want to see more saleswomen in the showroom , but they do want to see more emphasis placed on honesty , respect , trustworthiness and understanding when it comes to selling a car .
even after the purchase , the women interviewed said they would like to have easy-to-read instruction manuals and a personal explanation and demonstration of a car 's features .
perhaps if female drivers are taken more seriously both on and off the road , the number of women who take an interest in their cars beyond the simple transportation aspect will also grow . ingo uhlenbruch -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de why german women ca n't read maps … but can park the car only some of the clichés about german drivers are true according to a new study .
-lrb- aug .
28 , 2003 -rrb- car design à la lady even in this achingly modern 21st century , prejudice and preconception about dreaded " women drivers " still abound .
but there 's news for these macho male roadsters : women design cars .

the proposal is seen as another example of team chief jürgen klinsmann 's growing control . despite playing host to soccer 's most prestigious event , the world cup , in 2006 , germany may not play the opening game of the tournament .
germany 's organizing committee chairman franz beckenbauer said on monday that the option to pass the honor to reigning world champions brazil , providing they qualify , was being discussed . since 1974 the world cup winners have taken to the field in the opening match and it is expected that germany will allow this tradition to continue with brazil opening the tournament on june 9 , 2006 at munich 's new allianz arena . beckenbauer also confirmed that the possibility arose from discussions held with team chief jürgen klinsmann who had expressed a preference for the hosts to start the tournament three days later at the olympic stadium in berlin than in the opening match in munich .
it is believed his reasons centered on giving his team more time to prepare . " we , at the organizing committee , do n't mind whether germany or brazil play the opening game , " beckenbauer told german sports television channel dsf .
" we would have liked germany to start with a highlight but the brazil solution would not be bad either , " he added . team manager oliver bierhoff seemed to be more definite in his view . " we will step aside for brazil , " he told the german news agency dpa .
" the reigning champions can open the world cup . " there has yet to be any official word on the decision . klinsmann exerting influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann is said to be getting his own way through strong words and deeds .
klinsmann , who was appointed in july , has also been stamping his identity on other areas of the world cup 2006 plan by informing the organizing committee that he was against the idea of having germany 's training camp in leverkusen , which he felt was not practical . the plan to have the camp in leverkusen was agreed when klinsmann 's predecessor rudi völler was still in charge and was seen as compensation after the city 's bid to stage games of the 2006 finals was turned down because its stadium was too small . " he -lrb- klinsmann -rrb- has the right to refuse what rudi völler found correct and to have the team training somewhere else , " beckenbauer said . leverkusen anger over dfb reverse this could cause problems for the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- .

an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees . the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- annual report “ education at a glance , ” published tuesday , has dealt another blow to an already stricken german education policy . the study , which compares education systems in the 30 oecd member countries , indicated that germany has a lot of work to do if it wants to produce graduates with qualifications comparable to other developed countries .
without significant educational reforms , germany could forfeit its economical competitiveness , the report warned . while oecd states increased their investments in primary and secondary schools by 21 percent and in universities by 30 percent from 1995 through 2001 , germany had only spent 6 and 7 percent more respectively , the study said .
in oecd countries , the number of college and university students increased by an average of 40 percent . but germany , austria and france experienced no growth at all . " the qualification level in the oecd states has risen dramatically since 1995 , while in germany nothing has happened , " german education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said .

" made in germany " may soon be outdated . it 's an open secret that german carmakers are frustrated with high wages , employee benefits and inflexible working conditions , and that many are considering a move as a way out of the dilemma .
many in the sector have already set up manufacturing facilities abroad where wages and production costs are considerably lower than back home .
nearly every third german car supplier is already producing in eastern europe , and every sixth one has already set up sites in china .
but that 's only the beginning : every second automobile parts manufacturer is planning to move its production facilities outside of germany , according to a study published by the business consultancy firm ernst & young on monday .
looking to the east and far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturing in china - cheap and efficient .
the stuttgart-based business consultancy surveyed 200 german car suppliers with an annual turnover of between € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.12 million -rrb- and € 500 million .
nearly every second company had already established at least one production site abroad , and almost 40 percent of those questioned said they had concrete plans for shifting parts of their production to eastern europe .
some 23 percent , or close to one-fourth of all suppliers , said they planned to invest in china .
peter fuss , one of the authors of the ernst & young study said that various factors played a role in a company 's decision to move production outside germany .
whereas eastern europe attracts car companies primarily because of the low wages , he said china is particularly interesting because of its proximity to the growing asian market .
" logistical costs can be kept low because companies produce for the local market and parts do n't have to be shipped from western europe to china , " he said .
expanding exodus in a worldwide comparison of production sites , china and the czech republic topped the list , followed by hungary and poland .
both regions , china and eastern europe received top marks for car suppliers for low wage costs -lrb- 15 to 20 percent less than the hourly wage in germany -rrb- and in terms of flexibility and motivation of employees .
tax breaks and benefits for investing in industrially weak regions - aspects frequently criticized as unfair advantages by western european politicians - hardly played a role at all in the decision to move production outside of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes slk production in bremen according to ernst & young , fewer and fewer new manufacturing sites will be opened in western europe in the future .
while more factories close in germany and its neighboring western countries , the move east will not be limited to just the production of parts .
" over time things will develop , " fuss said .
" the companies interviewed in the survey clearly indicated that they are planning to move final assembly stages to eastern europe and china in the near future . "
that would mean that more complicated manufacturing processes - up to now largely based in germany would be affected by the outsourcing .
is germany 's auto industry at risk ?
the ernst & young study concluded that germany 's long tradition as a center of auto manufacturing is indeed in danger as more and more companies pack up and leave in search of better conditions abroad .
at the same time , the move abroad represents " the last chance the companies have to reduce costs and remain competitive in the international market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20 million vw golfs have rolled off the assembly line at the carmaker 's headquarters in wolfsburg but the study also said that although manufacturing will move , germany will continue to hold on to its claim as a nation of carmakers in the fields of branding - the label " made in germany " will still hold sway over car buyers - and in the critical area of research and development .
however , in order to capitalize on these strengths in the future , it will be crucial to identify innovative companies in these fields and promote them internationally , fuss said .
the threat of moving east is not necessarily connected to the loss of jobs , the study reported , with a view to the country 's rising unemployment rate .
" within the last few years there has been a considerable increase in the number of companies moving production to eastern europe and china , " fuss said .
" but during that same time there has also been an increase in jobs in the car sector in germany . "
the key to guaranteeing that those jobs remain in germany in the future , is to focus more on innovation , design , research and development , he added . rolf wenkel -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 30,000 jobs on line at volkswagen europe 's biggest carmaker said 30,000 jobs could be cut in germany if unions do not agree to cost-cutting plans .

an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees . the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- annual report “ education at a glance , ” published tuesday , has dealt another blow to an already stricken german education policy . the study , which compares education systems in the 30 oecd member countries , indicated that germany has a lot of work to do if it wants to produce graduates with qualifications comparable to other developed countries .
without significant educational reforms , germany could forfeit its economical competitiveness , the report warned . while oecd states increased their investments in primary and secondary schools by 21 percent and in universities by 30 percent from 1995 through 2001 , germany had only spent 6 and 7 percent more respectively , the study said .
in oecd countries , the number of college and university students increased by an average of 40 percent . but germany , austria and france experienced no growth at all . " the qualification level in the oecd states has risen dramatically since 1995 , while in germany nothing has happened , " german education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said .
the social democrat appealed to the opposition christian democratic union-run states to cooperate with the federal government to eliminate subsidies for homeowners and instead invest the money in education and research .
the lion 's share of german education funding and policy is determined at the state level . below average the study said germany spent less money than the average on each student and more on teachers ' salaries .
seven- and eight-year-old german pupils receive 160 fewer hours of lessons than the oecd average .
the discrepancy decreases in secondary schools , though 15-year-olds still get 66 hours of instruction less than the oecd midpoint .
kindergarten and primary school classes are also larger than the oecd average , which means that the children inevitably receive less individual attention aat one of the most crucial points in their education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher of the oecd “ what we have observed over time is that some countries have very dynamically expanded and extended their educational services , and in germany that kind of dynamic has been much less pronounced , " andreas schleicher , one of the study 's authors told dw-radio .
" over time , the divergence between the countries that move very fast and those that do not change is becoming bigger , ” he said . no longer the country of poets and philosophers three years ago , the oecd 's pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading , math and science when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
the assessment came as a shock to germans , who see their land as the “ country of poets and philosophers . ” education minister buhlman -lrb- photo , below -rrb- subsequently initiated a program to increase the number of all-day schools in germany , which the current report praised .
around 3,000 schools now provide full-day instruction .
but the majority of schools in germany continue to operate on a half-day basis , with lessons ending around lunchtime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn although he lauded the program , schleicher , who also coordinates the pisa study , said that all-day schools are already the norm in other oecd countries .
he focused criticism on germany 's track system , which separates students into different classes and schools depending on their achievements , thus determining whether they will gain the necessary qualifications to pursue further training or go to university after secondary school . in other countries " differences between people , between talents are not seen so much as a problem that must be resolved through school structures .
instead they deal with it constructively , " schleicher said . intensive discussion doris ahnen , the head of the education ministers ' conference , which is made up of the 16 state education ministers and senators , rebuffed the oecd criticism .

but when it comes to a car 's performance , they would rather take a drive than get their hands dirty fixing the motor . when germany 's automobile club for women was founded back in may 1926 with seven members , cars were still something of a rarity on german streets .
the site of a woman behind the wheel was virtually unheard of - let alone the notion of a lady actually taking an avid interest in the motorized vehicles .
but the founding mothers of ddac were not discouraged .
just two years after establishing the club , the motoring women organized their first long-distance race from berlin to oberhof , in southern germany .
the competition lasted two days and covered a stretch of 750 kilometers -lrb- 466 miles -rrb- .
today , that hardly seems much of a challenge , but more than 70 years ago , just arriving at the finish line was a real accomplishment .
more often than not , a car ended up in a ditch alongside the potholed roads .
back then the women had to rely a lot more on sheer strength and driving dexterity : there was no power steering , no four-wheel drive , no suspension system to assist the early women drivers .
since then , cars have developed by leaps and bounds in terms of technology and safety .
but the members of ddac have n't lost interest in the main focus of their club : driving for fun and leisure .

but when it comes to a car 's performance , they would rather take a drive than get their hands dirty fixing the motor . when germany 's automobile club for women was founded back in may 1926 with seven members , cars were still something of a rarity on german streets .
the site of a woman behind the wheel was virtually unheard of - let alone the notion of a lady actually taking an avid interest in the motorized vehicles .
but the founding mothers of ddac were not discouraged .
just two years after establishing the club , the motoring women organized their first long-distance race from berlin to oberhof , in southern germany .
the competition lasted two days and covered a stretch of 750 kilometers -lrb- 466 miles -rrb- .
today , that hardly seems much of a challenge , but more than 70 years ago , just arriving at the finish line was a real accomplishment .
more often than not , a car ended up in a ditch alongside the potholed roads .
back then the women had to rely a lot more on sheer strength and driving dexterity : there was no power steering , no four-wheel drive , no suspension system to assist the early women drivers .
since then , cars have developed by leaps and bounds in terms of technology and safety .
but the members of ddac have n't lost interest in the main focus of their club : driving for fun and leisure .

2 ; on the eve of the anniversary of german reunification in 1990 . the labor market changes will hit the former communist east hardest .
unemployment there is twice that in the west and young people have been abandoning the region in droves in search of a better future . ahead of the elections in brandenburg and saxony , voters have shown increasing signs they are disenchanted with chancellor gerhard schröder 's failure to find them jobs and revitalize the euro zone 's biggest economy . opinion polls suggest they will turn to parties on both extremes of the political spectrum , heaping more pressure on schröder in the wake of several recent bad election results . divisions also appear to be surfacing between eastern and western regions , with some in the more affluent parts of the country showing open resentment to the billions in " solidarity " payments that have been made to the east since the early 1990s . presidential participation german president horst köhler , a former head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , became mired in that debate after his comments in the weekly focus magazine were perceived as encouraging an abandoning of the eastern states . " there were and there are big differences in living standards everywhere in germany .
it 's the same from north to south as it is from east to west , " köhler told the news magazine in its monday edition . " if you want to level them out , you cement in place a subsidized state and place an intolerable burden of debt on the younger generation .
we must get away from a subsidised state , " he said . his remarks won a broadside from agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast , who said : " it 's not a president 's job to say : ' take care of your problems on your own . " ' the reaction to a prominent political figure addressing the virtual taboo of social inequality was also indicative of how much progress has been made just two months before the 15th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall . " it 's the first time that a senior german politician has called into question the central doctrine of unified germany , " said the daily berliner zeitung . " equalizing living standards is one of the founding myths of the united germany , " its editorial read under the headline " köhler was right .

the proposal is seen as another example of team chief jürgen klinsmann 's growing control . despite playing host to soccer 's most prestigious event , the world cup , in 2006 , germany may not play the opening game of the tournament .
germany 's organizing committee chairman franz beckenbauer said on monday that the option to pass the honor to reigning world champions brazil , providing they qualify , was being discussed . since 1974 the world cup winners have taken to the field in the opening match and it is expected that germany will allow this tradition to continue with brazil opening the tournament on june 9 , 2006 at munich 's new allianz arena . beckenbauer also confirmed that the possibility arose from discussions held with team chief jürgen klinsmann who had expressed a preference for the hosts to start the tournament three days later at the olympic stadium in berlin than in the opening match in munich .

" made in germany " may soon be outdated . it 's an open secret that german carmakers are frustrated with high wages , employee benefits and inflexible working conditions , and that many are considering a move as a way out of the dilemma .
many in the sector have already set up manufacturing facilities abroad where wages and production costs are considerably lower than back home .
nearly every third german car supplier is already producing in eastern europe , and every sixth one has already set up sites in china .
but that 's only the beginning : every second automobile parts manufacturer is planning to move its production facilities outside of germany , according to a study published by the business consultancy firm ernst & young on monday .
looking to the east and far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car manufacturing in china - cheap and efficient .
the stuttgart-based business consultancy surveyed 200 german car suppliers with an annual turnover of between € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.12 million -rrb- and € 500 million .
nearly every second company had already established at least one production site abroad , and almost 40 percent of those questioned said they had concrete plans for shifting parts of their production to eastern europe .
some 23 percent , or close to one-fourth of all suppliers , said they planned to invest in china .
peter fuss , one of the authors of the ernst & young study said that various factors played a role in a company 's decision to move production outside germany .
whereas eastern europe attracts car companies primarily because of the low wages , he said china is particularly interesting because of its proximity to the growing asian market .
" logistical costs can be kept low because companies produce for the local market and parts do n't have to be shipped from western europe to china , " he said .
expanding exodus in a worldwide comparison of production sites , china and the czech republic topped the list , followed by hungary and poland .
both regions , china and eastern europe received top marks for car suppliers for low wage costs -lrb- 15 to 20 percent less than the hourly wage in germany -rrb- and in terms of flexibility and motivation of employees .
tax breaks and benefits for investing in industrially weak regions - aspects frequently criticized as unfair advantages by western european politicians - hardly played a role at all in the decision to move production outside of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes slk production in bremen according to ernst & young , fewer and fewer new manufacturing sites will be opened in western europe in the future .
while more factories close in germany and its neighboring western countries , the move east will not be limited to just the production of parts .
" over time things will develop , " fuss said .
" the companies interviewed in the survey clearly indicated that they are planning to move final assembly stages to eastern europe and china in the near future . "
that would mean that more complicated manufacturing processes - up to now largely based in germany would be affected by the outsourcing .
is germany 's auto industry at risk ?
the ernst & young study concluded that germany 's long tradition as a center of auto manufacturing is indeed in danger as more and more companies pack up and leave in search of better conditions abroad .
at the same time , the move abroad represents " the last chance the companies have to reduce costs and remain competitive in the international market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20 million vw golfs have rolled off the assembly line at the carmaker 's headquarters in wolfsburg but the study also said that although manufacturing will move , germany will continue to hold on to its claim as a nation of carmakers in the fields of branding - the label " made in germany " will still hold sway over car buyers - and in the critical area of research and development .
however , in order to capitalize on these strengths in the future , it will be crucial to identify innovative companies in these fields and promote them internationally , fuss said .
the threat of moving east is not necessarily connected to the loss of jobs , the study reported , with a view to the country 's rising unemployment rate .
" within the last few years there has been a considerable increase in the number of companies moving production to eastern europe and china , " fuss said .
" but during that same time there has also been an increase in jobs in the car sector in germany . "
the key to guaranteeing that those jobs remain in germany in the future , is to focus more on innovation , design , research and development , he added . rolf wenkel -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 30,000 jobs on line at volkswagen europe 's biggest carmaker said 30,000 jobs could be cut in germany if unions do not agree to cost-cutting plans .

the stuttgart-based business consultancy surveyed 200 german car suppliers with an annual turnover of between € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.12 million -rrb- and € 500 million .
nearly every second company had already established at least one production site abroad , and almost 40 percent of those questioned said they had concrete plans for shifting parts of their production to eastern europe .
some 23 percent , or close to one-fourth of all suppliers , said they planned to invest in china .
peter fuss , one of the authors of the ernst & young study said that various factors played a role in a company 's decision to move production outside germany .
whereas eastern europe attracts car companies primarily because of the low wages , he said china is particularly interesting because of its proximity to the growing asian market .
" logistical costs can be kept low because companies produce for the local market and parts do n't have to be shipped from western europe to china , " he said .
expanding exodus in a worldwide comparison of production sites , china and the czech republic topped the list , followed by hungary and poland .
both regions , china and eastern europe received top marks for car suppliers for low wage costs -lrb- 15 to 20 percent less than the hourly wage in germany -rrb- and in terms of flexibility and motivation of employees .
tax breaks and benefits for investing in industrially weak regions - aspects frequently criticized as unfair advantages by western european politicians - hardly played a role at all in the decision to move production outside of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes slk production in bremen according to ernst & young , fewer and fewer new manufacturing sites will be opened in western europe in the future .
while more factories close in germany and its neighboring western countries , the move east will not be limited to just the production of parts .
" over time things will develop , " fuss said .
" the companies interviewed in the survey clearly indicated that they are planning to move final assembly stages to eastern europe and china in the near future . "
that would mean that more complicated manufacturing processes - up to now largely based in germany would be affected by the outsourcing .
is germany 's auto industry at risk ?
the ernst & young study concluded that germany 's long tradition as a center of auto manufacturing is indeed in danger as more and more companies pack up and leave in search of better conditions abroad .
at the same time , the move abroad represents " the last chance the companies have to reduce costs and remain competitive in the international market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20 million vw golfs have rolled off the assembly line at the carmaker 's headquarters in wolfsburg but the study also said that although manufacturing will move , germany will continue to hold on to its claim as a nation of carmakers in the fields of branding - the label " made in germany " will still hold sway over car buyers - and in the critical area of research and development .
however , in order to capitalize on these strengths in the future , it will be crucial to identify innovative companies in these fields and promote them internationally , fuss said .
the threat of moving east is not necessarily connected to the loss of jobs , the study reported , with a view to the country 's rising unemployment rate .
" within the last few years there has been a considerable increase in the number of companies moving production to eastern europe and china , " fuss said .
" but during that same time there has also been an increase in jobs in the car sector in germany . "

peter fuss , one of the authors of the ernst & young study said that various factors played a role in a company 's decision to move production outside germany .
whereas eastern europe attracts car companies primarily because of the low wages , he said china is particularly interesting because of its proximity to the growing asian market .
" logistical costs can be kept low because companies produce for the local market and parts do n't have to be shipped from western europe to china , " he said .
expanding exodus in a worldwide comparison of production sites , china and the czech republic topped the list , followed by hungary and poland .
both regions , china and eastern europe received top marks for car suppliers for low wage costs -lrb- 15 to 20 percent less than the hourly wage in germany -rrb- and in terms of flexibility and motivation of employees .
tax breaks and benefits for investing in industrially weak regions - aspects frequently criticized as unfair advantages by western european politicians - hardly played a role at all in the decision to move production outside of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes slk production in bremen according to ernst & young , fewer and fewer new manufacturing sites will be opened in western europe in the future .
while more factories close in germany and its neighboring western countries , the move east will not be limited to just the production of parts .
" over time things will develop , " fuss said .
" the companies interviewed in the survey clearly indicated that they are planning to move final assembly stages to eastern europe and china in the near future . "
that would mean that more complicated manufacturing processes - up to now largely based in germany would be affected by the outsourcing .
is germany 's auto industry at risk ?
the ernst & young study concluded that germany 's long tradition as a center of auto manufacturing is indeed in danger as more and more companies pack up and leave in search of better conditions abroad .
at the same time , the move abroad represents " the last chance the companies have to reduce costs and remain competitive in the international market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 20 million vw golfs have rolled off the assembly line at the carmaker 's headquarters in wolfsburg but the study also said that although manufacturing will move , germany will continue to hold on to its claim as a nation of carmakers in the fields of branding - the label " made in germany " will still hold sway over car buyers - and in the critical area of research and development .
however , in order to capitalize on these strengths in the future , it will be crucial to identify innovative companies in these fields and promote them internationally , fuss said .
the threat of moving east is not necessarily connected to the loss of jobs , the study reported , with a view to the country 's rising unemployment rate .
" within the last few years there has been a considerable increase in the number of companies moving production to eastern europe and china , " fuss said .
" but during that same time there has also been an increase in jobs in the car sector in germany . "
the key to guaranteeing that those jobs remain in germany in the future , is to focus more on innovation , design , research and development , he added . rolf wenkel -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 30,000 jobs on line at volkswagen europe 's biggest carmaker said 30,000 jobs could be cut in germany if unions do not agree to cost-cutting plans .

without significant educational reforms , germany could forfeit its economical competitiveness , the report warned . while oecd states increased their investments in primary and secondary schools by 21 percent and in universities by 30 percent from 1995 through 2001 , germany had only spent 6 and 7 percent more respectively , the study said .
in oecd countries , the number of college and university students increased by an average of 40 percent . but germany , austria and france experienced no growth at all .

so why does it have such a bad reputation ? “ so if your body were berlin , which part would you get rid of , ” performance artists from the gob squad theater group asked the crowd on the recent opening night of the volkspalas t festival in berlin ’ s palace of the republic , which is welcoming the public until it closes for the last time in november . the gob squad ’ s badgering of visitors highlighted the building ’ s sorry plight .
an in-your-face example of everything that was wrong with east german urban planning , it 's fatally out of fashion - and it has to go . at least , according to the bundestag . resisting the inevitable ? but it ’ s not going quietly .
plenty of people would like it to remain , at least until berlin is better able to foot the bill for its demolition . given the city ’ s € 50 billion -lrb- $ 61.2 billion -rrb- debt , it seems like a sensible solution . “ right now , the idea of rebuilding the palace is completely inappropriate , ” said dagmar richter , a german-american architecture professor and critic . ron bloch , a spokesman for volkspalast festival , agreed . “ in these times of hartz iv -lrb- controversial social welfare reforms , -rrb- the government has more urgent things to worry about than tearing down an intact building at a cost of up to € 60 million , ” he observed wryly . so why exactly did the bundestag vote to tear down the palace of the republic and erect a copy of a baroque hohenzollern palace in its place ? ideological baggage crucially , the building is not just aesthetically out of fashion , it ’ s politically passé , too . in few other cities does urban planning carry the same sort of baggage it does in berlin .
what with the german capital ’ s unusually turbulent past , architecture has a political dimension which ensures it ’ s regularly propelled into mainstream debate . “ given the many turning points in german history - 1918 , 1933 , 1945 and 1989 - architecture in germany has , without a doubt , been considerably more politicized than in other countries , ” said hartmut frank , an architect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with simone hain , formerly of east germany ’ s prestigious bauakademie , frank has curated an exhibition with the title two german architectures which opens in leipzig this week .
organized by germany 's institute for foreign relations , or ifa , it illustrates that ultimately , east and west german architecture had more in common than might have been expected . as andreas ruby wrote in the german weekly die zeit , many buildings that typify east german architecture would be considered “ characteristic and quality examples of european architecture of the post-war decades if they ’ d been built , say , in cologne . ”
the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .
since 1989 , urban planners have been acutely aware that banishing the city ’ s communist legacy is a matter of both psychological and physical transformation . the process began in the early 1990s when statues of communist heroes were unceremoniously removed and many of east berlin ’ s streets rechristened .
monuments to lenin were dismantled , marx-engels-platz became hackescher markt - and the oppressive era of socialist dictatorship became an increasingly distant memory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ architecture here is much more about politics than aesthetics , ” she said , explaining the drab , minimalist look of many 1950s east german buildings .
“ that always meant architecture had less of an opportunity to be expressive than in a highly consumerist society like the us . ” richter also pointed out that germany was and still is scarred by the overtly monumental vision of nazi architect albert speer and has shyed away from bombastic building ever since . “ what we have instead is architecture that has more of a political role in the urban fabric , ” she said , adding that it ’ s a sign of the times that the architects currently involved in redesigning the city - such as helmut jahn and hans kollhoff , the man behind the plans for the new alexanderplatz in central berlin - are famously conservative , “ corporate ” architects . retro classics worth preserving but as berliners witness the bricks and mortar traces of the soviet era slowly disappear , many have reclaimed aspects of east german architecture and design as retro classics eminently worth preserving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen years after the fall of the wall , it ’ s more than okay to have a sentimental attachment to east germany - it ’ s positively fashionable .
the party crowd is flocking to the capital ’ s hip havens of sputnik chic , with 1960s-built venues such as cafe moskau and kino kosmos enjoying unprecedented popularity . not even its new-found fans would describe it as beautiful - but if it gets a stay of execution , perhaps the day will come when even the palace of the republic is considered fashionable . two german architectures runs from sept .

organized by germany 's institute for foreign relations , or ifa , it illustrates that ultimately , east and west german architecture had more in common than might have been expected . as andreas ruby wrote in the german weekly die zeit , many buildings that typify east german architecture would be considered “ characteristic and quality examples of european architecture of the post-war decades if they ’ d been built , say , in cologne . ”
the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .
since 1989 , urban planners have been acutely aware that banishing the city ’ s communist legacy is a matter of both psychological and physical transformation . the process began in the early 1990s when statues of communist heroes were unceremoniously removed and many of east berlin ’ s streets rechristened .
monuments to lenin were dismantled , marx-engels-platz became hackescher markt - and the oppressive era of socialist dictatorship became an increasingly distant memory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ architecture here is much more about politics than aesthetics , ” she said , explaining the drab , minimalist look of many 1950s east german buildings .
“ that always meant architecture had less of an opportunity to be expressive than in a highly consumerist society like the us . ” richter also pointed out that germany was and still is scarred by the overtly monumental vision of nazi architect albert speer and has shyed away from bombastic building ever since . “ what we have instead is architecture that has more of a political role in the urban fabric , ” she said , adding that it ’ s a sign of the times that the architects currently involved in redesigning the city - such as helmut jahn and hans kollhoff , the man behind the plans for the new alexanderplatz in central berlin - are famously conservative , “ corporate ” architects . retro classics worth preserving but as berliners witness the bricks and mortar traces of the soviet era slowly disappear , many have reclaimed aspects of east german architecture and design as retro classics eminently worth preserving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen years after the fall of the wall , it ’ s more than okay to have a sentimental attachment to east germany - it ’ s positively fashionable .
the party crowd is flocking to the capital ’ s hip havens of sputnik chic , with 1960s-built venues such as cafe moskau and kino kosmos enjoying unprecedented popularity . not even its new-found fans would describe it as beautiful - but if it gets a stay of execution , perhaps the day will come when even the palace of the republic is considered fashionable . two german architectures runs from sept .

“ that always meant architecture had less of an opportunity to be expressive than in a highly consumerist society like the us . ” richter also pointed out that germany was and still is scarred by the overtly monumental vision of nazi architect albert speer and has shyed away from bombastic building ever since . “ what we have instead is architecture that has more of a political role in the urban fabric , ” she said , adding that it ’ s a sign of the times that the architects currently involved in redesigning the city - such as helmut jahn and hans kollhoff , the man behind the plans for the new alexanderplatz in central berlin - are famously conservative , “ corporate ” architects . retro classics worth preserving but as berliners witness the bricks and mortar traces of the soviet era slowly disappear , many have reclaimed aspects of east german architecture and design as retro classics eminently worth preserving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen years after the fall of the wall , it ’ s more than okay to have a sentimental attachment to east germany - it ’ s positively fashionable .

but when it comes to a car 's performance , they would rather take a drive than get their hands dirty fixing the motor . when germany 's automobile club for women was founded back in may 1926 with seven members , cars were still something of a rarity on german streets .
the site of a woman behind the wheel was virtually unheard of - let alone the notion of a lady actually taking an avid interest in the motorized vehicles .
but the founding mothers of ddac were not discouraged .
just two years after establishing the club , the motoring women organized their first long-distance race from berlin to oberhof , in southern germany .
the competition lasted two days and covered a stretch of 750 kilometers -lrb- 466 miles -rrb- .
today , that hardly seems much of a challenge , but more than 70 years ago , just arriving at the finish line was a real accomplishment .
more often than not , a car ended up in a ditch alongside the potholed roads .
back then the women had to rely a lot more on sheer strength and driving dexterity : there was no power steering , no four-wheel drive , no suspension system to assist the early women drivers .
since then , cars have developed by leaps and bounds in terms of technology and safety .
but the members of ddac have n't lost interest in the main focus of their club : driving for fun and leisure .
driving for fun " we drive normal cars , " christa reiners , head of the ddac branch in rheinland-ruhr in western germany , told dw-world .
" from the compact class to the large family car , everything has a place in our group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women drivers are no longer a rarity whereas their male counterparts frequently spend a good bit of time tuning up their motors and outfitting their cars with the latest in computer-assisted technology , the members of ddac rarely pick up a wrench .
instead , safety is their top priority .
" it is especially important that our vehicles are in excellent working condition , " reiners said , describing the ddac 's inclinations , which do n't differ that much from the interests and concerns of the average woman driver .
" complicated repairs are dealt with at the mechanic 's workshop . "
as a result , greasy hands and overalls are less common than extended car tours across the country .
christa reiners said the relationship between the club 's members and their automobiles is " rather playful , " but nonetheless demanding .
" in keeping with the tradition of our club , we are n't primarily interested in speeding , but rather in performing difficult orientation exercises or tests of skill , " she said .
taking women drivers seriously the way women think about cars is n't just visible on the road .
when faced with purchasing a new vehicle , many of their specific interests play a key role in decision-making .
however , a recent marketing study by the vocational college of niederrhein showed that woman often feel they are not taken seriously in the sales room .
" women are frequently insecure when they buy a car and they reveal that weakness to the salesperson , " said doris kortus-schultes .
the professor and author of the study examined the buying habits and interests of more than 1,200 women drivers , including car experts , senior citizens and immigrants .
according to the study , which the german women 's automobile club supported , female drivers do n't necessarily want to see more saleswomen in the showroom , but they do want to see more emphasis placed on honesty , respect , trustworthiness and understanding when it comes to selling a car .
even after the purchase , the women interviewed said they would like to have easy-to-read instruction manuals and a personal explanation and demonstration of a car 's features .
perhaps if female drivers are taken more seriously both on and off the road , the number of women who take an interest in their cars beyond the simple transportation aspect will also grow . ingo uhlenbruch -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de why german women ca n't read maps … but can park the car only some of the clichés about german drivers are true according to a new study .
-lrb- aug .
28 , 2003 -rrb- car design à la lady even in this achingly modern 21st century , prejudice and preconception about dreaded " women drivers " still abound .
but there 's news for these macho male roadsters : women design cars .

so why does it have such a bad reputation ? “ so if your body were berlin , which part would you get rid of , ” performance artists from the gob squad theater group asked the crowd on the recent opening night of the volkspalas t festival in berlin ’ s palace of the republic , which is welcoming the public until it closes for the last time in november . the gob squad ’ s badgering of visitors highlighted the building ’ s sorry plight .
an in-your-face example of everything that was wrong with east german urban planning , it 's fatally out of fashion - and it has to go . at least , according to the bundestag . resisting the inevitable ? but it ’ s not going quietly .
plenty of people would like it to remain , at least until berlin is better able to foot the bill for its demolition . given the city ’ s € 50 billion -lrb- $ 61.2 billion -rrb- debt , it seems like a sensible solution . “ right now , the idea of rebuilding the palace is completely inappropriate , ” said dagmar richter , a german-american architecture professor and critic . ron bloch , a spokesman for volkspalast festival , agreed . “ in these times of hartz iv -lrb- controversial social welfare reforms , -rrb- the government has more urgent things to worry about than tearing down an intact building at a cost of up to € 60 million , ” he observed wryly . so why exactly did the bundestag vote to tear down the palace of the republic and erect a copy of a baroque hohenzollern palace in its place ? ideological baggage crucially , the building is not just aesthetically out of fashion , it ’ s politically passé , too . in few other cities does urban planning carry the same sort of baggage it does in berlin .
what with the german capital ’ s unusually turbulent past , architecture has a political dimension which ensures it ’ s regularly propelled into mainstream debate . “ given the many turning points in german history - 1918 , 1933 , 1945 and 1989 - architecture in germany has , without a doubt , been considerably more politicized than in other countries , ” said hartmut frank , an architect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with simone hain , formerly of east germany ’ s prestigious bauakademie , frank has curated an exhibition with the title two german architectures which opens in leipzig this week .
organized by germany 's institute for foreign relations , or ifa , it illustrates that ultimately , east and west german architecture had more in common than might have been expected . as andreas ruby wrote in the german weekly die zeit , many buildings that typify east german architecture would be considered “ characteristic and quality examples of european architecture of the post-war decades if they ’ d been built , say , in cologne . ”
the trouble is that “ their historical complicity with the political system of the gdr makes them architectura non grata , ” he added . “ architects in the weimar republic , the third reich , and both halves of germany in the post-war years were forced to throw their own convictions overboard and accept the prevailing ethos , ” frank said .
“ this meant their decisions were often as much political as architectural . ” “ our exhibition attempts to answer the question : is architecture autonomous ? ” he continued .
“ we wanted to explore to what extent architecture is independent from political systems . ” berlin as an architectural battleground it seems the answer is : not very .
in recent years , berlin has been a battleground for conflicting architectural visions reflecting political agendas . new german architecture , 1980 – 1990 , another ifa exhibition now on an international tour , demonstrates that east german architects were given short shrift after the wall fell , frank told dw-world . “ they were more or less obliged to clear the field , ” he said .
“ they were barely involved at all in the building boom that occurred after re-unification , and the high-profile commissions went to west german architects . ” systematic erasure even so , it hasn ’ t been easy laying to rest the ghost of the german democratic republic when the city bears so much concrete testimony to this most recent chapter in germany ’ s troubled history . according to dagmar richter , today ’ s architectural decisions are motivated first and foremost by a need actively to erase traces of east germany .
since 1989 , urban planners have been acutely aware that banishing the city ’ s communist legacy is a matter of both psychological and physical transformation . the process began in the early 1990s when statues of communist heroes were unceremoniously removed and many of east berlin ’ s streets rechristened .
monuments to lenin were dismantled , marx-engels-platz became hackescher markt - and the oppressive era of socialist dictatorship became an increasingly distant memory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ architecture here is much more about politics than aesthetics , ” she said , explaining the drab , minimalist look of many 1950s east german buildings .
“ that always meant architecture had less of an opportunity to be expressive than in a highly consumerist society like the us . ” richter also pointed out that germany was and still is scarred by the overtly monumental vision of nazi architect albert speer and has shyed away from bombastic building ever since . “ what we have instead is architecture that has more of a political role in the urban fabric , ” she said , adding that it ’ s a sign of the times that the architects currently involved in redesigning the city - such as helmut jahn and hans kollhoff , the man behind the plans for the new alexanderplatz in central berlin - are famously conservative , “ corporate ” architects . retro classics worth preserving but as berliners witness the bricks and mortar traces of the soviet era slowly disappear , many have reclaimed aspects of east german architecture and design as retro classics eminently worth preserving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen years after the fall of the wall , it ’ s more than okay to have a sentimental attachment to east germany - it ’ s positively fashionable .
the party crowd is flocking to the capital ’ s hip havens of sputnik chic , with 1960s-built venues such as cafe moskau and kino kosmos enjoying unprecedented popularity . not even its new-found fans would describe it as beautiful - but if it gets a stay of execution , perhaps the day will come when even the palace of the republic is considered fashionable . two german architectures runs from sept .

an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees . the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- annual report “ education at a glance , ” published tuesday , has dealt another blow to an already stricken german education policy . the study , which compares education systems in the 30 oecd member countries , indicated that germany has a lot of work to do if it wants to produce graduates with qualifications comparable to other developed countries .
without significant educational reforms , germany could forfeit its economical competitiveness , the report warned . while oecd states increased their investments in primary and secondary schools by 21 percent and in universities by 30 percent from 1995 through 2001 , germany had only spent 6 and 7 percent more respectively , the study said .
in oecd countries , the number of college and university students increased by an average of 40 percent . but germany , austria and france experienced no growth at all . " the qualification level in the oecd states has risen dramatically since 1995 , while in germany nothing has happened , " german education and research minister edelgard bulmahn said .
the social democrat appealed to the opposition christian democratic union-run states to cooperate with the federal government to eliminate subsidies for homeowners and instead invest the money in education and research .
the lion 's share of german education funding and policy is determined at the state level . below average the study said germany spent less money than the average on each student and more on teachers ' salaries .
seven- and eight-year-old german pupils receive 160 fewer hours of lessons than the oecd average .
the discrepancy decreases in secondary schools , though 15-year-olds still get 66 hours of instruction less than the oecd midpoint .
kindergarten and primary school classes are also larger than the oecd average , which means that the children inevitably receive less individual attention aat one of the most crucial points in their education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher of the oecd “ what we have observed over time is that some countries have very dynamically expanded and extended their educational services , and in germany that kind of dynamic has been much less pronounced , " andreas schleicher , one of the study 's authors told dw-radio .
" over time , the divergence between the countries that move very fast and those that do not change is becoming bigger , ” he said . no longer the country of poets and philosophers three years ago , the oecd 's pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading , math and science when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
the assessment came as a shock to germans , who see their land as the “ country of poets and philosophers . ” education minister buhlman -lrb- photo , below -rrb- subsequently initiated a program to increase the number of all-day schools in germany , which the current report praised .
around 3,000 schools now provide full-day instruction .

he focused criticism on germany 's track system , which separates students into different classes and schools depending on their achievements , thus determining whether they will gain the necessary qualifications to pursue further training or go to university after secondary school . in other countries " differences between people , between talents are not seen so much as a problem that must be resolved through school structures .
instead they deal with it constructively , " schleicher said . intensive discussion doris ahnen , the head of the education ministers ' conference , which is made up of the 16 state education ministers and senators , rebuffed the oecd criticism .
" in hardly another country has education been discussed so intensively since pisa , " bavarian public broadcaster bayerische rundfunk quoted ahnen as saying . bildunterschrift : baden-wurttemberg 's education minister , annette schavan , also dismissed the study .

darrin duber-smith , a marketing consultant and professor , argued passionately that the ban was unimportant .
" i am not concerned .
automatic weapons have been illegal for years , " said mr duber-smith .
