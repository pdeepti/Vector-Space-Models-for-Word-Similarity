all eyes were focused on irish prime minister bertie ahern , who as the current helmsman of the rotating eu presidency , is charged with the tricky task of kick-starting the stalled negotiations on creating a european constitution . talks to sign off a draft constitution collapsed in december when european leaders came to blows over voting weights .

“ i can not promise that the constitution will be agreed in our presidency , but equally it would be premature to conclude that it will not , ” ahern said .

“ our problems with nice are quite different .
the decision mechanisms in the nice treaty are based on blocking minorities .

“ european union spending must be stabilised and should not make up more than one percent of gross national product , ” said fischer . the foreign minister also spoke out in favour of negotiations on allowing turkey to join the eu .

all eyes were focused on irish prime minister bertie ahern , who as the current helmsman of the rotating eu presidency , is charged with the tricky task of kick-starting the stalled negotiations on creating a european constitution . talks to sign off a draft constitution collapsed in december when european leaders came to blows over voting weights .
now , with the advent of a new year come fresh talks , and no matter how tough the job might be , bertie ahern is optimistic that agreement can be reached by the end of 2004 .
“ i can not promise that the constitution will be agreed in our presidency , but equally it would be premature to conclude that it will not , ” ahern said .

young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service . german politicians have long been debating plans to abandon the draft in favor of a professional army .
but getting rid of conscription would also entail an end to its alternative - community service .
the details are as yet unconfirmed , but the government this year looks set to shorten the length of compulsory community service from 10 to nine months - the same that is required for military service .
according to reports in the financial times deutschland , this would be the first step towards a phase-out of both military and community service by 2008 .
a government spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports ahead of a meeting on thursday , when the minister for family affairs renate schmidt , is due to present her report on the future of community service .
a coming catastrophe ?
around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service in a senior citizen 's home charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
joachim kendelbacher from the workers ' welfare organisation told deutsche welle that his organisation , which currently employs around 6,000 people doing their alternative community service , would suffer heavily if their jobs were to be cut .
" we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , " he said .
" in some sectors this will certainly be the case .
i ’ m thinking of services like going for walks with old people in the nursing homes , reading literature to old people or doing office work .
if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . "
schmidt has said that , should community service be cut , she is demanding a five-year phase-out period .
" assuming that the decision to end community service comes in this year , we 'd need until 2010 to come to terms with the reorganization that would be needed , " she said .
" we ca n't just get rid of conscription overnight .
otherwise essential social structures would simply break apart . "
schmidt said that she is generally not against mandatory service .
" but the duties of the armed forces have changed .
aside from this , we ca n't provide for the military when , each year , we 're only getting less than half of the people up for service into the military . "
holding onto compulsory community service once military service is abolished would be unconstitutional in schmidt 's view .
she says voluntary service should receive more recognition and more financial backing , perhaps from the € 885 million a year currently spent on the community service program .
bundeswehr cuts german defence minister peter struck is already preparing the armed forces structurally for the post-conscription era of fewer troops and a tighter budget .
he 's reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion .
over the weekend , struck said that in times when germany is having to enforce painful cuts in the social and welfare system , the armed forces also have to expect budget cuts .
" all of my 12 predecessors have had to deal with the same phenomenon , " struck said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the soldiers want more money than is available .
this is nothing new . "
struck said all divisions of the armed forces - naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts , and that the government will buy only the most necessary pieces of equipment .
planned purchases of tanks and helicopters may either have to be downsized or cancelled .
some military bases will be closed .
opposition conservative leaders have called the planned cuts a " waterloo for the bundeswehr . "
christian democrat defence spokesman christian schmidt said that the drastic savings measures will painfully reduce the armed forces ’ clout in future peace-keeping and peace-enforcing missions abroad .
however , struck said the cuts are in keeping with an overall restructuring plan for the bundeswehr to prepare it for new strategic objectives within the nato alliance and the planned european rapid response force . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de united states , germany plan major military restructuring the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .

around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service in a senior citizen 's home charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
joachim kendelbacher from the workers ' welfare organisation told deutsche welle that his organisation , which currently employs around 6,000 people doing their alternative community service , would suffer heavily if their jobs were to be cut .
" we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , " he said .
" in some sectors this will certainly be the case .
i ’ m thinking of services like going for walks with old people in the nursing homes , reading literature to old people or doing office work .
if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . "
schmidt has said that , should community service be cut , she is demanding a five-year phase-out period .
" assuming that the decision to end community service comes in this year , we 'd need until 2010 to come to terms with the reorganization that would be needed , " she said .
" we ca n't just get rid of conscription overnight .
otherwise essential social structures would simply break apart . "
schmidt said that she is generally not against mandatory service .
" but the duties of the armed forces have changed .
aside from this , we ca n't provide for the military when , each year , we 're only getting less than half of the people up for service into the military . "
holding onto compulsory community service once military service is abolished would be unconstitutional in schmidt 's view .
she says voluntary service should receive more recognition and more financial backing , perhaps from the € 885 million a year currently spent on the community service program .
bundeswehr cuts german defence minister peter struck is already preparing the armed forces structurally for the post-conscription era of fewer troops and a tighter budget .
he 's reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion .
over the weekend , struck said that in times when germany is having to enforce painful cuts in the social and welfare system , the armed forces also have to expect budget cuts .
" all of my 12 predecessors have had to deal with the same phenomenon , " struck said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the soldiers want more money than is available .
this is nothing new . "
struck said all divisions of the armed forces - naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts , and that the government will buy only the most necessary pieces of equipment .
planned purchases of tanks and helicopters may either have to be downsized or cancelled .
some military bases will be closed .
opposition conservative leaders have called the planned cuts a " waterloo for the bundeswehr . "
christian democrat defence spokesman christian schmidt said that the drastic savings measures will painfully reduce the armed forces ’ clout in future peace-keeping and peace-enforcing missions abroad .

all eyes were focused on irish prime minister bertie ahern , who as the current helmsman of the rotating eu presidency , is charged with the tricky task of kick-starting the stalled negotiations on creating a european constitution . talks to sign off a draft constitution collapsed in december when european leaders came to blows over voting weights .
now , with the advent of a new year come fresh talks , and no matter how tough the job might be , bertie ahern is optimistic that agreement can be reached by the end of 2004 .
“ i can not promise that the constitution will be agreed in our presidency , but equally it would be premature to conclude that it will not , ” ahern said .
he added that it would be preferable for agreement to be reached as soon as possible , as failure to do so could result in the development of a dangerous vacuum . german support german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the forum in place of chancellor gerhard schröder , who was ill , pledged ahern germany ’ s full support .
he , too , stressed the importance of agreeing on a constitution before the end of the year , warning that failure to achieve this would result in a single europe which moved at different speeds . in the absence of a constitution , europe is bound by the decision-making processes set out in the nice treaty .
it was this treaty under which spain and poland were granted what many perceive as disproportionate power and almost as many votes as much larger union states such as france and germany .
the nice treaty contributed to the deadlock in constitution talks at the end of last year . but fischer was quick to emphasize that the problems with the nice treaty are not about voting weights .
“ our problems with nice are quite different .
the decision mechanisms in the nice treaty are based on blocking minorities .
under the nice model 90 votes are needed to block decisions , ” fischer said at the forum . those in favor of the draft constitution maintain that it will make it more difficult for motions to be blocked when the union expands from 15 to 25 members on may 1 .
and being able to make decisions clearly and quickly is crucial for europe .
as joschka fischer was at pains to point out at the forum .
“ the world won ’ t wait for europe , and europe can not play an effective role in the world if it is caught up in arguments on majorities and money , ” he said . measured spending indeed fischer was vocal on future spending patterns within the eu , stressing that when the 10 new states become official members in the spring , the union should not start spending more , but should ensure that the money is better distributed .
“ european union spending must be stabilised and should not make up more than one percent of gross national product , ” said fischer . the foreign minister also spoke out in favour of negotiations on allowing turkey to join the eu .
a decision from brussels is expected later this year , but fischer added that a deciding factor would be the progress turkey makes in pushing through its own reforms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ireland takes helm of eu on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.01.2004 germany set to abolish the draft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr recruits : in the future , only on a voluntary basis .
young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service . german politicians have long been debating plans to abandon the draft in favor of a professional army .
but getting rid of conscription would also entail an end to its alternative - community service .
the details are as yet unconfirmed , but the government this year looks set to shorten the length of compulsory community service from 10 to nine months - the same that is required for military service .
according to reports in the financial times deutschland , this would be the first step towards a phase-out of both military and community service by 2008 .
a government spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports ahead of a meeting on thursday , when the minister for family affairs renate schmidt , is due to present her report on the future of community service .
a coming catastrophe ?
around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service in a senior citizen 's home charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
joachim kendelbacher from the workers ' welfare organisation told deutsche welle that his organisation , which currently employs around 6,000 people doing their alternative community service , would suffer heavily if their jobs were to be cut .
" we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , " he said .
" in some sectors this will certainly be the case .
i ’ m thinking of services like going for walks with old people in the nursing homes , reading literature to old people or doing office work .
if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . "
schmidt has said that , should community service be cut , she is demanding a five-year phase-out period .
" assuming that the decision to end community service comes in this year , we 'd need until 2010 to come to terms with the reorganization that would be needed , " she said .
" we ca n't just get rid of conscription overnight .
otherwise essential social structures would simply break apart . "
schmidt said that she is generally not against mandatory service .
" but the duties of the armed forces have changed .
aside from this , we ca n't provide for the military when , each year , we 're only getting less than half of the people up for service into the military . "
holding onto compulsory community service once military service is abolished would be unconstitutional in schmidt 's view .
she says voluntary service should receive more recognition and more financial backing , perhaps from the € 885 million a year currently spent on the community service program .
bundeswehr cuts german defence minister peter struck is already preparing the armed forces structurally for the post-conscription era of fewer troops and a tighter budget .
he 's reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion .
over the weekend , struck said that in times when germany is having to enforce painful cuts in the social and welfare system , the armed forces also have to expect budget cuts .
" all of my 12 predecessors have had to deal with the same phenomenon , " struck said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the soldiers want more money than is available .
this is nothing new . "
struck said all divisions of the armed forces - naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts , and that the government will buy only the most necessary pieces of equipment .
planned purchases of tanks and helicopters may either have to be downsized or cancelled .
some military bases will be closed .
opposition conservative leaders have called the planned cuts a " waterloo for the bundeswehr . "
christian democrat defence spokesman christian schmidt said that the drastic savings measures will painfully reduce the armed forces ’ clout in future peace-keeping and peace-enforcing missions abroad .
however , struck said the cuts are in keeping with an overall restructuring plan for the bundeswehr to prepare it for new strategic objectives within the nato alliance and the planned european rapid response force . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de united states , germany plan major military restructuring the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .

all eyes were focused on irish prime minister bertie ahern , who as the current helmsman of the rotating eu presidency , is charged with the tricky task of kick-starting the stalled negotiations on creating a european constitution . talks to sign off a draft constitution collapsed in december when european leaders came to blows over voting weights .
now , with the advent of a new year come fresh talks , and no matter how tough the job might be , bertie ahern is optimistic that agreement can be reached by the end of 2004 .
“ i can not promise that the constitution will be agreed in our presidency , but equally it would be premature to conclude that it will not , ” ahern said .
he added that it would be preferable for agreement to be reached as soon as possible , as failure to do so could result in the development of a dangerous vacuum . german support german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the forum in place of chancellor gerhard schröder , who was ill , pledged ahern germany ’ s full support .
he , too , stressed the importance of agreeing on a constitution before the end of the year , warning that failure to achieve this would result in a single europe which moved at different speeds . in the absence of a constitution , europe is bound by the decision-making processes set out in the nice treaty .
it was this treaty under which spain and poland were granted what many perceive as disproportionate power and almost as many votes as much larger union states such as france and germany .
the nice treaty contributed to the deadlock in constitution talks at the end of last year . but fischer was quick to emphasize that the problems with the nice treaty are not about voting weights .
“ our problems with nice are quite different .
the decision mechanisms in the nice treaty are based on blocking minorities .
under the nice model 90 votes are needed to block decisions , ” fischer said at the forum . those in favor of the draft constitution maintain that it will make it more difficult for motions to be blocked when the union expands from 15 to 25 members on may 1 .
and being able to make decisions clearly and quickly is crucial for europe .

“ european union spending must be stabilised and should not make up more than one percent of gross national product , ” said fischer . the foreign minister also spoke out in favour of negotiations on allowing turkey to join the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.01.2004 germany set to abolish the draft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr recruits : in the future , only on a voluntary basis .
young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service . german politicians have long been debating plans to abandon the draft in favor of a professional army .
but getting rid of conscription would also entail an end to its alternative - community service .
the details are as yet unconfirmed , but the government this year looks set to shorten the length of compulsory community service from 10 to nine months - the same that is required for military service .
according to reports in the financial times deutschland , this would be the first step towards a phase-out of both military and community service by 2008 .
a government spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports ahead of a meeting on thursday , when the minister for family affairs renate schmidt , is due to present her report on the future of community service .
a coming catastrophe ?
around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service in a senior citizen 's home charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
joachim kendelbacher from the workers ' welfare organisation told deutsche welle that his organisation , which currently employs around 6,000 people doing their alternative community service , would suffer heavily if their jobs were to be cut .
" we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , " he said .
" in some sectors this will certainly be the case .
i ’ m thinking of services like going for walks with old people in the nursing homes , reading literature to old people or doing office work .
if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . "
schmidt has said that , should community service be cut , she is demanding a five-year phase-out period .
" assuming that the decision to end community service comes in this year , we 'd need until 2010 to come to terms with the reorganization that would be needed , " she said .
" we ca n't just get rid of conscription overnight .
otherwise essential social structures would simply break apart . "
schmidt said that she is generally not against mandatory service .
" but the duties of the armed forces have changed .
aside from this , we ca n't provide for the military when , each year , we 're only getting less than half of the people up for service into the military . "
holding onto compulsory community service once military service is abolished would be unconstitutional in schmidt 's view .
she says voluntary service should receive more recognition and more financial backing , perhaps from the € 885 million a year currently spent on the community service program .
bundeswehr cuts german defence minister peter struck is already preparing the armed forces structurally for the post-conscription era of fewer troops and a tighter budget .
he 's reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion .
over the weekend , struck said that in times when germany is having to enforce painful cuts in the social and welfare system , the armed forces also have to expect budget cuts .
" all of my 12 predecessors have had to deal with the same phenomenon , " struck said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the soldiers want more money than is available .
this is nothing new . "
struck said all divisions of the armed forces - naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts , and that the government will buy only the most necessary pieces of equipment .
planned purchases of tanks and helicopters may either have to be downsized or cancelled .
some military bases will be closed .
opposition conservative leaders have called the planned cuts a " waterloo for the bundeswehr . "
christian democrat defence spokesman christian schmidt said that the drastic savings measures will painfully reduce the armed forces ’ clout in future peace-keeping and peace-enforcing missions abroad .
however , struck said the cuts are in keeping with an overall restructuring plan for the bundeswehr to prepare it for new strategic objectives within the nato alliance and the planned european rapid response force . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de united states , germany plan major military restructuring the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .

young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service . german politicians have long been debating plans to abandon the draft in favor of a professional army .
but getting rid of conscription would also entail an end to its alternative - community service .
the details are as yet unconfirmed , but the government this year looks set to shorten the length of compulsory community service from 10 to nine months - the same that is required for military service .
according to reports in the financial times deutschland , this would be the first step towards a phase-out of both military and community service by 2008 .
a government spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports ahead of a meeting on thursday , when the minister for family affairs renate schmidt , is due to present her report on the future of community service .
a coming catastrophe ?
around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service in a senior citizen 's home charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
joachim kendelbacher from the workers ' welfare organisation told deutsche welle that his organisation , which currently employs around 6,000 people doing their alternative community service , would suffer heavily if their jobs were to be cut .
" we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , " he said .
" in some sectors this will certainly be the case .
i ’ m thinking of services like going for walks with old people in the nursing homes , reading literature to old people or doing office work .
if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . "
schmidt has said that , should community service be cut , she is demanding a five-year phase-out period .
" assuming that the decision to end community service comes in this year , we 'd need until 2010 to come to terms with the reorganization that would be needed , " she said .
" we ca n't just get rid of conscription overnight .
otherwise essential social structures would simply break apart . "
schmidt said that she is generally not against mandatory service .
" but the duties of the armed forces have changed .
aside from this , we ca n't provide for the military when , each year , we 're only getting less than half of the people up for service into the military . "
holding onto compulsory community service once military service is abolished would be unconstitutional in schmidt 's view .
she says voluntary service should receive more recognition and more financial backing , perhaps from the € 885 million a year currently spent on the community service program .
bundeswehr cuts german defence minister peter struck is already preparing the armed forces structurally for the post-conscription era of fewer troops and a tighter budget .
he 's reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion .
over the weekend , struck said that in times when germany is having to enforce painful cuts in the social and welfare system , the armed forces also have to expect budget cuts .
" all of my 12 predecessors have had to deal with the same phenomenon , " struck said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the soldiers want more money than is available .
this is nothing new . "
struck said all divisions of the armed forces - naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts , and that the government will buy only the most necessary pieces of equipment .
planned purchases of tanks and helicopters may either have to be downsized or cancelled .
some military bases will be closed .
opposition conservative leaders have called the planned cuts a " waterloo for the bundeswehr . "
christian democrat defence spokesman christian schmidt said that the drastic savings measures will painfully reduce the armed forces ’ clout in future peace-keeping and peace-enforcing missions abroad .
however , struck said the cuts are in keeping with an overall restructuring plan for the bundeswehr to prepare it for new strategic objectives within the nato alliance and the planned european rapid response force . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de united states , germany plan major military restructuring the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .

all eyes were focused on irish prime minister bertie ahern , who as the current helmsman of the rotating eu presidency , is charged with the tricky task of kick-starting the stalled negotiations on creating a european constitution . talks to sign off a draft constitution collapsed in december when european leaders came to blows over voting weights .
now , with the advent of a new year come fresh talks , and no matter how tough the job might be , bertie ahern is optimistic that agreement can be reached by the end of 2004 .
“ i can not promise that the constitution will be agreed in our presidency , but equally it would be premature to conclude that it will not , ” ahern said .
he added that it would be preferable for agreement to be reached as soon as possible , as failure to do so could result in the development of a dangerous vacuum . german support german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the forum in place of chancellor gerhard schröder , who was ill , pledged ahern germany ’ s full support .

young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service . german politicians have long been debating plans to abandon the draft in favor of a professional army .
but getting rid of conscription would also entail an end to its alternative - community service .
the details are as yet unconfirmed , but the government this year looks set to shorten the length of compulsory community service from 10 to nine months - the same that is required for military service .
according to reports in the financial times deutschland , this would be the first step towards a phase-out of both military and community service by 2008 .
a government spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports ahead of a meeting on thursday , when the minister for family affairs renate schmidt , is due to present her report on the future of community service .
a coming catastrophe ?
around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service in a senior citizen 's home charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
joachim kendelbacher from the workers ' welfare organisation told deutsche welle that his organisation , which currently employs around 6,000 people doing their alternative community service , would suffer heavily if their jobs were to be cut .
" we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , " he said .
" in some sectors this will certainly be the case .
i ’ m thinking of services like going for walks with old people in the nursing homes , reading literature to old people or doing office work .
if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . "
schmidt has said that , should community service be cut , she is demanding a five-year phase-out period .
" assuming that the decision to end community service comes in this year , we 'd need until 2010 to come to terms with the reorganization that would be needed , " she said .
" we ca n't just get rid of conscription overnight .
otherwise essential social structures would simply break apart . "
schmidt said that she is generally not against mandatory service .
" but the duties of the armed forces have changed .
aside from this , we ca n't provide for the military when , each year , we 're only getting less than half of the people up for service into the military . "
holding onto compulsory community service once military service is abolished would be unconstitutional in schmidt 's view .
she says voluntary service should receive more recognition and more financial backing , perhaps from the € 885 million a year currently spent on the community service program .
bundeswehr cuts german defence minister peter struck is already preparing the armed forces structurally for the post-conscription era of fewer troops and a tighter budget .
he 's reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion .
over the weekend , struck said that in times when germany is having to enforce painful cuts in the social and welfare system , the armed forces also have to expect budget cuts .
" all of my 12 predecessors have had to deal with the same phenomenon , " struck said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the soldiers want more money than is available .
this is nothing new . "
struck said all divisions of the armed forces - naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts , and that the government will buy only the most necessary pieces of equipment .
planned purchases of tanks and helicopters may either have to be downsized or cancelled .
some military bases will be closed .
opposition conservative leaders have called the planned cuts a " waterloo for the bundeswehr . "
christian democrat defence spokesman christian schmidt said that the drastic savings measures will painfully reduce the armed forces ’ clout in future peace-keeping and peace-enforcing missions abroad .
however , struck said the cuts are in keeping with an overall restructuring plan for the bundeswehr to prepare it for new strategic objectives within the nato alliance and the planned european rapid response force . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de united states , germany plan major military restructuring the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .

young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service . german politicians have long been debating plans to abandon the draft in favor of a professional army .
but getting rid of conscription would also entail an end to its alternative - community service .
the details are as yet unconfirmed , but the government this year looks set to shorten the length of compulsory community service from 10 to nine months - the same that is required for military service .
according to reports in the financial times deutschland , this would be the first step towards a phase-out of both military and community service by 2008 .
a government spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports ahead of a meeting on thursday , when the minister for family affairs renate schmidt , is due to present her report on the future of community service .
a coming catastrophe ?
around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service in a senior citizen 's home charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
joachim kendelbacher from the workers ' welfare organisation told deutsche welle that his organisation , which currently employs around 6,000 people doing their alternative community service , would suffer heavily if their jobs were to be cut .
" we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , " he said .
" in some sectors this will certainly be the case .
i ’ m thinking of services like going for walks with old people in the nursing homes , reading literature to old people or doing office work .
if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . "
schmidt has said that , should community service be cut , she is demanding a five-year phase-out period .
" assuming that the decision to end community service comes in this year , we 'd need until 2010 to come to terms with the reorganization that would be needed , " she said .
" we ca n't just get rid of conscription overnight .
otherwise essential social structures would simply break apart . "
schmidt said that she is generally not against mandatory service .
" but the duties of the armed forces have changed .
aside from this , we ca n't provide for the military when , each year , we 're only getting less than half of the people up for service into the military . "
holding onto compulsory community service once military service is abolished would be unconstitutional in schmidt 's view .
she says voluntary service should receive more recognition and more financial backing , perhaps from the € 885 million a year currently spent on the community service program .
bundeswehr cuts german defence minister peter struck is already preparing the armed forces structurally for the post-conscription era of fewer troops and a tighter budget .
he 's reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion .
over the weekend , struck said that in times when germany is having to enforce painful cuts in the social and welfare system , the armed forces also have to expect budget cuts .
" all of my 12 predecessors have had to deal with the same phenomenon , " struck said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the soldiers want more money than is available .
this is nothing new . "
struck said all divisions of the armed forces - naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts , and that the government will buy only the most necessary pieces of equipment .
planned purchases of tanks and helicopters may either have to be downsized or cancelled .
some military bases will be closed .
opposition conservative leaders have called the planned cuts a " waterloo for the bundeswehr . "
christian democrat defence spokesman christian schmidt said that the drastic savings measures will painfully reduce the armed forces ’ clout in future peace-keeping and peace-enforcing missions abroad .
however , struck said the cuts are in keeping with an overall restructuring plan for the bundeswehr to prepare it for new strategic objectives within the nato alliance and the planned european rapid response force . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de united states , germany plan major military restructuring the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .

young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service . german politicians have long been debating plans to abandon the draft in favor of a professional army .
but getting rid of conscription would also entail an end to its alternative - community service .
the details are as yet unconfirmed , but the government this year looks set to shorten the length of compulsory community service from 10 to nine months - the same that is required for military service .
according to reports in the financial times deutschland , this would be the first step towards a phase-out of both military and community service by 2008 .
a government spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports ahead of a meeting on thursday , when the minister for family affairs renate schmidt , is due to present her report on the future of community service .
a coming catastrophe ?
around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service in a senior citizen 's home charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
joachim kendelbacher from the workers ' welfare organisation told deutsche welle that his organisation , which currently employs around 6,000 people doing their alternative community service , would suffer heavily if their jobs were to be cut .
" we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , " he said .
" in some sectors this will certainly be the case .
i ’ m thinking of services like going for walks with old people in the nursing homes , reading literature to old people or doing office work .
if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . "
schmidt has said that , should community service be cut , she is demanding a five-year phase-out period .
" assuming that the decision to end community service comes in this year , we 'd need until 2010 to come to terms with the reorganization that would be needed , " she said .
" we ca n't just get rid of conscription overnight .
otherwise essential social structures would simply break apart . "
schmidt said that she is generally not against mandatory service .
" but the duties of the armed forces have changed .
aside from this , we ca n't provide for the military when , each year , we 're only getting less than half of the people up for service into the military . "
holding onto compulsory community service once military service is abolished would be unconstitutional in schmidt 's view .
she says voluntary service should receive more recognition and more financial backing , perhaps from the € 885 million a year currently spent on the community service program .
bundeswehr cuts german defence minister peter struck is already preparing the armed forces structurally for the post-conscription era of fewer troops and a tighter budget .
he 's reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion .
over the weekend , struck said that in times when germany is having to enforce painful cuts in the social and welfare system , the armed forces also have to expect budget cuts .
" all of my 12 predecessors have had to deal with the same phenomenon , " struck said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the soldiers want more money than is available .
this is nothing new . "
struck said all divisions of the armed forces - naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts , and that the government will buy only the most necessary pieces of equipment .
planned purchases of tanks and helicopters may either have to be downsized or cancelled .
some military bases will be closed .
opposition conservative leaders have called the planned cuts a " waterloo for the bundeswehr . "
christian democrat defence spokesman christian schmidt said that the drastic savings measures will painfully reduce the armed forces ’ clout in future peace-keeping and peace-enforcing missions abroad .
however , struck said the cuts are in keeping with an overall restructuring plan for the bundeswehr to prepare it for new strategic objectives within the nato alliance and the planned european rapid response force . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de united states , germany plan major military restructuring the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .

young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service . german politicians have long been debating plans to abandon the draft in favor of a professional army .
but getting rid of conscription would also entail an end to its alternative - community service .
the details are as yet unconfirmed , but the government this year looks set to shorten the length of compulsory community service from 10 to nine months - the same that is required for military service .
according to reports in the financial times deutschland , this would be the first step towards a phase-out of both military and community service by 2008 .
a government spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports ahead of a meeting on thursday , when the minister for family affairs renate schmidt , is due to present her report on the future of community service .
a coming catastrophe ?
around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service in a senior citizen 's home charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
joachim kendelbacher from the workers ' welfare organisation told deutsche welle that his organisation , which currently employs around 6,000 people doing their alternative community service , would suffer heavily if their jobs were to be cut .
" we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , " he said .
" in some sectors this will certainly be the case .
i ’ m thinking of services like going for walks with old people in the nursing homes , reading literature to old people or doing office work .
if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . "
schmidt has said that , should community service be cut , she is demanding a five-year phase-out period .
" assuming that the decision to end community service comes in this year , we 'd need until 2010 to come to terms with the reorganization that would be needed , " she said .
" we ca n't just get rid of conscription overnight .
otherwise essential social structures would simply break apart . "
schmidt said that she is generally not against mandatory service .
" but the duties of the armed forces have changed .
aside from this , we ca n't provide for the military when , each year , we 're only getting less than half of the people up for service into the military . "

the last few years of stagnating growth are to blame for the predicted 4,500 bankruptcies and several thousand more silent business closures expected for the upcoming year , the head of the retailer ’ s association , holger wenzel , said in the business daily handelsblatt .
" after the last two bad years many businesses are seriously weakened , " he said , and until the planned tax reform actually kicks in consumer spending will not increase .
but once that happens the retail sector should see a slight growth of 0.5 percent by the end of the year .
other market analysts , such as the service union ver.di , see the loosening of the rebate laws as a further detriment to jumpstarting growth .
as long as retailers continue to " throw money out the window " by offering excessive price discounts , it ’ s no wonder the profit margin is so narrow , says ver.di ’ s trade expert . -lrb- based on wire reports -rrb- more briefs 12.01.2004 -pipe- airbus manufacturer hit by soaring euro 12.01.2004 -pipe- siemens sells off shares in infineon 09.01.2004 -pipe- survey sees further german job cuts 09.01.2004 -pipe- opel may reinstate pension plan 09.01.2004 -pipe- greens call for legalizing east european maids 08.01.2004 -pipe- german jobless rate climbs in december 08.01.2004 -pipe- ecb leaves rates unchanged despite strong euro 07.01.2004 -pipe- airbus surpasses boeing radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the berlin institute for contemporary art announced monday it had withdrawn its application for state funding for an exhibition planned for next winter .
originally , berlin ’ s cultural fund was to decide on a new and reduced funding application from the organization , but institute head klaus biesenbach said it had decided to withdraw the application because of the political skirmish surrounding the show .
in an interview with the news agency dpa , biesenbach said that the current attention was an indication that the exhibition would not be judged on its factual content , but would instead become a political fireball . more briefs 12.01.2004 -pipe- agriculture ministry admits knowledge of tip-off in bse testing lapses 09.01.2004 -pipe- germany says stell cell laws not hindering research 09.01.2004 -pipe- schröder supports leipzig 's olympic bid 09.01.2004 -pipe- hate mail for german health minister 07.01.2004 -pipe- mars orbiter fails to contact landing unit 07.01.2004 -pipe- german farmer groups slam sloppy bse testing 07.01.2004 -pipe- federal criminal police to move to berlin 07.01.2004 -pipe- german conservatives rail against turkish eu membership radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the quality so long associated with the three little words ‘ made in germany ’ could soon become a thing of the past , destined to be swallowed up by the wide mouth of the european union .
the financial times deutschland reported monday that the european commission plans to implement a new pan-european label bearing the words ‘ made in the european union . ’
the ftd report was based on an internal eu paper in which eu trade commissioner pascal lamy the desire to establish the eu label as a mark of quality and use it to push forward domestic integration .
lamy also sees it as a way of fighting fraudulent claims of origin .
the paper claimed that many companies wrongly label their products , and that many textiles which claim to be ‘ made in germany ’ or ‘ made in italy ’ in fact come from thailand or india .
not surprisingly german industry is opposed to dispensing with its seal of quality .
a legal expert for the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , henrike vieregge , told the paper that the association would reject any suggestion to create an eu label law . more briefs 12.01.2004 -pipe- raf show curators abandon request for berlin funds 12.01.2004 -pipe- agriculture ministry admits knowledge of tip-off in bse testing lapses 09.01.2004 -pipe- germany says stell cell laws not hindering research 09.01.2004 -pipe- schröder supports leipzig 's olympic bid 09.01.2004 -pipe- hate mail for german health minister 07.01.2004 -pipe- mars orbiter fails to contact landing unit 07.01.2004 -pipe- german farmer groups slam sloppy bse testing 07.01.2004 -pipe- federal criminal police to move to berlin radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the last few years of stagnating growth are to blame for the predicted 4,500 bankruptcies and several thousand more silent business closures expected for the upcoming year , the head of the retailer ’ s association , holger wenzel , said in the business daily handelsblatt .
" after the last two bad years many businesses are seriously weakened , " he said , and until the planned tax reform actually kicks in consumer spending will not increase .
but once that happens the retail sector should see a slight growth of 0.5 percent by the end of the year .
other market analysts , such as the service union ver.di , see the loosening of the rebate laws as a further detriment to jumpstarting growth .
as long as retailers continue to " throw money out the window " by offering excessive price discounts , it ’ s no wonder the profit margin is so narrow , says ver.di ’ s trade expert . -lrb- based on wire reports -rrb- more briefs 12.01.2004 -pipe- airbus manufacturer hit by soaring euro 12.01.2004 -pipe- siemens sells off shares in infineon 09.01.2004 -pipe- survey sees further german job cuts 09.01.2004 -pipe- opel may reinstate pension plan 09.01.2004 -pipe- greens call for legalizing east european maids 08.01.2004 -pipe- german jobless rate climbs in december 08.01.2004 -pipe- ecb leaves rates unchanged despite strong euro 07.01.2004 -pipe- airbus surpasses boeing radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the paper claimed that many companies wrongly label their products , and that many textiles which claim to be ‘ made in germany ’ or ‘ made in italy ’ in fact come from thailand or india .
not surprisingly german industry is opposed to dispensing with its seal of quality .
a legal expert for the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , henrike vieregge , told the paper that the association would reject any suggestion to create an eu label law . more briefs 12.01.2004 -pipe- raf show curators abandon request for berlin funds 12.01.2004 -pipe- agriculture ministry admits knowledge of tip-off in bse testing lapses 09.01.2004 -pipe- germany says stell cell laws not hindering research 09.01.2004 -pipe- schröder supports leipzig 's olympic bid 09.01.2004 -pipe- hate mail for german health minister 07.01.2004 -pipe- mars orbiter fails to contact landing unit 07.01.2004 -pipe- german farmer groups slam sloppy bse testing 07.01.2004 -pipe- federal criminal police to move to berlin radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the last few years of stagnating growth are to blame for the predicted 4,500 bankruptcies and several thousand more silent business closures expected for the upcoming year , the head of the retailer ’ s association , holger wenzel , said in the business daily handelsblatt .
" after the last two bad years many businesses are seriously weakened , " he said , and until the planned tax reform actually kicks in consumer spending will not increase .
but once that happens the retail sector should see a slight growth of 0.5 percent by the end of the year .
other market analysts , such as the service union ver.di , see the loosening of the rebate laws as a further detriment to jumpstarting growth .
as long as retailers continue to " throw money out the window " by offering excessive price discounts , it ’ s no wonder the profit margin is so narrow , says ver.di ’ s trade expert . -lrb- based on wire reports -rrb- more briefs 12.01.2004 -pipe- airbus manufacturer hit by soaring euro 12.01.2004 -pipe- siemens sells off shares in infineon 09.01.2004 -pipe- survey sees further german job cuts 09.01.2004 -pipe- opel may reinstate pension plan 09.01.2004 -pipe- greens call for legalizing east european maids 08.01.2004 -pipe- german jobless rate climbs in december 08.01.2004 -pipe- ecb leaves rates unchanged despite strong euro 07.01.2004 -pipe- airbus surpasses boeing radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the newspaper claimed that künast received an email from a cattle dealer in bavaria which suggested that a cattle breeder in emsland was not testing his cattle for bovine spongiform encephalopy , or bse , before having them slaughtered .
the information in the e-mail suggested that at least 80 cattle in emsland had been slaughtered without being tested for the illness , which is also believed to infect humans .
the paper added that the public prosecutors in the city of osnabrück are investigating the claims .
in response to the claims , künast explained that there had been evidence suggesting violations of food regulations , but that these had been passed on to the relevant states for further investigation .
germany ’ s fdp has accused künast of not following up tip-offs about possible incidences of illegal slaughtering .

speaking to germany ’ s public broadcast station ard , schily said that while it was important for police officers to maintain their civil servant status , he did not believe the same should be the case for university professors or school teachers .
he stressed that he does not wish to do away with the civil service altogether , but believes it important to restrict the status to what he deemed " suitable " areas of work .
the interior minister reiterated his calls for a far-reaching reform of working hours , remuneration and labor law for civil servants .
the german association for civil servants -lrb- dbb -rrb- has warned against further cuts in the public service service .
dbb chairman peter heesen has called for a fundamental modernization of germany ’ s civil service .
speaking on ard television heesen defended the civil servant status for teachers , describing it as necessary if germany is to keep strikes out of its schools . more briefs 09.01.2004 -pipe- prosecutors seek top penalty for mzoudi 17.12.2003 -pipe- smokers pay no heed to label warnings 05.12.2003 -pipe- fishy smell leads to record haul of smuggled caviar 26.11.2003 -pipe- vw executive denies job change rumors 26.11.2003 -pipe- u.s. troops likely to leave germany 26.11.2003 -pipe- cdu : no second chance for hohmann 26.11.2003 -pipe- world ’ s oldest food store discovered 24.11.2003 -pipe- shevardnadze says he wants to stay in georgia radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.01.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc taxpayers foot huge eu presidency bill the six-month eu presidency , which puts the particular member state under the glare of a political and media spotlight , also brings enormous costs .
ireland , which holds the eu presidency for the first half of this year , is no exception .
the irish independent reports that the presidency will cost irish taxpayers around € 500,000 for every day it remains at the eu helm , for a total well above € 90 million .
while around € 23 million was spent on preparations last year and € 60 million has been allocated this year , this is not the final sum as some of the irish government departments have yet to say how much they are set to spend .
to ensure a smooth stint at the head of the eu , ireland doubled the number of people working at its representation to the eu from 80 to 160 people .
meanwhile , the netherlands , which takes over the eu presidency directly after ireland for the remainder of the year , is having problems of its own .
according to de volksrant newspaper , the dutch government is having difficulty finding business sponsorship for its eu presidency .

speaking after a meeting on friday afternoon , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimosziewicz said , " we are determined , we can do it , we want to do it and we are convinced that we will be able to find agreement on the different points that have not yet been resolved . "
warsaw and paris hope to be able to thrash out their differences before the european elections in june , according to french daily le monde .
french foreign minister dominique de villepin said that there is a " common will to tackle these questions together . "
disagreements between paris and warsaw were seen as one of the reasons for the failure of talks on a european constitution in december .
poland , backed by spain , wanted to maintain the current system of voting weights in the european council whereas france , in turn backed by germany , supported a new system that would give poland less weight .

the berlin institute for contemporary art announced monday it had withdrawn its application for state funding for an exhibition planned for next winter .
originally , berlin ’ s cultural fund was to decide on a new and reduced funding application from the organization , but institute head klaus biesenbach said it had decided to withdraw the application because of the political skirmish surrounding the show .
in an interview with the news agency dpa , biesenbach said that the current attention was an indication that the exhibition would not be judged on its factual content , but would instead become a political fireball . more briefs 12.01.2004 -pipe- agriculture ministry admits knowledge of tip-off in bse testing lapses 09.01.2004 -pipe- germany says stell cell laws not hindering research 09.01.2004 -pipe- schröder supports leipzig 's olympic bid 09.01.2004 -pipe- hate mail for german health minister 07.01.2004 -pipe- mars orbiter fails to contact landing unit 07.01.2004 -pipe- german farmer groups slam sloppy bse testing 07.01.2004 -pipe- federal criminal police to move to berlin 07.01.2004 -pipe- german conservatives rail against turkish eu membership radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the quality so long associated with the three little words ‘ made in germany ’ could soon become a thing of the past , destined to be swallowed up by the wide mouth of the european union .
the financial times deutschland reported monday that the european commission plans to implement a new pan-european label bearing the words ‘ made in the european union . ’
the ftd report was based on an internal eu paper in which eu trade commissioner pascal lamy the desire to establish the eu label as a mark of quality and use it to push forward domestic integration .
lamy also sees it as a way of fighting fraudulent claims of origin .
the paper claimed that many companies wrongly label their products , and that many textiles which claim to be ‘ made in germany ’ or ‘ made in italy ’ in fact come from thailand or india .
not surprisingly german industry is opposed to dispensing with its seal of quality .
a legal expert for the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , henrike vieregge , told the paper that the association would reject any suggestion to create an eu label law . more briefs 12.01.2004 -pipe- raf show curators abandon request for berlin funds 12.01.2004 -pipe- agriculture ministry admits knowledge of tip-off in bse testing lapses 09.01.2004 -pipe- germany says stell cell laws not hindering research 09.01.2004 -pipe- schröder supports leipzig 's olympic bid 09.01.2004 -pipe- hate mail for german health minister 07.01.2004 -pipe- mars orbiter fails to contact landing unit 07.01.2004 -pipe- german farmer groups slam sloppy bse testing 07.01.2004 -pipe- federal criminal police to move to berlin radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

all eyes were focused on irish prime minister bertie ahern , who as the current helmsman of the rotating eu presidency , is charged with the tricky task of kick-starting the stalled negotiations on creating a european constitution . talks to sign off a draft constitution collapsed in december when european leaders came to blows over voting weights .
now , with the advent of a new year come fresh talks , and no matter how tough the job might be , bertie ahern is optimistic that agreement can be reached by the end of 2004 .
“ i can not promise that the constitution will be agreed in our presidency , but equally it would be premature to conclude that it will not , ” ahern said .
he added that it would be preferable for agreement to be reached as soon as possible , as failure to do so could result in the development of a dangerous vacuum . german support german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the forum in place of chancellor gerhard schröder , who was ill , pledged ahern germany ’ s full support .

it was this treaty under which spain and poland were granted what many perceive as disproportionate power and almost as many votes as much larger union states such as france and germany .
the nice treaty contributed to the deadlock in constitution talks at the end of last year . but fischer was quick to emphasize that the problems with the nice treaty are not about voting weights .
“ our problems with nice are quite different .
the decision mechanisms in the nice treaty are based on blocking minorities .

“ european union spending must be stabilised and should not make up more than one percent of gross national product , ” said fischer . the foreign minister also spoke out in favour of negotiations on allowing turkey to join the eu .

all eyes were focused on irish prime minister bertie ahern , who as the current helmsman of the rotating eu presidency , is charged with the tricky task of kick-starting the stalled negotiations on creating a european constitution . talks to sign off a draft constitution collapsed in december when european leaders came to blows over voting weights .
now , with the advent of a new year come fresh talks , and no matter how tough the job might be , bertie ahern is optimistic that agreement can be reached by the end of 2004 .
“ i can not promise that the constitution will be agreed in our presidency , but equally it would be premature to conclude that it will not , ” ahern said .
he added that it would be preferable for agreement to be reached as soon as possible , as failure to do so could result in the development of a dangerous vacuum . german support german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the forum in place of chancellor gerhard schröder , who was ill , pledged ahern germany ’ s full support .
he , too , stressed the importance of agreeing on a constitution before the end of the year , warning that failure to achieve this would result in a single europe which moved at different speeds . in the absence of a constitution , europe is bound by the decision-making processes set out in the nice treaty .
it was this treaty under which spain and poland were granted what many perceive as disproportionate power and almost as many votes as much larger union states such as france and germany .
the nice treaty contributed to the deadlock in constitution talks at the end of last year . but fischer was quick to emphasize that the problems with the nice treaty are not about voting weights .
“ our problems with nice are quite different .
the decision mechanisms in the nice treaty are based on blocking minorities .
under the nice model 90 votes are needed to block decisions , ” fischer said at the forum . those in favor of the draft constitution maintain that it will make it more difficult for motions to be blocked when the union expands from 15 to 25 members on may 1 .
and being able to make decisions clearly and quickly is crucial for europe .

“ i can not promise that the constitution will be agreed in our presidency , but equally it would be premature to conclude that it will not , ” ahern said .

the decision mechanisms in the nice treaty are based on blocking minorities .

and being able to make decisions clearly and quickly is crucial for europe .

“ european union spending must be stabilised and should not make up more than one percent of gross national product , ” said fischer . the foreign minister also spoke out in favour of negotiations on allowing turkey to join the eu .

“ i can not promise that the constitution will be agreed in our presidency , but equally it would be premature to conclude that it will not , ” ahern said .
he added that it would be preferable for agreement to be reached as soon as possible , as failure to do so could result in the development of a dangerous vacuum . german support german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the forum in place of chancellor gerhard schröder , who was ill , pledged ahern germany ’ s full support .
he , too , stressed the importance of agreeing on a constitution before the end of the year , warning that failure to achieve this would result in a single europe which moved at different speeds . in the absence of a constitution , europe is bound by the decision-making processes set out in the nice treaty .
it was this treaty under which spain and poland were granted what many perceive as disproportionate power and almost as many votes as much larger union states such as france and germany .
the nice treaty contributed to the deadlock in constitution talks at the end of last year . but fischer was quick to emphasize that the problems with the nice treaty are not about voting weights .
“ our problems with nice are quite different .
the decision mechanisms in the nice treaty are based on blocking minorities .
under the nice model 90 votes are needed to block decisions , ” fischer said at the forum . those in favor of the draft constitution maintain that it will make it more difficult for motions to be blocked when the union expands from 15 to 25 members on may 1 .
and being able to make decisions clearly and quickly is crucial for europe .
as joschka fischer was at pains to point out at the forum .
“ the world won ’ t wait for europe , and europe can not play an effective role in the world if it is caught up in arguments on majorities and money , ” he said . measured spending indeed fischer was vocal on future spending patterns within the eu , stressing that when the 10 new states become official members in the spring , the union should not start spending more , but should ensure that the money is better distributed .
“ european union spending must be stabilised and should not make up more than one percent of gross national product , ” said fischer . the foreign minister also spoke out in favour of negotiations on allowing turkey to join the eu .
a decision from brussels is expected later this year , but fischer added that a deciding factor would be the progress turkey makes in pushing through its own reforms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ireland takes helm of eu on jan .
1 , ireland takes over the european union ’ s most-important office for six months .
but unlike its italian predecessor , dublin is steering clear of great expectations .
-lrb- 1 january 2004 -rrb- germany presses for eu constitution by end of 2004 german chancellor schröder has stressed that the need for a decision on an eu constitution by the end of this year .

young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service . german politicians have long been debating plans to abandon the draft in favor of a professional army .
but getting rid of conscription would also entail an end to its alternative - community service .
the details are as yet unconfirmed , but the government this year looks set to shorten the length of compulsory community service from 10 to nine months - the same that is required for military service .
according to reports in the financial times deutschland , this would be the first step towards a phase-out of both military and community service by 2008 .
a government spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports ahead of a meeting on thursday , when the minister for family affairs renate schmidt , is due to present her report on the future of community service .
a coming catastrophe ?
around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service in a senior citizen 's home charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
joachim kendelbacher from the workers ' welfare organisation told deutsche welle that his organisation , which currently employs around 6,000 people doing their alternative community service , would suffer heavily if their jobs were to be cut .
" we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , " he said .
" in some sectors this will certainly be the case .
i ’ m thinking of services like going for walks with old people in the nursing homes , reading literature to old people or doing office work .
if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . "
schmidt has said that , should community service be cut , she is demanding a five-year phase-out period .
" assuming that the decision to end community service comes in this year , we 'd need until 2010 to come to terms with the reorganization that would be needed , " she said .
" we ca n't just get rid of conscription overnight .
otherwise essential social structures would simply break apart . "
schmidt said that she is generally not against mandatory service .
" but the duties of the armed forces have changed .
aside from this , we ca n't provide for the military when , each year , we 're only getting less than half of the people up for service into the military . "
holding onto compulsory community service once military service is abolished would be unconstitutional in schmidt 's view .
she says voluntary service should receive more recognition and more financial backing , perhaps from the € 885 million a year currently spent on the community service program .
bundeswehr cuts german defence minister peter struck is already preparing the armed forces structurally for the post-conscription era of fewer troops and a tighter budget .
he 's reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion .
over the weekend , struck said that in times when germany is having to enforce painful cuts in the social and welfare system , the armed forces also have to expect budget cuts .
" all of my 12 predecessors have had to deal with the same phenomenon , " struck said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the soldiers want more money than is available .
this is nothing new . "
struck said all divisions of the armed forces - naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts , and that the government will buy only the most necessary pieces of equipment .
planned purchases of tanks and helicopters may either have to be downsized or cancelled .
some military bases will be closed .
opposition conservative leaders have called the planned cuts a " waterloo for the bundeswehr . "
christian democrat defence spokesman christian schmidt said that the drastic savings measures will painfully reduce the armed forces ’ clout in future peace-keeping and peace-enforcing missions abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.01.2004 fresh hope for eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister bertie ahern wants a european constitution in place by the end of 2004 as european heads of state gathered in berlin for this year ’ s bertelsmann forum , attention was squarely focused on how to seal agreement on an eu constitution . representatives of some 30 countries gathered in the german capital on friday to discuss the way forward for the european union and its constitution .
all eyes were focused on irish prime minister bertie ahern , who as the current helmsman of the rotating eu presidency , is charged with the tricky task of kick-starting the stalled negotiations on creating a european constitution . talks to sign off a draft constitution collapsed in december when european leaders came to blows over voting weights .
now , with the advent of a new year come fresh talks , and no matter how tough the job might be , bertie ahern is optimistic that agreement can be reached by the end of 2004 .
“ i can not promise that the constitution will be agreed in our presidency , but equally it would be premature to conclude that it will not , ” ahern said .
he added that it would be preferable for agreement to be reached as soon as possible , as failure to do so could result in the development of a dangerous vacuum . german support german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the forum in place of chancellor gerhard schröder , who was ill , pledged ahern germany ’ s full support .
he , too , stressed the importance of agreeing on a constitution before the end of the year , warning that failure to achieve this would result in a single europe which moved at different speeds . in the absence of a constitution , europe is bound by the decision-making processes set out in the nice treaty .
it was this treaty under which spain and poland were granted what many perceive as disproportionate power and almost as many votes as much larger union states such as france and germany .
the nice treaty contributed to the deadlock in constitution talks at the end of last year . but fischer was quick to emphasize that the problems with the nice treaty are not about voting weights .
“ our problems with nice are quite different .
the decision mechanisms in the nice treaty are based on blocking minorities .
under the nice model 90 votes are needed to block decisions , ” fischer said at the forum . those in favor of the draft constitution maintain that it will make it more difficult for motions to be blocked when the union expands from 15 to 25 members on may 1 .
and being able to make decisions clearly and quickly is crucial for europe .
as joschka fischer was at pains to point out at the forum .
“ the world won ’ t wait for europe , and europe can not play an effective role in the world if it is caught up in arguments on majorities and money , ” he said . measured spending indeed fischer was vocal on future spending patterns within the eu , stressing that when the 10 new states become official members in the spring , the union should not start spending more , but should ensure that the money is better distributed .
“ european union spending must be stabilised and should not make up more than one percent of gross national product , ” said fischer . the foreign minister also spoke out in favour of negotiations on allowing turkey to join the eu .
a decision from brussels is expected later this year , but fischer added that a deciding factor would be the progress turkey makes in pushing through its own reforms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ireland takes helm of eu on jan .
1 , ireland takes over the european union ’ s most-important office for six months .
but unlike its italian predecessor , dublin is steering clear of great expectations .
-lrb- 1 january 2004 -rrb- germany presses for eu constitution by end of 2004 german chancellor schröder has stressed that the need for a decision on an eu constitution by the end of this year .
in a statement published saturday , he said his country will not offer concessions on voting rights .

young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service . german politicians have long been debating plans to abandon the draft in favor of a professional army .
but getting rid of conscription would also entail an end to its alternative - community service .
the details are as yet unconfirmed , but the government this year looks set to shorten the length of compulsory community service from 10 to nine months - the same that is required for military service .
according to reports in the financial times deutschland , this would be the first step towards a phase-out of both military and community service by 2008 .
a government spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports ahead of a meeting on thursday , when the minister for family affairs renate schmidt , is due to present her report on the future of community service .
a coming catastrophe ?
around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service in a senior citizen 's home charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
joachim kendelbacher from the workers ' welfare organisation told deutsche welle that his organisation , which currently employs around 6,000 people doing their alternative community service , would suffer heavily if their jobs were to be cut .
" we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , " he said .
" in some sectors this will certainly be the case .
i ’ m thinking of services like going for walks with old people in the nursing homes , reading literature to old people or doing office work .
if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . "
schmidt has said that , should community service be cut , she is demanding a five-year phase-out period .
" assuming that the decision to end community service comes in this year , we 'd need until 2010 to come to terms with the reorganization that would be needed , " she said .
" we ca n't just get rid of conscription overnight .
otherwise essential social structures would simply break apart . "
schmidt said that she is generally not against mandatory service .
" but the duties of the armed forces have changed .
aside from this , we ca n't provide for the military when , each year , we 're only getting less than half of the people up for service into the military . "
holding onto compulsory community service once military service is abolished would be unconstitutional in schmidt 's view .
she says voluntary service should receive more recognition and more financial backing , perhaps from the € 885 million a year currently spent on the community service program .
bundeswehr cuts german defence minister peter struck is already preparing the armed forces structurally for the post-conscription era of fewer troops and a tighter budget .
he 's reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion .
over the weekend , struck said that in times when germany is having to enforce painful cuts in the social and welfare system , the armed forces also have to expect budget cuts .
" all of my 12 predecessors have had to deal with the same phenomenon , " struck said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the soldiers want more money than is available .
this is nothing new . "
struck said all divisions of the armed forces - naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts , and that the government will buy only the most necessary pieces of equipment .
planned purchases of tanks and helicopters may either have to be downsized or cancelled .
some military bases will be closed .
opposition conservative leaders have called the planned cuts a " waterloo for the bundeswehr . "
christian democrat defence spokesman christian schmidt said that the drastic savings measures will painfully reduce the armed forces ’ clout in future peace-keeping and peace-enforcing missions abroad .
however , struck said the cuts are in keeping with an overall restructuring plan for the bundeswehr to prepare it for new strategic objectives within the nato alliance and the planned european rapid response force . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de united states , germany plan major military restructuring the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.01.2004 fresh hope for eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister bertie ahern wants a european constitution in place by the end of 2004 as european heads of state gathered in berlin for this year ’ s bertelsmann forum , attention was squarely focused on how to seal agreement on an eu constitution . representatives of some 30 countries gathered in the german capital on friday to discuss the way forward for the european union and its constitution .
all eyes were focused on irish prime minister bertie ahern , who as the current helmsman of the rotating eu presidency , is charged with the tricky task of kick-starting the stalled negotiations on creating a european constitution . talks to sign off a draft constitution collapsed in december when european leaders came to blows over voting weights .
now , with the advent of a new year come fresh talks , and no matter how tough the job might be , bertie ahern is optimistic that agreement can be reached by the end of 2004 .
“ i can not promise that the constitution will be agreed in our presidency , but equally it would be premature to conclude that it will not , ” ahern said .
he added that it would be preferable for agreement to be reached as soon as possible , as failure to do so could result in the development of a dangerous vacuum . german support german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the forum in place of chancellor gerhard schröder , who was ill , pledged ahern germany ’ s full support .
he , too , stressed the importance of agreeing on a constitution before the end of the year , warning that failure to achieve this would result in a single europe which moved at different speeds . in the absence of a constitution , europe is bound by the decision-making processes set out in the nice treaty .
it was this treaty under which spain and poland were granted what many perceive as disproportionate power and almost as many votes as much larger union states such as france and germany .
the nice treaty contributed to the deadlock in constitution talks at the end of last year . but fischer was quick to emphasize that the problems with the nice treaty are not about voting weights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.01.2004 germany set to abolish the draft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr recruits : in the future , only on a voluntary basis .
young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service . german politicians have long been debating plans to abandon the draft in favor of a professional army .
but getting rid of conscription would also entail an end to its alternative - community service .
the details are as yet unconfirmed , but the government this year looks set to shorten the length of compulsory community service from 10 to nine months - the same that is required for military service .
according to reports in the financial times deutschland , this would be the first step towards a phase-out of both military and community service by 2008 .
a government spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports ahead of a meeting on thursday , when the minister for family affairs renate schmidt , is due to present her report on the future of community service .
a coming catastrophe ?
around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service in a senior citizen 's home charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
joachim kendelbacher from the workers ' welfare organisation told deutsche welle that his organisation , which currently employs around 6,000 people doing their alternative community service , would suffer heavily if their jobs were to be cut .
" we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , " he said .
" in some sectors this will certainly be the case .
i ’ m thinking of services like going for walks with old people in the nursing homes , reading literature to old people or doing office work .
if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . "
schmidt has said that , should community service be cut , she is demanding a five-year phase-out period .
" assuming that the decision to end community service comes in this year , we 'd need until 2010 to come to terms with the reorganization that would be needed , " she said .
" we ca n't just get rid of conscription overnight .
otherwise essential social structures would simply break apart . "
schmidt said that she is generally not against mandatory service .
" but the duties of the armed forces have changed .
aside from this , we ca n't provide for the military when , each year , we 're only getting less than half of the people up for service into the military . "
holding onto compulsory community service once military service is abolished would be unconstitutional in schmidt 's view .
she says voluntary service should receive more recognition and more financial backing , perhaps from the € 885 million a year currently spent on the community service program .
bundeswehr cuts german defence minister peter struck is already preparing the armed forces structurally for the post-conscription era of fewer troops and a tighter budget .
he 's reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion .
over the weekend , struck said that in times when germany is having to enforce painful cuts in the social and welfare system , the armed forces also have to expect budget cuts .
" all of my 12 predecessors have had to deal with the same phenomenon , " struck said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the soldiers want more money than is available .
this is nothing new . "
struck said all divisions of the armed forces - naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts , and that the government will buy only the most necessary pieces of equipment .
planned purchases of tanks and helicopters may either have to be downsized or cancelled .
some military bases will be closed .
opposition conservative leaders have called the planned cuts a " waterloo for the bundeswehr . "
christian democrat defence spokesman christian schmidt said that the drastic savings measures will painfully reduce the armed forces ’ clout in future peace-keeping and peace-enforcing missions abroad .
however , struck said the cuts are in keeping with an overall restructuring plan for the bundeswehr to prepare it for new strategic objectives within the nato alliance and the planned european rapid response force . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de united states , germany plan major military restructuring the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .

the details are as yet unconfirmed , but the government this year looks set to shorten the length of compulsory community service from 10 to nine months - the same that is required for military service .
according to reports in the financial times deutschland , this would be the first step towards a phase-out of both military and community service by 2008 .
a government spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports ahead of a meeting on thursday , when the minister for family affairs renate schmidt , is due to present her report on the future of community service .
a coming catastrophe ?
around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service in a senior citizen 's home charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
joachim kendelbacher from the workers ' welfare organisation told deutsche welle that his organisation , which currently employs around 6,000 people doing their alternative community service , would suffer heavily if their jobs were to be cut .
" we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , " he said .
" in some sectors this will certainly be the case .
i ’ m thinking of services like going for walks with old people in the nursing homes , reading literature to old people or doing office work .
if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . "
schmidt has said that , should community service be cut , she is demanding a five-year phase-out period .
" assuming that the decision to end community service comes in this year , we 'd need until 2010 to come to terms with the reorganization that would be needed , " she said .
" we ca n't just get rid of conscription overnight .
otherwise essential social structures would simply break apart . "
schmidt said that she is generally not against mandatory service .
" but the duties of the armed forces have changed .
aside from this , we ca n't provide for the military when , each year , we 're only getting less than half of the people up for service into the military . "
holding onto compulsory community service once military service is abolished would be unconstitutional in schmidt 's view .
she says voluntary service should receive more recognition and more financial backing , perhaps from the € 885 million a year currently spent on the community service program .
bundeswehr cuts german defence minister peter struck is already preparing the armed forces structurally for the post-conscription era of fewer troops and a tighter budget .
he 's reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion .
over the weekend , struck said that in times when germany is having to enforce painful cuts in the social and welfare system , the armed forces also have to expect budget cuts .
" all of my 12 predecessors have had to deal with the same phenomenon , " struck said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the soldiers want more money than is available .
this is nothing new . "
struck said all divisions of the armed forces - naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts , and that the government will buy only the most necessary pieces of equipment .
planned purchases of tanks and helicopters may either have to be downsized or cancelled .
some military bases will be closed .
opposition conservative leaders have called the planned cuts a " waterloo for the bundeswehr . "
christian democrat defence spokesman christian schmidt said that the drastic savings measures will painfully reduce the armed forces ’ clout in future peace-keeping and peace-enforcing missions abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.01.2004 fresh hope for eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister bertie ahern wants a european constitution in place by the end of 2004 as european heads of state gathered in berlin for this year ’ s bertelsmann forum , attention was squarely focused on how to seal agreement on an eu constitution . representatives of some 30 countries gathered in the german capital on friday to discuss the way forward for the european union and its constitution .
all eyes were focused on irish prime minister bertie ahern , who as the current helmsman of the rotating eu presidency , is charged with the tricky task of kick-starting the stalled negotiations on creating a european constitution . talks to sign off a draft constitution collapsed in december when european leaders came to blows over voting weights .
now , with the advent of a new year come fresh talks , and no matter how tough the job might be , bertie ahern is optimistic that agreement can be reached by the end of 2004 .
“ i can not promise that the constitution will be agreed in our presidency , but equally it would be premature to conclude that it will not , ” ahern said .
he added that it would be preferable for agreement to be reached as soon as possible , as failure to do so could result in the development of a dangerous vacuum . german support german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the forum in place of chancellor gerhard schröder , who was ill , pledged ahern germany ’ s full support .
he , too , stressed the importance of agreeing on a constitution before the end of the year , warning that failure to achieve this would result in a single europe which moved at different speeds . in the absence of a constitution , europe is bound by the decision-making processes set out in the nice treaty .
it was this treaty under which spain and poland were granted what many perceive as disproportionate power and almost as many votes as much larger union states such as france and germany .
the nice treaty contributed to the deadlock in constitution talks at the end of last year . but fischer was quick to emphasize that the problems with the nice treaty are not about voting weights .
“ our problems with nice are quite different .
the decision mechanisms in the nice treaty are based on blocking minorities .
under the nice model 90 votes are needed to block decisions , ” fischer said at the forum . those in favor of the draft constitution maintain that it will make it more difficult for motions to be blocked when the union expands from 15 to 25 members on may 1 .
and being able to make decisions clearly and quickly is crucial for europe .
as joschka fischer was at pains to point out at the forum .
“ the world won ’ t wait for europe , and europe can not play an effective role in the world if it is caught up in arguments on majorities and money , ” he said . measured spending indeed fischer was vocal on future spending patterns within the eu , stressing that when the 10 new states become official members in the spring , the union should not start spending more , but should ensure that the money is better distributed .
“ european union spending must be stabilised and should not make up more than one percent of gross national product , ” said fischer . the foreign minister also spoke out in favour of negotiations on allowing turkey to join the eu .
a decision from brussels is expected later this year , but fischer added that a deciding factor would be the progress turkey makes in pushing through its own reforms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ireland takes helm of eu on jan .

young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service . german politicians have long been debating plans to abandon the draft in favor of a professional army .
but getting rid of conscription would also entail an end to its alternative - community service .
the details are as yet unconfirmed , but the government this year looks set to shorten the length of compulsory community service from 10 to nine months - the same that is required for military service .
according to reports in the financial times deutschland , this would be the first step towards a phase-out of both military and community service by 2008 .
a government spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports ahead of a meeting on thursday , when the minister for family affairs renate schmidt , is due to present her report on the future of community service .
a coming catastrophe ?
around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service in a senior citizen 's home charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
joachim kendelbacher from the workers ' welfare organisation told deutsche welle that his organisation , which currently employs around 6,000 people doing their alternative community service , would suffer heavily if their jobs were to be cut .
" we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , " he said .
" in some sectors this will certainly be the case .
i ’ m thinking of services like going for walks with old people in the nursing homes , reading literature to old people or doing office work .
if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . "
schmidt has said that , should community service be cut , she is demanding a five-year phase-out period .
" assuming that the decision to end community service comes in this year , we 'd need until 2010 to come to terms with the reorganization that would be needed , " she said .
" we ca n't just get rid of conscription overnight .
otherwise essential social structures would simply break apart . "
schmidt said that she is generally not against mandatory service .
" but the duties of the armed forces have changed .
aside from this , we ca n't provide for the military when , each year , we 're only getting less than half of the people up for service into the military . "
holding onto compulsory community service once military service is abolished would be unconstitutional in schmidt 's view .
she says voluntary service should receive more recognition and more financial backing , perhaps from the € 885 million a year currently spent on the community service program .
bundeswehr cuts german defence minister peter struck is already preparing the armed forces structurally for the post-conscription era of fewer troops and a tighter budget .
he 's reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion .
over the weekend , struck said that in times when germany is having to enforce painful cuts in the social and welfare system , the armed forces also have to expect budget cuts .
" all of my 12 predecessors have had to deal with the same phenomenon , " struck said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the soldiers want more money than is available .
this is nothing new . "
struck said all divisions of the armed forces - naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts , and that the government will buy only the most necessary pieces of equipment .
planned purchases of tanks and helicopters may either have to be downsized or cancelled .
some military bases will be closed .
opposition conservative leaders have called the planned cuts a " waterloo for the bundeswehr . "
christian democrat defence spokesman christian schmidt said that the drastic savings measures will painfully reduce the armed forces ’ clout in future peace-keeping and peace-enforcing missions abroad .
however , struck said the cuts are in keeping with an overall restructuring plan for the bundeswehr to prepare it for new strategic objectives within the nato alliance and the planned european rapid response force . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de united states , germany plan major military restructuring the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.01.2004 fresh hope for eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister bertie ahern wants a european constitution in place by the end of 2004 as european heads of state gathered in berlin for this year ’ s bertelsmann forum , attention was squarely focused on how to seal agreement on an eu constitution . representatives of some 30 countries gathered in the german capital on friday to discuss the way forward for the european union and its constitution .
all eyes were focused on irish prime minister bertie ahern , who as the current helmsman of the rotating eu presidency , is charged with the tricky task of kick-starting the stalled negotiations on creating a european constitution . talks to sign off a draft constitution collapsed in december when european leaders came to blows over voting weights .
now , with the advent of a new year come fresh talks , and no matter how tough the job might be , bertie ahern is optimistic that agreement can be reached by the end of 2004 .
“ i can not promise that the constitution will be agreed in our presidency , but equally it would be premature to conclude that it will not , ” ahern said .
he added that it would be preferable for agreement to be reached as soon as possible , as failure to do so could result in the development of a dangerous vacuum . german support german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the forum in place of chancellor gerhard schröder , who was ill , pledged ahern germany ’ s full support .
he , too , stressed the importance of agreeing on a constitution before the end of the year , warning that failure to achieve this would result in a single europe which moved at different speeds . in the absence of a constitution , europe is bound by the decision-making processes set out in the nice treaty .
it was this treaty under which spain and poland were granted what many perceive as disproportionate power and almost as many votes as much larger union states such as france and germany .
the nice treaty contributed to the deadlock in constitution talks at the end of last year . but fischer was quick to emphasize that the problems with the nice treaty are not about voting weights .
“ our problems with nice are quite different .
the decision mechanisms in the nice treaty are based on blocking minorities .
under the nice model 90 votes are needed to block decisions , ” fischer said at the forum . those in favor of the draft constitution maintain that it will make it more difficult for motions to be blocked when the union expands from 15 to 25 members on may 1 .
and being able to make decisions clearly and quickly is crucial for europe .
as joschka fischer was at pains to point out at the forum .
“ the world won ’ t wait for europe , and europe can not play an effective role in the world if it is caught up in arguments on majorities and money , ” he said . measured spending indeed fischer was vocal on future spending patterns within the eu , stressing that when the 10 new states become official members in the spring , the union should not start spending more , but should ensure that the money is better distributed .
“ european union spending must be stabilised and should not make up more than one percent of gross national product , ” said fischer . the foreign minister also spoke out in favour of negotiations on allowing turkey to join the eu .
a decision from brussels is expected later this year , but fischer added that a deciding factor would be the progress turkey makes in pushing through its own reforms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ireland takes helm of eu on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.01.2004 fresh hope for eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister bertie ahern wants a european constitution in place by the end of 2004 as european heads of state gathered in berlin for this year ’ s bertelsmann forum , attention was squarely focused on how to seal agreement on an eu constitution . representatives of some 30 countries gathered in the german capital on friday to discuss the way forward for the european union and its constitution .
all eyes were focused on irish prime minister bertie ahern , who as the current helmsman of the rotating eu presidency , is charged with the tricky task of kick-starting the stalled negotiations on creating a european constitution . talks to sign off a draft constitution collapsed in december when european leaders came to blows over voting weights .
now , with the advent of a new year come fresh talks , and no matter how tough the job might be , bertie ahern is optimistic that agreement can be reached by the end of 2004 .
“ i can not promise that the constitution will be agreed in our presidency , but equally it would be premature to conclude that it will not , ” ahern said .
he added that it would be preferable for agreement to be reached as soon as possible , as failure to do so could result in the development of a dangerous vacuum . german support german foreign minister joschka fischer , who attended the forum in place of chancellor gerhard schröder , who was ill , pledged ahern germany ’ s full support .
he , too , stressed the importance of agreeing on a constitution before the end of the year , warning that failure to achieve this would result in a single europe which moved at different speeds . in the absence of a constitution , europe is bound by the decision-making processes set out in the nice treaty .
it was this treaty under which spain and poland were granted what many perceive as disproportionate power and almost as many votes as much larger union states such as france and germany .
the nice treaty contributed to the deadlock in constitution talks at the end of last year . but fischer was quick to emphasize that the problems with the nice treaty are not about voting weights .
“ our problems with nice are quite different .
the decision mechanisms in the nice treaty are based on blocking minorities .

young german men could soon be free of compulsory military service .
but abolishing the draft may pose a serious problem for the social system , which depends on those men that opt for the alternative - community service . german politicians have long been debating plans to abandon the draft in favor of a professional army .
but getting rid of conscription would also entail an end to its alternative - community service .
the details are as yet unconfirmed , but the government this year looks set to shorten the length of compulsory community service from 10 to nine months - the same that is required for military service .
according to reports in the financial times deutschland , this would be the first step towards a phase-out of both military and community service by 2008 .
a government spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports ahead of a meeting on thursday , when the minister for family affairs renate schmidt , is due to present her report on the future of community service .
a coming catastrophe ?
around 90,000 young german men are registered yearly for community service , and approximately 80 percent end up working in hospitals or senior citizens ' homes doing essential work such as driving ambulances , caring for the disabled and elderly , and delivering meals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service in a senior citizen 's home charitable organizations fear there will be " catastrophic " consequences for healthcare in germany if this inexpensive and valuable workforce were to disappear .
joachim kendelbacher from the workers ' welfare organisation told deutsche welle that his organisation , which currently employs around 6,000 people doing their alternative community service , would suffer heavily if their jobs were to be cut .
" we ’ ll have to consider if the services these young people are doing can be totally abolished , " he said .
" in some sectors this will certainly be the case .
i ’ m thinking of services like going for walks with old people in the nursing homes , reading literature to old people or doing office work .
if these services are cut this definitely means a loss in quality . "
schmidt has said that , should community service be cut , she is demanding a five-year phase-out period .
" assuming that the decision to end community service comes in this year , we 'd need until 2010 to come to terms with the reorganization that would be needed , " she said .
" we ca n't just get rid of conscription overnight .
otherwise essential social structures would simply break apart . "
schmidt said that she is generally not against mandatory service .
" but the duties of the armed forces have changed .
aside from this , we ca n't provide for the military when , each year , we 're only getting less than half of the people up for service into the military . "
holding onto compulsory community service once military service is abolished would be unconstitutional in schmidt 's view .
she says voluntary service should receive more recognition and more financial backing , perhaps from the € 885 million a year currently spent on the community service program .
bundeswehr cuts german defence minister peter struck is already preparing the armed forces structurally for the post-conscription era of fewer troops and a tighter budget .
he 's reported to be planning cuts in armament projects for a projected savings of € 26 billion .
over the weekend , struck said that in times when germany is having to enforce painful cuts in the social and welfare system , the armed forces also have to expect budget cuts .
" all of my 12 predecessors have had to deal with the same phenomenon , " struck said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" the soldiers want more money than is available .
this is nothing new . "
struck said all divisions of the armed forces - naval , air and ground troops - will have to shoulder their share of the cuts , and that the government will buy only the most necessary pieces of equipment .
planned purchases of tanks and helicopters may either have to be downsized or cancelled .
some military bases will be closed .
opposition conservative leaders have called the planned cuts a " waterloo for the bundeswehr . "
christian democrat defence spokesman christian schmidt said that the drastic savings measures will painfully reduce the armed forces ’ clout in future peace-keeping and peace-enforcing missions abroad .
however , struck said the cuts are in keeping with an overall restructuring plan for the bundeswehr to prepare it for new strategic objectives within the nato alliance and the planned european rapid response force . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de united states , germany plan major military restructuring the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .

sir brian kerr will replace sir robert carswell in the top legal post .
sir robert is to become a law lord on monday .
the move follows the retirement of northern ireland-born judge lord hutton as a law lord .
lord hutton , himself a former lord chief justice in northern ireland , will step down shortly before he publishes his report into the death of weapons expert dr david kelly .
sir robert 's duties will include sitting in the house of lords and hearing final appeals on legal cases .
lord hutton , who is a crossbench peer , heard evidence into dr kelly 's death during the summer .
a statement on the hutton inquiry website said his retirement would have no effect on his work in writing his report on the six-week inquiry .

he said he looked forward to meeting the challenges posed by his new role .
lord hutton is to step down in the new year " the justice system is in a period of considerable change .
as judges we recognise that we must play our part in the implementation of those changes , " he said .
" for instance , we will be participating in the establishment of a new judicial appointments commission and will be dealing with the many legislative initiatives that will have an impact on the work of the courts .
" i am confident that the judiciary will rise to the challenge that these changes present while continuing to manage the ongoing and significant workload undertaken in courts at every level . "
mr justice kerr has been a high court judge since 1993 .
he was educated at st colman 's college in newry , county down , and at queen 's university in belfast .
he was called to the bar in northern ireland in 1970 and in england four years later .
he took silk in northern ireland in 1983 and he was appointed a senior crown counsel in 1988 .

the campaign was a success and now the 42-year-old is helping to find a solution to the question of what should replace joseph paxton 's original crystal palace .
i offered the crystal palace campaign some legal help and then in march 1998 they said i should become chairman .
we thought the multiplex scheme was ghastly .
it was the wrong scheme .
it paid no attention to the heritage of the park .
i 'm not anti-development , i 'm pro-sustainable regeneration .
i think we 've got a responsibility and we should n't get into the principle that just because a park is falling into a derelict state , just because it 's slipping , that we should then build on it .
i had spent a year in sheffield working on their unitary development plan -lrb- udp -rrb- .
it made me realise that the preservation of green space in urban areas was a problem and we need to do all we can to protect it .
i told them i need £ 25,000 by the end of the week - i had £ 25,000 by the end of the meeting philip kolvin my first reaction as a lawyer was to beat the multiplex through litigation .
we ran a case through the high court attacking planning because we wanted it delayed .
i really did feel very passionate about it .
it 's not just a regeneration issue .
it 's about democracy .
the views of local people were n't being listened to .
in june 1998 , around 600 people attended a meeting and i told them i did n't know if we could win the case to halt the multiplex but to hold it up we 'd need to start a judicial review .
i told them i needed £ 25,000 by the end of the week - i had £ 25,000 by the end of the meeting .
an elderly lady came up and said she really believed in what we were doing .
she gave me a £ 1,500 cheque there and then .
architects came up with this design for the park we also had two backers who gave me long-term underwriting of £ 10,000 apiece .
sadly we lost the judicial review .
after the defeat i went for a run along the ridge on the top of crystal palace park .
it 's incredibly beautiful .
it 's awe-inspiring .
i could n't have lived with that building -lsb- multiplex -rsb- there .
i went home and threw myself on the bed and then it came to me - a boycott .
picket lines it 's the moment that changed my life .
i realised law only has a small part to play in defeating development proposals .
we set about poisoning the multiplex scheme .
we worked out which cinema company was involved and asked them not to take part .
they did n't think that was a good idea so we started a campaign and held a march against them .
we also set up pickets across the country outside their cinemas .
the protest ran from strathclyde to poole - i did strathclyde with my wife and my six-month old daughter .
about 60 people ended up holding placards there .
people really wanted to help even though we told them our park was 500 miles away - they were fantastic .
the plans fell apart and it was time for us to take a step back philip kolvin we then objected to the licensing application .
we spent a lot of our money opposing that and won .
ken livingstone opposed it , as did local councillors .
they -lsb- multiplex people -rsb- applied for 14 pub licences and were granted one .
it was a fantastic day .
we produced an alternative prospectus to demonstrate how the campaign could create an economic and pr disaster for anyone who associated themselves with the development .
we sent it to the chairmen and managing directors of the 100 biggest leisure companies in the world .
we got some hostile letters back and some that said what a fantastic way of campaigning .
finally the plans fell apart .
then it was time for us to take a step back .
community support we held a meeting and all interested groups in the park were invited , whether seen as nice or nasty , horrible or endearing .
we invited everybody .
when everyone was in the room we handed over leadership .
we needed an independent person to run this , not leadership from within .
everyone to be seen on an equal basis .
the working group has now been running for over 18 months - all those warring factions are now able to talk to each other .
i got in touch with the architect chris wilkinson - it 's amazing that when you ask people to give up their time for free for a truly remarkable project they will .
he came up with a possible design for the top of the park .
it 's fantastic .
it would be a world class piece of architecture just like the original crystal palace .
we need all sectors of the community to support what happens next , whatever that is .

golden jubilee events are being organised by groups , including the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- .
the species was wiped out north of the border by persecution during the victorian era but returned in 1954 .
the scottish population of osprey has now reached 160 breeding pairs .
they spend the winter in africa .
as part of the celebrations , bird watchers will be able to see the ospreys at home in their eyries - or nests - and via cctv at four sites .
egg thieves duncan orr-ewing of rspb scotland said : " although this bird re-colonised scotland naturally , from then on the osprey 's population increase has been achieved largely as a result of much hard work by conservationists and land managers . "
since the 1950s , rspb wardens have at times staged all-night vigils around nests to guard the birds from the threat of egg thieves .
once quite common in the highlands , the osprey ceased to breed in scotland around 1916 after persecution by shooting and the theft of eggs .
although they continued to pass through on migration , none attempted to nest again until a pair settled at loch garten , in strathspey , and reared two young .
viewing sites since then almost two million nature lovers have visited the colony of osprey - cherished as scotland 's national bird - at the site .
moira baptie , of the forestry commission scotland , said : " we have been working for many years with partners to secure the spread of this iconic species .
" now we have opened remote viewing sites where the public will be able to watch these magnificent birds in action . "
however , the birds continue to face man-made hazards such as power lines , being caught up in fishing lines and swallowing fishing hooks .

egg thieves duncan orr-ewing of rspb scotland said : " although this bird re-colonised scotland naturally , from then on the osprey 's population increase has been achieved largely as a result of much hard work by conservationists and land managers . "
since the 1950s , rspb wardens have at times staged all-night vigils around nests to guard the birds from the threat of egg thieves .
once quite common in the highlands , the osprey ceased to breed in scotland around 1916 after persecution by shooting and the theft of eggs .
although they continued to pass through on migration , none attempted to nest again until a pair settled at loch garten , in strathspey , and reared two young .
viewing sites since then almost two million nature lovers have visited the colony of osprey - cherished as scotland 's national bird - at the site .
moira baptie , of the forestry commission scotland , said : " we have been working for many years with partners to secure the spread of this iconic species .
" now we have opened remote viewing sites where the public will be able to watch these magnificent birds in action . "
however , the birds continue to face man-made hazards such as power lines , being caught up in fishing lines and swallowing fishing hooks .
