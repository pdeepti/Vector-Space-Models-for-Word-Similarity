" we issued a fatwa urging the group to immediately free and not to harm the two french reporters , in recognition of france 's position on iraq , " sheikh mehdi al-sumaidaie , a senior cleric from the strict wahhabist current of islam , told afp . the cleric , an influential figure among extremist sunni muslim groups behind most kidnappings in iraq lately , also lambasted the iraqi government and us forces for staging a raid in the area where the pair was kidnapped , saying it had harmed efforts for their release . " the attack on latifiya disrupted the process of their release , " he said at a press conference . iraqi government forces backed by us troops staged their boldest raid yet against extremist sunni insurgents in latifiya , a lawless town south of baghdad which had become a no-go area for foreigners and iraqi security forces . snatched by a sect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporter georges malbrunot -lrb- right -rrb- of " le figaro " newspaper and french radio reporter christian chesnot of radio france internationale -lrb- rfi -rrb- were kidnapped in iraq on august 20 .
georges malbrunot of le figaro newspaper and christian chesnot of radio france internationale -lrb- rfi -rrb- were snatched in latifiya by a radical sect named the islamic army of iraq , which has previously abducted and executed hostages , including an italian journalist last month . the wahhabist cleric said that kidnapping journalists " gives government and us forces a pretext to carry out attacks against latifiya and fallujah . " on sunday , another group calling itself the black banners brigade of the secret islamic army -lrb- sia -rrb- , said in a videotaped statement aired on the dubai-based al-arabiya television station it was awaiting a fatwa on hostage-taking . " we call on the committee of ulema to issue a fatwa ... defining these acts , " one masked militant said , in reference to the most senior sunni muslims authority in the country . experts had warned that stepped up military activity against rebel strongholds in the area could harm the chances of malbrunot and chesnot , who have been held since august 20 . " the journalists should be freed to avoid turning france into an enemy of iraq , " sheikh mehdi said , highlighting france 's opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq in march 2003 . " we met with the french ambassador and the delegation representing the muslim faith in france and they assured us they would not seek the help of the americans to secure the release of the journalists , and would only rely on muslims , " the cleric added . french diplomatic efforts the wahabist leader nevertheless prodded the french government on the original condition set by the captors who had demanded paris scrap a controversial ban on wearing the islamic headscarf in state schools .
" we call on the french government to scrap or postpone the -lrb- islamic headscarf -rrb- law .
this would amount to a favor for all muslims , " he said . french diplomats criss-crossed the middle east all week to secure the release of the two journalists but their whereabouts were unknown on sunday . the conditions set by the captors were the first time a group tried to intervene in the domestic affairs of a foreign country not supporting the us presence in iraq . their tactic backfired as international condemnation poured in and the muslim world united behind the cause of the reporters . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de headscarf ban enforced in french schools as french officials continued their efforts to secure the release of two journalists held hostage in iraq on thursday , state schools started enforcing a ban on head scarves - the very issue that prompted the crisis .

dw-world spoke with her in munich . diana kerry has been visiting foreign countries to encourage american ex-patriots to vote as well as to drum up support for her brother john kerry 's campaign to beat incumbent president george w. bush in elections us elections this fall .
kerry 's little sister lived abroad for a long time herself . dw-world : as patron of “ americans overseas for kerry-edwards , ” you 're currently traveling throughout the world .
what is your aim ? diana kerry : i am interested in encouraging us citizens who live outside of the usa to register to vote .
we are very excited to have at our disposal a new web site to make possible the registration and application for the absentee ballot online .
this makes it very easy for people living in all sorts of remote places to be able to apply for their ballots from the united states .
and the deadline to do so is really right now .
i ’ ve been in mexico and i ’ ve been in canada and now i ’ m making a quick swing through europe to encourage people here to really do this because it ’ s such an important election and every vote really does count .
we saw in 2000 that the vote was very close , and we anticipate a very close election again this year you ’ re doing all this for your brother .
how would you describe your relationship to john kerry ? john is my elder brother and when we were growing up he was always the leader of the family and was somebody i used to like to tag along with and so we spent a lot of time doing things during our vacations together and that was a lot of fun .
i still have a close relationship with him , and i have - with great enthusiasm - enlisted in his campaign , because i really believe that he is the leader that we need for the country right now . what would be his main goals as president ? john has pledged to work hard to make the us stronger at home by investing in education and health care and jobs for all americans , and he also is very committed to working as a strong leader with principles and values within the global community .
and i think the restoring of respect both in our relationships with the rest of the world and our respect for the rest of the world is important , and that ’ s something to which my brother is very committed . in terms of priorities , are there differences between john kerry and george w. bush ? john kerry will lead the country in a very different direction and he has a positive vision for the country .
he has plans and programs which are committed to investing in people and not in the privileged .
i think that john will be the leader that we need for our country in these challenging times .
he understands that military force is not the only way in which you demonstrate strength .
he understands the uses of us power and i have confidence that he will make the world a better place . the republican party obviously see this in a different light .
at the recent republican national convention they said your brother was indecisive .
what do you think about accusations that he flip-flops on issues ? i don ’ t think they deserve to be discussed or considered .
they are just slanderous misrepresentations of my brother 's record .
john kerry has demonstrated over a significant career in public service that he is dedicated to all sorts of important issues ... and that kind of activity has been completely ignored by the republicans in their presentation of my brother 's service to the country .
and i think that their personal attacks were really just all they could do because they can ’ t run on their own record ; they have no leg to stand on in that regard .
it was really very disappointing to hear the vice president of the us devote his entire speech almost to tearing down his opponent and not really respecting the american people enough to talk in a positive way about the plans and programs that the party is proposing .
they should have been telling people what their extreme right-wing platform really is all about .
they obscured the truth of what their party stands for . both you and your brother have spent time abroad and know europe well .
from a european perspective , why would he be a good president ? i think that us citizens living overseas would understand that he shares an interest in a cooperative approach to global problems , which obviously is going to mean working with our traditional allies and repairing alliances that the current administration has turned its back on .
this will be important for us citizens living in europe and for the entire world really . could john kerry 's connections to europe be a disadvantage for him rather than an advantage in the election ? i ’ m not sure what you mean by john ’ s “ connection ” to europe .
certainly i consider that , with the challenges that face us in the 21st century , we need a global perspective and that this can only be an asset to the president of the united states and the leader of the free world . do you think the majority of americans see this in the same light ? that ’ s hard to say .
i certainly hope that this is true .
i have been traveling all over the country and talked to many people who are very concerned in as far-flung states as minnesota and nebraska and montana , where people are considered to be traditionally republican .
there is certainly a very great interest in the united states having better relations - and a recognition that we have alienated our traditional allies and we have lost our good name around the world . ralf lehnert interviewed diana kerry -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

dw-world spoke with her in munich . diana kerry has been visiting foreign countries to encourage american ex-patriots to vote as well as to drum up support for her brother john kerry 's campaign to beat incumbent president george w. bush in elections us elections this fall .
kerry 's little sister lived abroad for a long time herself . dw-world : as patron of “ americans overseas for kerry-edwards , ” you 're currently traveling throughout the world .
what is your aim ? diana kerry : i am interested in encouraging us citizens who live outside of the usa to register to vote .
we are very excited to have at our disposal a new web site to make possible the registration and application for the absentee ballot online .
this makes it very easy for people living in all sorts of remote places to be able to apply for their ballots from the united states .
and the deadline to do so is really right now .
i ’ ve been in mexico and i ’ ve been in canada and now i ’ m making a quick swing through europe to encourage people here to really do this because it ’ s such an important election and every vote really does count .
we saw in 2000 that the vote was very close , and we anticipate a very close election again this year you ’ re doing all this for your brother .
how would you describe your relationship to john kerry ? john is my elder brother and when we were growing up he was always the leader of the family and was somebody i used to like to tag along with and so we spent a lot of time doing things during our vacations together and that was a lot of fun .
i still have a close relationship with him , and i have - with great enthusiasm - enlisted in his campaign , because i really believe that he is the leader that we need for the country right now . what would be his main goals as president ? john has pledged to work hard to make the us stronger at home by investing in education and health care and jobs for all americans , and he also is very committed to working as a strong leader with principles and values within the global community .
and i think the restoring of respect both in our relationships with the rest of the world and our respect for the rest of the world is important , and that ’ s something to which my brother is very committed . in terms of priorities , are there differences between john kerry and george w. bush ? john kerry will lead the country in a very different direction and he has a positive vision for the country .
he has plans and programs which are committed to investing in people and not in the privileged .
i think that john will be the leader that we need for our country in these challenging times .
he understands that military force is not the only way in which you demonstrate strength .
he understands the uses of us power and i have confidence that he will make the world a better place . the republican party obviously see this in a different light .
at the recent republican national convention they said your brother was indecisive .
what do you think about accusations that he flip-flops on issues ? i don ’ t think they deserve to be discussed or considered .
they are just slanderous misrepresentations of my brother 's record .
john kerry has demonstrated over a significant career in public service that he is dedicated to all sorts of important issues ... and that kind of activity has been completely ignored by the republicans in their presentation of my brother 's service to the country .
and i think that their personal attacks were really just all they could do because they can ’ t run on their own record ; they have no leg to stand on in that regard .
it was really very disappointing to hear the vice president of the us devote his entire speech almost to tearing down his opponent and not really respecting the american people enough to talk in a positive way about the plans and programs that the party is proposing .
they should have been telling people what their extreme right-wing platform really is all about .
they obscured the truth of what their party stands for . both you and your brother have spent time abroad and know europe well .
from a european perspective , why would he be a good president ? i think that us citizens living overseas would understand that he shares an interest in a cooperative approach to global problems , which obviously is going to mean working with our traditional allies and repairing alliances that the current administration has turned its back on .
this will be important for us citizens living in europe and for the entire world really . could john kerry 's connections to europe be a disadvantage for him rather than an advantage in the election ? i ’ m not sure what you mean by john ’ s “ connection ” to europe .
certainly i consider that , with the challenges that face us in the 21st century , we need a global perspective and that this can only be an asset to the president of the united states and the leader of the free world . do you think the majority of americans see this in the same light ? that ’ s hard to say .
i certainly hope that this is true .
i have been traveling all over the country and talked to many people who are very concerned in as far-flung states as minnesota and nebraska and montana , where people are considered to be traditionally republican .
there is certainly a very great interest in the united states having better relations - and a recognition that we have alienated our traditional allies and we have lost our good name around the world . ralf lehnert interviewed diana kerry -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?
us presidential candidate john kerry officially accepted the democratic nomination on thursday , promising to restore america 's international reputation , and re-bind the fraying ties to europe .

dw-world spoke with her in munich . diana kerry has been visiting foreign countries to encourage american ex-patriots to vote as well as to drum up support for her brother john kerry 's campaign to beat incumbent president george w. bush in elections us elections this fall .
kerry 's little sister lived abroad for a long time herself . dw-world : as patron of “ americans overseas for kerry-edwards , ” you 're currently traveling throughout the world .
what is your aim ? diana kerry : i am interested in encouraging us citizens who live outside of the usa to register to vote .
we are very excited to have at our disposal a new web site to make possible the registration and application for the absentee ballot online .
this makes it very easy for people living in all sorts of remote places to be able to apply for their ballots from the united states .
and the deadline to do so is really right now .
i ’ ve been in mexico and i ’ ve been in canada and now i ’ m making a quick swing through europe to encourage people here to really do this because it ’ s such an important election and every vote really does count .
we saw in 2000 that the vote was very close , and we anticipate a very close election again this year you ’ re doing all this for your brother .
how would you describe your relationship to john kerry ? john is my elder brother and when we were growing up he was always the leader of the family and was somebody i used to like to tag along with and so we spent a lot of time doing things during our vacations together and that was a lot of fun .
i still have a close relationship with him , and i have - with great enthusiasm - enlisted in his campaign , because i really believe that he is the leader that we need for the country right now . what would be his main goals as president ? john has pledged to work hard to make the us stronger at home by investing in education and health care and jobs for all americans , and he also is very committed to working as a strong leader with principles and values within the global community .
and i think the restoring of respect both in our relationships with the rest of the world and our respect for the rest of the world is important , and that ’ s something to which my brother is very committed . in terms of priorities , are there differences between john kerry and george w. bush ? john kerry will lead the country in a very different direction and he has a positive vision for the country .
he has plans and programs which are committed to investing in people and not in the privileged .
i think that john will be the leader that we need for our country in these challenging times .
he understands that military force is not the only way in which you demonstrate strength .
he understands the uses of us power and i have confidence that he will make the world a better place . the republican party obviously see this in a different light .
at the recent republican national convention they said your brother was indecisive .
what do you think about accusations that he flip-flops on issues ? i don ’ t think they deserve to be discussed or considered .
they are just slanderous misrepresentations of my brother 's record .
john kerry has demonstrated over a significant career in public service that he is dedicated to all sorts of important issues ... and that kind of activity has been completely ignored by the republicans in their presentation of my brother 's service to the country .
and i think that their personal attacks were really just all they could do because they can ’ t run on their own record ; they have no leg to stand on in that regard .
it was really very disappointing to hear the vice president of the us devote his entire speech almost to tearing down his opponent and not really respecting the american people enough to talk in a positive way about the plans and programs that the party is proposing .
they should have been telling people what their extreme right-wing platform really is all about .
they obscured the truth of what their party stands for . both you and your brother have spent time abroad and know europe well .
from a european perspective , why would he be a good president ? i think that us citizens living overseas would understand that he shares an interest in a cooperative approach to global problems , which obviously is going to mean working with our traditional allies and repairing alliances that the current administration has turned its back on .
this will be important for us citizens living in europe and for the entire world really . could john kerry 's connections to europe be a disadvantage for him rather than an advantage in the election ? i ’ m not sure what you mean by john ’ s “ connection ” to europe .
certainly i consider that , with the challenges that face us in the 21st century , we need a global perspective and that this can only be an asset to the president of the united states and the leader of the free world . do you think the majority of americans see this in the same light ? that ’ s hard to say .
i certainly hope that this is true .
i have been traveling all over the country and talked to many people who are very concerned in as far-flung states as minnesota and nebraska and montana , where people are considered to be traditionally republican .
there is certainly a very great interest in the united states having better relations - and a recognition that we have alienated our traditional allies and we have lost our good name around the world . ralf lehnert interviewed diana kerry -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

we are very excited to have at our disposal a new web site to make possible the registration and application for the absentee ballot online .
this makes it very easy for people living in all sorts of remote places to be able to apply for their ballots from the united states .
and the deadline to do so is really right now .
i ’ ve been in mexico and i ’ ve been in canada and now i ’ m making a quick swing through europe to encourage people here to really do this because it ’ s such an important election and every vote really does count .
we saw in 2000 that the vote was very close , and we anticipate a very close election again this year you ’ re doing all this for your brother .
how would you describe your relationship to john kerry ? john is my elder brother and when we were growing up he was always the leader of the family and was somebody i used to like to tag along with and so we spent a lot of time doing things during our vacations together and that was a lot of fun .
i still have a close relationship with him , and i have - with great enthusiasm - enlisted in his campaign , because i really believe that he is the leader that we need for the country right now . what would be his main goals as president ? john has pledged to work hard to make the us stronger at home by investing in education and health care and jobs for all americans , and he also is very committed to working as a strong leader with principles and values within the global community .
and i think the restoring of respect both in our relationships with the rest of the world and our respect for the rest of the world is important , and that ’ s something to which my brother is very committed . in terms of priorities , are there differences between john kerry and george w. bush ? john kerry will lead the country in a very different direction and he has a positive vision for the country .
he has plans and programs which are committed to investing in people and not in the privileged .
i think that john will be the leader that we need for our country in these challenging times .
he understands that military force is not the only way in which you demonstrate strength .
he understands the uses of us power and i have confidence that he will make the world a better place . the republican party obviously see this in a different light .
at the recent republican national convention they said your brother was indecisive .
what do you think about accusations that he flip-flops on issues ? i don ’ t think they deserve to be discussed or considered .
they are just slanderous misrepresentations of my brother 's record .
john kerry has demonstrated over a significant career in public service that he is dedicated to all sorts of important issues ... and that kind of activity has been completely ignored by the republicans in their presentation of my brother 's service to the country .
and i think that their personal attacks were really just all they could do because they can ’ t run on their own record ; they have no leg to stand on in that regard .
it was really very disappointing to hear the vice president of the us devote his entire speech almost to tearing down his opponent and not really respecting the american people enough to talk in a positive way about the plans and programs that the party is proposing .
they should have been telling people what their extreme right-wing platform really is all about .
they obscured the truth of what their party stands for . both you and your brother have spent time abroad and know europe well .
from a european perspective , why would he be a good president ? i think that us citizens living overseas would understand that he shares an interest in a cooperative approach to global problems , which obviously is going to mean working with our traditional allies and repairing alliances that the current administration has turned its back on .
this will be important for us citizens living in europe and for the entire world really . could john kerry 's connections to europe be a disadvantage for him rather than an advantage in the election ? i ’ m not sure what you mean by john ’ s “ connection ” to europe .
certainly i consider that , with the challenges that face us in the 21st century , we need a global perspective and that this can only be an asset to the president of the united states and the leader of the free world . do you think the majority of americans see this in the same light ? that ’ s hard to say .
i certainly hope that this is true .
i have been traveling all over the country and talked to many people who are very concerned in as far-flung states as minnesota and nebraska and montana , where people are considered to be traditionally republican .
there is certainly a very great interest in the united states having better relations - and a recognition that we have alienated our traditional allies and we have lost our good name around the world . ralf lehnert interviewed diana kerry -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house bild backs bush an overwhelming case for germany ? former us treasurer campaigns for kerry foreign observers ready to monitor us elections europe -pipe- 05.09.2004 kerry 's sister gets out the vote in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diana kerry has been traveling the world to convince americans to vote as the us presidential race heats up , diana kerry , democratic party contender john kerry 's sister , traveled to europe to encourage americans living abroad to vote .
dw-world spoke with her in munich . diana kerry has been visiting foreign countries to encourage american ex-patriots to vote as well as to drum up support for her brother john kerry 's campaign to beat incumbent president george w. bush in elections us elections this fall .
kerry 's little sister lived abroad for a long time herself . dw-world : as patron of “ americans overseas for kerry-edwards , ” you 're currently traveling throughout the world .
what is your aim ? diana kerry : i am interested in encouraging us citizens who live outside of the usa to register to vote .
we are very excited to have at our disposal a new web site to make possible the registration and application for the absentee ballot online .
this makes it very easy for people living in all sorts of remote places to be able to apply for their ballots from the united states .
and the deadline to do so is really right now .
i ’ ve been in mexico and i ’ ve been in canada and now i ’ m making a quick swing through europe to encourage people here to really do this because it ’ s such an important election and every vote really does count .
we saw in 2000 that the vote was very close , and we anticipate a very close election again this year you ’ re doing all this for your brother .
how would you describe your relationship to john kerry ? john is my elder brother and when we were growing up he was always the leader of the family and was somebody i used to like to tag along with and so we spent a lot of time doing things during our vacations together and that was a lot of fun .
i still have a close relationship with him , and i have - with great enthusiasm - enlisted in his campaign , because i really believe that he is the leader that we need for the country right now . what would be his main goals as president ? john has pledged to work hard to make the us stronger at home by investing in education and health care and jobs for all americans , and he also is very committed to working as a strong leader with principles and values within the global community .
and i think the restoring of respect both in our relationships with the rest of the world and our respect for the rest of the world is important , and that ’ s something to which my brother is very committed . in terms of priorities , are there differences between john kerry and george w. bush ? john kerry will lead the country in a very different direction and he has a positive vision for the country .
he has plans and programs which are committed to investing in people and not in the privileged .
i think that john will be the leader that we need for our country in these challenging times .
he understands that military force is not the only way in which you demonstrate strength .
he understands the uses of us power and i have confidence that he will make the world a better place . the republican party obviously see this in a different light .
at the recent republican national convention they said your brother was indecisive .
what do you think about accusations that he flip-flops on issues ? i don ’ t think they deserve to be discussed or considered .
they are just slanderous misrepresentations of my brother 's record .
john kerry has demonstrated over a significant career in public service that he is dedicated to all sorts of important issues ... and that kind of activity has been completely ignored by the republicans in their presentation of my brother 's service to the country .
and i think that their personal attacks were really just all they could do because they can ’ t run on their own record ; they have no leg to stand on in that regard .
it was really very disappointing to hear the vice president of the us devote his entire speech almost to tearing down his opponent and not really respecting the american people enough to talk in a positive way about the plans and programs that the party is proposing .
they should have been telling people what their extreme right-wing platform really is all about .
they obscured the truth of what their party stands for . both you and your brother have spent time abroad and know europe well .
from a european perspective , why would he be a good president ? i think that us citizens living overseas would understand that he shares an interest in a cooperative approach to global problems , which obviously is going to mean working with our traditional allies and repairing alliances that the current administration has turned its back on .
this will be important for us citizens living in europe and for the entire world really . could john kerry 's connections to europe be a disadvantage for him rather than an advantage in the election ? i ’ m not sure what you mean by john ’ s “ connection ” to europe .
certainly i consider that , with the challenges that face us in the 21st century , we need a global perspective and that this can only be an asset to the president of the united states and the leader of the free world . do you think the majority of americans see this in the same light ? that ’ s hard to say .
i certainly hope that this is true .
i have been traveling all over the country and talked to many people who are very concerned in as far-flung states as minnesota and nebraska and montana , where people are considered to be traditionally republican .
there is certainly a very great interest in the united states having better relations - and a recognition that we have alienated our traditional allies and we have lost our good name around the world . ralf lehnert interviewed diana kerry -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

dw-world spoke with her in munich . diana kerry has been visiting foreign countries to encourage american ex-patriots to vote as well as to drum up support for her brother john kerry 's campaign to beat incumbent president george w. bush in elections us elections this fall .
kerry 's little sister lived abroad for a long time herself . dw-world : as patron of “ americans overseas for kerry-edwards , ” you 're currently traveling throughout the world .
what is your aim ? diana kerry : i am interested in encouraging us citizens who live outside of the usa to register to vote .
we are very excited to have at our disposal a new web site to make possible the registration and application for the absentee ballot online .
this makes it very easy for people living in all sorts of remote places to be able to apply for their ballots from the united states .
and the deadline to do so is really right now .
i ’ ve been in mexico and i ’ ve been in canada and now i ’ m making a quick swing through europe to encourage people here to really do this because it ’ s such an important election and every vote really does count .
we saw in 2000 that the vote was very close , and we anticipate a very close election again this year you ’ re doing all this for your brother .
how would you describe your relationship to john kerry ? john is my elder brother and when we were growing up he was always the leader of the family and was somebody i used to like to tag along with and so we spent a lot of time doing things during our vacations together and that was a lot of fun .
i still have a close relationship with him , and i have - with great enthusiasm - enlisted in his campaign , because i really believe that he is the leader that we need for the country right now . what would be his main goals as president ? john has pledged to work hard to make the us stronger at home by investing in education and health care and jobs for all americans , and he also is very committed to working as a strong leader with principles and values within the global community .
and i think the restoring of respect both in our relationships with the rest of the world and our respect for the rest of the world is important , and that ’ s something to which my brother is very committed . in terms of priorities , are there differences between john kerry and george w. bush ? john kerry will lead the country in a very different direction and he has a positive vision for the country .
he has plans and programs which are committed to investing in people and not in the privileged .
i think that john will be the leader that we need for our country in these challenging times .
he understands that military force is not the only way in which you demonstrate strength .
he understands the uses of us power and i have confidence that he will make the world a better place . the republican party obviously see this in a different light .
at the recent republican national convention they said your brother was indecisive .
what do you think about accusations that he flip-flops on issues ? i don ’ t think they deserve to be discussed or considered .
they are just slanderous misrepresentations of my brother 's record .
john kerry has demonstrated over a significant career in public service that he is dedicated to all sorts of important issues ... and that kind of activity has been completely ignored by the republicans in their presentation of my brother 's service to the country .
and i think that their personal attacks were really just all they could do because they can ’ t run on their own record ; they have no leg to stand on in that regard .
it was really very disappointing to hear the vice president of the us devote his entire speech almost to tearing down his opponent and not really respecting the american people enough to talk in a positive way about the plans and programs that the party is proposing .
they should have been telling people what their extreme right-wing platform really is all about .
they obscured the truth of what their party stands for . both you and your brother have spent time abroad and know europe well .
from a european perspective , why would he be a good president ? i think that us citizens living overseas would understand that he shares an interest in a cooperative approach to global problems , which obviously is going to mean working with our traditional allies and repairing alliances that the current administration has turned its back on .
this will be important for us citizens living in europe and for the entire world really . could john kerry 's connections to europe be a disadvantage for him rather than an advantage in the election ? i ’ m not sure what you mean by john ’ s “ connection ” to europe .
certainly i consider that , with the challenges that face us in the 21st century , we need a global perspective and that this can only be an asset to the president of the united states and the leader of the free world . do you think the majority of americans see this in the same light ? that ’ s hard to say .
i certainly hope that this is true .
i have been traveling all over the country and talked to many people who are very concerned in as far-flung states as minnesota and nebraska and montana , where people are considered to be traditionally republican .
there is certainly a very great interest in the united states having better relations - and a recognition that we have alienated our traditional allies and we have lost our good name around the world . ralf lehnert interviewed diana kerry -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

" the attack on latifiya disrupted the process of their release , " he said at a press conference . iraqi government forces backed by us troops staged their boldest raid yet against extremist sunni insurgents in latifiya , a lawless town south of baghdad which had become a no-go area for foreigners and iraqi security forces . snatched by a sect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporter georges malbrunot -lrb- right -rrb- of " le figaro " newspaper and french radio reporter christian chesnot of radio france internationale -lrb- rfi -rrb- were kidnapped in iraq on august 20 .

dw-world spoke with her in munich . diana kerry has been visiting foreign countries to encourage american ex-patriots to vote as well as to drum up support for her brother john kerry 's campaign to beat incumbent president george w. bush in elections us elections this fall .
kerry 's little sister lived abroad for a long time herself . dw-world : as patron of “ americans overseas for kerry-edwards , ” you 're currently traveling throughout the world .
what is your aim ? diana kerry : i am interested in encouraging us citizens who live outside of the usa to register to vote .
we are very excited to have at our disposal a new web site to make possible the registration and application for the absentee ballot online .
this makes it very easy for people living in all sorts of remote places to be able to apply for their ballots from the united states .
and the deadline to do so is really right now .
i ’ ve been in mexico and i ’ ve been in canada and now i ’ m making a quick swing through europe to encourage people here to really do this because it ’ s such an important election and every vote really does count .
we saw in 2000 that the vote was very close , and we anticipate a very close election again this year you ’ re doing all this for your brother .
how would you describe your relationship to john kerry ? john is my elder brother and when we were growing up he was always the leader of the family and was somebody i used to like to tag along with and so we spent a lot of time doing things during our vacations together and that was a lot of fun .
i still have a close relationship with him , and i have - with great enthusiasm - enlisted in his campaign , because i really believe that he is the leader that we need for the country right now . what would be his main goals as president ? john has pledged to work hard to make the us stronger at home by investing in education and health care and jobs for all americans , and he also is very committed to working as a strong leader with principles and values within the global community .
and i think the restoring of respect both in our relationships with the rest of the world and our respect for the rest of the world is important , and that ’ s something to which my brother is very committed . in terms of priorities , are there differences between john kerry and george w. bush ? john kerry will lead the country in a very different direction and he has a positive vision for the country .
he has plans and programs which are committed to investing in people and not in the privileged .
i think that john will be the leader that we need for our country in these challenging times .
he understands that military force is not the only way in which you demonstrate strength .
he understands the uses of us power and i have confidence that he will make the world a better place . the republican party obviously see this in a different light .
at the recent republican national convention they said your brother was indecisive .
what do you think about accusations that he flip-flops on issues ? i don ’ t think they deserve to be discussed or considered .
they are just slanderous misrepresentations of my brother 's record .
john kerry has demonstrated over a significant career in public service that he is dedicated to all sorts of important issues ... and that kind of activity has been completely ignored by the republicans in their presentation of my brother 's service to the country .
and i think that their personal attacks were really just all they could do because they can ’ t run on their own record ; they have no leg to stand on in that regard .
it was really very disappointing to hear the vice president of the us devote his entire speech almost to tearing down his opponent and not really respecting the american people enough to talk in a positive way about the plans and programs that the party is proposing .
they should have been telling people what their extreme right-wing platform really is all about .
they obscured the truth of what their party stands for . both you and your brother have spent time abroad and know europe well .
from a european perspective , why would he be a good president ? i think that us citizens living overseas would understand that he shares an interest in a cooperative approach to global problems , which obviously is going to mean working with our traditional allies and repairing alliances that the current administration has turned its back on .
this will be important for us citizens living in europe and for the entire world really . could john kerry 's connections to europe be a disadvantage for him rather than an advantage in the election ? i ’ m not sure what you mean by john ’ s “ connection ” to europe .
certainly i consider that , with the challenges that face us in the 21st century , we need a global perspective and that this can only be an asset to the president of the united states and the leader of the free world . do you think the majority of americans see this in the same light ? that ’ s hard to say .
i certainly hope that this is true .
i have been traveling all over the country and talked to many people who are very concerned in as far-flung states as minnesota and nebraska and montana , where people are considered to be traditionally republican .
there is certainly a very great interest in the united states having better relations - and a recognition that we have alienated our traditional allies and we have lost our good name around the world . ralf lehnert interviewed diana kerry -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

father anselm bilgri had been in charge of business at the st. bonifaz abbey in munich and andechs since 1986 .
he expanded it by selling products from the brewery and monastery , a schnapps distillery , yearly festivals , bars and a chain of restaurants called " der andechser . " the good times came to an end in late july , when andechs monastery gastronomy , which marketed the ten andechser restaurants , declared insolvency .

as a successful manager , father bilgri would have been an obvious choice to become the abbot at the st. bonifaz and andechs abbeys last summer .
instead johannes eckert assuming the position .
a row has been underway ever since . though eckert is considered economically open-minded , he apparently viewed his business chief as too powerful .
eckert gradually relieved bilgri of responsibilities , until he finally quit and left the monastery .
both bilgri and staiger have said declaring insolvency was unnecessary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house bild backs bush an overwhelming case for germany ? former us treasurer campaigns for kerry foreign observers ready to monitor us elections europe -pipe- 05.09.2004 kerry 's sister gets out the vote in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diana kerry has been traveling the world to convince americans to vote as the us presidential race heats up , diana kerry , democratic party contender john kerry 's sister , traveled to europe to encourage americans living abroad to vote .
dw-world spoke with her in munich . diana kerry has been visiting foreign countries to encourage american ex-patriots to vote as well as to drum up support for her brother john kerry 's campaign to beat incumbent president george w. bush in elections us elections this fall .
kerry 's little sister lived abroad for a long time herself . dw-world : as patron of “ americans overseas for kerry-edwards , ” you 're currently traveling throughout the world .
what is your aim ? diana kerry : i am interested in encouraging us citizens who live outside of the usa to register to vote .
we are very excited to have at our disposal a new web site to make possible the registration and application for the absentee ballot online .
this makes it very easy for people living in all sorts of remote places to be able to apply for their ballots from the united states .
and the deadline to do so is really right now .
i ’ ve been in mexico and i ’ ve been in canada and now i ’ m making a quick swing through europe to encourage people here to really do this because it ’ s such an important election and every vote really does count .
we saw in 2000 that the vote was very close , and we anticipate a very close election again this year you ’ re doing all this for your brother .
how would you describe your relationship to john kerry ? john is my elder brother and when we were growing up he was always the leader of the family and was somebody i used to like to tag along with and so we spent a lot of time doing things during our vacations together and that was a lot of fun .
i still have a close relationship with him , and i have - with great enthusiasm - enlisted in his campaign , because i really believe that he is the leader that we need for the country right now . what would be his main goals as president ? john has pledged to work hard to make the us stronger at home by investing in education and health care and jobs for all americans , and he also is very committed to working as a strong leader with principles and values within the global community .
and i think the restoring of respect both in our relationships with the rest of the world and our respect for the rest of the world is important , and that ’ s something to which my brother is very committed . in terms of priorities , are there differences between john kerry and george w. bush ? john kerry will lead the country in a very different direction and he has a positive vision for the country .
he has plans and programs which are committed to investing in people and not in the privileged .
i think that john will be the leader that we need for our country in these challenging times .
he understands that military force is not the only way in which you demonstrate strength .
he understands the uses of us power and i have confidence that he will make the world a better place . the republican party obviously see this in a different light .
at the recent republican national convention they said your brother was indecisive .
what do you think about accusations that he flip-flops on issues ? i don ’ t think they deserve to be discussed or considered .
they are just slanderous misrepresentations of my brother 's record .
john kerry has demonstrated over a significant career in public service that he is dedicated to all sorts of important issues ... and that kind of activity has been completely ignored by the republicans in their presentation of my brother 's service to the country .
and i think that their personal attacks were really just all they could do because they can ’ t run on their own record ; they have no leg to stand on in that regard .
it was really very disappointing to hear the vice president of the us devote his entire speech almost to tearing down his opponent and not really respecting the american people enough to talk in a positive way about the plans and programs that the party is proposing .
they should have been telling people what their extreme right-wing platform really is all about .
they obscured the truth of what their party stands for . both you and your brother have spent time abroad and know europe well .
from a european perspective , why would he be a good president ? i think that us citizens living overseas would understand that he shares an interest in a cooperative approach to global problems , which obviously is going to mean working with our traditional allies and repairing alliances that the current administration has turned its back on .
this will be important for us citizens living in europe and for the entire world really . could john kerry 's connections to europe be a disadvantage for him rather than an advantage in the election ? i ’ m not sure what you mean by john ’ s “ connection ” to europe .
certainly i consider that , with the challenges that face us in the 21st century , we need a global perspective and that this can only be an asset to the president of the united states and the leader of the free world . do you think the majority of americans see this in the same light ? that ’ s hard to say .
i certainly hope that this is true .
i have been traveling all over the country and talked to many people who are very concerned in as far-flung states as minnesota and nebraska and montana , where people are considered to be traditionally republican .
there is certainly a very great interest in the united states having better relations - and a recognition that we have alienated our traditional allies and we have lost our good name around the world . ralf lehnert interviewed diana kerry -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?
us presidential candidate john kerry officially accepted the democratic nomination on thursday , promising to restore america 's international reputation , and re-bind the fraying ties to europe .
-lrb- july 30 , 2004 -rrb- us voters in germany get rallying call the us presidential election in november is expected to be one of the closest contests in the country 's history .
every vote will count which is why organizations overseas are rallying voters abroad to participate .

kerry says if elected he 'll change u.s. foreign policy and renew frayed alliances .

dw-world spoke with her in munich . diana kerry has been visiting foreign countries to encourage american ex-patriots to vote as well as to drum up support for her brother john kerry 's campaign to beat incumbent president george w. bush in elections us elections this fall .
kerry 's little sister lived abroad for a long time herself . dw-world : as patron of “ americans overseas for kerry-edwards , ” you 're currently traveling throughout the world .
what is your aim ? diana kerry : i am interested in encouraging us citizens who live outside of the usa to register to vote .
we are very excited to have at our disposal a new web site to make possible the registration and application for the absentee ballot online .
this makes it very easy for people living in all sorts of remote places to be able to apply for their ballots from the united states .
and the deadline to do so is really right now .
i ’ ve been in mexico and i ’ ve been in canada and now i ’ m making a quick swing through europe to encourage people here to really do this because it ’ s such an important election and every vote really does count .
we saw in 2000 that the vote was very close , and we anticipate a very close election again this year you ’ re doing all this for your brother .
how would you describe your relationship to john kerry ? john is my elder brother and when we were growing up he was always the leader of the family and was somebody i used to like to tag along with and so we spent a lot of time doing things during our vacations together and that was a lot of fun .
i still have a close relationship with him , and i have - with great enthusiasm - enlisted in his campaign , because i really believe that he is the leader that we need for the country right now . what would be his main goals as president ? john has pledged to work hard to make the us stronger at home by investing in education and health care and jobs for all americans , and he also is very committed to working as a strong leader with principles and values within the global community .

and i think that their personal attacks were really just all they could do because they can ’ t run on their own record ; they have no leg to stand on in that regard .
it was really very disappointing to hear the vice president of the us devote his entire speech almost to tearing down his opponent and not really respecting the american people enough to talk in a positive way about the plans and programs that the party is proposing .
they should have been telling people what their extreme right-wing platform really is all about .
they obscured the truth of what their party stands for . both you and your brother have spent time abroad and know europe well .
from a european perspective , why would he be a good president ? i think that us citizens living overseas would understand that he shares an interest in a cooperative approach to global problems , which obviously is going to mean working with our traditional allies and repairing alliances that the current administration has turned its back on .
this will be important for us citizens living in europe and for the entire world really . could john kerry 's connections to europe be a disadvantage for him rather than an advantage in the election ? i ’ m not sure what you mean by john ’ s “ connection ” to europe .
certainly i consider that , with the challenges that face us in the 21st century , we need a global perspective and that this can only be an asset to the president of the united states and the leader of the free world . do you think the majority of americans see this in the same light ? that ’ s hard to say .

how would you describe your relationship to john kerry ? john is my elder brother and when we were growing up he was always the leader of the family and was somebody i used to like to tag along with and so we spent a lot of time doing things during our vacations together and that was a lot of fun .
i still have a close relationship with him , and i have - with great enthusiasm - enlisted in his campaign , because i really believe that he is the leader that we need for the country right now . what would be his main goals as president ? john has pledged to work hard to make the us stronger at home by investing in education and health care and jobs for all americans , and he also is very committed to working as a strong leader with principles and values within the global community .
and i think the restoring of respect both in our relationships with the rest of the world and our respect for the rest of the world is important , and that ’ s something to which my brother is very committed . in terms of priorities , are there differences between john kerry and george w. bush ? john kerry will lead the country in a very different direction and he has a positive vision for the country .
he has plans and programs which are committed to investing in people and not in the privileged .
i think that john will be the leader that we need for our country in these challenging times .
he understands that military force is not the only way in which you demonstrate strength .
he understands the uses of us power and i have confidence that he will make the world a better place . the republican party obviously see this in a different light .
at the recent republican national convention they said your brother was indecisive .
what do you think about accusations that he flip-flops on issues ? i don ’ t think they deserve to be discussed or considered .
they are just slanderous misrepresentations of my brother 's record .
john kerry has demonstrated over a significant career in public service that he is dedicated to all sorts of important issues ... and that kind of activity has been completely ignored by the republicans in their presentation of my brother 's service to the country .
and i think that their personal attacks were really just all they could do because they can ’ t run on their own record ; they have no leg to stand on in that regard .
it was really very disappointing to hear the vice president of the us devote his entire speech almost to tearing down his opponent and not really respecting the american people enough to talk in a positive way about the plans and programs that the party is proposing .
they should have been telling people what their extreme right-wing platform really is all about .
they obscured the truth of what their party stands for . both you and your brother have spent time abroad and know europe well .
from a european perspective , why would he be a good president ? i think that us citizens living overseas would understand that he shares an interest in a cooperative approach to global problems , which obviously is going to mean working with our traditional allies and repairing alliances that the current administration has turned its back on .
this will be important for us citizens living in europe and for the entire world really . could john kerry 's connections to europe be a disadvantage for him rather than an advantage in the election ? i ’ m not sure what you mean by john ’ s “ connection ” to europe .
certainly i consider that , with the challenges that face us in the 21st century , we need a global perspective and that this can only be an asset to the president of the united states and the leader of the free world . do you think the majority of americans see this in the same light ? that ’ s hard to say .

dw-world spoke with her in munich . diana kerry has been visiting foreign countries to encourage american ex-patriots to vote as well as to drum up support for her brother john kerry 's campaign to beat incumbent president george w. bush in elections us elections this fall .
kerry 's little sister lived abroad for a long time herself . dw-world : as patron of “ americans overseas for kerry-edwards , ” you 're currently traveling throughout the world .
what is your aim ? diana kerry : i am interested in encouraging us citizens who live outside of the usa to register to vote .
we are very excited to have at our disposal a new web site to make possible the registration and application for the absentee ballot online .
this makes it very easy for people living in all sorts of remote places to be able to apply for their ballots from the united states .
and the deadline to do so is really right now .
i ’ ve been in mexico and i ’ ve been in canada and now i ’ m making a quick swing through europe to encourage people here to really do this because it ’ s such an important election and every vote really does count .
we saw in 2000 that the vote was very close , and we anticipate a very close election again this year you ’ re doing all this for your brother .
how would you describe your relationship to john kerry ? john is my elder brother and when we were growing up he was always the leader of the family and was somebody i used to like to tag along with and so we spent a lot of time doing things during our vacations together and that was a lot of fun .
i still have a close relationship with him , and i have - with great enthusiasm - enlisted in his campaign , because i really believe that he is the leader that we need for the country right now . what would be his main goals as president ? john has pledged to work hard to make the us stronger at home by investing in education and health care and jobs for all americans , and he also is very committed to working as a strong leader with principles and values within the global community .
and i think the restoring of respect both in our relationships with the rest of the world and our respect for the rest of the world is important , and that ’ s something to which my brother is very committed . in terms of priorities , are there differences between john kerry and george w. bush ? john kerry will lead the country in a very different direction and he has a positive vision for the country .
he has plans and programs which are committed to investing in people and not in the privileged .
i think that john will be the leader that we need for our country in these challenging times .
he understands that military force is not the only way in which you demonstrate strength .
he understands the uses of us power and i have confidence that he will make the world a better place . the republican party obviously see this in a different light .
at the recent republican national convention they said your brother was indecisive .
what do you think about accusations that he flip-flops on issues ? i don ’ t think they deserve to be discussed or considered .
they are just slanderous misrepresentations of my brother 's record .
john kerry has demonstrated over a significant career in public service that he is dedicated to all sorts of important issues ... and that kind of activity has been completely ignored by the republicans in their presentation of my brother 's service to the country .
and i think that their personal attacks were really just all they could do because they can ’ t run on their own record ; they have no leg to stand on in that regard .
it was really very disappointing to hear the vice president of the us devote his entire speech almost to tearing down his opponent and not really respecting the american people enough to talk in a positive way about the plans and programs that the party is proposing .
they should have been telling people what their extreme right-wing platform really is all about .
they obscured the truth of what their party stands for . both you and your brother have spent time abroad and know europe well .
from a european perspective , why would he be a good president ? i think that us citizens living overseas would understand that he shares an interest in a cooperative approach to global problems , which obviously is going to mean working with our traditional allies and repairing alliances that the current administration has turned its back on .
this will be important for us citizens living in europe and for the entire world really . could john kerry 's connections to europe be a disadvantage for him rather than an advantage in the election ? i ’ m not sure what you mean by john ’ s “ connection ” to europe .
certainly i consider that , with the challenges that face us in the 21st century , we need a global perspective and that this can only be an asset to the president of the united states and the leader of the free world . do you think the majority of americans see this in the same light ? that ’ s hard to say .
i certainly hope that this is true .
i have been traveling all over the country and talked to many people who are very concerned in as far-flung states as minnesota and nebraska and montana , where people are considered to be traditionally republican .
there is certainly a very great interest in the united states having better relations - and a recognition that we have alienated our traditional allies and we have lost our good name around the world . ralf lehnert interviewed diana kerry -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

-lrb- july 30 , 2004 -rrb- us voters in germany get rallying call the us presidential election in november is expected to be one of the closest contests in the country 's history .

father anselm bilgri had been in charge of business at the st. bonifaz abbey in munich and andechs since 1986 .
he expanded it by selling products from the brewery and monastery , a schnapps distillery , yearly festivals , bars and a chain of restaurants called " der andechser . " the good times came to an end in late july , when andechs monastery gastronomy , which marketed the ten andechser restaurants , declared insolvency .
the company just was n't earning as much as it was spending , the monastery said . church profit but it 's not that business and religion do n't go together .
abbeys throughout europe sell the fruits of their labor in their own shops or over the internet .
some , particularly in northeastern greece , even rent out rooms - to men - for overnight stays and lease land to lumber firms . figures concerning church profits , however , are difficult to come by .
the vatican , one of the largest religious financial powers , is notoriously tight-lipped about such business affairs .
the vatican 's asset management alone was thought to be valued at € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- in 1994 .
the holy see 's earnings stem largely from a printing plant , a publisher , a book store as well as from the selling vatican coins and stamps .

private investors own the remaining shares . declaring insolvency was actually part of a power struggle .
as a successful manager , father bilgri would have been an obvious choice to become the abbot at the st. bonifaz and andechs abbeys last summer .
instead johannes eckert assuming the position .
a row has been underway ever since . though eckert is considered economically open-minded , he apparently viewed his business chief as too powerful .
eckert gradually relieved bilgri of responsibilities , until he finally quit and left the monastery .
both bilgri and staiger have said declaring insolvency was unnecessary .
but eckert has said he wanted to avoid things getting even worse . otherwise , its business as usual at andechs .
father bilgri also found his way .
still a monk , he 's opened a business consultancy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beer brewing monks battle over monastery 's future a power struggle at a monastery famous for producing beer is getting ugly .

eckert gradually relieved bilgri of responsibilities , until he finally quit and left the monastery .
both bilgri and staiger have said declaring insolvency was unnecessary .

dw-world spoke with her in munich . diana kerry has been visiting foreign countries to encourage american ex-patriots to vote as well as to drum up support for her brother john kerry 's campaign to beat incumbent president george w. bush in elections us elections this fall .
kerry 's little sister lived abroad for a long time herself . dw-world : as patron of “ americans overseas for kerry-edwards , ” you 're currently traveling throughout the world .
what is your aim ? diana kerry : i am interested in encouraging us citizens who live outside of the usa to register to vote .
we are very excited to have at our disposal a new web site to make possible the registration and application for the absentee ballot online .
this makes it very easy for people living in all sorts of remote places to be able to apply for their ballots from the united states .
and the deadline to do so is really right now .
i ’ ve been in mexico and i ’ ve been in canada and now i ’ m making a quick swing through europe to encourage people here to really do this because it ’ s such an important election and every vote really does count .
we saw in 2000 that the vote was very close , and we anticipate a very close election again this year you ’ re doing all this for your brother .
how would you describe your relationship to john kerry ? john is my elder brother and when we were growing up he was always the leader of the family and was somebody i used to like to tag along with and so we spent a lot of time doing things during our vacations together and that was a lot of fun .
i still have a close relationship with him , and i have - with great enthusiasm - enlisted in his campaign , because i really believe that he is the leader that we need for the country right now . what would be his main goals as president ? john has pledged to work hard to make the us stronger at home by investing in education and health care and jobs for all americans , and he also is very committed to working as a strong leader with principles and values within the global community .
and i think the restoring of respect both in our relationships with the rest of the world and our respect for the rest of the world is important , and that ’ s something to which my brother is very committed . in terms of priorities , are there differences between john kerry and george w. bush ? john kerry will lead the country in a very different direction and he has a positive vision for the country .
he has plans and programs which are committed to investing in people and not in the privileged .
i think that john will be the leader that we need for our country in these challenging times .
he understands that military force is not the only way in which you demonstrate strength .
he understands the uses of us power and i have confidence that he will make the world a better place . the republican party obviously see this in a different light .
at the recent republican national convention they said your brother was indecisive .
what do you think about accusations that he flip-flops on issues ? i don ’ t think they deserve to be discussed or considered .
they are just slanderous misrepresentations of my brother 's record .
john kerry has demonstrated over a significant career in public service that he is dedicated to all sorts of important issues ... and that kind of activity has been completely ignored by the republicans in their presentation of my brother 's service to the country .
and i think that their personal attacks were really just all they could do because they can ’ t run on their own record ; they have no leg to stand on in that regard .
it was really very disappointing to hear the vice president of the us devote his entire speech almost to tearing down his opponent and not really respecting the american people enough to talk in a positive way about the plans and programs that the party is proposing .
they should have been telling people what their extreme right-wing platform really is all about .
they obscured the truth of what their party stands for . both you and your brother have spent time abroad and know europe well .
from a european perspective , why would he be a good president ? i think that us citizens living overseas would understand that he shares an interest in a cooperative approach to global problems , which obviously is going to mean working with our traditional allies and repairing alliances that the current administration has turned its back on .
this will be important for us citizens living in europe and for the entire world really . could john kerry 's connections to europe be a disadvantage for him rather than an advantage in the election ? i ’ m not sure what you mean by john ’ s “ connection ” to europe .
certainly i consider that , with the challenges that face us in the 21st century , we need a global perspective and that this can only be an asset to the president of the united states and the leader of the free world . do you think the majority of americans see this in the same light ? that ’ s hard to say .
i certainly hope that this is true .
i have been traveling all over the country and talked to many people who are very concerned in as far-flung states as minnesota and nebraska and montana , where people are considered to be traditionally republican .
there is certainly a very great interest in the united states having better relations - and a recognition that we have alienated our traditional allies and we have lost our good name around the world . ralf lehnert interviewed diana kerry -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

father anselm bilgri had been in charge of business at the st. bonifaz abbey in munich and andechs since 1986 .
he expanded it by selling products from the brewery and monastery , a schnapps distillery , yearly festivals , bars and a chain of restaurants called " der andechser . " the good times came to an end in late july , when andechs monastery gastronomy , which marketed the ten andechser restaurants , declared insolvency .
the company just was n't earning as much as it was spending , the monastery said . church profit but it 's not that business and religion do n't go together .
abbeys throughout europe sell the fruits of their labor in their own shops or over the internet .
some , particularly in northeastern greece , even rent out rooms - to men - for overnight stays and lease land to lumber firms . figures concerning church profits , however , are difficult to come by .
the vatican , one of the largest religious financial powers , is notoriously tight-lipped about such business affairs .
the vatican 's asset management alone was thought to be valued at € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- in 1994 .
the holy see 's earnings stem largely from a printing plant , a publisher , a book store as well as from the selling vatican coins and stamps .
millions of pilgrims fill the coffers of souvenir and museum shops . power struggle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andechs monastery in andechs , the brewery has a 42 percent stake in andechs monastery gastronomy , while businessman rainer staiger controls 38 percent .
private investors own the remaining shares . declaring insolvency was actually part of a power struggle .
as a successful manager , father bilgri would have been an obvious choice to become the abbot at the st. bonifaz and andechs abbeys last summer .
instead johannes eckert assuming the position .
a row has been underway ever since . though eckert is considered economically open-minded , he apparently viewed his business chief as too powerful .
eckert gradually relieved bilgri of responsibilities , until he finally quit and left the monastery .
both bilgri and staiger have said declaring insolvency was unnecessary .
but eckert has said he wanted to avoid things getting even worse . otherwise , its business as usual at andechs .
father bilgri also found his way .

" the attack on latifiya disrupted the process of their release , " he said at a press conference . iraqi government forces backed by us troops staged their boldest raid yet against extremist sunni insurgents in latifiya , a lawless town south of baghdad which had become a no-go area for foreigners and iraqi security forces . snatched by a sect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporter georges malbrunot -lrb- right -rrb- of " le figaro " newspaper and french radio reporter christian chesnot of radio france internationale -lrb- rfi -rrb- were kidnapped in iraq on august 20 .

father anselm bilgri had been in charge of business at the st. bonifaz abbey in munich and andechs since 1986 .
he expanded it by selling products from the brewery and monastery , a schnapps distillery , yearly festivals , bars and a chain of restaurants called " der andechser . " the good times came to an end in late july , when andechs monastery gastronomy , which marketed the ten andechser restaurants , declared insolvency .
the company just was n't earning as much as it was spending , the monastery said . church profit but it 's not that business and religion do n't go together .
abbeys throughout europe sell the fruits of their labor in their own shops or over the internet .
some , particularly in northeastern greece , even rent out rooms - to men - for overnight stays and lease land to lumber firms . figures concerning church profits , however , are difficult to come by .
the vatican , one of the largest religious financial powers , is notoriously tight-lipped about such business affairs .
the vatican 's asset management alone was thought to be valued at € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- in 1994 .
the holy see 's earnings stem largely from a printing plant , a publisher , a book store as well as from the selling vatican coins and stamps .

private investors own the remaining shares . declaring insolvency was actually part of a power struggle .
as a successful manager , father bilgri would have been an obvious choice to become the abbot at the st. bonifaz and andechs abbeys last summer .
instead johannes eckert assuming the position .
a row has been underway ever since . though eckert is considered economically open-minded , he apparently viewed his business chief as too powerful .
eckert gradually relieved bilgri of responsibilities , until he finally quit and left the monastery .
both bilgri and staiger have said declaring insolvency was unnecessary .
but eckert has said he wanted to avoid things getting even worse . otherwise , its business as usual at andechs .
father bilgri also found his way .
still a monk , he 's opened a business consultancy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beer brewing monks battle over monastery 's future a power struggle at a monastery famous for producing beer is getting ugly .

dw-world spoke with her in munich . diana kerry has been visiting foreign countries to encourage american ex-patriots to vote as well as to drum up support for her brother john kerry 's campaign to beat incumbent president george w. bush in elections us elections this fall .
kerry 's little sister lived abroad for a long time herself . dw-world : as patron of “ americans overseas for kerry-edwards , ” you 're currently traveling throughout the world .
what is your aim ? diana kerry : i am interested in encouraging us citizens who live outside of the usa to register to vote .
we are very excited to have at our disposal a new web site to make possible the registration and application for the absentee ballot online .
this makes it very easy for people living in all sorts of remote places to be able to apply for their ballots from the united states .
and the deadline to do so is really right now .
i ’ ve been in mexico and i ’ ve been in canada and now i ’ m making a quick swing through europe to encourage people here to really do this because it ’ s such an important election and every vote really does count .
we saw in 2000 that the vote was very close , and we anticipate a very close election again this year you ’ re doing all this for your brother .
how would you describe your relationship to john kerry ? john is my elder brother and when we were growing up he was always the leader of the family and was somebody i used to like to tag along with and so we spent a lot of time doing things during our vacations together and that was a lot of fun .
i still have a close relationship with him , and i have - with great enthusiasm - enlisted in his campaign , because i really believe that he is the leader that we need for the country right now . what would be his main goals as president ? john has pledged to work hard to make the us stronger at home by investing in education and health care and jobs for all americans , and he also is very committed to working as a strong leader with principles and values within the global community .
and i think the restoring of respect both in our relationships with the rest of the world and our respect for the rest of the world is important , and that ’ s something to which my brother is very committed . in terms of priorities , are there differences between john kerry and george w. bush ? john kerry will lead the country in a very different direction and he has a positive vision for the country .
he has plans and programs which are committed to investing in people and not in the privileged .
i think that john will be the leader that we need for our country in these challenging times .
he understands that military force is not the only way in which you demonstrate strength .
he understands the uses of us power and i have confidence that he will make the world a better place . the republican party obviously see this in a different light .
at the recent republican national convention they said your brother was indecisive .
what do you think about accusations that he flip-flops on issues ? i don ’ t think they deserve to be discussed or considered .
they are just slanderous misrepresentations of my brother 's record .
john kerry has demonstrated over a significant career in public service that he is dedicated to all sorts of important issues ... and that kind of activity has been completely ignored by the republicans in their presentation of my brother 's service to the country .
and i think that their personal attacks were really just all they could do because they can ’ t run on their own record ; they have no leg to stand on in that regard .
it was really very disappointing to hear the vice president of the us devote his entire speech almost to tearing down his opponent and not really respecting the american people enough to talk in a positive way about the plans and programs that the party is proposing .
they should have been telling people what their extreme right-wing platform really is all about .
they obscured the truth of what their party stands for . both you and your brother have spent time abroad and know europe well .
from a european perspective , why would he be a good president ? i think that us citizens living overseas would understand that he shares an interest in a cooperative approach to global problems , which obviously is going to mean working with our traditional allies and repairing alliances that the current administration has turned its back on .
this will be important for us citizens living in europe and for the entire world really . could john kerry 's connections to europe be a disadvantage for him rather than an advantage in the election ? i ’ m not sure what you mean by john ’ s “ connection ” to europe .
certainly i consider that , with the challenges that face us in the 21st century , we need a global perspective and that this can only be an asset to the president of the united states and the leader of the free world . do you think the majority of americans see this in the same light ? that ’ s hard to say .
i certainly hope that this is true .
i have been traveling all over the country and talked to many people who are very concerned in as far-flung states as minnesota and nebraska and montana , where people are considered to be traditionally republican .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house bild backs bush an overwhelming case for germany ? former us treasurer campaigns for kerry foreign observers ready to monitor us elections europe -pipe- 05.09.2004 kerry 's sister gets out the vote in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diana kerry has been traveling the world to convince americans to vote as the us presidential race heats up , diana kerry , democratic party contender john kerry 's sister , traveled to europe to encourage americans living abroad to vote .
dw-world spoke with her in munich . diana kerry has been visiting foreign countries to encourage american ex-patriots to vote as well as to drum up support for her brother john kerry 's campaign to beat incumbent president george w. bush in elections us elections this fall .
kerry 's little sister lived abroad for a long time herself . dw-world : as patron of “ americans overseas for kerry-edwards , ” you 're currently traveling throughout the world .
what is your aim ? diana kerry : i am interested in encouraging us citizens who live outside of the usa to register to vote .
we are very excited to have at our disposal a new web site to make possible the registration and application for the absentee ballot online .
this makes it very easy for people living in all sorts of remote places to be able to apply for their ballots from the united states .
and the deadline to do so is really right now .
i ’ ve been in mexico and i ’ ve been in canada and now i ’ m making a quick swing through europe to encourage people here to really do this because it ’ s such an important election and every vote really does count .
we saw in 2000 that the vote was very close , and we anticipate a very close election again this year you ’ re doing all this for your brother .
how would you describe your relationship to john kerry ? john is my elder brother and when we were growing up he was always the leader of the family and was somebody i used to like to tag along with and so we spent a lot of time doing things during our vacations together and that was a lot of fun .
i still have a close relationship with him , and i have - with great enthusiasm - enlisted in his campaign , because i really believe that he is the leader that we need for the country right now . what would be his main goals as president ? john has pledged to work hard to make the us stronger at home by investing in education and health care and jobs for all americans , and he also is very committed to working as a strong leader with principles and values within the global community .
and i think the restoring of respect both in our relationships with the rest of the world and our respect for the rest of the world is important , and that ’ s something to which my brother is very committed . in terms of priorities , are there differences between john kerry and george w. bush ? john kerry will lead the country in a very different direction and he has a positive vision for the country .
he has plans and programs which are committed to investing in people and not in the privileged .
i think that john will be the leader that we need for our country in these challenging times .
he understands that military force is not the only way in which you demonstrate strength .
he understands the uses of us power and i have confidence that he will make the world a better place . the republican party obviously see this in a different light .
at the recent republican national convention they said your brother was indecisive .
what do you think about accusations that he flip-flops on issues ? i don ’ t think they deserve to be discussed or considered .
they are just slanderous misrepresentations of my brother 's record .
john kerry has demonstrated over a significant career in public service that he is dedicated to all sorts of important issues ... and that kind of activity has been completely ignored by the republicans in their presentation of my brother 's service to the country .
and i think that their personal attacks were really just all they could do because they can ’ t run on their own record ; they have no leg to stand on in that regard .
it was really very disappointing to hear the vice president of the us devote his entire speech almost to tearing down his opponent and not really respecting the american people enough to talk in a positive way about the plans and programs that the party is proposing .
they should have been telling people what their extreme right-wing platform really is all about .
they obscured the truth of what their party stands for . both you and your brother have spent time abroad and know europe well .
from a european perspective , why would he be a good president ? i think that us citizens living overseas would understand that he shares an interest in a cooperative approach to global problems , which obviously is going to mean working with our traditional allies and repairing alliances that the current administration has turned its back on .
this will be important for us citizens living in europe and for the entire world really . could john kerry 's connections to europe be a disadvantage for him rather than an advantage in the election ? i ’ m not sure what you mean by john ’ s “ connection ” to europe .
certainly i consider that , with the challenges that face us in the 21st century , we need a global perspective and that this can only be an asset to the president of the united states and the leader of the free world . do you think the majority of americans see this in the same light ? that ’ s hard to say .
i certainly hope that this is true .
i have been traveling all over the country and talked to many people who are very concerned in as far-flung states as minnesota and nebraska and montana , where people are considered to be traditionally republican .
there is certainly a very great interest in the united states having better relations - and a recognition that we have alienated our traditional allies and we have lost our good name around the world . ralf lehnert interviewed diana kerry -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

dw-world spoke with her in munich . diana kerry has been visiting foreign countries to encourage american ex-patriots to vote as well as to drum up support for her brother john kerry 's campaign to beat incumbent president george w. bush in elections us elections this fall .
kerry 's little sister lived abroad for a long time herself . dw-world : as patron of “ americans overseas for kerry-edwards , ” you 're currently traveling throughout the world .
what is your aim ? diana kerry : i am interested in encouraging us citizens who live outside of the usa to register to vote .
we are very excited to have at our disposal a new web site to make possible the registration and application for the absentee ballot online .
this makes it very easy for people living in all sorts of remote places to be able to apply for their ballots from the united states .
and the deadline to do so is really right now .
i ’ ve been in mexico and i ’ ve been in canada and now i ’ m making a quick swing through europe to encourage people here to really do this because it ’ s such an important election and every vote really does count .
we saw in 2000 that the vote was very close , and we anticipate a very close election again this year you ’ re doing all this for your brother .
how would you describe your relationship to john kerry ? john is my elder brother and when we were growing up he was always the leader of the family and was somebody i used to like to tag along with and so we spent a lot of time doing things during our vacations together and that was a lot of fun .
i still have a close relationship with him , and i have - with great enthusiasm - enlisted in his campaign , because i really believe that he is the leader that we need for the country right now . what would be his main goals as president ? john has pledged to work hard to make the us stronger at home by investing in education and health care and jobs for all americans , and he also is very committed to working as a strong leader with principles and values within the global community .
and i think the restoring of respect both in our relationships with the rest of the world and our respect for the rest of the world is important , and that ’ s something to which my brother is very committed . in terms of priorities , are there differences between john kerry and george w. bush ? john kerry will lead the country in a very different direction and he has a positive vision for the country .
he has plans and programs which are committed to investing in people and not in the privileged .
i think that john will be the leader that we need for our country in these challenging times .
he understands that military force is not the only way in which you demonstrate strength .
he understands the uses of us power and i have confidence that he will make the world a better place . the republican party obviously see this in a different light .
at the recent republican national convention they said your brother was indecisive .
what do you think about accusations that he flip-flops on issues ? i don ’ t think they deserve to be discussed or considered .
they are just slanderous misrepresentations of my brother 's record .
john kerry has demonstrated over a significant career in public service that he is dedicated to all sorts of important issues ... and that kind of activity has been completely ignored by the republicans in their presentation of my brother 's service to the country .
and i think that their personal attacks were really just all they could do because they can ’ t run on their own record ; they have no leg to stand on in that regard .
it was really very disappointing to hear the vice president of the us devote his entire speech almost to tearing down his opponent and not really respecting the american people enough to talk in a positive way about the plans and programs that the party is proposing .
they should have been telling people what their extreme right-wing platform really is all about .
they obscured the truth of what their party stands for . both you and your brother have spent time abroad and know europe well .
from a european perspective , why would he be a good president ? i think that us citizens living overseas would understand that he shares an interest in a cooperative approach to global problems , which obviously is going to mean working with our traditional allies and repairing alliances that the current administration has turned its back on .
this will be important for us citizens living in europe and for the entire world really . could john kerry 's connections to europe be a disadvantage for him rather than an advantage in the election ? i ’ m not sure what you mean by john ’ s “ connection ” to europe .
certainly i consider that , with the challenges that face us in the 21st century , we need a global perspective and that this can only be an asset to the president of the united states and the leader of the free world . do you think the majority of americans see this in the same light ? that ’ s hard to say .
i certainly hope that this is true .
i have been traveling all over the country and talked to many people who are very concerned in as far-flung states as minnesota and nebraska and montana , where people are considered to be traditionally republican .
there is certainly a very great interest in the united states having better relations - and a recognition that we have alienated our traditional allies and we have lost our good name around the world . ralf lehnert interviewed diana kerry -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

certainly i consider that , with the challenges that face us in the 21st century , we need a global perspective and that this can only be an asset to the president of the united states and the leader of the free world . do you think the majority of americans see this in the same light ? that ’ s hard to say .
i certainly hope that this is true .
i have been traveling all over the country and talked to many people who are very concerned in as far-flung states as minnesota and nebraska and montana , where people are considered to be traditionally republican .
there is certainly a very great interest in the united states having better relations - and a recognition that we have alienated our traditional allies and we have lost our good name around the world . ralf lehnert interviewed diana kerry -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : can kerry bring the us and europe back together ?

father anselm bilgri had been in charge of business at the st. bonifaz abbey in munich and andechs since 1986 .
he expanded it by selling products from the brewery and monastery , a schnapps distillery , yearly festivals , bars and a chain of restaurants called " der andechser . " the good times came to an end in late july , when andechs monastery gastronomy , which marketed the ten andechser restaurants , declared insolvency .
the company just was n't earning as much as it was spending , the monastery said . church profit but it 's not that business and religion do n't go together .
abbeys throughout europe sell the fruits of their labor in their own shops or over the internet .
some , particularly in northeastern greece , even rent out rooms - to men - for overnight stays and lease land to lumber firms . figures concerning church profits , however , are difficult to come by .
the vatican , one of the largest religious financial powers , is notoriously tight-lipped about such business affairs .
the vatican 's asset management alone was thought to be valued at € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- in 1994 .

private investors own the remaining shares . declaring insolvency was actually part of a power struggle .
as a successful manager , father bilgri would have been an obvious choice to become the abbot at the st. bonifaz and andechs abbeys last summer .
instead johannes eckert assuming the position .
a row has been underway ever since . though eckert is considered economically open-minded , he apparently viewed his business chief as too powerful .
eckert gradually relieved bilgri of responsibilities , until he finally quit and left the monastery .
both bilgri and staiger have said declaring insolvency was unnecessary .
but eckert has said he wanted to avoid things getting even worse . otherwise , its business as usual at andechs .
father bilgri also found his way .
still a monk , he 's opened a business consultancy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beer brewing monks battle over monastery 's future a power struggle at a monastery famous for producing beer is getting ugly .

father anselm bilgri had been in charge of business at the st. bonifaz abbey in munich and andechs since 1986 .
he expanded it by selling products from the brewery and monastery , a schnapps distillery , yearly festivals , bars and a chain of restaurants called " der andechser . " the good times came to an end in late july , when andechs monastery gastronomy , which marketed the ten andechser restaurants , declared insolvency .
the company just was n't earning as much as it was spending , the monastery said . church profit but it 's not that business and religion do n't go together .
abbeys throughout europe sell the fruits of their labor in their own shops or over the internet .
some , particularly in northeastern greece , even rent out rooms - to men - for overnight stays and lease land to lumber firms . figures concerning church profits , however , are difficult to come by .
the vatican , one of the largest religious financial powers , is notoriously tight-lipped about such business affairs .
the vatican 's asset management alone was thought to be valued at € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- in 1994 .

private investors own the remaining shares . declaring insolvency was actually part of a power struggle .
as a successful manager , father bilgri would have been an obvious choice to become the abbot at the st. bonifaz and andechs abbeys last summer .
instead johannes eckert assuming the position .
a row has been underway ever since . though eckert is considered economically open-minded , he apparently viewed his business chief as too powerful .
eckert gradually relieved bilgri of responsibilities , until he finally quit and left the monastery .
both bilgri and staiger have said declaring insolvency was unnecessary .
but eckert has said he wanted to avoid things getting even worse . otherwise , its business as usual at andechs .

dw-world spoke with her in munich . diana kerry has been visiting foreign countries to encourage american ex-patriots to vote as well as to drum up support for her brother john kerry 's campaign to beat incumbent president george w. bush in elections us elections this fall .
kerry 's little sister lived abroad for a long time herself . dw-world : as patron of “ americans overseas for kerry-edwards , ” you 're currently traveling throughout the world .
what is your aim ? diana kerry : i am interested in encouraging us citizens who live outside of the usa to register to vote .
we are very excited to have at our disposal a new web site to make possible the registration and application for the absentee ballot online .
this makes it very easy for people living in all sorts of remote places to be able to apply for their ballots from the united states .
and the deadline to do so is really right now .
i ’ ve been in mexico and i ’ ve been in canada and now i ’ m making a quick swing through europe to encourage people here to really do this because it ’ s such an important election and every vote really does count .
we saw in 2000 that the vote was very close , and we anticipate a very close election again this year you ’ re doing all this for your brother .
how would you describe your relationship to john kerry ? john is my elder brother and when we were growing up he was always the leader of the family and was somebody i used to like to tag along with and so we spent a lot of time doing things during our vacations together and that was a lot of fun .
i still have a close relationship with him , and i have - with great enthusiasm - enlisted in his campaign , because i really believe that he is the leader that we need for the country right now . what would be his main goals as president ? john has pledged to work hard to make the us stronger at home by investing in education and health care and jobs for all americans , and he also is very committed to working as a strong leader with principles and values within the global community .
and i think the restoring of respect both in our relationships with the rest of the world and our respect for the rest of the world is important , and that ’ s something to which my brother is very committed . in terms of priorities , are there differences between john kerry and george w. bush ? john kerry will lead the country in a very different direction and he has a positive vision for the country .
he has plans and programs which are committed to investing in people and not in the privileged .
i think that john will be the leader that we need for our country in these challenging times .
he understands that military force is not the only way in which you demonstrate strength .
he understands the uses of us power and i have confidence that he will make the world a better place . the republican party obviously see this in a different light .
at the recent republican national convention they said your brother was indecisive .
what do you think about accusations that he flip-flops on issues ? i don ’ t think they deserve to be discussed or considered .
they are just slanderous misrepresentations of my brother 's record .
john kerry has demonstrated over a significant career in public service that he is dedicated to all sorts of important issues ... and that kind of activity has been completely ignored by the republicans in their presentation of my brother 's service to the country .
and i think that their personal attacks were really just all they could do because they can ’ t run on their own record ; they have no leg to stand on in that regard .
it was really very disappointing to hear the vice president of the us devote his entire speech almost to tearing down his opponent and not really respecting the american people enough to talk in a positive way about the plans and programs that the party is proposing .
they should have been telling people what their extreme right-wing platform really is all about .
they obscured the truth of what their party stands for . both you and your brother have spent time abroad and know europe well .
from a european perspective , why would he be a good president ? i think that us citizens living overseas would understand that he shares an interest in a cooperative approach to global problems , which obviously is going to mean working with our traditional allies and repairing alliances that the current administration has turned its back on .
this will be important for us citizens living in europe and for the entire world really . could john kerry 's connections to europe be a disadvantage for him rather than an advantage in the election ? i ’ m not sure what you mean by john ’ s “ connection ” to europe .
certainly i consider that , with the challenges that face us in the 21st century , we need a global perspective and that this can only be an asset to the president of the united states and the leader of the free world . do you think the majority of americans see this in the same light ? that ’ s hard to say .

we saw in 2000 that the vote was very close , and we anticipate a very close election again this year you ’ re doing all this for your brother .
how would you describe your relationship to john kerry ? john is my elder brother and when we were growing up he was always the leader of the family and was somebody i used to like to tag along with and so we spent a lot of time doing things during our vacations together and that was a lot of fun .
i still have a close relationship with him , and i have - with great enthusiasm - enlisted in his campaign , because i really believe that he is the leader that we need for the country right now . what would be his main goals as president ? john has pledged to work hard to make the us stronger at home by investing in education and health care and jobs for all americans , and he also is very committed to working as a strong leader with principles and values within the global community .
and i think the restoring of respect both in our relationships with the rest of the world and our respect for the rest of the world is important , and that ’ s something to which my brother is very committed . in terms of priorities , are there differences between john kerry and george w. bush ? john kerry will lead the country in a very different direction and he has a positive vision for the country .
he has plans and programs which are committed to investing in people and not in the privileged .
i think that john will be the leader that we need for our country in these challenging times .

he understands the uses of us power and i have confidence that he will make the world a better place . the republican party obviously see this in a different light .
at the recent republican national convention they said your brother was indecisive .
what do you think about accusations that he flip-flops on issues ? i don ’ t think they deserve to be discussed or considered .
they are just slanderous misrepresentations of my brother 's record .
john kerry has demonstrated over a significant career in public service that he is dedicated to all sorts of important issues ... and that kind of activity has been completely ignored by the republicans in their presentation of my brother 's service to the country .
and i think that their personal attacks were really just all they could do because they can ’ t run on their own record ; they have no leg to stand on in that regard .

they should have been telling people what their extreme right-wing platform really is all about .
they obscured the truth of what their party stands for . both you and your brother have spent time abroad and know europe well .
from a european perspective , why would he be a good president ? i think that us citizens living overseas would understand that he shares an interest in a cooperative approach to global problems , which obviously is going to mean working with our traditional allies and repairing alliances that the current administration has turned its back on .
this will be important for us citizens living in europe and for the entire world really . could john kerry 's connections to europe be a disadvantage for him rather than an advantage in the election ? i ’ m not sure what you mean by john ’ s “ connection ” to europe .
certainly i consider that , with the challenges that face us in the 21st century , we need a global perspective and that this can only be an asset to the president of the united states and the leader of the free world . do you think the majority of americans see this in the same light ? that ’ s hard to say .

father anselm bilgri had been in charge of business at the st. bonifaz abbey in munich and andechs since 1986 .
he expanded it by selling products from the brewery and monastery , a schnapps distillery , yearly festivals , bars and a chain of restaurants called " der andechser . " the good times came to an end in late july , when andechs monastery gastronomy , which marketed the ten andechser restaurants , declared insolvency .
the company just was n't earning as much as it was spending , the monastery said . church profit but it 's not that business and religion do n't go together .
abbeys throughout europe sell the fruits of their labor in their own shops or over the internet .
some , particularly in northeastern greece , even rent out rooms - to men - for overnight stays and lease land to lumber firms . figures concerning church profits , however , are difficult to come by .
the vatican , one of the largest religious financial powers , is notoriously tight-lipped about such business affairs .
the vatican 's asset management alone was thought to be valued at € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- in 1994 .
the holy see 's earnings stem largely from a printing plant , a publisher , a book store as well as from the selling vatican coins and stamps .

private investors own the remaining shares . declaring insolvency was actually part of a power struggle .
as a successful manager , father bilgri would have been an obvious choice to become the abbot at the st. bonifaz and andechs abbeys last summer .
instead johannes eckert assuming the position .
a row has been underway ever since . though eckert is considered economically open-minded , he apparently viewed his business chief as too powerful .
eckert gradually relieved bilgri of responsibilities , until he finally quit and left the monastery .
both bilgri and staiger have said declaring insolvency was unnecessary .
but eckert has said he wanted to avoid things getting even worse . otherwise , its business as usual at andechs .
father bilgri also found his way .

suicide rates the deaths come just one day after a report revealed 14 prisoners had taken their lives in english jails in the month of august .
it was the highest figure for a single month since records began 20 years ago .
commenting on the recent peak in the number of suicides in prison , minister for correctional services paul goggins said : " the tragedy is for the individuals and their families .
" the paradox is that we have never done more to tackle self-harm and suicide in prison , " he added .
" the number of people with mental health and other problems passing through our prisons is challenging for all concerned , but we can not simply blame overcrowding : the prison population is lower now than it was six months ago .
" we will be working with the department of health to see what more we can do , and i have instructed the prison service to re-double their considerable efforts to prevent these tragic deaths . "
an average of about 95 inmates take their lives in prison each year , out of a prison population in excess of 70,000 .

the imac g5 is the latest addition to apple 's stylish collection the event provided a showcase for just what kind of stylish technology we should expect from apple in the coming months .
paris is a byword for chic , and as such , it is an appropriate setting for the company which places such a high premium on the elegance of its products .
but apple actually sees itself as promoting far more than just its products .
instead , it is selling an entire way of life .
many of the people attending the paris expo , the largest gathering outside the us , clearly buy into this idea , as apple inspires an almost religious devotion amongst its users .
the company 's fortunes may have been rocky over the years , but everyone seems to agree that at the moment it is riding high .
paul newman , editor of icreate magazine , says : " i think it 's a fantastic time for apple - things have never been better for them .
" the share price has been rising , the corporate side is doing really well , its products are completely revitalised and it 's innovating . "
think thin in the run-up to the paris expo , one persistent piece of speculation on the mac rumour-mill was that apple would use the event to launch an entirely new imac .
the rumours turned out to be correct , with the unveiling of the imac g5 , the first in the mid-range of macs to sport the top of the line 64-bit g5 processor .
equally as important for mac fans , both 17-inch and 20-inch versions embody the apple hallmark of minimalist design .
when apple is the innovator , the leader doing remarkable things that are successful , then of course the market will start to follow in our footsteps phil schiller , apple vice-president apple shows off new imac in paris apple vice president phil schiller says : " this new design is a breakthrough .
the entire computer , not just the desktop , fits on a stand and is only two inches thin .
it 's the thinnest desktop ever made . "
as for reaction from the crowds , for many of them one word summed it up : beautiful .
however , one attendee wondered what the difference would be from now on between such desktops and laptops .
another said she liked the design but that it was a bit too expensive for her .
as a student , she would have to save up for it .
with the cheapest model retailing at $ 1,300 dollars -lrb- £ 919 -rrb- , this is style and usability at a price .
yet it is possibly not enough to convert non-mac users , who will argue that pcs can deliver similar horsepower at a fraction of the price .
tiger ahead as for software , there were no big announcements , rather a fleshing out of the detail of tiger , the forthcoming update of the mac operating system .
the new imac packs all the technology behind the screen mr schiller told the conference it would have 150 new features .
by far the most innovative is the new search function , spotlight , which greatly enhances searching for items within your system .
the messaging tool ichat also gets a makeover in tiger to enhance the visual experience , with small touches like virtual video-conferencing tables reflecting the participants .
whether this proves to be a gimmick or a real enhancement remains to be seen as tiger is not out until 2005 .
branching out apple is concerned with far more than just computer hardware and software .
these days the prevailing message splashed across billboards is one promoting the digital lifestyle , largely driven by the phenomenal success of the ipod .
apple 's ipod has been a phenomenal success the music player has been the cornerstone of apple 's recent upturn in fortunes , and it is a key component in apple 's ilife vision .
as well as getting people using the mac as a hub to manage photos and edit home movies , apple would have us buying and organising our music through its itunes software , then taking it on the road with the ipod itself .
kenny hemphill , editor of macuser magazine , says : " apple at the moment is very much focussed on its music business - its ipod and its itunes music store .
" to help with this , they 've split the company into two parts , so you 'll see even more focus on the ipod and itunes than we 've seen in the last year or so .
" they 'll also be very much focussed on the portable side of the business .
powerbooks and ibooks now make up 50 % of all the macs that apple sell .
" so that 's still a very important part of the business , but does n't make anything like the kind of money you can expect the ipod and itunes store to make over the next few years . "
different tune the importance of the ipod is borne out by apple 's marketing campaigns , which feature the player even when trying to promote computers .
paul newman says : " i think apple 's aim is to capitalise on the success they 've had with the ipod among the windows community , who have n't traditionally been particularly receptive towards products made by apple or the mac operating system .
" the success of the ipod allows apple to pitch their product towards that new market . "
with less than 3 % of the global desktop computer market , apple hopes to exploit every opportunity in other areas where have a commanding presence .
competition is never far off : just this week , arch-rival microsoft launched its own online music store .
apple does not seem too concerned about staving off challenges from competitors .
" it 's actually not a worry when things are going right , " says mr schiller .
" when apple is the innovator , the leader doing remarkable things that are successful , then of course the market will start to follow in our footsteps .
" that 's a sign that apple 's back in front and doing great things , a great situation to be in . "

the imac g5 is the latest addition to apple 's stylish collection the event provided a showcase for just what kind of stylish technology we should expect from apple in the coming months .
paris is a byword for chic , and as such , it is an appropriate setting for the company which places such a high premium on the elegance of its products .
but apple actually sees itself as promoting far more than just its products .
instead , it is selling an entire way of life .
many of the people attending the paris expo , the largest gathering outside the us , clearly buy into this idea , as apple inspires an almost religious devotion amongst its users .
the company 's fortunes may have been rocky over the years , but everyone seems to agree that at the moment it is riding high .
paul newman , editor of icreate magazine , says : " i think it 's a fantastic time for apple - things have never been better for them .
" the share price has been rising , the corporate side is doing really well , its products are completely revitalised and it 's innovating . "
think thin in the run-up to the paris expo , one persistent piece of speculation on the mac rumour-mill was that apple would use the event to launch an entirely new imac .
the rumours turned out to be correct , with the unveiling of the imac g5 , the first in the mid-range of macs to sport the top of the line 64-bit g5 processor .
equally as important for mac fans , both 17-inch and 20-inch versions embody the apple hallmark of minimalist design .
when apple is the innovator , the leader doing remarkable things that are successful , then of course the market will start to follow in our footsteps phil schiller , apple vice-president apple shows off new imac in paris apple vice president phil schiller says : " this new design is a breakthrough .
the entire computer , not just the desktop , fits on a stand and is only two inches thin .
it 's the thinnest desktop ever made . "
as for reaction from the crowds , for many of them one word summed it up : beautiful .
however , one attendee wondered what the difference would be from now on between such desktops and laptops .
another said she liked the design but that it was a bit too expensive for her .
as a student , she would have to save up for it .
with the cheapest model retailing at $ 1,300 dollars -lrb- £ 919 -rrb- , this is style and usability at a price .
yet it is possibly not enough to convert non-mac users , who will argue that pcs can deliver similar horsepower at a fraction of the price .
tiger ahead as for software , there were no big announcements , rather a fleshing out of the detail of tiger , the forthcoming update of the mac operating system .
the new imac packs all the technology behind the screen mr schiller told the conference it would have 150 new features .
by far the most innovative is the new search function , spotlight , which greatly enhances searching for items within your system .
the messaging tool ichat also gets a makeover in tiger to enhance the visual experience , with small touches like virtual video-conferencing tables reflecting the participants .
whether this proves to be a gimmick or a real enhancement remains to be seen as tiger is not out until 2005 .
branching out apple is concerned with far more than just computer hardware and software .
these days the prevailing message splashed across billboards is one promoting the digital lifestyle , largely driven by the phenomenal success of the ipod .
apple 's ipod has been a phenomenal success the music player has been the cornerstone of apple 's recent upturn in fortunes , and it is a key component in apple 's ilife vision .
as well as getting people using the mac as a hub to manage photos and edit home movies , apple would have us buying and organising our music through its itunes software , then taking it on the road with the ipod itself .
kenny hemphill , editor of macuser magazine , says : " apple at the moment is very much focussed on its music business - its ipod and its itunes music store .
" to help with this , they 've split the company into two parts , so you 'll see even more focus on the ipod and itunes than we 've seen in the last year or so .
" they 'll also be very much focussed on the portable side of the business .
powerbooks and ibooks now make up 50 % of all the macs that apple sell .
" so that 's still a very important part of the business , but does n't make anything like the kind of money you can expect the ipod and itunes store to make over the next few years . "
different tune the importance of the ipod is borne out by apple 's marketing campaigns , which feature the player even when trying to promote computers .
paul newman says : " i think apple 's aim is to capitalise on the success they 've had with the ipod among the windows community , who have n't traditionally been particularly receptive towards products made by apple or the mac operating system .
" the success of the ipod allows apple to pitch their product towards that new market . "
with less than 3 % of the global desktop computer market , apple hopes to exploit every opportunity in other areas where have a commanding presence .
competition is never far off : just this week , arch-rival microsoft launched its own online music store .
apple does not seem too concerned about staving off challenges from competitors .
" it 's actually not a worry when things are going right , " says mr schiller .
" when apple is the innovator , the leader doing remarkable things that are successful , then of course the market will start to follow in our footsteps .
" that 's a sign that apple 's back in front and doing great things , a great situation to be in . "

equally as important for mac fans , both 17-inch and 20-inch versions embody the apple hallmark of minimalist design .
when apple is the innovator , the leader doing remarkable things that are successful , then of course the market will start to follow in our footsteps phil schiller , apple vice-president apple shows off new imac in paris apple vice president phil schiller says : " this new design is a breakthrough .
the entire computer , not just the desktop , fits on a stand and is only two inches thin .
it 's the thinnest desktop ever made . "
as for reaction from the crowds , for many of them one word summed it up : beautiful .
however , one attendee wondered what the difference would be from now on between such desktops and laptops .
another said she liked the design but that it was a bit too expensive for her .

with the cheapest model retailing at $ 1,300 dollars -lrb- £ 919 -rrb- , this is style and usability at a price .

these days the prevailing message splashed across billboards is one promoting the digital lifestyle , largely driven by the phenomenal success of the ipod .
apple 's ipod has been a phenomenal success the music player has been the cornerstone of apple 's recent upturn in fortunes , and it is a key component in apple 's ilife vision .
as well as getting people using the mac as a hub to manage photos and edit home movies , apple would have us buying and organising our music through its itunes software , then taking it on the road with the ipod itself .
kenny hemphill , editor of macuser magazine , says : " apple at the moment is very much focussed on its music business - its ipod and its itunes music store .
" to help with this , they 've split the company into two parts , so you 'll see even more focus on the ipod and itunes than we 've seen in the last year or so .
" they 'll also be very much focussed on the portable side of the business .
powerbooks and ibooks now make up 50 % of all the macs that apple sell .
" so that 's still a very important part of the business , but does n't make anything like the kind of money you can expect the ipod and itunes store to make over the next few years . "
different tune the importance of the ipod is borne out by apple 's marketing campaigns , which feature the player even when trying to promote computers .
paul newman says : " i think apple 's aim is to capitalise on the success they 've had with the ipod among the windows community , who have n't traditionally been particularly receptive towards products made by apple or the mac operating system .
" the success of the ipod allows apple to pitch their product towards that new market . "
with less than 3 % of the global desktop computer market , apple hopes to exploit every opportunity in other areas where have a commanding presence .
competition is never far off : just this week , arch-rival microsoft launched its own online music store .
apple does not seem too concerned about staving off challenges from competitors .
" it 's actually not a worry when things are going right , " says mr schiller .
" when apple is the innovator , the leader doing remarkable things that are successful , then of course the market will start to follow in our footsteps .
" that 's a sign that apple 's back in front and doing great things , a great situation to be in . "

the event provided a showcase for just what kind of stylish technology we should expect from apple in the coming months .
paris is a byword for chic , and as such , it is an appropriate setting for the company which places such a high premium on the elegance of its products .
but apple actually sees itself as promoting far more than just its products .
instead , it is selling an entire way of life .
many of the people attending the paris expo , the largest gathering outside the us , clearly buy into this idea , as apple inspires an almost religious devotion amongst its users .
the company 's fortunes may have been rocky over the years , but everyone seems to agree that at the moment it is riding high .
paul newman , editor of icreate magazine , says : " i think it 's a fantastic time for apple - things have never been better for them .
" the share price has been rising , the corporate side is doing really well , its products are completely revitalised and it 's innovating . "
think thin in the run-up to the paris expo , one persistent piece of speculation on the mac rumour-mill was that apple would use the event to launch an entirely new imac .

sarah woods , of hertfordshire university , found victims of physical bullying had normal amounts of friends and did not stand out from classmates .
but those who suffered " relational " abuse were more lonely and had problems making friends .
dr woods spoke to 401 pupils aged 11 to 16 at a london school .
' individual needs ' she told bbc news online anti-bullying strategies had to be tailored to the " individual needs of children " , rather than applying an overall plan .
according to the research , being presented to a british psychological society conference in leeds on sunday , those at the edge of groups , such as non-sporting children and loners , were more likely to suffer emotional bullying .
victims of physical bullying did not have the same underlying problems in making friends .
of the pupils who answered dr woods ' questionnaire , around one in 10 were purely bullies and one-third were purely victims .
a further one in seven were described as being both .
dr woods said : " a lot of the bullies enjoyed risk-taking in all ways , like taking drugs , smoking , risky sports and drinking .
" bullying had many of the same characteristics .
it raised the heart rate , was exhilarating and provided an audience . "
victims as a whole were less stimulated and had less self-esteem .
so anti-bullying strategies had to take these differences into account .
it would be no good offering bullies extra activities which stimulated their behaviour even more - making them the centre of attention - for instance .
dr woods said : " we need to tease out some of these subtle differences before we can address the problem more thoroughly . "
a study published earlier this year found almost half of all pupils had been bullied at school .

sarah woods , of hertfordshire university , found victims of physical bullying had normal amounts of friends and did not stand out from classmates .
but those who suffered " relational " abuse were more lonely and had problems making friends .
dr woods spoke to 401 pupils aged 11 to 16 at a london school .
' individual needs ' she told bbc news online anti-bullying strategies had to be tailored to the " individual needs of children " , rather than applying an overall plan .
according to the research , being presented to a british psychological society conference in leeds on sunday , those at the edge of groups , such as non-sporting children and loners , were more likely to suffer emotional bullying .
victims of physical bullying did not have the same underlying problems in making friends .
of the pupils who answered dr woods ' questionnaire , around one in 10 were purely bullies and one-third were purely victims .
a further one in seven were described as being both .
dr woods said : " a lot of the bullies enjoyed risk-taking in all ways , like taking drugs , smoking , risky sports and drinking .
" bullying had many of the same characteristics .
it raised the heart rate , was exhilarating and provided an audience . "
victims as a whole were less stimulated and had less self-esteem .
so anti-bullying strategies had to take these differences into account .
it would be no good offering bullies extra activities which stimulated their behaviour even more - making them the centre of attention - for instance .
dr woods said : " we need to tease out some of these subtle differences before we can address the problem more thoroughly . "
a study published earlier this year found almost half of all pupils had been bullied at school .
some 45 % of eight to 13 year olds had been victims at school and 32 % outside school , research at the university of central lancashire found .
