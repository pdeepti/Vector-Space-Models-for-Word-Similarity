nuns , priests and educators in german children 's homes systematically abused the young people there , according to a recently-formed lobbying group .
it 's now demanding a public apology . when marion zagermann looks back on her childhood , she does n't remember carefree days playing with friends and being surrounded by loving adults .
instead , often through tears , she remembers being chained to a bed at night , to a chair during the day , and being held under cold water until she lost consciousness .
in short , she remembers abuse , even torture - all at the hands of people of the church .
now marion and others are coming forth with their stories of abuse in church-sponsored children 's homes across germany .
their association , which hopes to be a forum and interest group for people who spent parts of their childhood in institutions , is meeting in the city of kassel on saturday .
the group 's goals are to bring together people with similar abusive pasts in children 's homes and set up a databank of their experiences .
members also want to bring the perpetrators , or at least the organizations where they were active , to account .
" we demand a public apology for the harm that was done to us in these institutions , " jean-pierre de picco , chairman of the victims ' association , told reporters .
tales of horror according to him , there were around 3,600 children 's homes in germany in the 1950s and 60s , and while abuse did not take place in all of them , the horrific stories of mistreatment are not isolated cases .
of the cases of abuse reported thus far , 90 percent happened in catholic children 's homes .
" we were beaten and whipped bloody by the nuns , even for the smallest of infractions , " picco said .
now an artist and historian for the city of hamlin , picco , 46 , lived at the " holy hedwig sisters " catholic boarding school from 1963 to 1972 , which has since been closed .
he describes nine years of fear due to continual physical and psychological abuse , including beatings with thorny branches , immersions in hot water until his skin was red and burnt , and sexual abuse .
fridays were especially bad for the young picco , since fish , which he hated , was served in the cafeteria on that day .
usually he threw up on the tray and was forced to eat it all again .
for decades afterward he was n't able to talk about his experiences and it was only in the mid-1990s that the repressed memories exploded on the surface .
" i cried rivers , " he said .
after the newsmagazine der spiegel reported his story some 500 people contacted the publication with similar stories .
it was then that he decided to create a formal organization to represent children abused in homes from 1945 to1985 .
at the founding in january of this year in the largely catholic city of paderborn , it counted 70 members .
" what happened to us , must have happened to hundreds of thousands of others , " he told reporters , the results often being addictive behavior , panic attacks , recurrent nightmares and depression as adults .
taliban regime gisela n. was one of the thousands .
at the age of 15 she was placed in a home in the city of dortmund where she was kept virtual prisoner , unable to leave the house , for two years and spent much of the time in solitary confinement , once because she sang an elvis song .
the 58-year-old compares the administration at the children 's home as a catholic " taliban regime " and like most of the abuse kids , left the church long ago .
she kept her story to herself for years and only came forward after seeing the 2003 film " the magdalene sisters , " based on the real experiences of irish girls sent to work in abusive conditions in laundries run by a religious order .
" it was a terror regime , a combination of nazi ideology and fanatical catholicism , " she said .
while there were a few nuns , priests and teachers who were kind , they were quickly driven off by the abusers .
picco says a public apology from the catholic church would help victims work through the mistreatment .
his association would also like a one-time compensation payment .
so far , however , there catholic church has kept silent about the accusations .
for marion zagermann , that silence has to be broken and lessons have to be learned .
her coming forward is part of the first step .

they argue there is n't enough skilled labor in the country to fill vacancies . " major dearth of skilled workers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rogowski , president of the german federation of industries this week , the president of the federation of german industries , michael rogowski , -lrb- photo -rrb- conceded that the problem of lack of skilled labor had eased partially in light of germany 's weak economic growth , but warned " this will change when the economy springs back to life again and in the long-term the demographic development begins to affect the labor market . " rogowski added : " we 'll squander away our economic growth chances if we ca n't cover the skilled labor shortage . " klaus zimmermann , head of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- echoed the sentiment .
" we need more immigration because we already have a dearth of skilled workers - it 's a problem that 's going to become massively acute in the next 10 to 15 years , " he said . it 's a scenario that 's all to familiar to researchers at the cologne institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- , who reckon that at present about 20,000 jobs nation-wide requiring high skills are n't filled because of a shortage of qualified workers . the problem is especially evident in the health care , corporate management , technical and engineering sectors .
" often the problem involves key positions , upon which other jobs are dependant , " iw labor market expert holger schäfer told daily berliner zeitung . catastrophic labor situation by 2050 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers warn that germany 's birth rate is declining at an alarming rate .
schäfer said their research showed that the need for qualified workers in germany will intensify hugely starting 2012 or 2015 because that 's when the country 's baby boomer generation will retire and birth rates will stagnate . the cologne researchers make it clear that the shortage of skilled labor in germany will take on alarming proportions by 2050 : the experts believe that by that time the number of potential workers - that includes working people , the jobless as well those not working - will fall to 30 million from the current 42 million . " there will be a drastic need for skilled labor because in the future fewer shoulders will have to bear more burdens , " according to the iw study . at the same time the number of highly qualified employees - those with a university degree or a professional qualification - will sink by two million to 8.9 million by 2050 .
the researchers also claim that by 2050 , germany 's population will fall to about 70 million - 12 million less than the current figure . the iw researchers believe that a shrinking population and work force will have catastrophic consequences for the country . global race for the best brains experts point towards chancellor schröder 's green card initiative in the it industry to plug a major need for skilled technical workers as an example of how monitored immigration can help fulfill demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a fourth of all green card it experts in germany come from india .
since august 2000 , the german government has issued around 16,400 green cards to foreigners with degrees in information and communication technology . but there 's little doubt that even that regulation is plagued with problems .
the government 's target of attracting around 20,000 it foreign workers has failed partly because of the sluggish growth in the it sector , but also on account of bureaucratic hurdles . business leaders are hoping that the implementation of a new immigration law this year will also give a boost to the flagging green card effort .

they argue there is n't enough skilled labor in the country to fill vacancies . " major dearth of skilled workers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rogowski , president of the german federation of industries this week , the president of the federation of german industries , michael rogowski , -lrb- photo -rrb- conceded that the problem of lack of skilled labor had eased partially in light of germany 's weak economic growth , but warned " this will change when the economy springs back to life again and in the long-term the demographic development begins to affect the labor market . " rogowski added : " we 'll squander away our economic growth chances if we ca n't cover the skilled labor shortage . " klaus zimmermann , head of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- echoed the sentiment .
" we need more immigration because we already have a dearth of skilled workers - it 's a problem that 's going to become massively acute in the next 10 to 15 years , " he said . it 's a scenario that 's all to familiar to researchers at the cologne institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- , who reckon that at present about 20,000 jobs nation-wide requiring high skills are n't filled because of a shortage of qualified workers . the problem is especially evident in the health care , corporate management , technical and engineering sectors .

schäfer said their research showed that the need for qualified workers in germany will intensify hugely starting 2012 or 2015 because that 's when the country 's baby boomer generation will retire and birth rates will stagnate . the cologne researchers make it clear that the shortage of skilled labor in germany will take on alarming proportions by 2050 : the experts believe that by that time the number of potential workers - that includes working people , the jobless as well those not working - will fall to 30 million from the current 42 million . " there will be a drastic need for skilled labor because in the future fewer shoulders will have to bear more burdens , " according to the iw study . at the same time the number of highly qualified employees - those with a university degree or a professional qualification - will sink by two million to 8.9 million by 2050 .
the researchers also claim that by 2050 , germany 's population will fall to about 70 million - 12 million less than the current figure . the iw researchers believe that a shrinking population and work force will have catastrophic consequences for the country . global race for the best brains experts point towards chancellor schröder 's green card initiative in the it industry to plug a major need for skilled technical workers as an example of how monitored immigration can help fulfill demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a fourth of all green card it experts in germany come from india .
since august 2000 , the german government has issued around 16,400 green cards to foreigners with degrees in information and communication technology . but there 's little doubt that even that regulation is plagued with problems .
the government 's target of attracting around 20,000 it foreign workers has failed partly because of the sluggish growth in the it sector , but also on account of bureaucratic hurdles . business leaders are hoping that the implementation of a new immigration law this year will also give a boost to the flagging green card effort .

" we need more immigration because we already have a dearth of skilled workers - it 's a problem that 's going to become massively acute in the next 10 to 15 years , " he said . it 's a scenario that 's all to familiar to researchers at the cologne institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- , who reckon that at present about 20,000 jobs nation-wide requiring high skills are n't filled because of a shortage of qualified workers . the problem is especially evident in the health care , corporate management , technical and engineering sectors .
" often the problem involves key positions , upon which other jobs are dependant , " iw labor market expert holger schäfer told daily berliner zeitung . catastrophic labor situation by 2050 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers warn that germany 's birth rate is declining at an alarming rate .
schäfer said their research showed that the need for qualified workers in germany will intensify hugely starting 2012 or 2015 because that 's when the country 's baby boomer generation will retire and birth rates will stagnate . the cologne researchers make it clear that the shortage of skilled labor in germany will take on alarming proportions by 2050 : the experts believe that by that time the number of potential workers - that includes working people , the jobless as well those not working - will fall to 30 million from the current 42 million . " there will be a drastic need for skilled labor because in the future fewer shoulders will have to bear more burdens , " according to the iw study . at the same time the number of highly qualified employees - those with a university degree or a professional qualification - will sink by two million to 8.9 million by 2050 .
the researchers also claim that by 2050 , germany 's population will fall to about 70 million - 12 million less than the current figure . the iw researchers believe that a shrinking population and work force will have catastrophic consequences for the country . global race for the best brains experts point towards chancellor schröder 's green card initiative in the it industry to plug a major need for skilled technical workers as an example of how monitored immigration can help fulfill demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a fourth of all green card it experts in germany come from india .
since august 2000 , the german government has issued around 16,400 green cards to foreigners with degrees in information and communication technology . but there 's little doubt that even that regulation is plagued with problems .
the government 's target of attracting around 20,000 it foreign workers has failed partly because of the sluggish growth in the it sector , but also on account of bureaucratic hurdles . business leaders are hoping that the implementation of a new immigration law this year will also give a boost to the flagging green card effort .

chancellor schröder on friday pushed for a permanent german seat on the u.n. security council at the eu-latin america summit , that urged the u.s. to drop its go-it-alone stance and stressed the need for u.n. reform . german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters in guadalajara in mexico on friday that he saw " good chances that such a seat can be realized , " and said it was recognized how sensitively and responsibly germany behaved on the world political stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder speaks during the eu-latin america summit in mexico . schröder 's government has never concealed its interest in a german seat on the council and has stepped up efforts recently to accomplish it . under the current structure , the security council has five permanent members - china , france , great britain , the united states and russia .
it also has 10 rotating members elected for two-year terms by the general assembly . germany was shut out from permanent-seat status when the u.n. was formed in 1945 .
for germany to get a seat , france or britain would have to cede theirs - not an easy option .
some european nations would like the 25-nation eu to get a permanent seat . condemnation of torture representatives from 58 european , latin america and caribbean nations participated in the one-day summit in mexico 's western city of guadalajara aimed at building closer ties between europe and latin america . despite initial opposition from britain and after hours of wrangling on the wording of the concluding declaration , summit participants condemned the sexual humiliation , torture and degradation of iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison by u.s. soldiers .
the scandal has further undermined u.s. credibility in iraq and the wider arab world . " we declare our horror at recent evidence of the mistreatment of prisoners in iraqi jails .
these abuses go against international law , " the declaration said .
" we energetically condemn all forms of abuse , torture and other cruel , inhumane and degrading treatment against people , including prisoners of war , wherever they occur . " u.s. should drop unilateralism the leaders also said they wanted the united nations to remain the premier organization to resolve international conflicts in a indirect warning to the u.s. to shed its unilateralist stance . the summit declaration was also critical of u.s. foreign policy , without specifically mentioning the u.s. they also called for a revamp of the united nations and expressed " full support " for the international criminal court in the hague , netherlands . leaders said u.n. reforms must make the international organization more effective and spare it the embarrassment of being sidelined , as happened last year when the u.s. declared war on iraq without u.n. backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister and head of the eu presidency , bertie ahern .
" we all recall that 2003 was a difficult year , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country holds the eu presidency .
ahern said u.s. action last year showed the u.n. to be " unable to deal with hard questions of peace and security and unable , therefore , to command confidence . " ahern said no country can act alone .
" peace and justice can best be guaranteed by states working together .
only by working together an terrorism conditions , which can sometimes rise to terrorism , be addressed , " ahern said . reform of the u.n. chancellor schröder said it was first necessary to bring about changes in the united nations .
" first , however , we must have reforms , " schröder said , adding germany would like to see a u.n. environment agency . the mexican hosts too said they were in favor of far-reaching reforms to the u.n. in order to set up a new international order . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vincente fox , president of mexico " i am convinced latin america , the caribbean and the european union should have an important role in forming a new international order in which multilateralism and social cohesion translate into a more secure , equal , prosperous and fair world , " mexican president vicente fox said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de latin america aims for more eu trade gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.05.2004 group claims rampant abuse in children 's homes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse in german church-run children 's homes was widespread , victims say .
nuns , priests and educators in german children 's homes systematically abused the young people there , according to a recently-formed lobbying group .
it 's now demanding a public apology . when marion zagermann looks back on her childhood , she does n't remember carefree days playing with friends and being surrounded by loving adults .
instead , often through tears , she remembers being chained to a bed at night , to a chair during the day , and being held under cold water until she lost consciousness .
in short , she remembers abuse , even torture - all at the hands of people of the church .
now marion and others are coming forth with their stories of abuse in church-sponsored children 's homes across germany .
their association , which hopes to be a forum and interest group for people who spent parts of their childhood in institutions , is meeting in the city of kassel on saturday .
the group 's goals are to bring together people with similar abusive pasts in children 's homes and set up a databank of their experiences .
members also want to bring the perpetrators , or at least the organizations where they were active , to account .
" we demand a public apology for the harm that was done to us in these institutions , " jean-pierre de picco , chairman of the victims ' association , told reporters .
tales of horror according to him , there were around 3,600 children 's homes in germany in the 1950s and 60s , and while abuse did not take place in all of them , the horrific stories of mistreatment are not isolated cases .
of the cases of abuse reported thus far , 90 percent happened in catholic children 's homes .
" we were beaten and whipped bloody by the nuns , even for the smallest of infractions , " picco said .
now an artist and historian for the city of hamlin , picco , 46 , lived at the " holy hedwig sisters " catholic boarding school from 1963 to 1972 , which has since been closed .
he describes nine years of fear due to continual physical and psychological abuse , including beatings with thorny branches , immersions in hot water until his skin was red and burnt , and sexual abuse .
fridays were especially bad for the young picco , since fish , which he hated , was served in the cafeteria on that day .
usually he threw up on the tray and was forced to eat it all again .
for decades afterward he was n't able to talk about his experiences and it was only in the mid-1990s that the repressed memories exploded on the surface .
" i cried rivers , " he said .
after the newsmagazine der spiegel reported his story some 500 people contacted the publication with similar stories .
it was then that he decided to create a formal organization to represent children abused in homes from 1945 to1985 .
at the founding in january of this year in the largely catholic city of paderborn , it counted 70 members .
" what happened to us , must have happened to hundreds of thousands of others , " he told reporters , the results often being addictive behavior , panic attacks , recurrent nightmares and depression as adults .
taliban regime gisela n. was one of the thousands .
at the age of 15 she was placed in a home in the city of dortmund where she was kept virtual prisoner , unable to leave the house , for two years and spent much of the time in solitary confinement , once because she sang an elvis song .
the 58-year-old compares the administration at the children 's home as a catholic " taliban regime " and like most of the abuse kids , left the church long ago .
she kept her story to herself for years and only came forward after seeing the 2003 film " the magdalene sisters , " based on the real experiences of irish girls sent to work in abusive conditions in laundries run by a religious order .
" it was a terror regime , a combination of nazi ideology and fanatical catholicism , " she said .
while there were a few nuns , priests and teachers who were kind , they were quickly driven off by the abusers .
picco says a public apology from the catholic church would help victims work through the mistreatment .
his association would also like a one-time compensation payment .
so far , however , there catholic church has kept silent about the accusations .
for marion zagermann , that silence has to be broken and lessons have to be learned .
her coming forward is part of the first step .
" i never want to hear again people saying ' times back then were just like that ' , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .

they argue there is n't enough skilled labor in the country to fill vacancies . " major dearth of skilled workers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rogowski , president of the german federation of industries this week , the president of the federation of german industries , michael rogowski , -lrb- photo -rrb- conceded that the problem of lack of skilled labor had eased partially in light of germany 's weak economic growth , but warned " this will change when the economy springs back to life again and in the long-term the demographic development begins to affect the labor market . " rogowski added : " we 'll squander away our economic growth chances if we ca n't cover the skilled labor shortage . " klaus zimmermann , head of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- echoed the sentiment .
" we need more immigration because we already have a dearth of skilled workers - it 's a problem that 's going to become massively acute in the next 10 to 15 years , " he said . it 's a scenario that 's all to familiar to researchers at the cologne institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- , who reckon that at present about 20,000 jobs nation-wide requiring high skills are n't filled because of a shortage of qualified workers . the problem is especially evident in the health care , corporate management , technical and engineering sectors .
" often the problem involves key positions , upon which other jobs are dependant , " iw labor market expert holger schäfer told daily berliner zeitung . catastrophic labor situation by 2050 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers warn that germany 's birth rate is declining at an alarming rate .
schäfer said their research showed that the need for qualified workers in germany will intensify hugely starting 2012 or 2015 because that 's when the country 's baby boomer generation will retire and birth rates will stagnate . the cologne researchers make it clear that the shortage of skilled labor in germany will take on alarming proportions by 2050 : the experts believe that by that time the number of potential workers - that includes working people , the jobless as well those not working - will fall to 30 million from the current 42 million . " there will be a drastic need for skilled labor because in the future fewer shoulders will have to bear more burdens , " according to the iw study . at the same time the number of highly qualified employees - those with a university degree or a professional qualification - will sink by two million to 8.9 million by 2050 .
the researchers also claim that by 2050 , germany 's population will fall to about 70 million - 12 million less than the current figure . the iw researchers believe that a shrinking population and work force will have catastrophic consequences for the country . global race for the best brains experts point towards chancellor schröder 's green card initiative in the it industry to plug a major need for skilled technical workers as an example of how monitored immigration can help fulfill demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a fourth of all green card it experts in germany come from india .
since august 2000 , the german government has issued around 16,400 green cards to foreigners with degrees in information and communication technology . but there 's little doubt that even that regulation is plagued with problems .
the government 's target of attracting around 20,000 it foreign workers has failed partly because of the sluggish growth in the it sector , but also on account of bureaucratic hurdles . business leaders are hoping that the implementation of a new immigration law this year will also give a boost to the flagging green card effort .
" germany must finally aggressively participate in the global competition for the best brains , " rogowski said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough on german immigration law after years of acrimonious talks and two failed attempts to push through a controversial immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder managed to secure a deal with the opposition conservatives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.05.2004 group claims rampant abuse in children 's homes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse in german church-run children 's homes was widespread , victims say .
nuns , priests and educators in german children 's homes systematically abused the young people there , according to a recently-formed lobbying group .
it 's now demanding a public apology . when marion zagermann looks back on her childhood , she does n't remember carefree days playing with friends and being surrounded by loving adults .
instead , often through tears , she remembers being chained to a bed at night , to a chair during the day , and being held under cold water until she lost consciousness .
in short , she remembers abuse , even torture - all at the hands of people of the church .
now marion and others are coming forth with their stories of abuse in church-sponsored children 's homes across germany .
their association , which hopes to be a forum and interest group for people who spent parts of their childhood in institutions , is meeting in the city of kassel on saturday .
the group 's goals are to bring together people with similar abusive pasts in children 's homes and set up a databank of their experiences .
members also want to bring the perpetrators , or at least the organizations where they were active , to account .
" we demand a public apology for the harm that was done to us in these institutions , " jean-pierre de picco , chairman of the victims ' association , told reporters .
tales of horror according to him , there were around 3,600 children 's homes in germany in the 1950s and 60s , and while abuse did not take place in all of them , the horrific stories of mistreatment are not isolated cases .
of the cases of abuse reported thus far , 90 percent happened in catholic children 's homes .
" we were beaten and whipped bloody by the nuns , even for the smallest of infractions , " picco said .
now an artist and historian for the city of hamlin , picco , 46 , lived at the " holy hedwig sisters " catholic boarding school from 1963 to 1972 , which has since been closed .
he describes nine years of fear due to continual physical and psychological abuse , including beatings with thorny branches , immersions in hot water until his skin was red and burnt , and sexual abuse .
fridays were especially bad for the young picco , since fish , which he hated , was served in the cafeteria on that day .
usually he threw up on the tray and was forced to eat it all again .
for decades afterward he was n't able to talk about his experiences and it was only in the mid-1990s that the repressed memories exploded on the surface .
" i cried rivers , " he said .
after the newsmagazine der spiegel reported his story some 500 people contacted the publication with similar stories .
it was then that he decided to create a formal organization to represent children abused in homes from 1945 to1985 .
at the founding in january of this year in the largely catholic city of paderborn , it counted 70 members .
" what happened to us , must have happened to hundreds of thousands of others , " he told reporters , the results often being addictive behavior , panic attacks , recurrent nightmares and depression as adults .
taliban regime gisela n. was one of the thousands .
at the age of 15 she was placed in a home in the city of dortmund where she was kept virtual prisoner , unable to leave the house , for two years and spent much of the time in solitary confinement , once because she sang an elvis song .
the 58-year-old compares the administration at the children 's home as a catholic " taliban regime " and like most of the abuse kids , left the church long ago .
she kept her story to herself for years and only came forward after seeing the 2003 film " the magdalene sisters , " based on the real experiences of irish girls sent to work in abusive conditions in laundries run by a religious order .
" it was a terror regime , a combination of nazi ideology and fanatical catholicism , " she said .
while there were a few nuns , priests and teachers who were kind , they were quickly driven off by the abusers .
picco says a public apology from the catholic church would help victims work through the mistreatment .
his association would also like a one-time compensation payment .
so far , however , there catholic church has kept silent about the accusations .
for marion zagermann , that silence has to be broken and lessons have to be learned .
her coming forward is part of the first step .
" i never want to hear again people saying ' times back then were just like that ' , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .

" rogowski added : " we 'll squander away our economic growth chances if we ca n't cover the skilled labor shortage . " klaus zimmermann , head of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- echoed the sentiment .
" we need more immigration because we already have a dearth of skilled workers - it 's a problem that 's going to become massively acute in the next 10 to 15 years , " he said . it 's a scenario that 's all to familiar to researchers at the cologne institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- , who reckon that at present about 20,000 jobs nation-wide requiring high skills are n't filled because of a shortage of qualified workers . the problem is especially evident in the health care , corporate management , technical and engineering sectors .

schäfer said their research showed that the need for qualified workers in germany will intensify hugely starting 2012 or 2015 because that 's when the country 's baby boomer generation will retire and birth rates will stagnate . the cologne researchers make it clear that the shortage of skilled labor in germany will take on alarming proportions by 2050 : the experts believe that by that time the number of potential workers - that includes working people , the jobless as well those not working - will fall to 30 million from the current 42 million . " there will be a drastic need for skilled labor because in the future fewer shoulders will have to bear more burdens , " according to the iw study . at the same time the number of highly qualified employees - those with a university degree or a professional qualification - will sink by two million to 8.9 million by 2050 .
the researchers also claim that by 2050 , germany 's population will fall to about 70 million - 12 million less than the current figure . the iw researchers believe that a shrinking population and work force will have catastrophic consequences for the country . global race for the best brains experts point towards chancellor schröder 's green card initiative in the it industry to plug a major need for skilled technical workers as an example of how monitored immigration can help fulfill demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a fourth of all green card it experts in germany come from india .
since august 2000 , the german government has issued around 16,400 green cards to foreigners with degrees in information and communication technology . but there 's little doubt that even that regulation is plagued with problems .
the government 's target of attracting around 20,000 it foreign workers has failed partly because of the sluggish growth in the it sector , but also on account of bureaucratic hurdles . business leaders are hoping that the implementation of a new immigration law this year will also give a boost to the flagging green card effort .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.05.2004 group claims rampant abuse in children 's homes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse in german church-run children 's homes was widespread , victims say .
nuns , priests and educators in german children 's homes systematically abused the young people there , according to a recently-formed lobbying group .
it 's now demanding a public apology . when marion zagermann looks back on her childhood , she does n't remember carefree days playing with friends and being surrounded by loving adults .
instead , often through tears , she remembers being chained to a bed at night , to a chair during the day , and being held under cold water until she lost consciousness .
in short , she remembers abuse , even torture - all at the hands of people of the church .
now marion and others are coming forth with their stories of abuse in church-sponsored children 's homes across germany .
their association , which hopes to be a forum and interest group for people who spent parts of their childhood in institutions , is meeting in the city of kassel on saturday .
the group 's goals are to bring together people with similar abusive pasts in children 's homes and set up a databank of their experiences .
members also want to bring the perpetrators , or at least the organizations where they were active , to account .
" we demand a public apology for the harm that was done to us in these institutions , " jean-pierre de picco , chairman of the victims ' association , told reporters .
tales of horror according to him , there were around 3,600 children 's homes in germany in the 1950s and 60s , and while abuse did not take place in all of them , the horrific stories of mistreatment are not isolated cases .
of the cases of abuse reported thus far , 90 percent happened in catholic children 's homes .
" we were beaten and whipped bloody by the nuns , even for the smallest of infractions , " picco said .
now an artist and historian for the city of hamlin , picco , 46 , lived at the " holy hedwig sisters " catholic boarding school from 1963 to 1972 , which has since been closed .
he describes nine years of fear due to continual physical and psychological abuse , including beatings with thorny branches , immersions in hot water until his skin was red and burnt , and sexual abuse .
fridays were especially bad for the young picco , since fish , which he hated , was served in the cafeteria on that day .
usually he threw up on the tray and was forced to eat it all again .
for decades afterward he was n't able to talk about his experiences and it was only in the mid-1990s that the repressed memories exploded on the surface .
" i cried rivers , " he said .
after the newsmagazine der spiegel reported his story some 500 people contacted the publication with similar stories .
it was then that he decided to create a formal organization to represent children abused in homes from 1945 to1985 .
at the founding in january of this year in the largely catholic city of paderborn , it counted 70 members .
" what happened to us , must have happened to hundreds of thousands of others , " he told reporters , the results often being addictive behavior , panic attacks , recurrent nightmares and depression as adults .
taliban regime gisela n. was one of the thousands .
at the age of 15 she was placed in a home in the city of dortmund where she was kept virtual prisoner , unable to leave the house , for two years and spent much of the time in solitary confinement , once because she sang an elvis song .
the 58-year-old compares the administration at the children 's home as a catholic " taliban regime " and like most of the abuse kids , left the church long ago .
she kept her story to herself for years and only came forward after seeing the 2003 film " the magdalene sisters , " based on the real experiences of irish girls sent to work in abusive conditions in laundries run by a religious order .
" it was a terror regime , a combination of nazi ideology and fanatical catholicism , " she said .
while there were a few nuns , priests and teachers who were kind , they were quickly driven off by the abusers .
picco says a public apology from the catholic church would help victims work through the mistreatment .
his association would also like a one-time compensation payment .
so far , however , there catholic church has kept silent about the accusations .
for marion zagermann , that silence has to be broken and lessons have to be learned .
her coming forward is part of the first step .
" i never want to hear again people saying ' times back then were just like that ' , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .

nuns , priests and educators in german children 's homes systematically abused the young people there , according to a recently-formed lobbying group .
it 's now demanding a public apology . when marion zagermann looks back on her childhood , she does n't remember carefree days playing with friends and being surrounded by loving adults .
instead , often through tears , she remembers being chained to a bed at night , to a chair during the day , and being held under cold water until she lost consciousness .
in short , she remembers abuse , even torture - all at the hands of people of the church .
now marion and others are coming forth with their stories of abuse in church-sponsored children 's homes across germany .
their association , which hopes to be a forum and interest group for people who spent parts of their childhood in institutions , is meeting in the city of kassel on saturday .
the group 's goals are to bring together people with similar abusive pasts in children 's homes and set up a databank of their experiences .
members also want to bring the perpetrators , or at least the organizations where they were active , to account .
" we demand a public apology for the harm that was done to us in these institutions , " jean-pierre de picco , chairman of the victims ' association , told reporters .
tales of horror according to him , there were around 3,600 children 's homes in germany in the 1950s and 60s , and while abuse did not take place in all of them , the horrific stories of mistreatment are not isolated cases .
of the cases of abuse reported thus far , 90 percent happened in catholic children 's homes .
" we were beaten and whipped bloody by the nuns , even for the smallest of infractions , " picco said .
now an artist and historian for the city of hamlin , picco , 46 , lived at the " holy hedwig sisters " catholic boarding school from 1963 to 1972 , which has since been closed .
he describes nine years of fear due to continual physical and psychological abuse , including beatings with thorny branches , immersions in hot water until his skin was red and burnt , and sexual abuse .
fridays were especially bad for the young picco , since fish , which he hated , was served in the cafeteria on that day .
usually he threw up on the tray and was forced to eat it all again .
for decades afterward he was n't able to talk about his experiences and it was only in the mid-1990s that the repressed memories exploded on the surface .
" i cried rivers , " he said .
after the newsmagazine der spiegel reported his story some 500 people contacted the publication with similar stories .
it was then that he decided to create a formal organization to represent children abused in homes from 1945 to1985 .
at the founding in january of this year in the largely catholic city of paderborn , it counted 70 members .
" what happened to us , must have happened to hundreds of thousands of others , " he told reporters , the results often being addictive behavior , panic attacks , recurrent nightmares and depression as adults .
taliban regime gisela n. was one of the thousands .
at the age of 15 she was placed in a home in the city of dortmund where she was kept virtual prisoner , unable to leave the house , for two years and spent much of the time in solitary confinement , once because she sang an elvis song .
the 58-year-old compares the administration at the children 's home as a catholic " taliban regime " and like most of the abuse kids , left the church long ago .
she kept her story to herself for years and only came forward after seeing the 2003 film " the magdalene sisters , " based on the real experiences of irish girls sent to work in abusive conditions in laundries run by a religious order .
" it was a terror regime , a combination of nazi ideology and fanatical catholicism , " she said .
while there were a few nuns , priests and teachers who were kind , they were quickly driven off by the abusers .
picco says a public apology from the catholic church would help victims work through the mistreatment .
his association would also like a one-time compensation payment .
so far , however , there catholic church has kept silent about the accusations .
for marion zagermann , that silence has to be broken and lessons have to be learned .
her coming forward is part of the first step .

nuns , priests and educators in german children 's homes systematically abused the young people there , according to a recently-formed lobbying group .
it 's now demanding a public apology . when marion zagermann looks back on her childhood , she does n't remember carefree days playing with friends and being surrounded by loving adults .
instead , often through tears , she remembers being chained to a bed at night , to a chair during the day , and being held under cold water until she lost consciousness .
in short , she remembers abuse , even torture - all at the hands of people of the church .
now marion and others are coming forth with their stories of abuse in church-sponsored children 's homes across germany .
their association , which hopes to be a forum and interest group for people who spent parts of their childhood in institutions , is meeting in the city of kassel on saturday .
the group 's goals are to bring together people with similar abusive pasts in children 's homes and set up a databank of their experiences .
members also want to bring the perpetrators , or at least the organizations where they were active , to account .
" we demand a public apology for the harm that was done to us in these institutions , " jean-pierre de picco , chairman of the victims ' association , told reporters .
tales of horror according to him , there were around 3,600 children 's homes in germany in the 1950s and 60s , and while abuse did not take place in all of them , the horrific stories of mistreatment are not isolated cases .
of the cases of abuse reported thus far , 90 percent happened in catholic children 's homes .
" we were beaten and whipped bloody by the nuns , even for the smallest of infractions , " picco said .
now an artist and historian for the city of hamlin , picco , 46 , lived at the " holy hedwig sisters " catholic boarding school from 1963 to 1972 , which has since been closed .
he describes nine years of fear due to continual physical and psychological abuse , including beatings with thorny branches , immersions in hot water until his skin was red and burnt , and sexual abuse .
fridays were especially bad for the young picco , since fish , which he hated , was served in the cafeteria on that day .
usually he threw up on the tray and was forced to eat it all again .
for decades afterward he was n't able to talk about his experiences and it was only in the mid-1990s that the repressed memories exploded on the surface .
" i cried rivers , " he said .
after the newsmagazine der spiegel reported his story some 500 people contacted the publication with similar stories .
it was then that he decided to create a formal organization to represent children abused in homes from 1945 to1985 .
at the founding in january of this year in the largely catholic city of paderborn , it counted 70 members .
" what happened to us , must have happened to hundreds of thousands of others , " he told reporters , the results often being addictive behavior , panic attacks , recurrent nightmares and depression as adults .
taliban regime gisela n. was one of the thousands .
at the age of 15 she was placed in a home in the city of dortmund where she was kept virtual prisoner , unable to leave the house , for two years and spent much of the time in solitary confinement , once because she sang an elvis song .
the 58-year-old compares the administration at the children 's home as a catholic " taliban regime " and like most of the abuse kids , left the church long ago .
she kept her story to herself for years and only came forward after seeing the 2003 film " the magdalene sisters , " based on the real experiences of irish girls sent to work in abusive conditions in laundries run by a religious order .
" it was a terror regime , a combination of nazi ideology and fanatical catholicism , " she said .
while there were a few nuns , priests and teachers who were kind , they were quickly driven off by the abusers .
picco says a public apology from the catholic church would help victims work through the mistreatment .
his association would also like a one-time compensation payment .
so far , however , there catholic church has kept silent about the accusations .
for marion zagermann , that silence has to be broken and lessons have to be learned .
her coming forward is part of the first step .
" i never want to hear again people saying ' times back then were just like that ' , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .

chancellor schröder on friday pushed for a permanent german seat on the u.n. security council at the eu-latin america summit , that urged the u.s. to drop its go-it-alone stance and stressed the need for u.n. reform . german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters in guadalajara in mexico on friday that he saw " good chances that such a seat can be realized , " and said it was recognized how sensitively and responsibly germany behaved on the world political stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder speaks during the eu-latin america summit in mexico . schröder 's government has never concealed its interest in a german seat on the council and has stepped up efforts recently to accomplish it . under the current structure , the security council has five permanent members - china , france , great britain , the united states and russia .
it also has 10 rotating members elected for two-year terms by the general assembly . germany was shut out from permanent-seat status when the u.n. was formed in 1945 .
for germany to get a seat , france or britain would have to cede theirs - not an easy option .
some european nations would like the 25-nation eu to get a permanent seat . condemnation of torture representatives from 58 european , latin america and caribbean nations participated in the one-day summit in mexico 's western city of guadalajara aimed at building closer ties between europe and latin america . despite initial opposition from britain and after hours of wrangling on the wording of the concluding declaration , summit participants condemned the sexual humiliation , torture and degradation of iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison by u.s. soldiers .
the scandal has further undermined u.s. credibility in iraq and the wider arab world . " we declare our horror at recent evidence of the mistreatment of prisoners in iraqi jails .
these abuses go against international law , " the declaration said .
" we energetically condemn all forms of abuse , torture and other cruel , inhumane and degrading treatment against people , including prisoners of war , wherever they occur . " u.s. should drop unilateralism the leaders also said they wanted the united nations to remain the premier organization to resolve international conflicts in a indirect warning to the u.s. to shed its unilateralist stance . the summit declaration was also critical of u.s. foreign policy , without specifically mentioning the u.s. they also called for a revamp of the united nations and expressed " full support " for the international criminal court in the hague , netherlands . leaders said u.n. reforms must make the international organization more effective and spare it the embarrassment of being sidelined , as happened last year when the u.s. declared war on iraq without u.n. backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister and head of the eu presidency , bertie ahern .
" we all recall that 2003 was a difficult year , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country holds the eu presidency .
ahern said u.s. action last year showed the u.n. to be " unable to deal with hard questions of peace and security and unable , therefore , to command confidence . " ahern said no country can act alone .
" peace and justice can best be guaranteed by states working together .
only by working together an terrorism conditions , which can sometimes rise to terrorism , be addressed , " ahern said . reform of the u.n. chancellor schröder said it was first necessary to bring about changes in the united nations .
" first , however , we must have reforms , " schröder said , adding germany would like to see a u.n. environment agency . the mexican hosts too said they were in favor of far-reaching reforms to the u.n. in order to set up a new international order . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vincente fox , president of mexico " i am convinced latin america , the caribbean and the european union should have an important role in forming a new international order in which multilateralism and social cohesion translate into a more secure , equal , prosperous and fair world , " mexican president vicente fox said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de latin america aims for more eu trade gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .

nuns , priests and educators in german children 's homes systematically abused the young people there , according to a recently-formed lobbying group .
it 's now demanding a public apology . when marion zagermann looks back on her childhood , she does n't remember carefree days playing with friends and being surrounded by loving adults .
instead , often through tears , she remembers being chained to a bed at night , to a chair during the day , and being held under cold water until she lost consciousness .
in short , she remembers abuse , even torture - all at the hands of people of the church .
now marion and others are coming forth with their stories of abuse in church-sponsored children 's homes across germany .
their association , which hopes to be a forum and interest group for people who spent parts of their childhood in institutions , is meeting in the city of kassel on saturday .
the group 's goals are to bring together people with similar abusive pasts in children 's homes and set up a databank of their experiences .
members also want to bring the perpetrators , or at least the organizations where they were active , to account .
" we demand a public apology for the harm that was done to us in these institutions , " jean-pierre de picco , chairman of the victims ' association , told reporters .
tales of horror according to him , there were around 3,600 children 's homes in germany in the 1950s and 60s , and while abuse did not take place in all of them , the horrific stories of mistreatment are not isolated cases .
of the cases of abuse reported thus far , 90 percent happened in catholic children 's homes .
" we were beaten and whipped bloody by the nuns , even for the smallest of infractions , " picco said .
now an artist and historian for the city of hamlin , picco , 46 , lived at the " holy hedwig sisters " catholic boarding school from 1963 to 1972 , which has since been closed .
he describes nine years of fear due to continual physical and psychological abuse , including beatings with thorny branches , immersions in hot water until his skin was red and burnt , and sexual abuse .
fridays were especially bad for the young picco , since fish , which he hated , was served in the cafeteria on that day .
usually he threw up on the tray and was forced to eat it all again .
for decades afterward he was n't able to talk about his experiences and it was only in the mid-1990s that the repressed memories exploded on the surface .
" i cried rivers , " he said .
after the newsmagazine der spiegel reported his story some 500 people contacted the publication with similar stories .
it was then that he decided to create a formal organization to represent children abused in homes from 1945 to1985 .
at the founding in january of this year in the largely catholic city of paderborn , it counted 70 members .
" what happened to us , must have happened to hundreds of thousands of others , " he told reporters , the results often being addictive behavior , panic attacks , recurrent nightmares and depression as adults .
taliban regime gisela n. was one of the thousands .
at the age of 15 she was placed in a home in the city of dortmund where she was kept virtual prisoner , unable to leave the house , for two years and spent much of the time in solitary confinement , once because she sang an elvis song .
the 58-year-old compares the administration at the children 's home as a catholic " taliban regime " and like most of the abuse kids , left the church long ago .
she kept her story to herself for years and only came forward after seeing the 2003 film " the magdalene sisters , " based on the real experiences of irish girls sent to work in abusive conditions in laundries run by a religious order .
" it was a terror regime , a combination of nazi ideology and fanatical catholicism , " she said .
while there were a few nuns , priests and teachers who were kind , they were quickly driven off by the abusers .
picco says a public apology from the catholic church would help victims work through the mistreatment .
his association would also like a one-time compensation payment .
so far , however , there catholic church has kept silent about the accusations .
for marion zagermann , that silence has to be broken and lessons have to be learned .
her coming forward is part of the first step .
" i never want to hear again people saying ' times back then were just like that ' , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.05.2004 german experts warn of alarming lack of skilled workers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign students will be able to stay and work in germany german business leaders have largely welcomed the political breakthrough on immigration , but warn the government has to move quickly to translate words into action as germany faces a dramatic shortage of skilled labor . a collective sigh of relief went around german business circles and industry groups this week after chancellor schröder reached a deal with the conservative opposition on a much-needed immigration law for the country after years of cross-party bickering . the new law will make it easier for german companies to hire managers and highly-qualified technical personnel from abroad as well as allow foreign students to stay in the country for a year and seek work after successfully completing their study program . german industry leaders have for years been urging political leaders to ease restrictions for foreign workers and implement immigration policies attuned to the present and future needs of the german labor market .
they argue there is n't enough skilled labor in the country to fill vacancies . " major dearth of skilled workers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rogowski , president of the german federation of industries this week , the president of the federation of german industries , michael rogowski , -lrb- photo -rrb- conceded that the problem of lack of skilled labor had eased partially in light of germany 's weak economic growth , but warned " this will change when the economy springs back to life again and in the long-term the demographic development begins to affect the labor market . " rogowski added : " we 'll squander away our economic growth chances if we ca n't cover the skilled labor shortage . " klaus zimmermann , head of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- echoed the sentiment .
" we need more immigration because we already have a dearth of skilled workers - it 's a problem that 's going to become massively acute in the next 10 to 15 years , " he said . it 's a scenario that 's all to familiar to researchers at the cologne institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- , who reckon that at present about 20,000 jobs nation-wide requiring high skills are n't filled because of a shortage of qualified workers . the problem is especially evident in the health care , corporate management , technical and engineering sectors .
" often the problem involves key positions , upon which other jobs are dependant , " iw labor market expert holger schäfer told daily berliner zeitung . catastrophic labor situation by 2050 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers warn that germany 's birth rate is declining at an alarming rate .
schäfer said their research showed that the need for qualified workers in germany will intensify hugely starting 2012 or 2015 because that 's when the country 's baby boomer generation will retire and birth rates will stagnate . the cologne researchers make it clear that the shortage of skilled labor in germany will take on alarming proportions by 2050 : the experts believe that by that time the number of potential workers - that includes working people , the jobless as well those not working - will fall to 30 million from the current 42 million . " there will be a drastic need for skilled labor because in the future fewer shoulders will have to bear more burdens , " according to the iw study . at the same time the number of highly qualified employees - those with a university degree or a professional qualification - will sink by two million to 8.9 million by 2050 .
the researchers also claim that by 2050 , germany 's population will fall to about 70 million - 12 million less than the current figure . the iw researchers believe that a shrinking population and work force will have catastrophic consequences for the country . global race for the best brains experts point towards chancellor schröder 's green card initiative in the it industry to plug a major need for skilled technical workers as an example of how monitored immigration can help fulfill demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a fourth of all green card it experts in germany come from india .
since august 2000 , the german government has issued around 16,400 green cards to foreigners with degrees in information and communication technology . but there 's little doubt that even that regulation is plagued with problems .
the government 's target of attracting around 20,000 it foreign workers has failed partly because of the sluggish growth in the it sector , but also on account of bureaucratic hurdles . business leaders are hoping that the implementation of a new immigration law this year will also give a boost to the flagging green card effort .

they argue there is n't enough skilled labor in the country to fill vacancies . " major dearth of skilled workers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rogowski , president of the german federation of industries this week , the president of the federation of german industries , michael rogowski , -lrb- photo -rrb- conceded that the problem of lack of skilled labor had eased partially in light of germany 's weak economic growth , but warned " this will change when the economy springs back to life again and in the long-term the demographic development begins to affect the labor market . " rogowski added : " we 'll squander away our economic growth chances if we ca n't cover the skilled labor shortage . " klaus zimmermann , head of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- echoed the sentiment .
" we need more immigration because we already have a dearth of skilled workers - it 's a problem that 's going to become massively acute in the next 10 to 15 years , " he said . it 's a scenario that 's all to familiar to researchers at the cologne institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- , who reckon that at present about 20,000 jobs nation-wide requiring high skills are n't filled because of a shortage of qualified workers . the problem is especially evident in the health care , corporate management , technical and engineering sectors .
" often the problem involves key positions , upon which other jobs are dependant , " iw labor market expert holger schäfer told daily berliner zeitung . catastrophic labor situation by 2050 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers warn that germany 's birth rate is declining at an alarming rate .
schäfer said their research showed that the need for qualified workers in germany will intensify hugely starting 2012 or 2015 because that 's when the country 's baby boomer generation will retire and birth rates will stagnate . the cologne researchers make it clear that the shortage of skilled labor in germany will take on alarming proportions by 2050 : the experts believe that by that time the number of potential workers - that includes working people , the jobless as well those not working - will fall to 30 million from the current 42 million . " there will be a drastic need for skilled labor because in the future fewer shoulders will have to bear more burdens , " according to the iw study . at the same time the number of highly qualified employees - those with a university degree or a professional qualification - will sink by two million to 8.9 million by 2050 .
the researchers also claim that by 2050 , germany 's population will fall to about 70 million - 12 million less than the current figure . the iw researchers believe that a shrinking population and work force will have catastrophic consequences for the country . global race for the best brains experts point towards chancellor schröder 's green card initiative in the it industry to plug a major need for skilled technical workers as an example of how monitored immigration can help fulfill demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a fourth of all green card it experts in germany come from india .
since august 2000 , the german government has issued around 16,400 green cards to foreigners with degrees in information and communication technology . but there 's little doubt that even that regulation is plagued with problems .
the government 's target of attracting around 20,000 it foreign workers has failed partly because of the sluggish growth in the it sector , but also on account of bureaucratic hurdles . business leaders are hoping that the implementation of a new immigration law this year will also give a boost to the flagging green card effort .

they argue there is n't enough skilled labor in the country to fill vacancies . " major dearth of skilled workers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rogowski , president of the german federation of industries this week , the president of the federation of german industries , michael rogowski , -lrb- photo -rrb- conceded that the problem of lack of skilled labor had eased partially in light of germany 's weak economic growth , but warned " this will change when the economy springs back to life again and in the long-term the demographic development begins to affect the labor market . " rogowski added : " we 'll squander away our economic growth chances if we ca n't cover the skilled labor shortage . " klaus zimmermann , head of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- echoed the sentiment .
" we need more immigration because we already have a dearth of skilled workers - it 's a problem that 's going to become massively acute in the next 10 to 15 years , " he said . it 's a scenario that 's all to familiar to researchers at the cologne institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- , who reckon that at present about 20,000 jobs nation-wide requiring high skills are n't filled because of a shortage of qualified workers . the problem is especially evident in the health care , corporate management , technical and engineering sectors .
" often the problem involves key positions , upon which other jobs are dependant , " iw labor market expert holger schäfer told daily berliner zeitung . catastrophic labor situation by 2050 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers warn that germany 's birth rate is declining at an alarming rate .
schäfer said their research showed that the need for qualified workers in germany will intensify hugely starting 2012 or 2015 because that 's when the country 's baby boomer generation will retire and birth rates will stagnate . the cologne researchers make it clear that the shortage of skilled labor in germany will take on alarming proportions by 2050 : the experts believe that by that time the number of potential workers - that includes working people , the jobless as well those not working - will fall to 30 million from the current 42 million . " there will be a drastic need for skilled labor because in the future fewer shoulders will have to bear more burdens , " according to the iw study . at the same time the number of highly qualified employees - those with a university degree or a professional qualification - will sink by two million to 8.9 million by 2050 .
the researchers also claim that by 2050 , germany 's population will fall to about 70 million - 12 million less than the current figure . the iw researchers believe that a shrinking population and work force will have catastrophic consequences for the country . global race for the best brains experts point towards chancellor schröder 's green card initiative in the it industry to plug a major need for skilled technical workers as an example of how monitored immigration can help fulfill demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a fourth of all green card it experts in germany come from india .
since august 2000 , the german government has issued around 16,400 green cards to foreigners with degrees in information and communication technology . but there 's little doubt that even that regulation is plagued with problems .
the government 's target of attracting around 20,000 it foreign workers has failed partly because of the sluggish growth in the it sector , but also on account of bureaucratic hurdles . business leaders are hoping that the implementation of a new immigration law this year will also give a boost to the flagging green card effort .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.05.2004 group claims rampant abuse in children 's homes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse in german church-run children 's homes was widespread , victims say .
nuns , priests and educators in german children 's homes systematically abused the young people there , according to a recently-formed lobbying group .
it 's now demanding a public apology . when marion zagermann looks back on her childhood , she does n't remember carefree days playing with friends and being surrounded by loving adults .
instead , often through tears , she remembers being chained to a bed at night , to a chair during the day , and being held under cold water until she lost consciousness .
in short , she remembers abuse , even torture - all at the hands of people of the church .
now marion and others are coming forth with their stories of abuse in church-sponsored children 's homes across germany .
their association , which hopes to be a forum and interest group for people who spent parts of their childhood in institutions , is meeting in the city of kassel on saturday .
the group 's goals are to bring together people with similar abusive pasts in children 's homes and set up a databank of their experiences .
members also want to bring the perpetrators , or at least the organizations where they were active , to account .
" we demand a public apology for the harm that was done to us in these institutions , " jean-pierre de picco , chairman of the victims ' association , told reporters .
tales of horror according to him , there were around 3,600 children 's homes in germany in the 1950s and 60s , and while abuse did not take place in all of them , the horrific stories of mistreatment are not isolated cases .
of the cases of abuse reported thus far , 90 percent happened in catholic children 's homes .
" we were beaten and whipped bloody by the nuns , even for the smallest of infractions , " picco said .
now an artist and historian for the city of hamlin , picco , 46 , lived at the " holy hedwig sisters " catholic boarding school from 1963 to 1972 , which has since been closed .
he describes nine years of fear due to continual physical and psychological abuse , including beatings with thorny branches , immersions in hot water until his skin was red and burnt , and sexual abuse .
fridays were especially bad for the young picco , since fish , which he hated , was served in the cafeteria on that day .
usually he threw up on the tray and was forced to eat it all again .
for decades afterward he was n't able to talk about his experiences and it was only in the mid-1990s that the repressed memories exploded on the surface .
" i cried rivers , " he said .
after the newsmagazine der spiegel reported his story some 500 people contacted the publication with similar stories .
it was then that he decided to create a formal organization to represent children abused in homes from 1945 to1985 .
at the founding in january of this year in the largely catholic city of paderborn , it counted 70 members .
" what happened to us , must have happened to hundreds of thousands of others , " he told reporters , the results often being addictive behavior , panic attacks , recurrent nightmares and depression as adults .
taliban regime gisela n. was one of the thousands .
at the age of 15 she was placed in a home in the city of dortmund where she was kept virtual prisoner , unable to leave the house , for two years and spent much of the time in solitary confinement , once because she sang an elvis song .
the 58-year-old compares the administration at the children 's home as a catholic " taliban regime " and like most of the abuse kids , left the church long ago .
she kept her story to herself for years and only came forward after seeing the 2003 film " the magdalene sisters , " based on the real experiences of irish girls sent to work in abusive conditions in laundries run by a religious order .
" it was a terror regime , a combination of nazi ideology and fanatical catholicism , " she said .
while there were a few nuns , priests and teachers who were kind , they were quickly driven off by the abusers .
picco says a public apology from the catholic church would help victims work through the mistreatment .
his association would also like a one-time compensation payment .
so far , however , there catholic church has kept silent about the accusations .
for marion zagermann , that silence has to be broken and lessons have to be learned .
her coming forward is part of the first step .
" i never want to hear again people saying ' times back then were just like that ' , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .

chancellor schröder on friday pushed for a permanent german seat on the u.n. security council at the eu-latin america summit , that urged the u.s. to drop its go-it-alone stance and stressed the need for u.n. reform . german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters in guadalajara in mexico on friday that he saw " good chances that such a seat can be realized , " and said it was recognized how sensitively and responsibly germany behaved on the world political stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder speaks during the eu-latin america summit in mexico . schröder 's government has never concealed its interest in a german seat on the council and has stepped up efforts recently to accomplish it . under the current structure , the security council has five permanent members - china , france , great britain , the united states and russia .
it also has 10 rotating members elected for two-year terms by the general assembly . germany was shut out from permanent-seat status when the u.n. was formed in 1945 .
for germany to get a seat , france or britain would have to cede theirs - not an easy option .
some european nations would like the 25-nation eu to get a permanent seat . condemnation of torture representatives from 58 european , latin america and caribbean nations participated in the one-day summit in mexico 's western city of guadalajara aimed at building closer ties between europe and latin america . despite initial opposition from britain and after hours of wrangling on the wording of the concluding declaration , summit participants condemned the sexual humiliation , torture and degradation of iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison by u.s. soldiers .
the scandal has further undermined u.s. credibility in iraq and the wider arab world . " we declare our horror at recent evidence of the mistreatment of prisoners in iraqi jails .
these abuses go against international law , " the declaration said .
" we energetically condemn all forms of abuse , torture and other cruel , inhumane and degrading treatment against people , including prisoners of war , wherever they occur . " u.s. should drop unilateralism the leaders also said they wanted the united nations to remain the premier organization to resolve international conflicts in a indirect warning to the u.s. to shed its unilateralist stance . the summit declaration was also critical of u.s. foreign policy , without specifically mentioning the u.s. they also called for a revamp of the united nations and expressed " full support " for the international criminal court in the hague , netherlands . leaders said u.n. reforms must make the international organization more effective and spare it the embarrassment of being sidelined , as happened last year when the u.s. declared war on iraq without u.n. backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister and head of the eu presidency , bertie ahern .
" we all recall that 2003 was a difficult year , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country holds the eu presidency .
ahern said u.s. action last year showed the u.n. to be " unable to deal with hard questions of peace and security and unable , therefore , to command confidence . " ahern said no country can act alone .
" peace and justice can best be guaranteed by states working together .
only by working together an terrorism conditions , which can sometimes rise to terrorism , be addressed , " ahern said . reform of the u.n. chancellor schröder said it was first necessary to bring about changes in the united nations .

nuns , priests and educators in german children 's homes systematically abused the young people there , according to a recently-formed lobbying group .
it 's now demanding a public apology . when marion zagermann looks back on her childhood , she does n't remember carefree days playing with friends and being surrounded by loving adults .
instead , often through tears , she remembers being chained to a bed at night , to a chair during the day , and being held under cold water until she lost consciousness .
in short , she remembers abuse , even torture - all at the hands of people of the church .
now marion and others are coming forth with their stories of abuse in church-sponsored children 's homes across germany .
their association , which hopes to be a forum and interest group for people who spent parts of their childhood in institutions , is meeting in the city of kassel on saturday .
the group 's goals are to bring together people with similar abusive pasts in children 's homes and set up a databank of their experiences .
members also want to bring the perpetrators , or at least the organizations where they were active , to account .
" we demand a public apology for the harm that was done to us in these institutions , " jean-pierre de picco , chairman of the victims ' association , told reporters .
tales of horror according to him , there were around 3,600 children 's homes in germany in the 1950s and 60s , and while abuse did not take place in all of them , the horrific stories of mistreatment are not isolated cases .
of the cases of abuse reported thus far , 90 percent happened in catholic children 's homes .
" we were beaten and whipped bloody by the nuns , even for the smallest of infractions , " picco said .
now an artist and historian for the city of hamlin , picco , 46 , lived at the " holy hedwig sisters " catholic boarding school from 1963 to 1972 , which has since been closed .
he describes nine years of fear due to continual physical and psychological abuse , including beatings with thorny branches , immersions in hot water until his skin was red and burnt , and sexual abuse .
fridays were especially bad for the young picco , since fish , which he hated , was served in the cafeteria on that day .
usually he threw up on the tray and was forced to eat it all again .
for decades afterward he was n't able to talk about his experiences and it was only in the mid-1990s that the repressed memories exploded on the surface .
" i cried rivers , " he said .
after the newsmagazine der spiegel reported his story some 500 people contacted the publication with similar stories .
it was then that he decided to create a formal organization to represent children abused in homes from 1945 to1985 .
at the founding in january of this year in the largely catholic city of paderborn , it counted 70 members .
" what happened to us , must have happened to hundreds of thousands of others , " he told reporters , the results often being addictive behavior , panic attacks , recurrent nightmares and depression as adults .
taliban regime gisela n. was one of the thousands .
at the age of 15 she was placed in a home in the city of dortmund where she was kept virtual prisoner , unable to leave the house , for two years and spent much of the time in solitary confinement , once because she sang an elvis song .
the 58-year-old compares the administration at the children 's home as a catholic " taliban regime " and like most of the abuse kids , left the church long ago .
she kept her story to herself for years and only came forward after seeing the 2003 film " the magdalene sisters , " based on the real experiences of irish girls sent to work in abusive conditions in laundries run by a religious order .
" it was a terror regime , a combination of nazi ideology and fanatical catholicism , " she said .
while there were a few nuns , priests and teachers who were kind , they were quickly driven off by the abusers .
picco says a public apology from the catholic church would help victims work through the mistreatment .
his association would also like a one-time compensation payment .
so far , however , there catholic church has kept silent about the accusations .
for marion zagermann , that silence has to be broken and lessons have to be learned .
her coming forward is part of the first step .
" i never want to hear again people saying ' times back then were just like that ' , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .

in short , she remembers abuse , even torture - all at the hands of people of the church .
now marion and others are coming forth with their stories of abuse in church-sponsored children 's homes across germany .
their association , which hopes to be a forum and interest group for people who spent parts of their childhood in institutions , is meeting in the city of kassel on saturday .
the group 's goals are to bring together people with similar abusive pasts in children 's homes and set up a databank of their experiences .

" we demand a public apology for the harm that was done to us in these institutions , " jean-pierre de picco , chairman of the victims ' association , told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.05.2004 german experts warn of alarming lack of skilled workers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign students will be able to stay and work in germany german business leaders have largely welcomed the political breakthrough on immigration , but warn the government has to move quickly to translate words into action as germany faces a dramatic shortage of skilled labor . a collective sigh of relief went around german business circles and industry groups this week after chancellor schröder reached a deal with the conservative opposition on a much-needed immigration law for the country after years of cross-party bickering . the new law will make it easier for german companies to hire managers and highly-qualified technical personnel from abroad as well as allow foreign students to stay in the country for a year and seek work after successfully completing their study program . german industry leaders have for years been urging political leaders to ease restrictions for foreign workers and implement immigration policies attuned to the present and future needs of the german labor market .
they argue there is n't enough skilled labor in the country to fill vacancies . " major dearth of skilled workers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rogowski , president of the german federation of industries this week , the president of the federation of german industries , michael rogowski , -lrb- photo -rrb- conceded that the problem of lack of skilled labor had eased partially in light of germany 's weak economic growth , but warned " this will change when the economy springs back to life again and in the long-term the demographic development begins to affect the labor market . " rogowski added : " we 'll squander away our economic growth chances if we ca n't cover the skilled labor shortage . " klaus zimmermann , head of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- echoed the sentiment .
" we need more immigration because we already have a dearth of skilled workers - it 's a problem that 's going to become massively acute in the next 10 to 15 years , " he said . it 's a scenario that 's all to familiar to researchers at the cologne institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- , who reckon that at present about 20,000 jobs nation-wide requiring high skills are n't filled because of a shortage of qualified workers . the problem is especially evident in the health care , corporate management , technical and engineering sectors .
" often the problem involves key positions , upon which other jobs are dependant , " iw labor market expert holger schäfer told daily berliner zeitung . catastrophic labor situation by 2050 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers warn that germany 's birth rate is declining at an alarming rate .
schäfer said their research showed that the need for qualified workers in germany will intensify hugely starting 2012 or 2015 because that 's when the country 's baby boomer generation will retire and birth rates will stagnate . the cologne researchers make it clear that the shortage of skilled labor in germany will take on alarming proportions by 2050 : the experts believe that by that time the number of potential workers - that includes working people , the jobless as well those not working - will fall to 30 million from the current 42 million . " there will be a drastic need for skilled labor because in the future fewer shoulders will have to bear more burdens , " according to the iw study . at the same time the number of highly qualified employees - those with a university degree or a professional qualification - will sink by two million to 8.9 million by 2050 .
the researchers also claim that by 2050 , germany 's population will fall to about 70 million - 12 million less than the current figure . the iw researchers believe that a shrinking population and work force will have catastrophic consequences for the country . global race for the best brains experts point towards chancellor schröder 's green card initiative in the it industry to plug a major need for skilled technical workers as an example of how monitored immigration can help fulfill demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a fourth of all green card it experts in germany come from india .
since august 2000 , the german government has issued around 16,400 green cards to foreigners with degrees in information and communication technology . but there 's little doubt that even that regulation is plagued with problems .
the government 's target of attracting around 20,000 it foreign workers has failed partly because of the sluggish growth in the it sector , but also on account of bureaucratic hurdles . business leaders are hoping that the implementation of a new immigration law this year will also give a boost to the flagging green card effort .
" germany must finally aggressively participate in the global competition for the best brains , " rogowski said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough on german immigration law after years of acrimonious talks and two failed attempts to push through a controversial immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder managed to secure a deal with the opposition conservatives .

" rogowski added : " we 'll squander away our economic growth chances if we ca n't cover the skilled labor shortage . " klaus zimmermann , head of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- echoed the sentiment .
" we need more immigration because we already have a dearth of skilled workers - it 's a problem that 's going to become massively acute in the next 10 to 15 years , " he said . it 's a scenario that 's all to familiar to researchers at the cologne institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- , who reckon that at present about 20,000 jobs nation-wide requiring high skills are n't filled because of a shortage of qualified workers . the problem is especially evident in the health care , corporate management , technical and engineering sectors .

schäfer said their research showed that the need for qualified workers in germany will intensify hugely starting 2012 or 2015 because that 's when the country 's baby boomer generation will retire and birth rates will stagnate . the cologne researchers make it clear that the shortage of skilled labor in germany will take on alarming proportions by 2050 : the experts believe that by that time the number of potential workers - that includes working people , the jobless as well those not working - will fall to 30 million from the current 42 million . " there will be a drastic need for skilled labor because in the future fewer shoulders will have to bear more burdens , " according to the iw study . at the same time the number of highly qualified employees - those with a university degree or a professional qualification - will sink by two million to 8.9 million by 2050 .
the researchers also claim that by 2050 , germany 's population will fall to about 70 million - 12 million less than the current figure . the iw researchers believe that a shrinking population and work force will have catastrophic consequences for the country . global race for the best brains experts point towards chancellor schröder 's green card initiative in the it industry to plug a major need for skilled technical workers as an example of how monitored immigration can help fulfill demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a fourth of all green card it experts in germany come from india .

the government 's target of attracting around 20,000 it foreign workers has failed partly because of the sluggish growth in the it sector , but also on account of bureaucratic hurdles . business leaders are hoping that the implementation of a new immigration law this year will also give a boost to the flagging green card effort .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.05.2004 group claims rampant abuse in children 's homes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuse in german church-run children 's homes was widespread , victims say .
nuns , priests and educators in german children 's homes systematically abused the young people there , according to a recently-formed lobbying group .
it 's now demanding a public apology . when marion zagermann looks back on her childhood , she does n't remember carefree days playing with friends and being surrounded by loving adults .
instead , often through tears , she remembers being chained to a bed at night , to a chair during the day , and being held under cold water until she lost consciousness .
in short , she remembers abuse , even torture - all at the hands of people of the church .
now marion and others are coming forth with their stories of abuse in church-sponsored children 's homes across germany .
their association , which hopes to be a forum and interest group for people who spent parts of their childhood in institutions , is meeting in the city of kassel on saturday .
the group 's goals are to bring together people with similar abusive pasts in children 's homes and set up a databank of their experiences .
members also want to bring the perpetrators , or at least the organizations where they were active , to account .
" we demand a public apology for the harm that was done to us in these institutions , " jean-pierre de picco , chairman of the victims ' association , told reporters .
tales of horror according to him , there were around 3,600 children 's homes in germany in the 1950s and 60s , and while abuse did not take place in all of them , the horrific stories of mistreatment are not isolated cases .
of the cases of abuse reported thus far , 90 percent happened in catholic children 's homes .
" we were beaten and whipped bloody by the nuns , even for the smallest of infractions , " picco said .
now an artist and historian for the city of hamlin , picco , 46 , lived at the " holy hedwig sisters " catholic boarding school from 1963 to 1972 , which has since been closed .

they argue there is n't enough skilled labor in the country to fill vacancies . " major dearth of skilled workers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rogowski , president of the german federation of industries this week , the president of the federation of german industries , michael rogowski , -lrb- photo -rrb- conceded that the problem of lack of skilled labor had eased partially in light of germany 's weak economic growth , but warned " this will change when the economy springs back to life again and in the long-term the demographic development begins to affect the labor market . " rogowski added : " we 'll squander away our economic growth chances if we ca n't cover the skilled labor shortage . " klaus zimmermann , head of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- echoed the sentiment .
" we need more immigration because we already have a dearth of skilled workers - it 's a problem that 's going to become massively acute in the next 10 to 15 years , " he said . it 's a scenario that 's all to familiar to researchers at the cologne institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- , who reckon that at present about 20,000 jobs nation-wide requiring high skills are n't filled because of a shortage of qualified workers . the problem is especially evident in the health care , corporate management , technical and engineering sectors .
" often the problem involves key positions , upon which other jobs are dependant , " iw labor market expert holger schäfer told daily berliner zeitung . catastrophic labor situation by 2050 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers warn that germany 's birth rate is declining at an alarming rate .
schäfer said their research showed that the need for qualified workers in germany will intensify hugely starting 2012 or 2015 because that 's when the country 's baby boomer generation will retire and birth rates will stagnate . the cologne researchers make it clear that the shortage of skilled labor in germany will take on alarming proportions by 2050 : the experts believe that by that time the number of potential workers - that includes working people , the jobless as well those not working - will fall to 30 million from the current 42 million . " there will be a drastic need for skilled labor because in the future fewer shoulders will have to bear more burdens , " according to the iw study . at the same time the number of highly qualified employees - those with a university degree or a professional qualification - will sink by two million to 8.9 million by 2050 .
the researchers also claim that by 2050 , germany 's population will fall to about 70 million - 12 million less than the current figure . the iw researchers believe that a shrinking population and work force will have catastrophic consequences for the country . global race for the best brains experts point towards chancellor schröder 's green card initiative in the it industry to plug a major need for skilled technical workers as an example of how monitored immigration can help fulfill demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a fourth of all green card it experts in germany come from india .
since august 2000 , the german government has issued around 16,400 green cards to foreigners with degrees in information and communication technology . but there 's little doubt that even that regulation is plagued with problems .
the government 's target of attracting around 20,000 it foreign workers has failed partly because of the sluggish growth in the it sector , but also on account of bureaucratic hurdles . business leaders are hoping that the implementation of a new immigration law this year will also give a boost to the flagging green card effort .

nuns , priests and educators in german children 's homes systematically abused the young people there , according to a recently-formed lobbying group .
it 's now demanding a public apology . when marion zagermann looks back on her childhood , she does n't remember carefree days playing with friends and being surrounded by loving adults .
instead , often through tears , she remembers being chained to a bed at night , to a chair during the day , and being held under cold water until she lost consciousness .
in short , she remembers abuse , even torture - all at the hands of people of the church .
now marion and others are coming forth with their stories of abuse in church-sponsored children 's homes across germany .
their association , which hopes to be a forum and interest group for people who spent parts of their childhood in institutions , is meeting in the city of kassel on saturday .
the group 's goals are to bring together people with similar abusive pasts in children 's homes and set up a databank of their experiences .
members also want to bring the perpetrators , or at least the organizations where they were active , to account .
" we demand a public apology for the harm that was done to us in these institutions , " jean-pierre de picco , chairman of the victims ' association , told reporters .
tales of horror according to him , there were around 3,600 children 's homes in germany in the 1950s and 60s , and while abuse did not take place in all of them , the horrific stories of mistreatment are not isolated cases .
of the cases of abuse reported thus far , 90 percent happened in catholic children 's homes .
" we were beaten and whipped bloody by the nuns , even for the smallest of infractions , " picco said .
now an artist and historian for the city of hamlin , picco , 46 , lived at the " holy hedwig sisters " catholic boarding school from 1963 to 1972 , which has since been closed .

a german scientific research institute has warned that most condoms on the market contain a cancer-causing chemical and has urged that their manufacture be subjected to stringent quality control . the chemical and veterinary investigation institute in stuttgart said on friday it had found the carcinogen n-nitrosamine in 29 of 32 types of condoms it tested in simulated conditions . the condoms , which were kept in a solution with artificial sweat , exuded huge amounts of cancer-causing n-nitrosamine from its rubber coating .
researchers measured amounts of n-nitrosamine , that were way above the prescribed limits for other rubber products such as baby pacifiers . " n-nitrosamine is one of the most carcinogenic substances , " the study 's authors said .
" there is a pressing need for manufacturers to tackle this problem . " the study said that the carcinogen is thought to be present in a substance used to improve condom elasticity .

" authorities are also withholding the name of the affected manufacturers for fear of litigation . manufacturers should use alternative substances but germany 's federal institute for risk assessment said that daily condom use exposed users to n-nitrosamine levels up to three times higher than levels naturally present in food . werner altkofer , head of the stuttgart-based chemical and veterinary investigation institute said that though the production of rubber usually uses chemicals that can exude n-nitrosamine , condom manufacturers could bypass it by using more expensive alternative substances available on the market that did n't form the carcinogen . " we believe that it 's up to the manufacturers to use other production processes so that no n-nitrosamine is formed in condoms , " altkofer said . he added that the latter was technically possible going by the fact that products of some manufacturers did n't show traces of the carcinogen during the testing . beate uhse taking no chances germany 's biggest erotica compnay beate uhse however , has decided to play it safe . shortly after the results of the study were introduced on friday , the group banned chocolate-flavored condoms from its range .

a german scientific research institute has warned that most condoms on the market contain a cancer-causing chemical and has urged that their manufacture be subjected to stringent quality control . the chemical and veterinary investigation institute in stuttgart said on friday it had found the carcinogen n-nitrosamine in 29 of 32 types of condoms it tested in simulated conditions . the condoms , which were kept in a solution with artificial sweat , exuded huge amounts of cancer-causing n-nitrosamine from its rubber coating .
researchers measured amounts of n-nitrosamine , that were way above the prescribed limits for other rubber products such as baby pacifiers . " n-nitrosamine is one of the most carcinogenic substances , " the study 's authors said .
" there is a pressing need for manufacturers to tackle this problem . " the study said that the carcinogen is thought to be present in a substance used to improve condom elasticity .

" authorities are also withholding the name of the affected manufacturers for fear of litigation . manufacturers should use alternative substances but germany 's federal institute for risk assessment said that daily condom use exposed users to n-nitrosamine levels up to three times higher than levels naturally present in food . werner altkofer , head of the stuttgart-based chemical and veterinary investigation institute said that though the production of rubber usually uses chemicals that can exude n-nitrosamine , condom manufacturers could bypass it by using more expensive alternative substances available on the market that did n't form the carcinogen . " we believe that it 's up to the manufacturers to use other production processes so that no n-nitrosamine is formed in condoms , " altkofer said . he added that the latter was technically possible going by the fact that products of some manufacturers did n't show traces of the carcinogen during the testing . beate uhse taking no chances germany 's biggest erotica compnay beate uhse however , has decided to play it safe . shortly after the results of the study were introduced on friday , the group banned chocolate-flavored condoms from its range .

nuns , priests and educators in german children 's homes systematically abused the young people there , according to a recently-formed lobbying group .
it 's now demanding a public apology . when marion zagermann looks back on her childhood , she does n't remember carefree days playing with friends and being surrounded by loving adults .
instead , often through tears , she remembers being chained to a bed at night , to a chair during the day , and being held under cold water until she lost consciousness .
in short , she remembers abuse , even torture - all at the hands of people of the church .
now marion and others are coming forth with their stories of abuse in church-sponsored children 's homes across germany .
their association , which hopes to be a forum and interest group for people who spent parts of their childhood in institutions , is meeting in the city of kassel on saturday .
the group 's goals are to bring together people with similar abusive pasts in children 's homes and set up a databank of their experiences .
members also want to bring the perpetrators , or at least the organizations where they were active , to account .
" we demand a public apology for the harm that was done to us in these institutions , " jean-pierre de picco , chairman of the victims ' association , told reporters .
tales of horror according to him , there were around 3,600 children 's homes in germany in the 1950s and 60s , and while abuse did not take place in all of them , the horrific stories of mistreatment are not isolated cases .
of the cases of abuse reported thus far , 90 percent happened in catholic children 's homes .
" we were beaten and whipped bloody by the nuns , even for the smallest of infractions , " picco said .
now an artist and historian for the city of hamlin , picco , 46 , lived at the " holy hedwig sisters " catholic boarding school from 1963 to 1972 , which has since been closed .
he describes nine years of fear due to continual physical and psychological abuse , including beatings with thorny branches , immersions in hot water until his skin was red and burnt , and sexual abuse .
fridays were especially bad for the young picco , since fish , which he hated , was served in the cafeteria on that day .
usually he threw up on the tray and was forced to eat it all again .
for decades afterward he was n't able to talk about his experiences and it was only in the mid-1990s that the repressed memories exploded on the surface .
" i cried rivers , " he said .
after the newsmagazine der spiegel reported his story some 500 people contacted the publication with similar stories .
it was then that he decided to create a formal organization to represent children abused in homes from 1945 to1985 .
at the founding in january of this year in the largely catholic city of paderborn , it counted 70 members .
" what happened to us , must have happened to hundreds of thousands of others , " he told reporters , the results often being addictive behavior , panic attacks , recurrent nightmares and depression as adults .
taliban regime gisela n. was one of the thousands .
at the age of 15 she was placed in a home in the city of dortmund where she was kept virtual prisoner , unable to leave the house , for two years and spent much of the time in solitary confinement , once because she sang an elvis song .
the 58-year-old compares the administration at the children 's home as a catholic " taliban regime " and like most of the abuse kids , left the church long ago .
she kept her story to herself for years and only came forward after seeing the 2003 film " the magdalene sisters , " based on the real experiences of irish girls sent to work in abusive conditions in laundries run by a religious order .
" it was a terror regime , a combination of nazi ideology and fanatical catholicism , " she said .
while there were a few nuns , priests and teachers who were kind , they were quickly driven off by the abusers .
picco says a public apology from the catholic church would help victims work through the mistreatment .
his association would also like a one-time compensation payment .
so far , however , there catholic church has kept silent about the accusations .
for marion zagermann , that silence has to be broken and lessons have to be learned .
her coming forward is part of the first step .
" i never want to hear again people saying ' times back then were just like that ' , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .

he describes nine years of fear due to continual physical and psychological abuse , including beatings with thorny branches , immersions in hot water until his skin was red and burnt , and sexual abuse .
fridays were especially bad for the young picco , since fish , which he hated , was served in the cafeteria on that day .
usually he threw up on the tray and was forced to eat it all again .
for decades afterward he was n't able to talk about his experiences and it was only in the mid-1990s that the repressed memories exploded on the surface .

at the age of 15 she was placed in a home in the city of dortmund where she was kept virtual prisoner , unable to leave the house , for two years and spent much of the time in solitary confinement , once because she sang an elvis song .
the 58-year-old compares the administration at the children 's home as a catholic " taliban regime " and like most of the abuse kids , left the church long ago .
she kept her story to herself for years and only came forward after seeing the 2003 film " the magdalene sisters , " based on the real experiences of irish girls sent to work in abusive conditions in laundries run by a religious order .

nuns , priests and educators in german children 's homes systematically abused the young people there , according to a recently-formed lobbying group .
it 's now demanding a public apology . when marion zagermann looks back on her childhood , she does n't remember carefree days playing with friends and being surrounded by loving adults .
instead , often through tears , she remembers being chained to a bed at night , to a chair during the day , and being held under cold water until she lost consciousness .
in short , she remembers abuse , even torture - all at the hands of people of the church .
now marion and others are coming forth with their stories of abuse in church-sponsored children 's homes across germany .
their association , which hopes to be a forum and interest group for people who spent parts of their childhood in institutions , is meeting in the city of kassel on saturday .
the group 's goals are to bring together people with similar abusive pasts in children 's homes and set up a databank of their experiences .
members also want to bring the perpetrators , or at least the organizations where they were active , to account .
" we demand a public apology for the harm that was done to us in these institutions , " jean-pierre de picco , chairman of the victims ' association , told reporters .
tales of horror according to him , there were around 3,600 children 's homes in germany in the 1950s and 60s , and while abuse did not take place in all of them , the horrific stories of mistreatment are not isolated cases .

now marion and others are coming forth with their stories of abuse in church-sponsored children 's homes across germany .
their association , which hopes to be a forum and interest group for people who spent parts of their childhood in institutions , is meeting in the city of kassel on saturday .
the group 's goals are to bring together people with similar abusive pasts in children 's homes and set up a databank of their experiences .
members also want to bring the perpetrators , or at least the organizations where they were active , to account .
" we demand a public apology for the harm that was done to us in these institutions , " jean-pierre de picco , chairman of the victims ' association , told reporters .
tales of horror according to him , there were around 3,600 children 's homes in germany in the 1950s and 60s , and while abuse did not take place in all of them , the horrific stories of mistreatment are not isolated cases .
of the cases of abuse reported thus far , 90 percent happened in catholic children 's homes .
" we were beaten and whipped bloody by the nuns , even for the smallest of infractions , " picco said .
now an artist and historian for the city of hamlin , picco , 46 , lived at the " holy hedwig sisters " catholic boarding school from 1963 to 1972 , which has since been closed .
he describes nine years of fear due to continual physical and psychological abuse , including beatings with thorny branches , immersions in hot water until his skin was red and burnt , and sexual abuse .
fridays were especially bad for the young picco , since fish , which he hated , was served in the cafeteria on that day .
usually he threw up on the tray and was forced to eat it all again .
for decades afterward he was n't able to talk about his experiences and it was only in the mid-1990s that the repressed memories exploded on the surface .
" i cried rivers , " he said .
after the newsmagazine der spiegel reported his story some 500 people contacted the publication with similar stories .
it was then that he decided to create a formal organization to represent children abused in homes from 1945 to1985 .
at the founding in january of this year in the largely catholic city of paderborn , it counted 70 members .
" what happened to us , must have happened to hundreds of thousands of others , " he told reporters , the results often being addictive behavior , panic attacks , recurrent nightmares and depression as adults .
taliban regime gisela n. was one of the thousands .
at the age of 15 she was placed in a home in the city of dortmund where she was kept virtual prisoner , unable to leave the house , for two years and spent much of the time in solitary confinement , once because she sang an elvis song .
the 58-year-old compares the administration at the children 's home as a catholic " taliban regime " and like most of the abuse kids , left the church long ago .
she kept her story to herself for years and only came forward after seeing the 2003 film " the magdalene sisters , " based on the real experiences of irish girls sent to work in abusive conditions in laundries run by a religious order .
" it was a terror regime , a combination of nazi ideology and fanatical catholicism , " she said .
while there were a few nuns , priests and teachers who were kind , they were quickly driven off by the abusers .
picco says a public apology from the catholic church would help victims work through the mistreatment .
his association would also like a one-time compensation payment .
so far , however , there catholic church has kept silent about the accusations .
for marion zagermann , that silence has to be broken and lessons have to be learned .
her coming forward is part of the first step .
" i never want to hear again people saying ' times back then were just like that ' , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .

a german scientific research institute has warned that most condoms on the market contain a cancer-causing chemical and has urged that their manufacture be subjected to stringent quality control . the chemical and veterinary investigation institute in stuttgart said on friday it had found the carcinogen n-nitrosamine in 29 of 32 types of condoms it tested in simulated conditions . the condoms , which were kept in a solution with artificial sweat , exuded huge amounts of cancer-causing n-nitrosamine from its rubber coating .
researchers measured amounts of n-nitrosamine , that were way above the prescribed limits for other rubber products such as baby pacifiers . " n-nitrosamine is one of the most carcinogenic substances , " the study 's authors said .
" there is a pressing need for manufacturers to tackle this problem . " the study said that the carcinogen is thought to be present in a substance used to improve condom elasticity .
when the rubber material comes in contact with human bodily fluids , it can release traces of n-nitrosamine . no immediate health risk but since there are no prescribed limits of n-nitrosamine for condoms , the study has n't caused panic among manufacturers or mass-recalling of the products from counters . local government officials said condom users should not stop using rubber contraceptives based on the results of the study because n-nitrosamine does not present an immediate health risk . the baden-würtemmberg social ministry said it did n't think " it posed a risk . " authorities are also withholding the name of the affected manufacturers for fear of litigation . manufacturers should use alternative substances but germany 's federal institute for risk assessment said that daily condom use exposed users to n-nitrosamine levels up to three times higher than levels naturally present in food . werner altkofer , head of the stuttgart-based chemical and veterinary investigation institute said that though the production of rubber usually uses chemicals that can exude n-nitrosamine , condom manufacturers could bypass it by using more expensive alternative substances available on the market that did n't form the carcinogen . " we believe that it 's up to the manufacturers to use other production processes so that no n-nitrosamine is formed in condoms , " altkofer said . he added that the latter was technically possible going by the fact that products of some manufacturers did n't show traces of the carcinogen during the testing . beate uhse taking no chances germany 's biggest erotica compnay beate uhse however , has decided to play it safe . shortly after the results of the study were introduced on friday , the group banned chocolate-flavored condoms from its range .

chancellor schröder on friday pushed for a permanent german seat on the u.n. security council at the eu-latin america summit , that urged the u.s. to drop its go-it-alone stance and stressed the need for u.n. reform . german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters in guadalajara in mexico on friday that he saw " good chances that such a seat can be realized , " and said it was recognized how sensitively and responsibly germany behaved on the world political stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder speaks during the eu-latin america summit in mexico . schröder 's government has never concealed its interest in a german seat on the council and has stepped up efforts recently to accomplish it . under the current structure , the security council has five permanent members - china , france , great britain , the united states and russia .
it also has 10 rotating members elected for two-year terms by the general assembly . germany was shut out from permanent-seat status when the u.n. was formed in 1945 .
for germany to get a seat , france or britain would have to cede theirs - not an easy option .
some european nations would like the 25-nation eu to get a permanent seat . condemnation of torture representatives from 58 european , latin america and caribbean nations participated in the one-day summit in mexico 's western city of guadalajara aimed at building closer ties between europe and latin america . despite initial opposition from britain and after hours of wrangling on the wording of the concluding declaration , summit participants condemned the sexual humiliation , torture and degradation of iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison by u.s. soldiers .
the scandal has further undermined u.s. credibility in iraq and the wider arab world . " we declare our horror at recent evidence of the mistreatment of prisoners in iraqi jails .
these abuses go against international law , " the declaration said .
" we energetically condemn all forms of abuse , torture and other cruel , inhumane and degrading treatment against people , including prisoners of war , wherever they occur . " u.s. should drop unilateralism the leaders also said they wanted the united nations to remain the premier organization to resolve international conflicts in a indirect warning to the u.s. to shed its unilateralist stance . the summit declaration was also critical of u.s. foreign policy , without specifically mentioning the u.s. they also called for a revamp of the united nations and expressed " full support " for the international criminal court in the hague , netherlands . leaders said u.n. reforms must make the international organization more effective and spare it the embarrassment of being sidelined , as happened last year when the u.s. declared war on iraq without u.n. backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister and head of the eu presidency , bertie ahern .
" we all recall that 2003 was a difficult year , " said irish prime minister bertie ahern , whose country holds the eu presidency .
ahern said u.s. action last year showed the u.n. to be " unable to deal with hard questions of peace and security and unable , therefore , to command confidence . " ahern said no country can act alone .
" peace and justice can best be guaranteed by states working together .
only by working together an terrorism conditions , which can sometimes rise to terrorism , be addressed , " ahern said . reform of the u.n. chancellor schröder said it was first necessary to bring about changes in the united nations .
" first , however , we must have reforms , " schröder said , adding germany would like to see a u.n. environment agency . the mexican hosts too said they were in favor of far-reaching reforms to the u.n. in order to set up a new international order . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vincente fox , president of mexico " i am convinced latin america , the caribbean and the european union should have an important role in forming a new international order in which multilateralism and social cohesion translate into a more secure , equal , prosperous and fair world , " mexican president vicente fox said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de latin america aims for more eu trade gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .

but trade with the eu is lagging .

schäfer said their research showed that the need for qualified workers in germany will intensify hugely starting 2012 or 2015 because that 's when the country 's baby boomer generation will retire and birth rates will stagnate . the cologne researchers make it clear that the shortage of skilled labor in germany will take on alarming proportions by 2050 : the experts believe that by that time the number of potential workers - that includes working people , the jobless as well those not working - will fall to 30 million from the current 42 million . " there will be a drastic need for skilled labor because in the future fewer shoulders will have to bear more burdens , " according to the iw study . at the same time the number of highly qualified employees - those with a university degree or a professional qualification - will sink by two million to 8.9 million by 2050 .
the researchers also claim that by 2050 , germany 's population will fall to about 70 million - 12 million less than the current figure . the iw researchers believe that a shrinking population and work force will have catastrophic consequences for the country . global race for the best brains experts point towards chancellor schröder 's green card initiative in the it industry to plug a major need for skilled technical workers as an example of how monitored immigration can help fulfill demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a fourth of all green card it experts in germany come from india .
since august 2000 , the german government has issued around 16,400 green cards to foreigners with degrees in information and communication technology . but there 's little doubt that even that regulation is plagued with problems .
the government 's target of attracting around 20,000 it foreign workers has failed partly because of the sluggish growth in the it sector , but also on account of bureaucratic hurdles . business leaders are hoping that the implementation of a new immigration law this year will also give a boost to the flagging green card effort .

they argue there is n't enough skilled labor in the country to fill vacancies . " major dearth of skilled workers " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rogowski , president of the german federation of industries this week , the president of the federation of german industries , michael rogowski , -lrb- photo -rrb- conceded that the problem of lack of skilled labor had eased partially in light of germany 's weak economic growth , but warned " this will change when the economy springs back to life again and in the long-term the demographic development begins to affect the labor market . " rogowski added : " we 'll squander away our economic growth chances if we ca n't cover the skilled labor shortage . " klaus zimmermann , head of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- echoed the sentiment .
" we need more immigration because we already have a dearth of skilled workers - it 's a problem that 's going to become massively acute in the next 10 to 15 years , " he said . it 's a scenario that 's all to familiar to researchers at the cologne institute for business research -lrb- iw -rrb- , who reckon that at present about 20,000 jobs nation-wide requiring high skills are n't filled because of a shortage of qualified workers . the problem is especially evident in the health care , corporate management , technical and engineering sectors .
" often the problem involves key positions , upon which other jobs are dependant , " iw labor market expert holger schäfer told daily berliner zeitung . catastrophic labor situation by 2050 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers warn that germany 's birth rate is declining at an alarming rate .
schäfer said their research showed that the need for qualified workers in germany will intensify hugely starting 2012 or 2015 because that 's when the country 's baby boomer generation will retire and birth rates will stagnate . the cologne researchers make it clear that the shortage of skilled labor in germany will take on alarming proportions by 2050 : the experts believe that by that time the number of potential workers - that includes working people , the jobless as well those not working - will fall to 30 million from the current 42 million . " there will be a drastic need for skilled labor because in the future fewer shoulders will have to bear more burdens , " according to the iw study . at the same time the number of highly qualified employees - those with a university degree or a professional qualification - will sink by two million to 8.9 million by 2050 .
the researchers also claim that by 2050 , germany 's population will fall to about 70 million - 12 million less than the current figure . the iw researchers believe that a shrinking population and work force will have catastrophic consequences for the country . global race for the best brains experts point towards chancellor schröder 's green card initiative in the it industry to plug a major need for skilled technical workers as an example of how monitored immigration can help fulfill demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a fourth of all green card it experts in germany come from india .
since august 2000 , the german government has issued around 16,400 green cards to foreigners with degrees in information and communication technology . but there 's little doubt that even that regulation is plagued with problems .
the government 's target of attracting around 20,000 it foreign workers has failed partly because of the sluggish growth in the it sector , but also on account of bureaucratic hurdles . business leaders are hoping that the implementation of a new immigration law this year will also give a boost to the flagging green card effort .

nuns , priests and educators in german children 's homes systematically abused the young people there , according to a recently-formed lobbying group .
it 's now demanding a public apology . when marion zagermann looks back on her childhood , she does n't remember carefree days playing with friends and being surrounded by loving adults .
instead , often through tears , she remembers being chained to a bed at night , to a chair during the day , and being held under cold water until she lost consciousness .
in short , she remembers abuse , even torture - all at the hands of people of the church .
now marion and others are coming forth with their stories of abuse in church-sponsored children 's homes across germany .
their association , which hopes to be a forum and interest group for people who spent parts of their childhood in institutions , is meeting in the city of kassel on saturday .
the group 's goals are to bring together people with similar abusive pasts in children 's homes and set up a databank of their experiences .
members also want to bring the perpetrators , or at least the organizations where they were active , to account .
" we demand a public apology for the harm that was done to us in these institutions , " jean-pierre de picco , chairman of the victims ' association , told reporters .
tales of horror according to him , there were around 3,600 children 's homes in germany in the 1950s and 60s , and while abuse did not take place in all of them , the horrific stories of mistreatment are not isolated cases .
of the cases of abuse reported thus far , 90 percent happened in catholic children 's homes .
" we were beaten and whipped bloody by the nuns , even for the smallest of infractions , " picco said .
now an artist and historian for the city of hamlin , picco , 46 , lived at the " holy hedwig sisters " catholic boarding school from 1963 to 1972 , which has since been closed .
he describes nine years of fear due to continual physical and psychological abuse , including beatings with thorny branches , immersions in hot water until his skin was red and burnt , and sexual abuse .
fridays were especially bad for the young picco , since fish , which he hated , was served in the cafeteria on that day .
usually he threw up on the tray and was forced to eat it all again .
for decades afterward he was n't able to talk about his experiences and it was only in the mid-1990s that the repressed memories exploded on the surface .
" i cried rivers , " he said .
after the newsmagazine der spiegel reported his story some 500 people contacted the publication with similar stories .
it was then that he decided to create a formal organization to represent children abused in homes from 1945 to1985 .
at the founding in january of this year in the largely catholic city of paderborn , it counted 70 members .
" what happened to us , must have happened to hundreds of thousands of others , " he told reporters , the results often being addictive behavior , panic attacks , recurrent nightmares and depression as adults .
taliban regime gisela n. was one of the thousands .
at the age of 15 she was placed in a home in the city of dortmund where she was kept virtual prisoner , unable to leave the house , for two years and spent much of the time in solitary confinement , once because she sang an elvis song .
the 58-year-old compares the administration at the children 's home as a catholic " taliban regime " and like most of the abuse kids , left the church long ago .
she kept her story to herself for years and only came forward after seeing the 2003 film " the magdalene sisters , " based on the real experiences of irish girls sent to work in abusive conditions in laundries run by a religious order .
" it was a terror regime , a combination of nazi ideology and fanatical catholicism , " she said .
while there were a few nuns , priests and teachers who were kind , they were quickly driven off by the abusers .
picco says a public apology from the catholic church would help victims work through the mistreatment .
his association would also like a one-time compensation payment .
so far , however , there catholic church has kept silent about the accusations .
for marion zagermann , that silence has to be broken and lessons have to be learned .
her coming forward is part of the first step .

nuns , priests and educators in german children 's homes systematically abused the young people there , according to a recently-formed lobbying group .
it 's now demanding a public apology . when marion zagermann looks back on her childhood , she does n't remember carefree days playing with friends and being surrounded by loving adults .
instead , often through tears , she remembers being chained to a bed at night , to a chair during the day , and being held under cold water until she lost consciousness .
in short , she remembers abuse , even torture - all at the hands of people of the church .
now marion and others are coming forth with their stories of abuse in church-sponsored children 's homes across germany .
their association , which hopes to be a forum and interest group for people who spent parts of their childhood in institutions , is meeting in the city of kassel on saturday .
the group 's goals are to bring together people with similar abusive pasts in children 's homes and set up a databank of their experiences .
members also want to bring the perpetrators , or at least the organizations where they were active , to account .
" we demand a public apology for the harm that was done to us in these institutions , " jean-pierre de picco , chairman of the victims ' association , told reporters .
tales of horror according to him , there were around 3,600 children 's homes in germany in the 1950s and 60s , and while abuse did not take place in all of them , the horrific stories of mistreatment are not isolated cases .
of the cases of abuse reported thus far , 90 percent happened in catholic children 's homes .
" we were beaten and whipped bloody by the nuns , even for the smallest of infractions , " picco said .
now an artist and historian for the city of hamlin , picco , 46 , lived at the " holy hedwig sisters " catholic boarding school from 1963 to 1972 , which has since been closed .
he describes nine years of fear due to continual physical and psychological abuse , including beatings with thorny branches , immersions in hot water until his skin was red and burnt , and sexual abuse .
fridays were especially bad for the young picco , since fish , which he hated , was served in the cafeteria on that day .
usually he threw up on the tray and was forced to eat it all again .
for decades afterward he was n't able to talk about his experiences and it was only in the mid-1990s that the repressed memories exploded on the surface .
" i cried rivers , " he said .
after the newsmagazine der spiegel reported his story some 500 people contacted the publication with similar stories .
it was then that he decided to create a formal organization to represent children abused in homes from 1945 to1985 .
at the founding in january of this year in the largely catholic city of paderborn , it counted 70 members .
" what happened to us , must have happened to hundreds of thousands of others , " he told reporters , the results often being addictive behavior , panic attacks , recurrent nightmares and depression as adults .
taliban regime gisela n. was one of the thousands .
at the age of 15 she was placed in a home in the city of dortmund where she was kept virtual prisoner , unable to leave the house , for two years and spent much of the time in solitary confinement , once because she sang an elvis song .
the 58-year-old compares the administration at the children 's home as a catholic " taliban regime " and like most of the abuse kids , left the church long ago .
she kept her story to herself for years and only came forward after seeing the 2003 film " the magdalene sisters , " based on the real experiences of irish girls sent to work in abusive conditions in laundries run by a religious order .
" it was a terror regime , a combination of nazi ideology and fanatical catholicism , " she said .
while there were a few nuns , priests and teachers who were kind , they were quickly driven off by the abusers .
picco says a public apology from the catholic church would help victims work through the mistreatment .
his association would also like a one-time compensation payment .
so far , however , there catholic church has kept silent about the accusations .

tony blair intends to fight the next election as labour leader , he told a tabloid newspaper on saturday .
he told the mirror he believed in what he was doing and enjoyed the job .
but he said a guarantee he would finish a third term would sound " arrogant " and lead to headlines saying he would go " on and on " like margaret thatcher .
there has been speculation recently about the prime minister 's future but senior ministers have repeatedly insisted he has no plans to step down .
mr blair told the newspaper he was " up for " fighting the next general election as leader .
" i do n't feel that i am just going to go on and on for the sake of it .
" and whether i am prime minister after the next election is ultimately a decision for the british people , " he told the mirror .
brown support last week deputy prime minister john prescott suggested tony blair could " follow the example of harold wilson " who stood down mid-term .
he said mr blair would have labour 's full support if he led the party into the next general election , but hinted that the prime minister could be derailed by " events " .
the remark followed his earlier comments , which had suggested cabinet ministers were jockeying for position in case mr blair stood down .
a yougov poll of 2,131 people published by the daily telegraph on saturday suggested more voters believed gordon brown would make a better prime minister .
a total of 29 % plumped for the chancellor as the ideal candidate , while 25 % opted for mr blair .
is gordon brown more popular with voters ?
the poll also said 59 % believed mr blair should resign immediately or before the next general election - with 41 % wanting him to step down immediately and 18 % preferring him to leave sometime ahead of the election .
only 18 % wanted him to stay for many more years .
during this weekend 's interview mr blair said five-year plans about the party 's future strategy would be unveiled before the summer holidays .
" it will set out the next stage of public service reforms , how we take our economy to a higher level and how we create a civic society with self respect and respect for others , " he told the mirror .
when asked if his christian faith kept him going in his darkest moments he said : " yes , absolutely . "

tony blair intends to fight the next election as labour leader , he told a tabloid newspaper on saturday .
he told the mirror he believed in what he was doing and enjoyed the job .

tony blair intends to fight the next election as labour leader , he told a tabloid newspaper on saturday .
he told the mirror he believed in what he was doing and enjoyed the job .
but he said a guarantee he would finish a third term would sound " arrogant " and lead to headlines saying he would go " on and on " like margaret thatcher .
there has been speculation recently about the prime minister 's future but senior ministers have repeatedly insisted he has no plans to step down .
mr blair told the newspaper he was " up for " fighting the next general election as leader .
" i do n't feel that i am just going to go on and on for the sake of it .
" and whether i am prime minister after the next election is ultimately a decision for the british people , " he told the mirror .
brown support last week deputy prime minister john prescott suggested tony blair could " follow the example of harold wilson " who stood down mid-term .
he said mr blair would have labour 's full support if he led the party into the next general election , but hinted that the prime minister could be derailed by " events " .
the remark followed his earlier comments , which had suggested cabinet ministers were jockeying for position in case mr blair stood down .
a yougov poll of 2,131 people published by the daily telegraph on saturday suggested more voters believed gordon brown would make a better prime minister .
a total of 29 % plumped for the chancellor as the ideal candidate , while 25 % opted for mr blair .
is gordon brown more popular with voters ?
the poll also said 59 % believed mr blair should resign immediately or before the next general election - with 41 % wanting him to step down immediately and 18 % preferring him to leave sometime ahead of the election .
only 18 % wanted him to stay for many more years .
during this weekend 's interview mr blair said five-year plans about the party 's future strategy would be unveiled before the summer holidays .
" it will set out the next stage of public service reforms , how we take our economy to a higher level and how we create a civic society with self respect and respect for others , " he told the mirror .
when asked if his christian faith kept him going in his darkest moments he said : " yes , absolutely . "
on crime and anti-social behaviour he said the government wanted " decent ordinary law-abiding people to be in control of the streets , not the violent minority " .
his reaction to the purple powder attack in the house of commons recently was one of frustration he said , because he was " just about to land one on michael howard " and wanted to get on with the debate .

it is also one that cuts through a lot of the rubbish involved in making bonds in the real world .
we proved a real mixed bunch in terms of backgrounds , class , jobs , income brackets and so on .
although the mean age was around 30 , some were married , some had kids , a couple were ex-forces and several worked in computers .
sadly , none of our more international comrades could make it , but it was still telling .
the point is that gaming is still saddled by stereotypes .
online gaming is even more so , possibly because it became so consolidated through d & d style role-playing games , a subculture with even longer " geek-hood " associations .
but the members of the halibuts i met were basically a normal bunch of blokes .
now , if we could only get some of the fairer sex interested , it might help moderate the stereotyping even more .
although actually , given the nature of our in-game chat , perhaps not .
